By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s heavy stealth fighter-interceptor, the J-20 , has rapidly matured over the last half decade , with some reports stating the jet may have reached limited initial operating capability. That term can mean very different things in the Russian and Chinese aerospace and defense communities than it does to their western counterparts. Fielding hardware early on, with minimal capabilities, and developing it in a spiral manner over time by using the operational community as a kind of testing ground, invites higher risk and less than fully vetted capabilities to front-line units. Yet it also offers more immediate results and can be strategically important not just in terms of fielded new capabilities, but also in terms of “optics” both for internal and external consumption. Regardless of its operational state, the J-20 concept represents a potential threat as it was designed—along with other emerging Chinese aerial weaponry —to exploit weaknesses in American forces’ order of battle and combat doctrine. But the jet also represents a massive leap in Chinese aerospace and manufacturing capabilities and still holds many mysteries—maybe the most pressing among them is the maturity and intended abilities of its integrated avionics suite. Now an image has emerged that shows how the Chinese are grabbing yet another play right out of modern western fighter development—using a surrogate airliner to act as a flying integrated avionics testbed for their new 5th generation fighter. China’s J-20 avionics testbed seen at the Yanglian flight test center : … The highly modified Russian-built Tupolev Tu-204C looks like a clone to Boeing’s 757-200 prototype turned F-22 integrated avionics testbed—better known as “The Catfish” due to its unique and highly modified nose profile. The Catfish has worked for nearly two decades to test and perfect the F-22’s ever evolving avionics suite . Boeing’s Catfish sits on the ramp at its home at Boeing Field in Washington (Clemens Vasters/Wikicommons): … Built primarily around the Raptor’s APG-77 AESA radar and its equally important ALR-94 electronic support measures suite—but also including its low-probability of intercept data-link, AAR-56 IR/UV missile approach warning system and secure communications systems, among other tactical subsystems—the F-22’s sensor suite and its powerful mission computers were unprecedented in their complexity and capability for their time. Today the system is rivaled only by the one on the F-35. Much of the development that allowed for all these systems to work together reliably in an automated fashion was done aboard the Catfish. The aircraft features not only the iconic nose profile of the Raptor, but also the aircraft’s swept wing leading-edges, in which conformal antennas are buried. Inside the aircraft, computer workstations, server racks and even a recreation of the F-22 cockpit allow for testing in real flying conditions, including recreating tactical and environmental scenarios F-22 pilots may see in real life. Catfish was by no means the first avionics testbed. Quite the contrary actually. Surrogate aircraft were used to test avionics, and especially radars, all the way back to World War II. But where the F-22 differed was in its level of “sensor fusion,” that was brought about by deep integration of its various sensors, computers, and communications systems. Before it, fighter avionics were largely “federated,” or systems of their own within a large package of individual systems. As such, Catfish represented a new level of surrogate testbed that was necessary to tackle the huge job of making all the F-22’s systems work together, as if by magic, in an actual airborne environment. Here is Boeing’s press release from Catfish’s first flight in 1999: “SEATTLE, March 11—Boeing today began testing the F-22 Raptor’s integrated avionics on board its 757 Flying Test Bed.  The 757 took off from Boeing Field and tested navigation and sensor emitter management functions. Testing the Raptor’s advanced avionics aboard the company’s test bed will help reduce risk, as well as cut back on future F-22 flight test hours by enabling extensive in-flight testing, evaluation and troubleshooting before full avionics suites are installed on F-22 fighters. The first avionics package, Block 1, which includes the radar and mission software, will be tested on the 757 between March and August 1999. Raptor 4004 will be the first aircraft to fly with its integrated avionics installed, and is scheduled to make its first flight in 2000. Bob Barnes, Boeing vice president and F-22 program manager, said the initial test flight went extremely well, adding that testing aboard the 757 will allow early delivery of a better developed avionics package. “Avionics testing on other fighters has taken 4,000 to 6,000 hours,” Barnes added.  “We should be able to cut the hours on the F-22 by about 50 percent using our test bed.” The test avionics are operated from a simulated F-22 cockpit, which has been installed in the test-bed cabin.  The cockpit has primary and secondary F-22 displays, as well as a throttle and stick.  There is room on the aircraft for up to 30 software engineers and technicians to evaluate the avionics during testing. Additional modifications to the test bed include installation of an F-22 forward fuselage section to the nose of the plane, and installation of a sensor wing on the plane’s crown.  The sensor wing was designed and built to simulate the same wing sweep and orientation as an F-22 wing.  Additionally, communication, navigation and identification sensors will be mounted directly on the wing to simulate sensor positioning on the F-22’s wings. Boeing is teamed with Lockheed Martin, Pratt & Whitney and the U.S. Air Force to develop the F-22.  Boeing supplies the F-22’s aft fuselage, wings, radar, 70 percent of the mission software, avionics integration and testing, training and life support systems.” Since the F-22 became operational over a decade ago, Catfish has continued to play a vital role in supporting upgrades to the jet’s hardware and software, as well as in tactics development to some degree. From time-to-time it will migrate down to Edwards AFB or Nellis AFB for development work, and will even fly alongside other integrated testbeds, like the F-35’s Cooperative Avionics Testbed —nicknamed the CATbird—or those used by Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and other for cross-platform integration. Knowing all this, it’s easy to see why Chinese aerospace firms involved with the J-20’s development have chosen to take an almost identical, and highly proven, route for developing the J-20’s integrated avionics suite. I mean, it’s not like China has any problems with lifting proven designs and aerospace concepts from the US . And just because this testbed aircraft is just now emerging, it doesn’t mean it hasn’t existed for some time. In fact, most indications point toward the aircraft being fitted with J-20’s radar for at least a year—if not two. Nor does it give any indication as to how far along the J-20’s avionics suite, and particularly its radar, is developmentally.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 26, 2020",Exclusive: Uniquely Configured RQ-170 Stealth Spy Drone Appears At Vandenberg AFB,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The RQ-170 Sentinel remains cloaked in mystery a decade after it was first photographed and nearly six years after the Skunk Works-built flying-wing drone spied on Osama Bin Laden’s compound and later fell into the hands of the Iranian government . In recent years, Sentinels have been photographed and filmed just a handful of times flying in and out of Creech AFB, the USAF’s master unmanned aircraft base located north of Las Vegas. Although the RQ-170 may still have some presence at shadowy Tonopah Test Range Airport , where the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron was stood up to fly the type in secrecy in 2005, the unit is thought to have moved their operations from the remote base to Creech AFB in recent years. The War Zone’s own Joseph Trevithick learned, via an official USAF document, that the 30th RS had also activated a detachment in 2011 at Vandenberg AFB, of all places. Now, years after this action had supposedly occurred, the first photographic proof of the RQ-170’s presence at Vandenberg is shown below. Matt C. Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt C. Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt C. Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt C. Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt C. Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt C. Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The images were snapped by photographer Matt Hartman while visiting the base to capture the launch of a classified reconnaissance satellite (NROL-79) . His images show an RQ-170 like we have never seen before, sporting a large air data boom , a strange hodgepodge of black and white paneling, as well as some other features not seen in prior RQ-170 photos. These include an air inlet on the right-rear underside of the aircraft and what appear to be doors, either for access or otherwise, outboard of the aircraft’s shrouded sensor turret and what is likely a synthetic aperture radar housing that protrudes down the drone’s centerline. Some highly visible air-data sensors are also seen embedded into the drone’s leading edge, and what appear to be some sort of speed-brake like units towards the outer edges of the Sentinel’s wings. These exist on top of the aircraft as well as the Iranians have shown video of their officers messing with them. As for if we are seeing the oldest, or newest evolution of the RQ-170 design, that is not clear, but we can say with certainty that this particular RQ-170 is used for testing purposes. Vandenberg AFB, nestled along the southern California coastline between Santa Maria and Santa Barbara, is the USAF’s premier ballistic missile test and rocket launch facility, and is not widely known for supporting fixed-wing aircraft programs. The base had been the home of the X-37B miniature spaceplane until recently , when the program moved to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Before that the RQ-4 Global Hawk used the base for testing, with the runway’s somewhat even slope and close proximity to the sea acting as a proving ground before the high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft deployed to Guam for the first time. But beyond this, Vandenberg AFB has no aircraft permanently assigned to it. … These is just one large hangar and some smaller support buildings near the base’s massive runway. To the southwest, the old Orbiter Processing Facility that was built to support the failed military Space Shuttle program and its co-located SLC-6 launch complex is connected to the runway via a long taxiway. It is unknown what this facility is used for today, but it appears to feature high security and is still active, judging from satellite photos. The old orbiter processing facility (also known as the orbiter maintenance and checkout facility) has remained busy long after the Space Shuttle’s fate at Vandenberg was sealed. , Google Earth Vandenberg’s 15,000-foot runway is mainly used to support aerial transports moving missile and rocket material to and from the installation, and to provide a practice runway for military aviation units based all around California. A 2011 report noted that the airfield had just 4,000 operations a year, a tiny number compared to other USAF installations. But those operations are condensed largely within a nine hour timeframe each day, as the field is open from 8AM to 5PM and closed on weekends. It is possible that the base opens up for limited operations at other hours to support testing and classified programs, and there have been times when the base’s large runway is restricted even for transient military traffic. So why base a detachment of RQ-170s at Vandenberg? First off, the base is relatively secluded, has high security, and as mentioned earlier, the RQ-170 would not have to compete with many other aircraft based there for runway time. Additionally, it gives incredible access to the Navy’s massive Pacific Range complex, including certain Channel Islands that are used exclusively for military training and weapons development. … For instance, one of the RQ-170’s missions is to provide overwatch, including streaming video to commanders (and possibly communications relay), for special operations units operating in contested territory. Members of SEAL Team Six supposedly had an RQ-170 overhead during Operation Neptune Spear—the mission to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden. One of the SEALs’ most elaborate and remote training grounds—one that also blends water and land operations—is located on the northern tip of San Clemente Island ( you can read all about it here ). San Nicolas Island hosts live weapons tests and an active bombing range. The island is also equipped with multiple threat emitters that mimic enemy radar and electronic warfare systems. The RQ-170 is known to have worked with the B-2 and other assets when it comes to targeting and bomb damage assessment. RQ-170s could use these facilities to develop and hone their tactics and interoperational capabilities. But above all else, these vast military operating areas located right off Vandenberg’s coast provide a safe and secure place for experimenting with new technologies without the risk of an aircraft crashing to the ground in a populated area, something that the RQ-170 may have already done in the past. Just like the Global Hawk, the RQ-170 is known to have been deployed to Guam , and other potential operating locations could take the aircraft over water. Testing and training to operate the Sentinel in a similar maritime environment that it could face operationally isn’t just prudent, but it may also be necessary. In fact, the RQ-170, with its electo-optical sensors and what most experts think is a highly sensitive AESA-based synthetic aperture radar ( like the ASQ-236 ), could make the aircraft a potent targeting and surveillance node in an anti-access maritime and/or littoral combat environment. Proving that the RQ-170’s talents can be applied to the surface warfare realm would require that the aircraft have access to such an environment, and the middle of the Nevada desert surely does not offer that kind of an opportunity, but Vandenberg AFB certainly does. Don’t be surprised if more unmanned aircraft testing, development and training makes its way to Vandenberg in the future, especially if the USAF ever brings the swarming UCAV revolution into the light . There is plenty of room along the runway at Vandenberg to build new ramp space, hangars and other facilities if they are required. With the RQ-4, X-37B and now the RQ-170 having used the site for various parts of their development, it only makes sense that more of the USAF’s most sophisticated drones, both known and unknown, will call the site home at some point in time. In fact, the Vandenberg is currently in the running to house a wing of MQ-9 Reaper drones, which would see aircraft permanently assigned to installation. This would kickstart facilities expansion uniquely tailored to unmanned aircraft mission, and would give the base a whole new and exciting mission as passes its 60th year of operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2021",Navy Littoral Combat Ship Still Missing Cruise Missile Nine Months After Launching One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Oct. 1, 2019, the Independence class Littoral Combat Ship USS Gabrielle Giffords fired a stealthy RGM-184A Naval Strike Missile at the ex-USS Ford , a decommissioned Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate, as part of sinking exercise, or SINKEX, off Guam. Since then, the ship has continued to ply the waters of the Western Pacific, with the U.S. Navy recently highlighting her presence in the hotly contested South China Sea as an important signal to China, as well as a demonstration of America’s commitment to its allies and partners in the region. However, official pictures have also consistently shown that, after more than nine months, the forward-deployed Gabrielle Giffords has still not loaded a fresh launch canister in place of the one it expended last year and has been operating with seven RGM-184As ready to fire, rather than a full load of eight. The Navy has touted the complete weapon system, also known as the Mk 87 Mod 0 , as a critical upgrade offering a major boost in firepower for both Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) subclasses. As such, having a visibly empty missile canister in place for months on end seems, at best, puzzling and, at worst, it raises questions about the state of the program, as well as the Navy’s ability to support deployed examples of the system and its commitment to keeping these ships on the front line fully armed with the few weapons they can carry. To date, Gabrielle Giffords it the only LCS to have deployed operationally armed with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM). The U.S. Seventh Fleet, to which Gabrielle Giffords is presently assigned, declined to confirm or deny that the ship has not gotten a reload for its NSM launchers since the October 2019 SINKEX. “USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS 10) is conducting routine operations in the South China Sea. Through continued presence in the region, the U.S. Navy supports transparency, the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, the principles that underpin security and prosperity for the Indo-Pacific, so that all nations in the region may benefit,” Navy Lieutenant Joe Keiley, spokesperson for the U.S. Seventh Fleet, told The War Zone in a statement in response to questions about Gifford’s present armament. “U.S. Navy forces will continue to fly, sail and operate in the international waters of the South China Sea at our discretion and in accordance with maritime norms and international law, demonstrating the wide range of naval capability we have available in the Indo-Pacific.” However, all the official pictures that The War Zone has examined of the ship in the interceding nine months clearly show an open hole in the rear of the top right canister on the NSM launcher closest to the ship’s superstructure. Pictures and video from the SINKEX showed that this was the missile that Gabrielle Giffords fired at that time. The open hole is a clear indication that the launch canister is empty. NSMs come from the manufacturer, Norway’s Kongsberg, pre-loaded in these canisters, also known as Launch Missile Modules (LMM). The rear hole is sealed with a plug that fits over the rocket motor that propels the missile in the initial launch phase of flight. After the rocket burns out, this booster falls away and a small turbojet engine then kicks in. You can read more about the NSM and its capabilities in detail in this past War Zone piece . A cutaway diagram showing the interior of a loaded Launch Missile Module., Kongsberg Even if the rear plug in the canister was missing for some reason, which would also expose the missile inside to potential environmental damage, especially from corrosive saltwater, the rocket motor would still be visible. The missile cannot function properly without this boost motor in place. A closeup of the Naval Strike Missile launchers on Gabrielle Giffords as she sailed in the South China Sea on July 1. The empty hole in the rear of the top right launch canister on the launcher closest to the ship’s superstructure is clearly visible., USN It’s fair to say that other Navy surface warships may conduct routine operations with at least some number of their Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells empty. However, it’s not immediately apparent from the outside that there isn’t a missile in a VLS cell, adding uncertainty and ambiguity into any potential adversary’s planning process and risk calculuses. That the Navy has so visibly gone nine months without getting the Gabrielle Giffords a new missile would seem to be sending a message about the ship’s capabilities that doesn’t quite line up with the service’s public statements. “That’s a game-changer for LCS,” Navy Rear Admiral Casey Moton, the Program Executive Officer for Unmanned and Small Combatants, said in an interview with USNI News in September 2019 regarding the addition of Naval Strike Missiles. “Now, every LCS that’s out there can’t be ignored.” It also raises questions about the present state of the Navy’s supporting infrastructure and logistics chains for the NSMs, as well as just how many missiles the service has inventory right now, which could be a relatively small number still. Gabrielle Giffords is forward-deployed in Singapore, where she could readily reload if stocks of RGM-184As were available. The pictures of Gabrielle Giffords launching the one missile during SINKEX last year show that the LMMs loaded on the ship have markings in Norwegian and English, indicating they came from Kongsberg and underscoring how its American partner in its deal with the Navy, Raytheon, still has yet to establish robust U.S.-based production and supply chains. Norwegian and English markings on one of the NSM missile canisters on the USS Gabrielle Giffords ., USN It’s not as if the Navy has kept Gabrielle Giffords away from potential major hotspots, either. The service has been particularly eager to talk up the ship’s presence, as well as that of the Independence class USS Montgomery , in and around the South China Sea on multiple occasions this year. This included sending it near the site of a dispute between China and Malaysia over the latter country’s exploration of potential undersea oil and natural gas deposits. “The versatility and flexibility of Independence-variant littoral combat ships rotationally deployed to Southeast Asia is a game changer,” U.S. Rear Admiral Fred Kacher, head of the U.S. Seventh Fleet’s Expeditionary Strike Group 7, said in a statement on May 12. “ Gabrielle Giffords ‘ operations near [the Malaysian government-chartered drillship] West Capella demonstrate the depth of capability the U.S. Navy has available in the region.” The USS Gabrielle Giffords , in the foreground, sails past the drillship West Capella in the South China Sea on May 12., USN With competition in the Pacific region , particularly with China , heating up , the Navy has been keen to point to the LCS deployments in the region as examples of how the program as a whole has finally turned a corner after years of disappointment and questions about the ships’ operational utility . The planned addition of the NSMs to ships across both classes has been an important component of broader efforts to expand the capabilities of the LCSs in any kind of significant confrontation. The limitations of both LCS subclasses already led the Navy to initiate plans in 2017 to buy much more capable frigates. In April, the service chose Wisconsin-based Marinette Marine to build at least the initial batch of these ships, presently referred to as FFG(X)s, based on a design from its Italian parent company, Fincantieri. “We’re at the beginning of doing these recurring deployments, and I expect LCS deployments are just going to continue to increase in numbers,” Navy Captain Jack Fay, the commander of Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One, headquartered in San Diego, told USNI News for a piece it published on July 1. “Multiple LCS in theater, especially adding Naval Strike Missile like Gabrielle Giffords has, is a huge huge move forward for the ship class. When I think about what adversaries have to think about – now it’s not just one particular focus area; now they’ve got to look across the entire theater – and that challenges a staff, that challenges their capabilities. I think it was a huge win, and we’re just seeing the start of that, what multiple LCS in theater can do.” USS Gabrielle Giffords , in the background, identifiable by her NSM launchers, sails together with the USS Montgomery , in the foreground, in the South China Sea in January., USN At the same time, those same adversaries can see that Gabrielle Giffords has been sailing for months now with one NSM short of a full load. For all the progress the Navy has made to try to squeeze as much capability as possible out of these ships, there still appears to be work left to do.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 19, 2020",Major Airfield Expansion On Wake Island Seen By Satellite As U.S. Preps For Pacific Fight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s remote outpost deep in the Pacific, situated roughly between Japan and Hawaii, Wake Island serves as a reserve airfield should American airpower have to fallback from the far reaches of Western Pacific during a peer state conflict. It also provides a reverse utility, working as a staging ground in a crisis for air combat missions heading west, into Russia’s and especially China’s highly-defended anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) bubbles that emanate far from their shores. With the ongoing ‘pivot towards the Pacific’ and with adversary A2/AD capabilities creeping farther east, Wake Island is more important than it has been in decades, possibly since World War II. The restricted access island—which is one of the most remote on Earth—is an unincorporated territory of the United States that is also claimed by the Marshall Islands. The vast majority of the atoll is taken up by a 9,800-foot runway—long enough to accommodate anything in the Pentagon’s inventory—and the airfield infrastructure and staging areas that surround it. Although it supports some missile defense tests with launchpads scattered around its southernmost tip, it is best known for being an emergency divert point for aircraft crossing the Pacific and as a stopping point for U.S. military aircraft moving from the U.S. to Asia.

U.S. military aircraft often route over or stop at the island during transits across the Pacific. , USAF New satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs dated June 25th, 2020 shows that substantial improvements to the base have occurred recently. Based on archival satellite imagery, the major expansions to the airfield began early this year and are still underway today.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The same area from the 10/8/2016 image. , Google Earth The Pentagon has been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the secretive strategic stronghold in recent years. These expenditures have included the apron and runway improvements, as well as a large solar farm that can be seen in the western area of the island in the recent satellite photo. It’s more likely than not that even more investment into the island’s infrastructure will be made in the near term as rising tensions with China, North Korea, and Russia have reinvigorated the strategic importance of the remote base. Beyond its clear logistical utility, acting as a major hub where there isn’t another for thousands of miles, it sits outside the range of China’s and North Korea’s medium-range ballistic missiles, and largely at the end, if not entirely out of range, of their intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). Guam, which is situated about 1,500 miles further west, is well within the range of these weapons. During the opening stages of a major conflict with China, America’s bases that are within range of these missiles would be overwhelmed by them, at the very least knocking bases like Kadena in Okinawa out of commission for a substantial period of time. These strikes would likely be layered with cruise missile attacks, making them harder to defend against and upping the odds that Beijing could neuter American airpower throughout the region in the opening exchanges of a conflict. Guam, which hosts a key U.S. naval base and the sprawling Andersen Air Force Base , would be targeted as well, although at greater range. This island has a THAAD missile battery that has been in place for years to fend-off ballistic missile attacks specifically, but the sheer numbers a foe like China can fire at the island makes defending it a highly dubious exercise. Rebuffing more limited attacks from a foe like North Korea is far more relevant to the island’s defenses. Other airfields in the Marianas Island Chain, or within the MRBM and IRBM range in general, are even more vulnerable. USS Theodore Roosevelt operating off Wake Island., USN So, you can see how Wake Island quickly becomes a key fallback position during what could be an incredibly violent and fast-moving conflict, at least at first. The island itself can be quickly fortified with its own air defenses and those based on forward-deployed U.S. Navy surface combatants sailing between the Chinese mainland and the island. Wake Island is also thought to be within the outer engagement umbrella of the ground-based midcourse defense (GMD) interceptors based in Fort Greely, Alaska, which are designed to counter low-volumes of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threats. The idea of making Wake Island becoming a hub of airpower activity that looks to overcome the ‘tyranny of distance’ that is so closely associated with conflict in the Pacific Theater is already being trialed. Just last year, B-2 Spirits used the airfield for the first time as a forward re-arming and refueling point (FARP), with their sorties beginning at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, not Guam. This would be the likely arrangement if U.S. installations to the east were threatened or destroyed during a conflict. B-2 Spirit operating from Wake Island. , USAF Heavy bomber sorties against an enemy such as China will be absolutely essential to slowly degrade its A2/AD bubble so that less capable and shorter-ranged assets can push close enough towards that country’s shores to be useful at all. This will be a very high-stakes and laborious process during the early days and possibly weeks of a conflict. Bombers will also be critical when it comes to taking on China’s growing fleet of advanced warships that will stand between U.S. territory and targets in and around the Chinese mainland. As a conflict carries on, stealthy B-2 bombers and penetrating tactical airpower will be essential to making major progress in an air war against China via their ability to make the necessary volume of direct attacks required to prosecute such a conflict. There is an absurd notion that standoff weapons alone can win a war against a peer state, even a relatively limited one. This is impossible as we are talking about target sets that number in the tens of thousands or more. There will not be enough highly expensive standoff weapons, such as cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons , to come even near to satisfying these requirements. As such, those standoff weapons will be used to break down the enemy’s defenses and to strike strategic sensors and nerve centers, in order to blind the enemy and negate force-multiplying capabilities and some key kinetic ones, as well. In effect, this will open the door to broader follow-on strikes made by platforms that can get close enough to their targets to be employed en masse. A Navy MH-60S flies along Wake Island’s narrow coast, with one of its historical gun emplacements visible. , USN Of course, even with Wake Island, any operation like this will rely very heavily on America’s rapidly aging aerial refueling tanker fleet . This includes refueling the bombers, yes, but especially when it comes to short-ranged tactical airpower once they can get close enough to their targets to be relevant in a peer state conflict in the Pacific at all. Remember, an F-35A has a combat radius of around 650 miles, and this is generous compared to most fighter designs. This means a tanker will be at risk within 650 miles of the aircraft’s target area when making a direct attack. It is roughly 3,000 miles from Wake Island to Chinese shores. So, you can see just how heavily the tanker fleet will be taxed to sustain even a limited tanker bridge for tactical aircraft to be useful along the leading edge of such a conflict. We have talked about these issues in depth many times before, which you can read about here , here , and here . F-22s over Wake Island—America’s massive investment in short-range tactical airpower is ill-suited for the Pacific Theater, making Wake Island an absolutely key component of the ‘tanker bridge’ that will be required to shuttle fighters like the F-22 over thousands of miles to the front lines of a peer state conflict in Asia. , USAF This brings us back to just how important Wake Island is. America’s tankers and fighters would be pushed back to Hawaii, positioned 2,300 miles from Wake Island, or even Alaska, if it were not for the island outpost, at least initially, during a major conflict. Midway, which sits 1,200 miles to the east of Wake Island, is another option, but it has limited capacity and a shorter runway. So, the idea is that Wake Island would be packed with aircraft moving to and fro across the Pacific during such a major crisis, at least until the enemy’s A2/AD bubble can be degraded significantly and austere airfields farther east can be developed and activated . Even then, those forward bases would have limited capacity for prolonged operations and would be more vulnerable to enemy attacks. With all this in mind, the upgrades to Wake Island are absolutely necessary and couldn’t have come soon enough.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 12, 2020",The U.S. Air Force’s Last Tail Gunner Has Retired,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Whenever someone retires, it marks the end of an era in their personal life. When U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Rob Wellbaum leaves the service he’ll end an entire era of aerial combat as America’s last bomber tail gunner. On May 12, 2017, Wellbaum retired after three decades in the Air Force. When he first joined up in 1987, the non-commissioned officer had signed up for Specialty Code 111X0—Aerial Defense Gunner. “I went into the recruiter’s office and asked them what jobs they had for enlisted [personnel] to fly,” Wellbaum recalled in an interview . “My recruiter listed off loadmaster, boom operator, and B-52 aerial defensive gunner. The gunner job sounded like the coolest job out of the three so that is what I applied for.” For the next five years, he served in that role on a B-52 Stratofortress bomber. This aircraft – more lovingly referred to as the Big Ugly Fat Fellow , or BUFF – was the last in service to even have a tail gun. Chief Master Sergeant Rob Wellbaum and his family pose in front of one of the 15th Wing’s KC-10A Extender tankers., USAF When the first B-52 prototype rolled out of Boeing’s plant in Seattle in 1952, aircraft defensive armament was already in a period of flux. For more than a decade at that point, American heavy bombers, as well many smaller attack and maritime patrol aircraft had featured various guns for self-protection against enemy fighters and interceptors. The American workhorses of World War II, Boeing’s B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated’s B-24 Liberator both bristled with machine guns by the end of their service life. Both companies specifically designed the armament configurations to provide maximum coverage. So, in addition to weapons in the nose and sticking out the sides and the top and bottom of the fuselage, another gunner’s position was installed in the tail. From there a member of the crew could cover the vulnerable rear flank. The U.S. Army Air Force’s entire bomber doctrine revolved around this defensive armament. The lumbering aircraft would fly together in tight “boxes” in order to provide mutually supporting firepower. U.S. military proponents of heavy bombing felt this method of operation, combined with superior aircraft designs, might even obviate the need for escorting fighter planes altogether. The tail gun position on a World War II-era B-29 bomber., USAF The World War II experience in both the Europe and Pacific theaters showed this notion was a pipedream. Over Germany especially, American crews suffered horrific losses until sufficient escorting aircraft became available. After one raid on Nazi factories in Schweinfurt on Oct. 14, 1943, the Eight Air Force effectively lost more than 25 percent of its entire force. “With the Schweinfurt missions went the virtual end of the idea that the heavy bomber could ‘go it alone’,” according to one 1955 Air Force history . “The debate that had continued since the early 1930’s was now all but over.” Though this didn’t stop bombers from carrying weapons, it did begin to reduce crews’ reliance on their own guns for self-defense. Boeing’s B-29 Superfortress , which became iconic of the fight against the Japanese, still had multiple machine gun positions, including then state-of-the-art remote control dorsal and ventral turrets. Its particularly deadly tail gun position, often referred to as the plane’s “stinger,” packed a pair of .50 caliber M2 machine guns flanking a single 20mm M2 cannon. But with the Japanese Army and Navy air arms all but crushed, American crews began leaving some or all of those weapons back at base to reduce weight and increase flying time. Many immediate post-war bomber designs for the brand new, separate Air Force continued to come with full suites of defensive weapons. The B-50 , a suped-up B-29, had the same gun positions. The initial prototypes of Consolidated’s massive B-36 Peacemaker had numerous, retractable remotely-operated turrets with 20mm cannons, along with a tail gun. But technological advances were making much of this obsolete. Most importantly, surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles gave anti-aircraft teams on the ground and fighter pilots the ability to attack bombers from increasingly long distances, well outside of the range of a bomber’s guns. The tail gun position on a B-52D., USAF So, Boeing’s B-47 Stratojet and B-52 both dispensed with guns in the nose and fuselage completely. On both aircraft, tail guns were the only traditional defensive weapons. Nearly all of the B-52 variants featured a radar-assisted tail position with four M3 machine guns, each firing at a rate of 1,200 rounds per minute. The ultimate version, the B-52H, came with a single 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon, able to spit out up to 100 shells every second, in their place. In addition, the air search radar for the guns was powerful enough to act as a navigational aid and help keep bombers in formation, according to an article in Air Force Magazine . On top of that, it could help guide trailing bombers in a single cell toward their destination through bad weather. Still, physically separated from the rest of the crew at the other end of the plane’s enormous fuselage, it sounds like it would have been a lonely job. However, starting with the B-52G, the gunner joined the rest of the crew in the main cabin. The Air Force Magazine piece explains this was done in order to allow the crew to better coordinate during the flight and finally put the gunner in an ejection seat like everyone else, but “many gunners rued the loss of their wide-screen view.” A view from inside the tail gunner’s position on a B-52D., USAF Convair’s super-sonic B-58 Hustler had a similar arrangement with a single Vulcan cannon. At the same time, electronic countermeasures and chaff to jam and confuse enemy radars, along with bright-burning flares to distract heat-seeking missiles, increasingly became the primary means of defense. Fast-forward to the 1970s and the B-52 was Americans sole remaining heavy bomber. It was also the service’s last aircraft to even feature a tail gun, whatever its utility might have been at that point. Over Southeast Asia, B-52D bombers scored just two kills. Both instances occurred over North Vietnam in 1972. A B-52H bomber with its tail gun still installed., USAF “When the target got to 2,000 yards, I notified the crew that I was firing,” Airman 1st Class Albert Moore, who was responsible for the second kill, explained later . “I fired at the bandit until it ballooned to three times in intensity then suddenly disappeared from my radar scope at approximately 1,200 yards, 6:30 low. I expended 800 rounds in three bursts.” A gunner in another nearby B-52 confirmed Moore had blasted a North Vietnamese MiG-21. This was the last time a tail gunner from any air force scored a kill. “On the way home I wasn’t sure whether I should be happy or sad. You know, there was a guy in that MiG,” Moore wrote afterwards. “I’m sure he would have wanted to fly home too. But it was a case of him or my crew. I’m glad it turned out the way it did. Yes, I’d go again. Do I want another MiG? No, but given the same set of circumstances, yes, I’d go for another one.” The bomber Moore served on, nicknamed Diamond Lil and with the tail number 55-083, continued to serve until 1983. It now sits near the north entrance to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Moore died in 2009. After the Vietnam War ended, the Air Force continued to train enlisted personnel like Chief Master Sergeant Wellbaum to man the guns on the remaining B-52s. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the service finally decided it wasn’t worth the trouble. “My decision to eliminate the guns from the ‘BUFF’ was not an easy one,” General George L. Butler, then head of Strategic Air Command (SAC), wrote to the aerial gunner community in the fall of 1991. “It stemmed from the collapse of the soviet threat and the leading edge of very sharp budget cuts… Our Air Force is going to go through a lengthy period of turmoil as we adapt to a dramatically changing world.” The tails of two B-52H bombers in 2012, with the guns obviously missing., USAF By 1992, the Air Force had removed the guns from all its remaining B-52Gs and Hs. The service’s 111X0s, including Wellbaum, transitioned to other jobs. Neither the B-1 Bone nor the B-2 Spirit bombers ever had tail guns. “We knew something was in the works but we weren’t expecting to be cut,” Wellbaum said of the Air Force’s decision to remove the BUFF’s weapons for good and eliminate tail gunners. “However, the Air Force did take care of us and opened up a lot of AFSCs, one of which was flight engineer.” In total, Wellbaum accumulated more than 1,000 flight hours as a B-52 tail gunner. His last position was as the superintendent of the 15th Operations Group, the flying component of Pacific Air Force’s composite 15th Wing, which is situated at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. Update 5/16/2017: Since this story was published, multiple readers have reached out to inform us that there are in fact other former aerial defense gunners still on duty. Initially, it appeared as if the 15th Wing’s public affairs office had only been referring to individuals within the active component and not counted personnel who had gone on to serve in the Air National Guard. However, a representative of the Air Force Gunners Association explained that there were in fact at least two of its members still in active component units. It’s unclear how the error occurred, but it seems safe to say that the last B-52 gunner still has yet to leave the service.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 15, 2021",The Time A F-4G Wild Weasel’s Anti-Radiation Missile Blew Apart A B-52’s Tail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the early 1990s, one of America’s B-52Gs, serial number 58-0248, was emblazoned with nose art displaying a puzzling nickname: “In HARM’s Way.” The story of how the bomber got the moniker emanates from one of those bizarre sets of circumstances that only war seems to provide. The incident occurred during Operation Desert Storm , on a nighttime raid deep into Iraqi territory. A brace of B-52s were interdicting into Iraqi airspace at very low-level using their nap-of-the-earth flying capabilities. The tactic was used early in the war in an attempt to avoid deadly anti-aircraft artillery and surface to air missiles—both of which Saddam Hussein’s forces have plenty of—as well as roving fighters. High above the B-52Gs were a flight of F-4G Wild Weasels tasked with protecting the strike package from enemy air defenses via “suppressing” any enemy emitter that popped up near their path. This is done by firing AGM-88 Hight-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARMs) at those emitters. The HARM will then home in on the unique electronic emissions characteristics of the radar targeted, and blow it to pieces. F-4G Wild Weasel armed with a pair of AGM-88 HARMs., USAF The specific electromagnetic “fingerprint” of different emitters, such as different types of fire control radars, are classified based on an ever evolving electronic threat library maintained by the Pentagon and America’s intelligence services. Everything from espionage to spy plane missions are used to keep this library as up to date as possible, and aircraft with radar warning receivers, and especially those tasked with attacking enemy air defenses, have their onboard threat libraries updated regularly with this information. The B-52Gs, even with their low-altitude penetration capabilities and electronic warfare suites, were still vulnerable to multiple types of enemy attack—including by roving fighters that could fall in behind the big bombers and open up on them with cannons and short-range missiles. Just one lucky Iraqi MiG or Mirage, also flying low to counter coalition fighter and airborne early warning and control aircraft radars, that stumbled upon the bombers could be devastating. B-52G, Rob Schleiffert/wikicommons This was still the age when B-52s retained their tail guns , and those tail guns used radar for targeting enemy fighters at close-range. As the bombers roared across the dark desert floor, B-52 “gunners” intensely monitored their scopes for marauding enemy aircraft while electronic warfare officers watched for missile launches. At just a couple hundred feet off the ground, crews would have little time or space to react if their aircraft were pounced. Suddenly a F-4G crew picked up the radar of an anti-aircraft artillery battery in the B-52s’ path and fired off a HARM from on high. What happened next is the most opaque part of the story, but what seems to have occurred is that the F-4G fired the missile “in the blind,” without a specific threat radar being classified before launch. Apparently this was due to the fact that multiple types of anti-aircraft artillery radars have very similar electronic signatures, so many of them were classified simply as AAA by default. Some claim the F-4G crew actually mistook the B-52’s tail gun radar or its missile warning system by accident, but it seems like a real threat did exist, with the unique geometry of the engagement being the catalyst for near disaster. F-4Gs., USAF As the nearly 14 foot long, 800lb missile dove toward its target in the dark abyss below, accelerating on its way to mach two in the process, its seeker inadvertently locked onto one of the B-52’s AN/ASG-15 tail gun targeting radar system , otherwise known as the Defensive Fire Control System (DFCS). Others claim the HARM locked onto the bomber’s AN/ALQ-153 missile warning system. Like the AN/AGS-15, the AN/ALQ-153 used a radar system. But in its case that system was used to detect incoming missiles. Apparently, this was possible because the B-52’s tail radars are similar to those used by AAA batteries, and were also classified to the default general AAA designation. As such, the missile was drawn to the B-52’s tail instead of the AAA site the Wild Weasel crew was trying to put out of commission. The missile’s 146 pound warhead detonated just behind the big bomber, ripping off various pieces of the aircraft’s empennage, including pretty much everything behind the vertical stabilizer and blasting other surfaces, including the horizontal stabilizers, with shrapnel. The aircraft’s tail gun system and missile warning system were totally obliterated. The badly damaged aircraft skewed about in the darkness low over the desert, the crew struggled to regain control of the stricken bomber, dropping to just feet above the ground in the process. Amazingly they were able to limp the stricken jet back to Prince Abdullah Air Base in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, landing without a drag chute —it was streamed out the back of the B-52 as a result of the explosion, and immediately collapsed as the jet was going hundreds of knots above its maximum deployment speed. B-52G taking off for a Desert Storm sortie. , USAF The jet was patched together crudely and ferried thousands of miles to Andersen AFB in Guam where it would receive much more comprehensive set of fixes. Eventually it was returned to the fleet with new nose art and a new nickname: “In HARM’s Way.” The B-52 served brilliantly in Desert Storm, secretly launching GPS-guided cruise missiles and dropping nearly one third of the tonnage of all air-to-ground weapons during the war. By 1992, all tail guns were removed from the entire B-52 fleet as part of a cost saving and tactics shifting measure, although the AN/ALQ-153 remained. Just two years later, in 1994, the B-52G fleet was retired, including 58-0248 , leaving just the B-52H to soldier on for decades to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",‘Kraken’ Is the U.S. Navy’s Monster Motion-Based Research Simulator,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the features most elaborate motion-based simulators lack are the sustained gravitational forces that can have severe effects on a vehicle’s crew. That is not the case for the Navy’s GL-6000 disorientation research device, better known as “The Kraken.” The $19 million monster of a simulator is the centerpiece of the Captain Ashton Graybiel Acceleration Research Facility at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio that opened in June 2016. The system weighs a quarter of a million pounds, leverages 4,500 horsepower, and provides simultaneous motion on six axes. In other words, it gives its occupants one hell of a ride. The goal of this engineering marvel is to allow researchers to evaluate human factors like operational effectiveness, performance, and safety in various moving vehicles as accurately as possible without actually putting anyone (or anything) in danger. And the Kraken is not just about flight, although it can accurately reproduce rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft of virtually all types. It can also simulate the motion dynamics of submarines, boats, and land vehicles. Its cockpit, or “gondola,” is totally reconfigurable to mimic whatever type of vehicle needs to be simulated. This rapid adaptability drastically saves in terms of cost and the time needed to execute disparate test and research programs. “While we recognize the tremendous challenges overcome and the feats of engineering and cunning required to create the marvel that is the Kraken, we also acknowledge that it is the natural realization of Capt. Graybiel’s vision,” Navy captain and commanding officer of the new facility Rees Lee said at its opening last year. “For the first time in the history of aerospace medicine, fully realistic motion simulations can be created which allow the exhaustive research necessary for a comprehensive understanding of spatial disorientation and other motion and acceleration-based phenomenon” Research done on Kraken, and new solutions that come from that research, should result in fewer motion-related vehicle mishaps out in the field. As a result, the incredibly complex simulator and lab will likely save lives—and some very expensive vehicles, too. The tragedy of controlled flight into terrain in particular—a problem that has plagued military aircrews for the majority of man’s history in the air—is one area that the Pentagon has begun to make large strides in curtailing in recent years. The F-16, and soon other fighters and military aircraft, are being fitted with automatic ground collision avoidance systems (Auto-GCAS) that automatically recover the aircraft from an imminent flight into terrain, thus saving a disoriented or unconscious pilot from certain death. Similar systems could be adapted to keep less advanced low-flying aircraft from flying into mountains and other obstacles in poor visibility or at night. While Auto-GCAS is one solution for a narrow but very formidable set of issues, Kraken aims to take on a much wider set of problems, including examining the causes of disorientation and other medical and human-factors science related to the phenomena. An impressive digital rendering of the mighty Kraken., ETC Aircrew Training Systems The name of the new center that houses Kraken is a tribute to Captain Ashton Graybiel , a Navy scientist and medical doctor who made groundbreaking advances in acceleration research and its physiological effects during the 1950s and 1960s, then continued making new discoveries all the way through the 1980s. His work included game-changing studies of disorientation, weightlessness, human balance and the body’s ability to cope with heavy acceleration. Graybiel’s data, reports and research instruments were absolutely essential when it came to NASA’s success during the space race. Graybiel was also a renowned cardiologist whose published works changed the field dramatically from the 1940s on. Him and his team established their original biomedical research lab at the Navy School Of Aviation Medicine in Pensacola, Florida in the 1950s. By 1970 the lab had grown immensely, and was rebranded independently as the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (NAMRL). So, yeah, if anyone deserves a facility like this one named after them, it’s Captain Graybiel. Captain Lee stated the following during the facility’s grand opening last year: “In October 2010, the Navy moved its aeromedical research arm from Pensacola to Wright-Patterson as part of the Base Realignment and Closure initiative, it brought together Air Force and Navy scientists with long histories of ground-breaking and innovative aeromedical research to work side-by-side, establishing the potential to create the world’s most advanced and capable aeromedical research center in the world. Over the last six years we have been working to realize that potential. Today, with the activation of the Kraken Disorientation Research Device, and the establishment of the Captain Ashton Graybiel Acceleration Research Facility, we take another giant step to realizing that potential.” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 19, 2020",This Shadowy Afghan Unit Fights Alongside America’s Most Elite Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that American special operations forces have been actively hunting members of Islamic State’s franchise in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. But official details about a raid in 2017 show that the Afghanistan government’s most elite unit, the shadowy Ktah Khas battalion, has been fighting alongside U.S. troops during the campaign. On the night of April 26, 2017, helicopters inserted a combined force of American special operators, including U.S. Army Rangers, and Afghan commandos into the Mohmand Valley in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar Province. A firefight ensued that lasted into the early hours of April 27, 2017. “U.S. Special Operations forces killed several senior ISIS-K leaders along with about 35 ISIS operatives, which should significantly degrade ISIS-K operations and help to destroy the ISIS-K affiliate that’s there,” U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters on April 28, 2017. The night raid specifically targeted the group’s self-described emir, Abdul Hasib. On May 7, 2017, top American command in Afghanistan announced Hasib had died in the raid . Two Rangers from the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment also died during the battle, possibly as a result of friendly fire. U.S. officials subsequently said they had launched a formal investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths. A member of the Ktah Khas during a training exercise., USAF The terrorist leader had orchestrated a complex assault on the Sardar Daud Khan National Military Hospital in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul on March 8, 2017. Wearing the uniforms of hospital employees, the attackers massacred more than 30 people and wounded dozens more, including doctors, other staff, and patients. “This successful joint operation is another important step in our relentless campaign to defeat ISIS-K in 2017,” U.S. Army General John Nicholson, head of all American troops, said after his command announced Hasib’s death. “This is the second ISIS-K emir we have killed in nine months, along with dozens of their leaders and hundreds of their fighters.” An American air strike killed the previous ISIS-K emir , Hafiz Saeed Khan, in July 2016. In late 2014, Khan and his fighters split from the Pakistani Tehrik-e Taliban and swore allegiance to ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group was also the target of an aerial attack on April 13, 2017, in which a U.S. Air Force MC-130 special operations transport dropped a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Burst (MOAB) bomb for the first time in combat. That spectacular mission appeared to be in retaliation for the death another Ranger during operations in Nangarhar earlier in the month. In addition, Nicholson took time to praise the Afghan troops who participated in the operation.  And in a rare acknowledgement, the press release named the unit involved as the secretive and obscure Ktah Khas. A US Army Special Forces soldier in Afghanistan., US Army Referred to variously as the Afghan Special Security Forces, the Afghan Special Unit, the Kteh Khas, the 1st Ktah Khas, the Ktah Khas Unit, or simply by the abbreviation KKA, the unit is the Afghanistan’s analogue to the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The name is a phrase in the Dari language that literally translates to something along the lines of “ to touch success ,” but is often treated as simply meaning “special force” or “special unit.” Sometime in 2009, Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense established the unit with help from members of the 75th Ranger Regiment to assist the Americans on kill or capture missions, according to Leigh Neville’s 2015 book Special Forces in the War on Terror . Army Rangers were among the forces assigned to JSOC task force in the country, known at least for a time as Task Force 3-10 , which had the job of tracking and neutralizing specific terrorists and militants. Initially, U.S. commanders referred to the elite Afghan forces euphemistically as the “Afghan Partner Unit,” or APU. This generic terminology allowed them to talk about the unit without necessarily giving away details of its existence or the secretive American elements it was supporting. For instance, in 2010, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) released a statement about an “Afghan-international security force,” which included an “Afghan partner unit” that had killed and wounded a number of insurgents while pursuing a Taliban sub-commander in Nimroz Province. This was likely the work of American special operators and the Ktah Khas. Afghan commandos board an Mi-17 helicopter., US Army In 2011, more details about the force had begun to leak out.” Little has been publicly revealed about this unit, but in Senate testimony former JSOC commander [U.S. Navy] Admiral William McRaven described it as an Afghan special operations unit ‘…that went on target with the JSOC forces forward to ensure that we had an Afghan that was, if you will, going through the door first, that was making first contact with the locals, in order to make sure that we kind of protected the culturally sensitive issues or items that were on target,’” the November 2011 edition of West Point’s CTC Sentinel magazine explained. On March 21, 2012, more information emerged when U.S. Central Command released redacted copies of the documents associated with the investigation into the shootdown of a CH-47D Chinook known as Extortion 17 . More than seven months earlier, Taliban fighters had knocked out the helicopter as it brought it a reaction force of U.S. Navy SEALs during a night raid to kill or capture Qari Tahir, one of the group’s leaders, in the Tangi Valley in Afghanistan’s Wardak Province. Interviews and other records noted that “APU” members had been part of the mission, touching off conspiracy theories that they alerted the militants to the operation. By 2013, the battalion, by then known publicly as the Ktah Khas, had more than 1,200 personnel, including members of the Afghan National Police and the National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan’s main intelligence service. These individuals “give it unique law enforcement and intelligence capabilities,” a Pentagon review of activities during that year noted. A member of the Ktah Khas battalion, with “APU” written on their chest rig, searches a house in 2012., US Army On top of that, the unit had previously added a group of elite female troops, first known as the Family Support Platoon (FSP) and then renamed the Female Tactical Platoon (FTP). “A concept based on the successes of the U.S. CST [Cultural Support Team] program, FSPs were developed to accompany Ktah Khas Afghan Strike Forces on missions and, working in conjunction with their CST counterparts, safeguard and interact with the women and children encountered during the conduct of special operations,” another U.S. report explained . As of 2015, the battalion reportedly consisted of three strike companies, a military intelligence company, a training company, the FTP, and various logistics and other support elements. In December 2015, U.S. Central Command also denied in full the author’s Freedom of Information Act request for U.S. Forces Afghanistan records relating to the unit’s mission and structure. By then, though largely unknown, the Ktah Khas had established itself as a capable partner in Afghanistan for America’s most elite special operations forces. “Many of the most dangerous insurgents currently held in Afghan prisons were captured or detained by the KKA,” the Pentagon’s 2013 report declared. In December 2015, unspecified Afghan forces, possibly the Ktah Khas, had freed 60 prisoners from the Taliban in the Now Zad District of Afghanistan’s Helmand Province, according to Vice News . The next month, the battalion rescued nearly 60 more individuals in Helmand’s Nahr-e-Saraj District. Afghan Commandos practice air assault operations., USN Unfortunately, in spite of these successes, the force suffered from many of the problems that continued to plague the bulk of Afghanistan’s military and police. The Ktah Khas “are highly effective, but also highly dependent on U.S. counterterrorism forces (e.g., for intelligence, targeting, and air transportation),” according to an independent assessment of the Afghan National Security Forces that CNA Analysis and Solutions conducted for the Pentagon in 2014. “Significantly increasing the ranks of the elite Ktah Khas counterterrorism force is likely infeasible without lowering its recruiting standards.” In January 2015, the unit had reportedly planned and an executed its first ever independent airmobile assault, using helicopters form the Special Mission Wing of the Afghan National Army’s Special Operations Command. However, the availability rates of the Afghan military’s Mi-17 helicopter fleet have long been a major cause for concern, and the country’s special operations elements have repeatedly poached both choppers and crews from the regular Air Force to meet operational demands. The April 2017 raid into Nangarhar would seem to show that the Ktah Khas remains capable of operating with American forces, but is still dependent on support from the main U.S. special operations task force in Afghanistan. It’s not clear when that situation might change. Since President Barack Obama began drawing down American troops in the country in 2011, Afghanistan’s military and its elite forces in particular, have been under increasing strain. A US Army Special Forces soldier points a laser aiming device during an night op in Afghanistan. , US Army U.S. Army Lieutenant General Joseph Anderson, then head of the ISAF Joint Command, told reporters on Nov. 5, 2014 that the Afghan National Security Forces’ casualty rate was “ not sustainable .” In October 2016, The Washington Post reported that the Afghan National Army’s Commando Kandaks – elite light infantry battalions assigned to the country’s special operations command – were performing conventional day-to-day missions . In March 2017, Reuters reported officials in Kabul and their American advisors wanted to expand the country’s special operations contingents to a total of 17,000 troops, adding that these specialized forces were responsible for approximately 70 percent of all combat operations. Then, in May 2017, there were reports that President Donald Trump and his administration were considering boosting American forces in the war-torn country in the face of a resurgent Taliban and continued difficulties in improving the quality of Afghan security forces. The proposal reportedly included a surge of at least 3,000 more U.S. troops into the country. The month before, a contingent of 300 Marines had returned to Helmand Province, where the Corps had previously run operations until 2014, to take over a vital advisory project . Regardless, until Afghanistan’s regular forces become more capable, the country’s elite units – including the Ktah Khas – are likely to remain out front on operations against groups like the Taliban and ISIS-K.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 26, 2020",Family Demands To Know How A 200-Pound Antique Anvil Disappeared From Area 51,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As if the situation couldn’t get any more bizarre. Now the family locked in a major land use battle with the USAF over their property that overlooked the air base at Area 51 wants the Air Force to tell them how a 200-pound antique anvil disappeared from the property just weeks after it was officially seized. The Sheahans have, in one way or another, been fighting the Air Force for decades. You should read all about this more than extraordinary struggle here. But now, more than a year after the property was condemned under eminent domain in the fall of 2015, the issue has come down to what the historic mine is worth. As of late last year, the two parties were as far apart as one can imagine. The USAF drastically dropped what it was willing to pay for the mine to a paltry $333,000, while the Sheahans claim the property could be worth as much as $116 million. On top of that, the family says that by law all their personal property needs to be relocated from the site on the US Air Force’s dime, a fact that seemed to have been a given when the condemnation process was executed. But now, according to the Sheahans, the Air Force isn’t even going to do that. The family stated the following in a press release: After seizing the Groom Mine Property from the Sheahan family through eminent domain, the U.S. Government confirmed it would take a small army, many months and $2.7 million to move 130 years worth of family  belongings from the property–not including storage fees, incidentals and other unforeseen costs. The Sheahan’s relocation expert agreed that the relocation would take several months, but the cost would be $4.5 million. The government is now changing its initial position, arguing that it will only take several blocks of three to four days to move the belongings and cost less than $300,000 for both moving and storage. The government claims that this position is justified on the grounds that the mining equipment on the property is considered a fixture that is attached to the land and needs to be valued as part of it, not moved. However, the government initially took the exact opposite position when valuing the land, claiming the mining equipment should not be valued as part of the land, because it is personal property that needs to be moved. “These grossly inconsistent positions are nothing more than an attempt to outright take our family’s personal property without just compensation,” said Joe Sheahan, one of the property owners. The government is also refusing to move other items owned by the Sheahan family including a 1929 Model A Ford, a 1936 International truck, antique mining buckets and gears, and similar items. Their excuse for this is that these items are high bulk and low value, although they have not provided a single valuation appraisal on any of these items. In addition , the government has sent the landowners threatening letters ordering them to remove all of their property within 30 days, while not providing access to do so. This is a clear violation of federal law. To assure that personal property of this type is fully protected, Congress adopted the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). The URA mandates specific rules to assure the government pays for moving and storage of all personal property and provides a reasonable time to do so. The URA further states that the government is required to provide assistance with the relocation of the personal property “to ensure that persons displaced as a direct result of federal or federally assisted projects are treated fairly, consistently, and equitably so that such displaced persons will not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of the projects designed for the benefit of the public as a whole” (49 CFR § 24.1.). The Sheahan’s property is a historic mine that overlooks Groom Lake., Groommine.com/Groom Mine Facebook page. The relationship has gotten so contentious between the Sheahans and the Air Force that the family is now demanding answers as to how an antique anvil that weighs 200-lbs could have disappeared within the most highly secured land mass in the world just weeks after the family was evicted from their property that lies within its perimeter. Less than two months after the Government confiscated the Groom Mine Property, a 100-year-old, 200-lb. blacksmith’s anvil disappeared from the property. The owners noticed the historic anvil was missing shortly after arriving on-site to conduct a personal property review with the U.S. Government’s moving company in November of 2015. The Government conducted an investigation, but was unsuccessful in recovering this large antique anvil. In spite of the numerous cameras, sensors, guards in Ford Raptors, helicopters and satellites, they still could not find a 200-lb. anvil. “Was this Area 51 black magic or just plain old theft? Did someone slip it out of the most secret and secure location on the planet in their lunch box?” asked Patrick Sheahan, one of property owners. The Sheahan’s puzzlement as to how such an ungainly object could have vanished from such a secure locale is totally warranted. It’s an anvil, so we know it didn’t get up and walk away on its own, and the only people who would have access to the mine were presumably those who work at the base or who secure its heavily monitored perimeter. In other words, random hikers didn’t casually rob the place. Also, considering that most of the workers at Area 51 are either flown there or are bussed in daily, the ability to remove the anvil from the secretive installation’s grounds becomes even less plausible. One of the contractor operated “Janet” 737s that travel the route from Las Vegas International Airport to Area 51 one a daily basis. , AP As sophomoric as it sounds, the historic anvil from the Sheahan’s property—the last private parcel of land with a direct line of sight of the flight test installation at the center of Area 51—would be a nice “victory trophy” for powers that be at the secretive facility. Considering that the place is supposedly littered with test aircraft and is likely the most compartmentalized facility in the US, it’s unclear how exactly the USAF could investigate such an act. In fact, investigating Area 51 on an official level is next to impossible, as proven by the lawsuit filed by workers that became gravely ill during the 1990s after toxic chemicals were systematically burned in trenches at the base. Before that suit, the base never officially existed. To this day, renewed executive orders are issued by the White House to keep it so classified that it is largely shielded from oversight and the American judicial system. In other words, the chances that the Sheahans will be seeing their anvil anytime soon are probably as good as you or I receiving a formal invite to come take a personal tour of the installation. So there you have it, the enigmatic Area 51—a wondrous place that is not only associated directly with aircraft that can disappear, but now also with mysteriously disappearing historical blacksmithing hardware.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 17, 2020",Ryan Aeronautical Had Big Plans for the Vertifan Jump Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While defense contractors can be shameless in trying to sell their products, they don’t always offer a complete vision of certain aspects of future warfare. But based on a collection of concept art, at the height of the Cold War, Ryan Aeronautical pitched their Vertifan jump jet as the future of air power. When Ryan’s experimental XV-5A Vertifan made its first flight On May 25, 1964, the California-based plane maker had already been at work on the concept for more than two years. The U.S. Army had only ordered two of the planes, but the firm envisioned the prototypes as the first step to building jump jet fighters for the U.S. Air Force and Navy, interceptors for the West German Luftwaffe, sub hunting patrol planes, and small counter-insurgency aircraft, all of which could take off and land vertically without the need for conventional runways. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fg9guWqKShs By the end of the 1950s, the U.S. military and many of its allies had become interested in the idea of jump jets. Experience in World War II had shown that taking out runways could cripple an enemy’s air force without necessarily having to eliminate production lines or destroy individual aircraft. With the advent of nuclear weapons the United States realized it would be particularly easy for the Soviet Union to take out entire air bases with minimal effort. The two Ryan XV-5A prototypes., Ryan Aeronautical via the SDASM Archives This concern was even more pronounced for countries, such as West Germany, which sat right on the border of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. An aircraft that could take off and land vertically or otherwise operate without the need for large, conspicuous improved runway offered a possible way to keep forces safe and available for a counterattack during a future conflict involving atomic weaponry. Various countries experimented with vertical take-off aircraft in different configurations. In its actual prototypes, Ryan’s Vertifan design involved separate jet engines and lift fans to achieve level and vertical flight respectively. However, the lift fans were not independently powered.  When the pilot switched from level to vertical flight, a cut-off valve redirected the jet exhaust and used it to physically spin the fans. Not surprisingly, Ryan’s art showcases these prototypes, with twin jet engines and lift fans in the wings and nose, which the company had crafted for the Army. Offering the ability to operate like a helicopter, but with the cruising speed of a fixed wing jet, the service wanted to explore their potential in both the close air support and rescue roles. The COIN Vertifan., Ryan Aeronautical via the SDASM Archives But Ryan didn’t expect stop there. Artworks depict a stubbier Vertifan specifically for counter-insurgency operations. The concept looks like a hybrid between the XV-5 and North American Rockwell’s OV-10 Bronco. Based on the art, this version would have involved a turbojet engine driving a pusher propeller in the tail, as well as providing the exhaust to drive the lift fans. In scenes that evoke a Southeast Asian setting—the U.S. military was becoming increasingly embroiled in Vietnam as Ryan continued to refine its prototypes—these aircraft carry rocket pods under their wings while operating from austere camps and attacking insurgent-controlled villages. Vertifan fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force., Ryan Aeronautical via the SDASM Archives Ryan had options for other services, too. One slide features a pair of potential Air Force fighter jets in a similar configuration to the XV-5. The aircraft in the foreground has two under-wing drop tanks and what appear to be four cannons. At the time, the service was still flying the F-100 Super Sabre fighter, which had a similar armament. A U.S. Navy Vertifan refuels in mid-air., Ryan Aeronautical via the SDASM Archives Another image shows an elongated Vertifan design in a Navy paint scheme flying along with A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft and F-4 Phantom fighter jets. One of the A-4s is refueling the Vertifan in mid-air using a “buddy pod” system. It’s not entirely clear whether the proposed variant was a fighter, attack aircraft, spy plane, or electronic warfare platform – akin to the EA-3B and EKA-3B Skywarriors – since it carries no obvious weapons, but has pods or slipper tanks on its wings. There was also a larger anti-submarine warfare concept, which Ryan would likely have pitched to the Navy, too. Ryan Aeronautical via the SDASM Archives Then there’s a painted scene involving three West German Vertifans, all much longer than the XV-5 prototypes, with two sets of fans in the forward and rear fuselages. The port for a forward-firing cannon, such as the M61 Vulcan, is visible and the pointed nose looks perfect for an air intercept radar. Luftwaffe Vertifan intereptors., Ryan Aeronautical via the SDASM Archives It’s worth noting that at the time, the Luftwaffe was actively exploring zero-length launchers capable of blasting the F-104 interceptor into the air, as well as domestically produced dedicated jump jets such as the EWR VJ 101 . German firm VFW continued this work into the 1970s, ultimately developing the experimental VAK 191B . The German military did not put any of these designs into service. The Vertifan itself ended in failure, suffering from reliability problems and intra-service rivalry . In April 1965, one of the two XV-5As was totally destroyed during a demonstration flight, which killed the pilot. The next year another accident claimed the life of a second test aviator. During an experiment with a rescue hoist system, a manikin representing an injured soldier had gotten caught in one of the lift fans, destabilizing the aircraft. Ryan rebuilt the prototype with various improvements, leading to the XV-5B. Unfortunately, at the same time, the Army was losing a long-running bureaucratic battle with the Air Force over its right to fly fixed wing aircraft. The Air Force and its supporters ultimately managed to kill off the Army’s Vertifan program. With no interest in using it themselves, the Air Force effectively doomed the project as a whole. Ryan never found buyers for any variant of the Vertifan. Instead, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps focused on testing the British Hawker Siddeley P.1127 , which eventually led to the Marine’s adopting the AV8 Harrier jump jet in 1971.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2020",How a Secretive Special Operations Task Force Is Taking the Fight to ISIS,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While body counts are not a particularly useful metric of a military operationâ€™s success, they can be a good indicator of how intense things have been on the ground. So, if the official tally is accurate, the U.S.-led special operations task force fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, which includes Americaâ€™s shadowy Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), foreign partners, and private contractors, has had a massive and potentially lopsided impact on the mission. On April 14, 2017, members of Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolveâ€™s (SOJTF-OIR) headquarters element received new, distinctive unit patches at a ceremony at an undisclosed location somewhere in â€œSouthwest Asia.â€ Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the overarching U.S.-run force battling ISIS, which oversees SOJTF-OIR, released a number of pictures of the event. Though they were full of small, interesting details â€“ like the presence of both U.S. Army and Marine Corps special operators, along with British and Turkish officers â€“ the most eye-opening information was in the caption. â€œSince its establishment, SOJTF-OIR has liberated over 45,000 square [kilometers] previously held by ISIS and has killed over 21,00 [sic; 21,000] ISIS militants,” the text read. Sometime afterwards, CJTF-OIR quietly deleted this information from the pictures. However, in an Email to The War Zone, one of commandâ€™s public affairs officers confirmed the figure and the apparent typo. â€œSOJTF-OIR since its inception has greatly contributed to the degradation of the enemy, ISIS,â€ the media office added. â€œTheâ€¦number is an estimate. Body count is not the focus of the coalition’s efforts. It is the ultimate defeat of this barbaric and inhuman enemy, ISIS.â€ A U.S. Army member of SOJTF-OIR wears the unit’s new patch at a ceremony in April 2017., U.S. Army Though not the focus of their activities, SOJTF-OIRâ€™s kill count is both massive and accounts for a huge proportion of the total figure across the entire American-led coalition. As of April 2017, CJTF-OIR estimated it had killed approximately 70,000 ISIS fighters since 2014. This means that SOJTF-OIR â€“ and possibly its predecessor organizations â€“ has been responsible for around 30 percent of all dead terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Yet, the special operations forces do not receive nearly the same amount of attention as the air war, or even the increasing use of conventional artillery. Of course, we donâ€™t know whether SOJTF-OIR counts terrorists who died in air or artillery strikes its personnel called in among the task forceâ€™s final count. But after digging into the available information, along with various documents The War Zone obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), we can share a more complete picture of the intelligence-driven campaign focused on killing the terrorist groupâ€™s leader and attacking other high value targets. The most obvious, but least visible part of this effort has been the work of a JSOC task force. Publicly referred to as the â€œExpeditionary Targeting Forceâ€ (ETF) in 2015 , these elite forces were going to Iraq and might even cross the border for missions into Syria, according to then Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. â€œSpecial operators will, over time, be able to conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence and capture ISIL leaders,â€ he explained to lawmakers in a statement on Dec. 1, 2015, using another acronym for Islamic State. â€œThat creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, which generates more targets, more raids and more momentum.â€ As the Pentagon described it, this concept seemed very similar to the controversial special operations forces-led push against Al Qaeda in Iraq â€“ the predecessor to ISIS â€“ and other terrorists during the American-led occupation of the country between 2003 and 2011. This plan is often described as the brain child of Army General Stanley McChrystal, who commanded a JSOC task force in Iraq until he took over as head of the super-secretive command in September 2003. “Itâ€™s Â a tool that we introduced as part of our â€“ the accelerated operations Â to conduct raids of various kinds, seizing places and people, freeing Â hostages and prisoners of ISIL, and making it such that ISIL has to fear Â that anywhere, anytime, it may be struck,” Carter added during a public briefing at the Pentagon on Feb. 29, 2016. “The only thing Iâ€™ll say is Â the ETF is in position, it is having an effect and operating, and I Â expect it to be a very effective part of our acceleration campaign. I Â donâ€™t have any more on that.â€ Though Carter didnâ€™t explicitly say JSOC was leading the force, he did admit elements of the command were operating in the region during a press conference with his French counterpart, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, on Oct. 25, 2016. â€œWe have put our Joint Special Operations Command in the lead of countering ISIL’s external operations,â€ he declared, using another term for ISIS. â€œAnd we have already achieved very significant results both in reducing the flow of foreign fighters and removing ISIL leaders from the battlefield.â€ Thanks to FOIA, the War Zone has obtained a more in depth view of these operations from the U.S. Armyâ€™s official report on the crash of a mysterious spy plane with the civilian registration code â€“ N6351V â€“ and paint job to match crashed into a field outside the town of Kawrgosk in northern Iraq on March 5, 2016. Though accident report is both heavily redacted and significantly abridged to begin with for operational security reasons, the formal review confirmed the aircraft was supporting JSOCâ€™s forces. U.S. Army via FOIA The formal chain of custody starts with U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), the serviceâ€™s top manager for aircraft of all types. Then it moves down through Program Manager-Fixed Wing (PM-FW) and Program Manager-Sensors-Aerial Intelligence (PM-SAI) and finally to U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). At the very end, JSOC is listed as the â€œorganization involvedâ€ at the time of the incident. Despite the sensitive nature of the mission, the Armyâ€™s protocols required an investigation into the Class A accident, meaning the incident either caused more than $2 million in damage to the plane or someone died. In this instance, thankfully, there were no fatalities, but the crash totaled the aircraft. â€œThe accident aircraft wasâ€¦assigned to a task force (TF) located at Erbil International Airport, Erbil, Iraq,â€ Army investigators explained in their narrative. â€œThe accident aircrew was scheduled to conduct their standard mission in the local area, which was captured on the TF’s flight schedule.â€ The wreckage of N6351V in a controlled hangar at Erbil Airport after the accident in March 2016., U.S. Army via FOIA The results of the investigation itself were inconclusive. Both of the engines on the modified King Air 300-series failed after smoke suddenly began filling the cockpit. After finding evidence of debris inside, the Army sent the two PT6A turboprop engines to the Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) facility at Bridgeport, West Virginia for further analysis. Investigators forwarded fuel and oil samples to a military laboratory for separate tests, which did not turn up any dangerous impurities. â€œThe number one engine forward gearbox housing fractured from the engine combustion housing, revealing extensive internal damage to the gearbox planetary gears. Removal of the exhaust stacks revealed extensive internal combustion housing and power turbine damage. The number one engine chip detector revealed a copious amount of metallic debris,â€ the investigators found when they began to inspect the wreckage at a controlled hangar at Erbil Airport. â€œThe number two engine did not reveal any notable damage.â€ The remains of N6351V’s right wing., U.S. Army via FOIA But the details about the aircraft itself are particularly interesting, illuminating how JSOC is operating in Iraq and Syria, as well as procedures it might apply to operations globally. Though an official document describes it as an MC-12W Liberty aircraft, we now know that N6351V was actually a government-owned, contractor-operated Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS). This aerial-intelligence system includes day- and night-vision cameras, a combination laser range-finder and designator, as well as signals intelligence (SIGINT) equipment to find and monitor enemy communications. In 2009, the Army had initially hired contractors to fly this same gear in various aircraft, including both King Air 200- and 300-series planes and larger Bombardier Dash-7s. Â The MARSS went to Afghanistan to form the basis for the serviceâ€™s Task Force Observe, Detect, Identify, and Neutralize-Enhanced (ODIN-E), which was primarily hunting for militants planting roadside bombs. ODIN-E built on the concept the original Task Force ODIN pioneered in Iraq. According a separate FOIA request, the Army said it had bought N6351V outright, along with a second MARSS aircraft with the registration N8007U, sometime between 2013 and 2014. A table from July 2015 noted both aircraft, along with eight other King Air 300-based aerial spooks, were all situated at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. The decision to collocate these two JSOC aircraft with the other planes, all of which shared many of the same basic airframe and engine components, would have eased maintenance requirements and kept them obscured from the Armyâ€™s own fleet. In addition, fuel and oil purity tests from Corpus Christi Army Depot attached to the main incident report suggested that JSOC may swap these registrations between aircraft to help conceal their activities. In his 2015 book on JSOC, Relentless Strike , journalist and author Sean Naylor talks extensively about the commandâ€™s use of â€œcovered air,â€ which involves elements â€œwhose personnel and aircraft operate under cover.â€ The War Zone has already written an extensive look at what we know of the U.S. military’s most secretive aviation elements . U.S. Army via FOIA In this case, the review included historical sampling data for N6351V from August 2014 to March 2016. The last three entries listed â€œN166BAâ€ as the so-called â€œEnd-Item Serial Numberâ€ or EISN. In 2016, plane spotters repeatedly tracked this aircraft, as well as a second apparent Beechcraft King Air 300 spy plane with the registration N80BZ, over Iraq using websites like FlightRadar24.com. To persistently track Islamic State fighters and the movements of particular targets for long periods of time in order to build a so-called pattern of life,â€ JSOC would definitely need more than just one aircraft.

A picture of N166BA from 2009 does show a similar aircraft to N6351V, but in an overall gray paint scheme. To persistently track Islamic State fighters and the movements of particular targets for long periods of time in order to build a so-called pattern of life, JSOC would need more than just one aircraft. An Army table from July 2015 included N6351V and what could be another contractor-operated MARSS â€“ Â N8007U â€“ along with eight other King Air 300-based aerial spooks, all situated at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. The decision to collocate these two JSOC aircraft with the other planes, all of which shared many of the same basic airframe and engine components, would have eased maintenance requirements and kept them obscured from the Armyâ€™s own fleet. A MARSS aircraft in Afghanistan., US Army Regardless of the origins of the aircraft itself, and just how many JSOC actually has under its control, the most interesting detail about N6351V from the accident report may be its crew. Of the four crew members, only one was actually a member of the U.S. military. This U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant acted as the aircraftâ€™s â€œtactical systems operatorâ€ manning the SIGINT system. Censors redacted this individualâ€™s name and there is no mention of their unit, but they could have been assigned to JSOC from Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) or one of the Corpsâ€™ three obscure communications-grabbing radio battalions. U.S. Army via FOIA The remaining individuals on the plane â€“ the pilot, co-pilot, and full-motion video specialist â€“ were all contract employees from ASKII Technology, Inc. Not surprisingly, on its website, this New Jersey-headquartered firm proudly declares past support for SOCOM, Task Force ODIN, and the Multi Sensor Aerial Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (MAISR) program, which supplied contractor support for Task Force ODIN-E. Shortly after the crash, on March 23, 2016, elite troops, likely from the ETF, killed Islamic State’s then number two leader, Rahman Mustafa Qaduli , during a raid in Syria. On April 6, 2017, another such special operation in Syria resulted in the death of Abdurakhmon Uzbeki , an ethnic Uzbek foreign fighter who the Pentagon described as a “close associate” of ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi.Â It is important to note that we donâ€™t know the exact relationship between JSOCâ€™s elements in Iraq and Syria and the over-arching SOJTF-OIR. In Afghanistan, a similarly unspecified â€œtask forceâ€ tasked with targeted strikes against terrorists in that country is at least nominally part of the larger Special Operations Joint Task Force-Afghanistan (SOJTF-A). American special operators and members of the USAF pose for a picture during Exercise Eagle Resolve 2017 in Kuwait., U.S. Army On top of that, even before Carter revealed the Expeditionary Targeting Force, there was already evidence the U.S. military was looking to start a more specialized campaign against ISIS. In July 2014, U.S. and Jordanian special operations forces tried and failed to rescue two dozen hostages from ISIS. Afterwards, the terrorists publicly beheaded a number of them, including Americas James Foley, Steve Sotloff, and Peter Kassig. Later that year, elite troops also failed in another rescue mission to free American humanitarian Kayla Mueller, who the brutal militants had forced to “marry” their leader Baghdadi and became a sex slave. She died in captivity in February 2015. When it came to direct against against terrorist leaders, according to a summary table of civilian casualty allegations, at least one A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft attacked a high value individual codenamed â€œANDERS MESAâ€ on or about April 12, 2015 near Hawija, Iraq. In May 2015, a ground raid in Syria, reportedly involving Delta Force and the British Special Air Service (SAS), killed then-ISIS deputy commander Abu Sayyaf and led to the capture of the militant’s wife, Umm Sayyaf. The two had reportedly held Mueller captive at one point. â€œHVI [high value individual] strikes have killed approximately 70 senior and mid-level leaders since the beginning of May,â€ Army Col. Steve Warren, then the main spokesman for CJTF-OIR, told reporters on Oct. 13, 2015. â€œThat equates to one HVI killed every two days.â€ Then, on Oct. 22, 2015, Army Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler died during a combined raid with Kurdish commandos on a terrorist prison camp near the town of Hawija in northern Iraq. It later emerged that Wheeler had been a member of Delta Force, which works exclusively as a force provider for JSOC operations. U.S. Central Command via FOIA By 2014, the Pentagon had already created larger, multi-national special operations task forces for both fronts â€“ Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Iraq (CJSOTF-I) and Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Syria (CJSOTF-S) â€“ as well. When SOJTF-OIR stood up, the Pentagon dictated that its commander be dual-hatted as the head of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force-Syria (CJIATF-S), effectively bringing the entire special operations enterprise pointed at ISIS under the guidance of a single individual. While the primary job of these forces has been and continues to be training and advising local forces in both countries, these activities have brought American special operators closer and closer to the front lines. As already noted, it could be here that SOJTF-OIR has scored most of its kills by calling in air strikes and artillery fire during grueling battles for critical cities, such as Mosul , which was ISISâ€™ de facto capital in Iraq. Some of the aerial attacks could conceivably have come from within the task force itself. In its Email to The War Zone, CJTF-OIRâ€™s media office confirmed the existence of a Joint Special Operations Air Component within the unit, though they declined to specify what types or how many aircraft it had on hand. MH-60M and MH-47G helicopters from the Armyâ€™s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), as well as at least one of the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s 27th Special Operations Wingâ€™s AC-130W Stinger II gunships, have appeared in publicly available images and video clips. Some of the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones zipping around Iraq and Syria could have come from other Air Force special operations squadrons. In addition, the service’s CV-22 Ospreys have joined Marine MV-22s to shuttle elite forces around. The MH-60Ms can carry miniguns, 2.75â€ rockets and Hellfire missiles. Pentagon data suggested the 160th SOAR Â fired a significant number of the rockets, which could include laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System-II (APKWS-II) variants, in both Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan. Similarly, for a period in 2016, SOCOM reported special operations units around the world were firing an average of two AGM-176 Griffin missiles, which have laser- and GPS-guidance, every day . The AC-130W, MQ-1 and MQ-9 can all carry these small weapons. The Stinger II also has a 30mm cannon and can carry Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) glide bombs, while the Predators and Reapers can lob Hellfires and GBU-12 laser-guided bombs, as well. All of these weapons could be potent in targeted strikes or while the aircraft were providing close air support for specialized missions, such as the raid on Al Tabqa Dam near the Syrian city of Raqqa. There might be heretofore unseen weapons in the mix , too.Â Thereâ€™s always the possibility elite American troops, including snipers, could have claimed even more ISIS fighters with small arms and light weapons as they advance alongside Iraqi, Syrian, and Kurdish forces. And despite the willingness of President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to Â send more conventional troops to the region, these special operations missions will likely remain a critical part of the broad campaign against the terrorist organization. After Trumpâ€™s election victory in November 2016, President Barack Obama had already reportedly expanded JSOCâ€™s worldwide authorities to go after militants.

In February, he gave the White House a new plan on how to break the terrorists in Iraq and Syria, as well as elsewhere around the world. “It is a plan to rapidly defeat ISIS,” Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, said during a briefing on Feb. 28, 2017. However, Mattis has also expressed his general distaste for body counts. â€œFor many years, we have not been calculating the results of warfare by simply quantifying the number of enemy killed,â€ he told reporters as he toured American military operations throughout the Middle East in April 2017. â€œYou donâ€™t want to start calculating things, as far as what matters, in the crude terms of battle casualties.â€ ) But whether SOJTF-OIRâ€™s estimated kills are a useful metric, or not, it does make one thing clear, the Pentagonâ€™s revised strategy for defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria continues to rely heavily on special operators hunting down relatively small terrorist groups or even going after specific individuals.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 24, 2020",France Turned the B-26 Invader Into a Colonial Night Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Douglas’ Invader attack aircraft, commonly known by the designations A-26 and B-26, had a prolific, multi-decade service life fighting around the world with a dozen different countries. However, of those foreign operators, only France created an entirely new variant to suit its operational needs. In 1961, the French Air Force’s L’Escadrille de Chasse de Nuit 1/71—Night Fighter Squadron 1/71, or ECN 1/71—took delivery of eight specially modified B-26 Invaders. Their job was to shoot down small aircraft trying to deliver supplies from neighboring Tunisia to National Liberation Front rebels in Algeria. At that time, France had been fighting the group, better known by its French acronym FLN, in what was then still a colonial possession for more than six years. “By 1957, newly independent Tunisia had become a major source of supply for the FLN,” according to an article in the March 1998 issue of the Chandelle aviation history journal. “The French responded with the Morice Line, an elaborate system of sensors, electrified border fences, mine fields, and forts stretching the length of Algeria’s eastern border.” The only problem was that this barrier didn’t do anything to prevent sympathetic aviators from simply flying over at low altitudes and eluding detection. Radars at the French naval base in Bône—known today as Annaba—could spot the intruders, but had difficulty directing friendly aircraft to intercept them. One of the eight B-26Ns., Rene Francillon via the San Diego Air and Space Museum Archives The French Air Force hastily rigged up aerial radars to two Dassault MD 315 Flamant transport planes and rushed them into service. The twin-engine aircraft, with a cruising speed of 186 miles per hour and a maximum range of just 648 miles were clearly ill-suited for the role. Without any weapons themselves, the crews had to try and guide other combat aircraft to the scene, too. Enter the B-26N. In 1951, France had begun to receive B-26s as part of military aid packages from the United States. Ultimately, America delivered more than 200 of the aircraft to French forces, who flew them first in Indochina and then in Algeria. The aircraft came with a good combat reputation from service during both World War II and the Korean War. The twin-engine light bombers had a maximum speed of over 350 miles per hour and could carry up to 8,000 pounds of bombs and rockets in an internal bay and on racks under the wings. Depending on the particular load-out, the Invader could fly up to 1,400 miles on a single tank of fuel. On top of that, the aircraft had two remote-controlled turrets, each with a pair of Browning .50 caliber machine guns and late production models had three more in the root of each wing. The B-26B models had solid noses with either six or eight more Brownings. With the eight-gun nose and the top turret pointed forward, these aircraft could tear apart ground targets with 16 guns in total. French technicians built a new nose for the Invader housing a British Mk. X air intercept radar. These systems had come from ECN 1/71’s Gloster Meteor NF.11s, which France had bought from the United Kingdom after World War II. These first generation jet night fighters would have been too fast and fuel hungry to scour the rugged Algeria-Tunisia border for protracted periods of time while hunting relatively slow-moving small cargo-carrying aircraft. At least one picture exists of a formation with a French Meteor NF.11, a B-26N, and one of the radar-equipped Flamants. But with the sensor taking up all the space in the nose, the upgraded Invaders lost their main gun armament. Instead, each B-26N carried a pod under each wing, each housing a pair of Browning .50 caliber machine guns. In addition, each aircraft had a pair of 68mm SNEB rocket pods. The result was what the piece in Chandelle described as a “special colonial night fighter.” Rene Francillon via the San Diego Air and Space Museum Archives It’s not clear how effective the B-26Ns actually were in their unique role. According to Chandelle, the night-fighting Invaders found nearly 40 small planes and helicopters and shot down nine. We don’t know whether the remaining intercepts turned out to be false tracks or friendly aircraft and the article doesn’t give a source for that information. “By the time that the B-26Ns became operational, supply aircraft coming in from the Tunisian side of the border were increasingly rare, and only a few interceptions were made,” aviation enthusiast Joe Baugher noted in his well-researched look into French B-26 operations. The effectiveness of the modified Invaders quickly became moot. In 1961, the French administration under Charles De Gaulle had begun secret negotiations with the FLN and was moving to end the fighting. This move prompted a group of French officers to attempt a coup, but they failed to overthrow De Gaulle or force a change in policy. On Feb. 20, 1962, France and the FLN agreed to a peace accord that would pave the way for Algerian independence. French forces began to evacuate their bases and return home and the war came to a formal halt the next month. In 1962, the French Air also began to retire all of its B-26s, including the N models. Only four examples of any kind ended up in French museums, with the rest going to the scrapyard or the second-hand market.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 20, 2019",These Unassuming Planes Have Been Key Players in America’s War on Terror,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A key element that makes the U.S. military so potent is its ability to start rushing troops anywhere in the world on short notice. Massive cargo aircraft, such as the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster III , depositing troops and equipment into or near war zones is a common image of American military deployments. But as the United States has expanded its often shadowy global fight against terrorism, a secretive fleet of small transport planes has become a vital tool in those operations. Between 2011 and 2013, aircraft from the U.S. Air Force’s 318th Special Operations Squadron flew more than 3,000 hours across five continents. The sorties included everything from basic cargo deliveries to air dropping supplies onto remote combat outposts and even psychological warfare. “Planning, preparing, and executing various missions while providing special operations commanders with agile, intra-theater mobility support defined their mission statement, while performing from austere, semi-prepared, and blacked-out airfields with minimal support,” the annual history for that year of the 27th Special Operations Wing, which controls the 318th, explained. The War Zone obtained this report and other records related to this unique unit’s operations through the Freedom of Information Act. As of 2012, the 318th was one of two units performing the so-called “non-standard aviation” and “light special operations forces (SOF) mobility” missions. The other was the 524th Special Operations Squadron , also part of the 27th. One of the 318th’s PC-12s., USAF In this role, the squadron had two aircraft, the single engine Pilatus PC-12 and the twin engine C-145A Combat Coyote. The latter aircraft is the Air Force’s version of the twin engine PZL M28 Skytruck. Both aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop. The 524th initially flew the twin engine Bombardier Q-200, before transitioning to the similar C-146A Wolfhound, which The War Zone already explored in an earlier piece . With a crew of two, the PC-12 can carry between six and nine passengers, depending on how much gear they have with them, or just more than 1,600 pounds of cargo. Popular in the civilian aviation world, the planes cruise at nearly 330 miles per hour and can fly more than 1,800 mile routes depending on their load. Derived from the Soviet-era Antonov An-28, the M28 can lug 5,000 pounds of supplies or nearly 20 combat-equipped troops. It has a small rear ramp so the crew can air drop packages or individuals can parachute out. The Skytrucks have a relatively short range of less than 1,000 miles and a similarly modest cruising speed of just shy of 170 miles per hour. A C-145A airdrops cargo during a training exercise., USAF For the U.S. military’s special operators, the two aircraft’s main benefits were their ease of operation and relatively low maintenance costs, as well as their ability to operate from small and unimproved airstrips. Boeing designed the C-17 to have impressive short take off capabilities for its size, but it still needs well over a mile of runway usually to get into the air. By comparison, the PC-12 only needs about half that to get airborne, and with lighter loads this requirement decreases even further. It didn’t hurt that the aircraft were common sights at airports around the world. Initially the Air Force flew both the PC-12s and C-145s with civilian-style paint jobs and with civil registration codes. These features helped aviators keep a low profile on sensitive missions, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Still, it was hard to hide various bits and bobs protruding from the USAF’s PC-12s in particular, such as various communications antennas, which made the aircraft stand out to the trained eye compared to their civilian counterparts. In 2011 and 2012, the 318th’s PC-12s flew the bulk of their sorties in the Philippines, as part of the American military assistance mission in that country. As part of Operation Enduring Freedom-Philippines (OEF-P), U.S. special operators worked with Filipino security forces primarily to battle Abu Sayyaf , an Islamist terrorist group within the archipelago, and Jemaah Islamiyah , a regional Islamist terrorist organization. Both had ties to Al Qaeda and sought to attack security forces and kill or kidnap civilians, especially foreigners, throughout the region. USAF Special Operations PC-12 in Niger in 2012., Sputniktilt/wikicommons During the year, the PC-12s flew cargo and personnel to and from forward bases and other sites around the country’s southern region. In total, the crews moved more than 3,100 passengers and delivered more than 230,000 pounds of cargo. OEF-P officially ended in 2015, but the Pentagon continues to support the Philippines counter-terrorism campaigns. From bases in Germany, additional PC-12s performed similar duties across Europe and Africa . Compared to their activities in the Philippines, the planes flew just 133 sorties and moved 27,000 pounds of cargo. Many of these missions were to or from Entebbe International Airport in Uganda. This was the hub of the American mission to aid African troops across four countries in their effort to break the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group and hopefully apprehend its enigmatic leader, Joseph Kony. For more than two decades, Kony and his group had perpetrated a reign of terror across Central Africa, becoming especially known for abducting hundreds of children to fight as child soldiers or serve as sex slaves. In October 2011, President Barack Obama approved plans to send special operators to advise and assist local forces and provide logistical support – including aerial mobility with military planes like the PC-12s and contractor-operated aircraft – as part of Operation Observant Compass . Special tactics airmen secure the area around a C-145A during a training exercise., USAF The C-145s were less active, but no less vital to special operations forces activities. In January 2011, the 318th sent a detachment of Combat Coyotes to support operations in Afghanistan. On Dec. 18, 2011, one of the aircraft veered off a short, dirt-strip runway near the town of Qalat and flipped over. Though no one was injured, the plane was a total loss. The rest of the aircraft continued flying in the Central Asian country until May 2012. During the deployment, crews dropped more than 3,200 pounds of supplies onto forward operating bases and unloaded more than 345,000 more pounds of equipment and gear on the ground. Afterwards, they moved to Uganda to participate in Observant Compass missions, shuttling more than 100,000 pounds of cargo and nearly 250 passengers to remote sites in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan. In addition, both types of aircraft flew sorties in Latin America from Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras. This had been the site of the 318th’s first operational deployment in 2009 and the squadron had maintained a steady presence at the base afterward. Though the 2012 history does not explain what mission the aircraft supported in the region, it is likely the planes moved cargo and personnel around as part of both counter-drug and counter-terrorism operations. The Pentagon has been actively involved in fighting drug trafficking in both Central and South America since the 1980s. USAF Then, in 2008, U.S. Southern Command also kicked off a push against international terrorism in the region, dubbed Operation Enduring Freedom- Caribbean, Central America (OEF-CCA). American commanders in the region expressed concerns that Islamist terrorist groups could be working and trading weapons and knowledge with drug cartels. A U.S. special operations task force coordinated this effort from Soto Cano. The 318th’s activities were much the same the next year. The 318th “compiled 8,544 flight hours with 4,500 of those hours in support of joint special operations forces on five separate continents,” the 2013 historical review of operations across the 27th noted. From Entebbe, C-145s brought more than 135,000 pounds of fuel to forward sites to support teams tracking Kony and his fighters. In another instance, the planes moved 1,600 pounds of ammunition to help a joint special operations element in a remote location somewhere in Central Africa. On top of that, the Combat Coyotes began dropping leaflets imploring LRA members to abandon the group and rejoin society, reportedly generating 30 defectors in one month of operations. In Europe, the squadron’s PC-12 helped bring in equipment to set up a new airstrip to support the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.  Another one of the aircraft raced to an unspecified location in Latin America to take an injured U.S. Army diver from a location in the field to a a proper hospital. One of the 318th’s U-28As, which is a fully militarized version of the PC-12., USAF But at the same time, the 318th was experiencing significant changes. The Air Force had decided to stop flying PC-12s and move the C-145s to the 6th Special Operations Squadron. The service began converting the Pilatus planes into fully militarized U-28A spy planes and returned them to the 318th. While the U-28s can perform short-range airlift missions and even small airdrops, their main job is surveillance using day- and night-vision cameras. For this mission, they have data links, improved radios, and added defensive countermeasures, too. In September 2016, the unit flew its last PC-12 mission and became fully focused on the new intelligence gathering mission. The 6th Special Operations Squadron still has Combat Coyotes, but uses them as part of its worldwide efforts to train and advise friendly air arms. As of 2017, the 524th Special Operations Squadron, with its more capable C-146s, is the only unit left performing light SOF mobility duties. These innocuous aircraft continue to be a critical part of discreet American military operations around the world. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Paul Nickell And Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",A Tomcat Pilot’s Early Struggles to Tame the Mighty F-14,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fighter pilot-in-training Paul Nickell made it through the rigors of primary and advanced flight training to earn his coveted wings of gold—and an assignment to fly what was then the Navy’s newest and most complex fighter, the F-14A Tomcat. Going from the spritely TA-4J Skyhawk to Grumman’s fleet defender would prove to be a bigger challenge than Paul imagined, and the aircraft’s unique handling qualities during landing were a beast that he had to quickly learn to control in order for his dream of flying Navy fighters to finally come true. In this the fourth and final installment of our in-depth series recounting Paul’s time at the stick of an F-16N , flying as a Topgun student and as an instructor , and deploying on his first cruise with the Tomcat , we see what it took to begin his career as a fighter pilot, and the rocky start of his love affair with the most iconic fighter jet of all time. Mastering the Skyhawk I joined the navy with no previous flight training. However, I had flown several times in small aircraft, including the T-34B on several occasions with Navy recruiters. For someone with no flying experience, Navy flight training is very difficult. Early on, you’re being exposed to so many new things that it is simply overwhelming. By the time I started advanced jet training in the TA-4J Skyhawk, things had changed. I knew how to fly, navigate, adhere to ATC procedures, and it was just a matter of learning a new jet. Also the syllabus started to focus on more tactical missions such as low level flying, bombing, strafing, and air combat maneuvering (ACM). It was just a taste of all the excitement to come. The TA-4J was a great aircraft to fly. It was a two seat version of a real combat aircraft, the A-4 Skyhawk, a workhorse of the Vietnam War. It was small and agile, boasting a 720 degree per second roll rate which would bang your helmet on the side of the canopy if you slammed the stick to the side. It was a tight cockpit, which fit like a glove. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Once strapped in with the canopy closed, your shoulders were touching the sides of the canopy rails. You felt like you were a part of the jet—the two of you were one. One of the beauties of the TA-4 was that in the approach environment, it flew exactly like what you were taught to think a navy jet should fly like. Attitude controlled airspeed and power controlled rate of descent. So once you got it trimmed in pitch, it pretty much maintained that speed. If you started to see a change in glideslope from the meatball, you simply made the appropriate power correction to return to a centered ball. I loved flying it, and the way that it flew. By the time I completed the advanced jet training syllabus, culminating in six traps ( ed. note: a “trap” is an arrested carrier landing ) aboard USS Lexington (CV16), I was extremely comfortable and confident flying a true navy carrier aircraft, especially in the landing environment. However, the skills that I had mastered flying the TA-4 would to some extent come back to haunt me as I moved on to the mighty F-14A Tomcat. Teething Tomcat After earning my wings of gold, I reported to the west coast F-14 replacement air group (RAG)—VF-124 at NAS Miramar. It was a great time to be in the navy in San Diego! The anti-military sentiment that had existed through the latter part of the Vietnam war and beyond was dying off as we rolled into the Reagan years. I had several months before I started F-14 training. During that time I completed an instrument refresher course with VF-126 flying in the back seat, once again in the TA-4J, and also spin and out of control flight training in the T-2C Buckeye. Additionally I accomplished my Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape training, otherwise known as SERE school. To this day, I still have copies of my SERE school completion letter to ensure that I never have to go through it again! AP Finally I started F-14 training. After weeks of ground school and simulators for this complex aircraft, it was finally time to man up an actual F-14 and go fly. Even though the F-14 was a two seat aircraft, there were no trainer versions. No F-14s had flight controls in the back seat, only weapons system controllers. So your first flight in the jet was essentially a solo. For your first two flights you were scheduled with an F-14 instructor pilot in the back seat, but he could only talk to you, he could not fly the aircraft from there. But not to worry, statistically the odds were good that nothing would go wrong on that first flight or two. I’ll never forget walking out to the jet for my first F-14 flight. Compared to anything I had flown before, it was huge, and it was awesome looking! We preflighted the aircraft, manned up, and after starting the engines, completed about 10 minutes of systems and control checks. After that it was a short five minute taxi to Runway 24 Right and we were ready to go. We made our way onto the runway and as I lined up on centerline, we were cleared for takeoff. I held the brakes, ran the engines up to full military power, then released the brakes and lit the afterburners. We began to accelerate rapidly and within seconds we were approaching 80 knots. Suddenly there was a huge boom and the jet immediately started veering to the left. Even though it was my first takeoff, it was obvious to me that things were not going well. I jerked the throttles back to idle, deployed the speed brakes, and started manually braking while correcting back to runway centerline. We slowed, cleared the runway, and taxied back to our ramp. The F-14 had ramps in each engine intake that were hydraulically driven down at high mach numbers to reduce the area of the intake. It turned out that the left ramp intake had incorrectly deployed as we were on our takeoff roll, causing the left engine to enter into a compressor stall and lose thrust. Sucking a ramp down was not a common occurrence with the F-14, and with over 1100 hours in the Tomcat, it only happened to me one time…on my first takeoff roll! Wrestling the Turkey Bird to the Ground Because of aircraft availability and due to other phases of training having higher priority for the jets, it ended up being several days before my first actual flight. Fortunately this time there were no problems on the takeoff roll. The big thing on the first flight was to go supersonic, not that there was really much to it. The F-14 would easily go supersonic and within the cockpit you noticed very little. As you approached mach one, the acceleration rate would decrease somewhat, and then as you went through the number, the acceleration rate would increase again. After 30-40 minutes of familiarizing myself with the handling of the F-14 in the Southern California Warning Area of San Diego, we headed back to Miramar with plenty of gas to do multiple touch and go’s. Courtesy of Paul Nickell With all of the different training phases required to master the varied weapons systems of the F-14, the phase that washed the most pilots out of the syllabus was carrier qualifications (CQ). It didn’t matter how well you could fight and employ the weapons systems of the jet, if you couldn’t get back aboard the ship, you were not going the fly the F-14. For that reason, emphasis on carrier type landings started with your first flight, and continued until your last night trap and completion of the CQ phase. Returning to Miramar, we smoked into the break at the standard 325 knots, made a crisp roll to almost 90 degrees of bank, and pulled about five Gs in a decelerating turn to downwind. Quickly slowing, I configured for landing and rattled through the before landing checklist. I had all of the pattern altitude gouge numbers and landmarks firmly committed to memory and flew them as precisely as possible so that I would roll into the groove with a centered meatball and a good start for the approach. At Miramar, Runway 24 Left was a shorter runway and was usually used for touch and go’s. It had a meatball and a carrier deck landing area painted on it. As the wings came level I noticed that the ball was starting to go slightly high, so I reduced the power, but after several seconds the ball was getting higher and I was starting to get indications of being slightly slow. I tried giving it a little more time, but the situation only got worse. AP Finally I pushed the nose down and the ball started to come down and we got back on speed. As we approached a centered ball I added power to slow the descent, but very quickly we were getting low and fast. These cycles continued down to an uneventful touch and go and then a turn to downwind for another approach. After seven to eight more touch and go’s, we were down to 2,000 pounds of fuel remaining, and it was time for a full stop landing. By this time I was beginning to realize that the techniques and motor skills that had worked so well for me in the TA-4J were not working so well in the F-14. The Tomcat was definitely a different jet to land. It had a lot of lift when fully configured to land, especially with no missiles, rails, or external fuel tanks. The old adage of “attitude controls airspeed and power controlled rate of descent” didn’t work the same way in the F-14. If you wanted to change the rate of descent, it needed a power correction, but you also had to nudge the nose up or down some to get a quicker response to the power change. To help with this, it had a system called Direct Lift Control, or DLC. In the landing configuration you pushed a button on the side of the stick to engage DLC. It caused all of the spoilers on the top of the wings to extend slightly. Once engaged, there was a small thumb wheel on the stick, spring loaded to centered, that you could roll forward to cause the spoilers to raise higher and cause the aircraft to “elevator down.” If you rolled the wheel aft, the spoilers would go down causing the aircraft to “elevator up.”  DLC up was not very effective, but DLC down would help as you got close to the ground and started to flatten out in ground effect. USN Needless to say, the jet was large and had a lot of moving parts when coming aboard the boat. Because of it’s tendency to slide around laterally in the groove, some called it the “frisbee.” Lineup was difficult to maintain, especially at night, yet it was critical due to it’s large wingspan. Because of it’s size and many moving flight control surfaces flapping around on an approach, most called it the “turkey.” After 6-7 flights I was starting to get much more comfortable in the Tomcat. The next flight was what we called an FCLP hop, which stood for Field Carrier Landing Practice. The difference now was that instead of myself and the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) I was flying with being the judge of my landings, a fully qualified Landing Signal Officer (LSO) would be out by the runway grading every landing. All of the pilots in my class went out and got in 8 to 10 touch and go’s, or what we called “bounces.” Once complete, we all waited in the squadron ready room for the LSO to come in and individually debrief us. When it came to my turn, the LSO informed me that he was giving me an UNSAT (unsatisfactory) grade for my landings, otherwise known as a “down.”  I was surprised, but accepted it from someone who had a lot of experience with carrier landings. I had made it all the way through the training command and gotten my wings without any UNSATs, so needless to say this was difficult to swallow. But realistically I knew that I was struggling to land the F-14 well. Old Habits Die Hard When my brain got overloaded with flying the jet on the approach, it would revert back to what had worked well for me in the TA-4, “first learned/best remembered,” and that just didn’t hack it in the Tomcat. Several weeks later, after mentally recovering from the down, I flew one of my last FAM (familiarization stage) flights on a Friday afternoon. When we returned to the ready room, it was desolate. My RIO instructor sat down and informed me that he was giving me an UNSAT for my landings because as I came through the 45 and rolled into the groove on one landing, he saw the ball go from high on the lens to low on the lens. To me, this was devastating! After eight to ten landings, I couldn’t even remember seeing that, but I was in no place to argue. He started telling me that not everyone was cutout to be a pilot, and at that point I pretty much tuned him out. I had worked way too hard and come way too far, straight from the flight training to the F-14 RAG, to start thinking I couldn’t hack it now. I later learned that this RIO had originally started out in pilot training, washed out, and then went through Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training, and ended up as an F-14 RIO. Maybe that was his course, but it wasn’t going to be mine. I spent a miserable weekend in beautiful San Diego, knowing what Monday would bring. I hadn’t been the only one in my class of seven pilots to receive a down during the earlier FCLP period, but this second down for landings really put me up on the rig-line—highly visible for the wrong reasons—a place that I did not want to be! I knew that word of my second down for landings would spread quickly through my class, and I was embarrassed to walk in to the squadron on Monday morning. Fortunately my class leader was a great guy and what we called a RIO retread. He had previously been an F-4 and F-14 RIO who after his first sea tour had gone back through pilot training, and was now checking out an an F-14 pilot. We talked a good bit and he was nothing but positive, giving me great encouragement. I also sat down and talked to the two squadron LSOs, one of which was the one who had given me the first down from the FCLP period, and they also were very positive. F-14A over the farms of Southern California. , USN They decided to get me a couple of extra FCLP periods, no pressure, just to let me relax and fine tune things. No one ever insinuated that I was dangerous, but the reality is that there’s a huge difference in not being dangerous landing on a 14,000 foot runway, and being ready to go land on an aircraft carrier in the day, much less at night. In one of the extra FCLP periods, the LSO who had downed me earlier actually rode in the backseat of the F-14 I was flying to see if he could determine any trends that I needed to correct. We even turned the air system in the jet off to minimize cockpit noise so that he could hear the engines as I worked the throttles. At the end of those two periods, both LSOs were satisfied that I was making good progress and should continue on to the next phase of training, while getting as many landings at the end of each training flight as possible. Both of those LSOs were great guys, and I started spending more time with them, picking their brains for every tidbit I could get about landing the F-14. They also let me to start coming out to the LSO platform when they were waving other classes to see what landings looked like from that perspective. Maybe that would help me when I was landing the F-14. Even “Basic” Tomcat Training Can be Deadly The next phase of F-14 training was basic Intercepts. On one of the hops, my instructor RIO and I went out into the warning area to fly intercepts against a TA-4J. In the briefing he told me about a way to do a vertical intercept. Normally on an intercept you would come in with possibly some vertical separation, but in particular with lateral offset so that you would have room to turn and join or attack, depending on the mission. For the vertical intercept he had the A-4 come in at about 10,000 feet and we were somewhere above 15,000 feet, at about 325 knots. We had no lateral offset—a 180 degree out pass. At a certain range he instructed me to roll inverted and start my pull down so as to roll out behind the TA-4. The problem was that I had yet to visually acquired the TA-4 and was very concerned about blindly pulling down into him. As a result I pulled very easily and as the nose came down with a light G pull, the F-14 started to accelerate rapidly. I never acquired the TA-4 visually and by about 10,000 feet I had a bigger problem on my hands. I was now pointed straight down, supersonic, and accelerating. Courtesy of Paul Nickell By then I realized that it was time to pull and pull hard! The marine cloud layer off the coast of southern California usually came up to about 2,000 feet above the water. I don’t remember what altitude we descended to, what our speed was, or how many Gs we pulled, but we were down in the marine cloud layer when we finally bottomed out and started climbing again. My heart was pounding, and it was quiet in the cockpit. I’m sure it scared the instructor RIO also, but he never really mentioned it. He knew how to do the vertical attack from his perspective, but there were some things I needed to know from a pilot’s perspective that were never briefed. I learned some very valuable lessons that day! It’s interesting how old fighter pilots’ “funny stories” often involve a brush with death. That was a close one, but not my closest. That was yet to come. Learning to Fight in the F-14 The last phase of training prior to carrier quals was the ACM/Tactics phase. The early flights were one F-14 verses one bogey (1 V 1). The bogey’s were usually an A-4 simulating a MIG-17 or an F-5 simulating a MIG-21. Usually they were flown by VF-126, Topgun, or VFC-13. The F-14 could easily defeat either one of these adversaries, if the Tomcat was flown correctly, and especially when it employed its forward quarter missile capability. However, it was very easy to get suckered into a slow speed, high angle of attack fight, at which the A-4 in particular excelled. Even when you knew that the bogey was bleeding off his energy to intimidate you, if you weren’t extremely disciplined about flying your jet by the numbers, you’d find yourself in a slow speed fight, otherwise known as “groveling.”  Once in a groveling match, a successful “bug out” was about all you could hope for. The best pilots in the 1 V 1 arena knew the appropriate game plans for the different threats, could feel the jet’s performance by the way it was handling, and were very disciplined when being intimidated by aggressive bogeys. It took time for most of us to master all of these attributes. Once we had basic maneuvering of the aircraft mastered, the phase continued with 2 V 1, 1 V 2, 2 V 2, and then 2 V Unknown scenarios. In these flights, the RIOs were much more involved, because most of these engagements would begin with about a 30 mile intercept. The RIO’s ran the intercept until the fighters were in the visual arena, and then the pilots took it from there. One of the most challenging aspects was communication. You had two pilots and two RIO’s with two radios and an intercom within each aircraft. Additionally there was usually an Air Intercept Controller (AIC) on the primary frequency. This AIC might be land based, on a ship at sea, or in an aircraft such as an E-2C or AWACS. We worked a great deal on comm discipline. Using standard terminology and being brief and specific (comm brevity) could make a huge of difference in the Situational Awareness (SA) that you at the merge. E-2 Hawkeye, F-14 Tomcat, F-5 Tiger II and the A-4 Skyhawk over Southern California circa the 1980s—three of the four aircraft shown Paul would end up flying. , USN One of the problems with the Tomcat was that depending on what radar modes the RIO was using, often the pilot had no visual display in the cockpit of the tactical situation. To make matters worse, if the RIO was using a mode which allowed the pilot to see the radar picture, the pilot’s 5 inch square repeater display was located low in the cockpit and directly behind the stick grip. On top of that, if the RIO did not zoom the range scale in as you approached the merge, the pilot would be looking at the entire tactical picture in about one square inch on the display. Consequently, most of the pilots tactical SA approaching the merge was based upon a verbal description between the RIOs and the AIC. Pre-merge, depending on the weapons loadout and rules of engagement (ROE), we would simulate forward quarter missile shots, but in those days generally we did not call “kills” based upon those shots. Arriving at the merge, the pilots pretty much took over from a comm, maneuvering, and weapons employment standpoint. RIOs would shift their attention more to defensive lookout and helping the pilot maintain good tactical SA through inter-cockpit communication. Overall the ACM/Tactics phase went very well. It was demanding, challenging, exhilarating, and very rewarding. By the time it was complete, I felt like I had a good handle on how to employ the F-14 as a true air-to-air fighter. Landing on an Island in the Pacific Before a Carrier in the Pacific The final phase of F-14 training had finally arrived—carrier qualifications. To complete the phase, we would get two daytime touch and goes, ten daytime arrested landings (traps), and six night traps. Prior to going to the carrier, which for me would be the USS Constellation (CV-64), we would accomplish 8-10 FCLP periods getting 8-10 practice approach/landings during each period. We started with a day period at Miramar and from then on about all of the remaining periods were at night. A few were at Miramar, but most were either at NAF El Centro or out on San Clemente island off the coast of San Diego. Both of these airports were much more challenging than Miramar because they were in more remote and darker areas—more like a ship at sea. San Clemente was particularly challenging. Usually there would be four to five aircraft there flying around a radar pattern with very little help from a ground based controller. Often times at the pattern altitude we were in the marine cloud layer, with the RIOs using the F-14’s AWG-9 radar to keep us clear of each other. And it was dark out there. You would come out of the clouds and see nothing but the lighted carrier deck landing area outlined on the runway, and the meatball. It was a complete black hole. It was by far the closest thing I’ve ever experienced to an aircraft carrier landing, except that it sat on a 100 foot plus cliff of bedrock as opposed to a pitching, rolling, and heaving hunk of steel in the sea. If any place could prepare you for the boat, San Clemente was it. An A-7 refuels a Tomcat at dusk., Courtest of Paul Nickell I eked my way through the FCLP periods, surviving one period at a time. I was definitely getting more comfortable landing the Tomcat, but old habits die hard, and at times in the heat of battle, I would revert to them. Finally at the end of the FCLP periods the LSOs informed me that I would be going to the boat for day quals, and if that went ok, night quals as well. My assigned RIO for this final phase of training was an experienced fleet RIO who was now an instructor at the RAG. His callsign was “Chief.” Chief was my rock through the CQ phase. He flew with me through all of the FCLP periods, and was always positive and supportive. He didn’t try to teach me to be a pilot, but he would offer me his observations and let me try to figure out how to make changes. Over time we developed a great rapport. Time to Head to the Boat Finally my day CQ period arrived. Chief and I manned up and launched out to meet up with the “Connie” which was working 40-50 miles west of San Diego. The weather was Case II which meant that there was an overcast layer of clouds, so we would end up holding away from the ship until they had room in the pattern for us. Eventually they called us in, giving us a vector toward the carrier and we began our descent through the cloud layer. Five to six miles behind the ship I had it in sight. We went into the break at 800 feet, 350 knots. Just as at the field, we turned, slowed, and dirtied up for the approach, only leaving the hook up for the first touch and go. Although this would be my first carrier landing in the F-14, I had the experience of four touch and go’s and ten traps in the T-2C and TA-4J, so this wasn’t a completely new experience. The touch and go’s went relatively well, and after the second, we got a call from the LSO on the radio telling us to drop the hook. I did and successfully trapped on the next pass. Courtesy of Paul Nickell After four or five cat shots and traps, they spun us around into an area between the island and landing area known as the six pack to refuel us. After refueling, I completed the remainder of my ten traps. As we taxied up to the catapult for a shot back to the beach, the LSO came up on the radio, gave me a verbal pat on the back, and told me that they’d see me back tonight for night quals. To this day, I can still remember the boost in confidence that that radio call gave me. I still had night quals to go, but for the first time since my confidence was shattered back in the FAM phase, I was starting to feel better about my landing abilities and thought that I might actually successfully complete F-14 carrier quals. We blasted off, returned to Miramar, and rested three to four hours before heading back out to the boat. Courtesy of Paul Nickell The Night is Dark and Full of Surprises That evening we arrived back in the holding pattern, known as the marshall stack, at our scheduled time and commenced holding. We held for about an hour, and finally we were called down. As opposed to the day visual pattern around the ship, night approaches are flown as a straight in approach from well aft of the ship with some approach control guidance and also instrument approach guidance. I slowed and configured on schedule and by three to four miles out I could see the illuminated landing area. Some F-4 Phantoms were also carrier qualling and as we were switched to the final radio frequency. A Phantom crew that was heading for the beach asked for a burner cat shot and climb. My mind was so busy that the call pretty much went in one ear and out the other. By now we had called the ball at three quarters of a mile and I was completely absorbed in meatball, line-up, and angle of attack.  All of a sudden there was a bright blueish white light illuminating from ahead of the landing area and then up it zoomed through the sky. I immediately thought something had happened on the carrier deck and that I would soon be waved off. That momentary diversion of my attention allowed me to get slightly low. I got an LSO call for “a little power” followed a few seconds later by a “POWER” call. I responded to both, but not enough, and the next call was “WAVE OFF!” Away I went, turning downwind for another approach. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Night carrier quals were not starting off well for me. I got a call on downwind from the LSOs saying that they needed to see a more positive response to their calls from me, and I made up my mind that they would definitely get what they wanted. The next pass went better, with no burner cat shots, and me responding to the LSO’s appropriately. It ended with my first night trap! Immediately the next challenge confronted me, taxiing around on the flight deck at night. It was eerily illuminated by orangish flood lights from the island, so that if you were in that area, you could pretty much see what was happening with aircraft and personnel. Strangely though on approach, you noticed none of this illumination, only the lighted outline of the landing area. As you taxied  away from the island toward the extremities of the deck, everything was dark, including the taxi directors—except for their illuminated wands. As I taxied around the pitching, rolling deck with other aircraft also moving, at times it was almost impossible to tell if I was moving or if other aircraft were moving. At one point, while waiting to taxi onto the catapult, I was holding the brakes and my knees were shaking so badly that I finally had to set the parking brake and relax them for a few seconds. I don’t known if it was fear, stress, or just from mashing the brakes so hard for so long, but later, even after two cruises and over 100 night traps, the same thing would happen if I sat for very long at night holding the brakes. I think I just exerted so much energy mashing the brakes, for fear of unknowingly taxiing over the side of the flight deck into the black abyss of the night sea. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Finally I was directed onto the catapult for my first night cat shot. Boom, the catapult fired, and after a couple of seconds of tremendous acceleration, we were heaved off the deck into total darkness. Once again we were vectored around the pattern. My next five passes all resulted in successful traps. After the last one, the LSOs came up on the radio and congratulated me and told me that my F-14 carrier qualification was complete. They said they would see me back on the beach for my debrief. Finally after many months, the monkey was off my back. Chief and I returned to Miramar and landed on the 14,000 foot runway there. What a difference in so many ways than the boat! Clearing the runway, Chief called on our squadron frequency to let them know we were on deck. The reply was, “welcome back page boy.”  We were both confused, and when Chief queried them, we realized that they were telling me that I had received orders to VF-24. “Page Boy” was a call sign that had been assigned to VF-24 flights years before, but had long since disappeared. Any time someone wanted to get under the skin of a VF-24 pilot, they would bring up the page boy call sign. It didn’t bother me one bit, I was going to be a VF-24 Fighting Renegade!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 14, 2019",The Mysterious Case Of The F-117 Nighthawk’s Flip-Down Radar Locators,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 continues to be one of the most intriguing aircraft ever built, even nearly a decade after it was retired, and close to 30 years after it was originally unveiled to the public. From the Nighthawk’s “cloaking device ” to its “ toxic death” paint job , it seem like some of the most interesting aspects of the F-117’s story are the small bits that have largely gone unreported. Maybe one of the most obscure and enigmatic details of the “Black Jet” is an elusive component called the Radar Locating System (RLS). For an aircraft that survives on its stealthy shape and coatings, these flip-down antenna arrays seem to deviate drastically from the F-117’s modus operandi. But then again, the impetus for their existence may make more sense than not—that is if they really existed at all. The F-117’s Radar Locating System consists (as far as we know) of a pair of small planar antenna farms located under the aircraft’s wings, about ten feet from the wing roots, near their leading edges. The idea behind the system seems to have been that the F-117 pilot, who would normally retract all the jet’s antennas when moving into hostile territory to minimize its radar reflectivity, could activate the system and its antennas would pop down into the airstream. Once deployed, they would work as a radar homing and warning receiver (RHWR), not only notifying the pilot of the an enemy radar’s presence and type, but also its direction and maybe even its general location. Based on some accounts, the RLS seems to have been more about using the F-117 for the destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) role than just avoiding enemy emitters, and was possibly part of a program that aimed to see the F-117 dynamically go after radar and SAM sites as a secondary mission set. Based on the information available, it may have also had a recording function and could have given the aircraft a secondary signals intelligence collection capability as well. The only picture of the RLS available., James Goodall The picture above is credited to James Goodall—if you don’t own James’s books, make sure to buy them , and a new one on nuclear fast attack subs is coming out this summer. It is a rare photo of this elusive system. According to one source, the array appears to be set up for spiral omni-directional electronic support measures (ESM) antennas, roughly 50mm in diameter, which are typical for 0.2-18GHZ surveillance coverage, and they can be specifically tuned to different bands. Because of their wide spacing on each side of the jet’s wings, the two sensor blocks/arrays coupled with the forward motion of the jet would provide direction finding ability. In other words, at least the threat emitter’s bearing could be identified, and possibly its range. This would be especially useful for finding and attacking newer road-mobile SAM systems like the S-300 and SA-11 that were emerging at the same time the F-117 was operating under high secrecy in the Nevada desert . USAF Today some of the most powerful capabilities that a combat aircraft possesses, especially the stealth kind like the F-22 and F-35, are their abilities to detect, classify and geolocate threat emitters and other components of an enemy’s integrated air defense systems (IADS) . This is done via antennas placed all around the aircraft, under its stealthy skin. These conformal arrays are tied to high-speed computers that use interferometry, a large threat library, and other methods to give pilots—and even other aircraft connected via data-link within the battlespace—a real time tactical “picture” of the electronic order of battle around them. RLS seems like a very early and somewhat poorly conceived attempt to give the F-117 a fraction of this capability. Because conformal arrays and their composite coverings were not available at the time, the flip-down method was likely used. The likely problem with the system was that it drastically increased the F-117’s radar cross section when in use, as its flip-down antennas compromised the jet’s smooth ventral surface. This is an especially bad attribute when it comes to maintaining a very low radar cross section for the critical forward hemisphere of the aircraft. The likely result was the F-117’s radar signature bloomed drastically when the RLS was activated. As such, the system would not only blow the Nighthawk’s cover, but it would also turn it into a target. Not just that, but it would have only offered a “snapshot” of the electronic threat environment around the F-117 at any given time. That’s because the system would need to be retracted quickly, or it would turn the jet into a sitting duck while operating in enemy airspace. By most accounts, it seems that the system was either just part of a test series, or was only used for a very limited amount of time operationally, and how many jets it was installed on remains an unknown—that is if it ever existed at all. USAF Some veteran F-117 maintainers seem to remember the quirky RLS trap doors pretty well. They even have mentioned that they were known to sag, which would not only hurt the jet’s stealth capabilities, but on dark nights that often were prime operations time for F-117 missions, partially opened RLS doors could be a hazard for maintainers foreheads. Not just that, but the RLS is prominently featured in the F-117’s “Dash One” operating manual. It is not only mentioned, and its abandoned control panel identified, but its location is also shown clearly in a diagram of the jet. You can see the mentions below, and the entire manual is available online here . Some of the snippets from the F-117’s Dash-1 that talk about the RLS. , F-117 Dash Manual It has been noted that by 2006, the system was not listed in official hazard and crash responders documents which are posted online here . The diagram showing the RLS doors are still there, but it does not identify it as being something that is accessible like the rest of the aircraft’s retractable antenna, so it seems as if the doors were permanently sealed or filled-in at some point in time. This could have occurred during a depot overhaul or upgrade. While we have a picture, written and first hand accounts of the Radar Locator System, it seems that its existence is still highly doubted by some—including the man that largely oversaw the development of the jet—senior Skunk Works engineer and F-117 program manager Alan Brown. USAF I chatted at length with Mr. Brown about the F-117 and this obscure, and let’s face it, mysterious feature. He was as puzzled as I was. After sending him the picture of it, he was kind enough to respond with his conclusions: “This picture doesn’t look like anything that was ever put on a F-117A airplane, and as such I am inclined to discount the story entirely. The only possibility to my mind is that the USAF made the modification themselves without Lockheed’s knowledge, but that itself is impossible for me to believe, knowing how well we followed up with the airplane in the field. Lockheed Skunk Works always had a cradle-to-grave philosophy in terms of follow-up with its products in service.” Mr. Brown was even nice enough to contact his successor as F-117 program manager, Sherm Mullin, to see what his thoughts were about the RLS enigma. His reply was just about the same as Mr. Brown’s, stating that “it was never put on the F-117, period.” Although he did mention that it could have been a concept from a study that occurred from 1984 to 1985 that apparently went off the rails conceptually and was disbanded with prejudice as a result. USAF During roughly that same time period it is known, although not well documented publicly, that the F-117 was tested with some fairly elaborate modifications. This supposedly included a handful of sensor systems in addition to the jet’s stock Infrared Acquisition And Designation System (IRADS). We know that a passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar was flown on one F-117 in a specially-built radome fitted on the Nighthawk’s iconic wedge-like nose. Maybe RLS was one of the other mods that was deemed successful, and was accommodated for in some F-117s built, but never fully installed. Still, you would think that even something as useless as an empty-flip down antenna array would be well known by the F-117s top engineers and program managers. So there you have it, the obscure mystery of the F-117’s funky little flip-down Radar Locator System. For a jet that was made famous for its work during Desert Storm , it is really amazing that we are still finding new peculiarities of its design and genesis to discuss. Then again, the jet was so exotic for its time and its deep classification added massively to its murky lore—not to mention it has off-the-charts techno-sinister looks—that really it is mystery personified. The fact that it is still flying, and we are still wondering as to its applications , even after it left front line service almost a decade ago, goes to show you that the F-117 is a mystery machine at heart that just won’t die.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 1, 2020","USAF’s Deadliest F-16 Pilot Talks F-15 Retirement, Syria, and Pilot Shortage","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Often referred to as the deadliest F-16 pilot, outspoken best selling author Dan Hampton is back to discuss a wide range of issues. Last time we talked , our conversation ranged from women in the cockpit to employing his beloved F-16 to kill the enemy. This time around we cover everything from the USAF’s plan to keep a portion of its F-16s flying until 2048, to the service’s pilot retention woes, to America’s strategy in Iraq. As usual, “Two Dogs” has strong views, and is unafraid to share them. Hampton wrote one of the best air combat memoirs of all time, Viper Pilot , and has had continued success as an author with Lords of Sky and The Hunter Killers . He also writes a a well-reviewed fiction series based on the mercenary pilot mysteriously known as the Sandman. With his upcoming book about Charles Lindbergh’s historic voyage—aptly titled The Flight —set for release next month, Hampton spent nearly an hour talking The War Zone. It was a lively discussion, to say the least. Bold italics are the author’s questions, Dan Hampton’s responses are seen in normal text: The United States Air Force is looking to replace the F-15C/D fleet with existing F-16s upgraded with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The plan has been viewed as highly controversial. What are your thoughts on using modernized F-16s to fill the role that is currently filled by the F-15C/D Eagle fleet? Well, we could spend 45 minutes talking about the Air Force and its collective lack of leadership, but it kind of goes to that. Here on the one hand they’re pushing the F-35, and possibly an upgraded F-22, and yet they don’t want to get rid of older 1970s vintage F-15s, right? That’s because for a long time the Air Force was run by what’s called the Eagle Mafia, which were the guys that always wanted to be the white scarf in the wind, air-to-air dog fighting kings. Unfortunately that pretty much went out with Vietnam. You could even argue that it went out with Korea. But they never really grasped that fact, so they never really thought too much of aircraft that did air-to-ground missions or swing-role airplanes like the F-16 that were quite capable of doing their single air-to-air mission, and close air support, and all the other stuff that multi-role fighters do. F-16 and F-15 aggressors over the Nellis Range Complex. The F-15 has already been retired form the adversary role. , USAF I think the situation is illustrating a lot of the issues with the Air Force, and I think the F-16 is more than capable. Northrup Grumman has an APG-80 AESA radar (used on the Block 60 F-16E/F) and their new SABR ( APG-83 Scaleable Agile Beam Radar ) for the F-16. The only thing the Eagle can do that the F-16 can’t do is it can carry more weapons. But then again if the weapons are so much more accurate and dependable now, then what’s the point? I mean, I watched an Eagle shoot off six AIM-7s in the first Gulf War and five of them just dropped off the wings and fell to the ground. So carrying more weapons isn’t necessarily a good thing if the weapons don’t work. Now an AIM-7 is not an AIM-120 obviously, but the principle is the same. With an F-16 you get a very active, very versatile fighter in conjunction with some sort of AESA radar. Then you can get away with carrying six missiles and you don’t need ten, right? These upgraded F-16s would include about 300 Block 40 and 50 jets already in service, and the AESA upgrade would likely go along with the structural and avionics upgrades. So it kind of gives us new life in the F-16. The USAF says they would fly the type till 2048 under the plan— but potentially at the expense of the F-15C/D fleet. You’re along the right track, and airplanes and equipment are so expensive these days. Almost prohibitively so. But you can’t afford to keep a bunch of aging F-15s around for sentimental purposes and that’s essentially what they’re doing. They’re not needed. When was the last time there was a big dogfight? We had some air-to-air action in the first Gulf War but I wouldn’t really call it dog fighting when they’re shooting them down with BVR missiles from 15 miles away. I would say the money is better spent on multirole aircraft that can swing from mission-to-mission as required. What are your thoughts on the USAF’s initiative to possibly field light air support aircraft like the A-29 Super Tucano or AT-6 Coyote? And what do you think about the close air support fly-off that is still planned between the F-35 and the A-10? I think it’s yet another glaring example of those in charge who just don’t really get it. And here’s what I mean. An F-35 costs upwards of, what, over $100 million each? Yeah, it can do close air support and it’s a multirole fighter and that’s fine, but you’re never going to have enough of them to do the sort of dirty-hand grunt work, close air support stuff that at least I saw in the wars that I was a part of. There’s nothing wrong with the A-10 that can’t be solved by some upgrading and modernization, for crying out loud. I mean we’ve still got B-52s flying. B-52s took their first flight, what, over a decade before I was born. A-29 Super Tucano., USAF I would say this. Again money isn’t endless the way that it used to be. I would scrap the notion of an improved Raptor, whatever that means, because we definitely do not need single mission aircraft. And what were the numbers for the F-35, like 1,700 was what the Air Force contract called for? Yeah, 1,763 is the number the Air Force still has as a target. Yeah, at a $100 million each, that’s going to happen. So what you need is a mix. You need to keep the A-10s around as long as you can. I would have bought the Block 60 F-16E/F version for the U.S. Air Force. I flew that thing. It’s superb. Everything that we complained about for years has been fixed and it’s got the new and better version in it. But the Air Force didn’t buy it because they were in love with the Raptor and the F-35. Maybe somebody is going to look at this again and say, “well, you know what, maybe we were a bit hasty and we need some of each.” As far as the light aircraft thing, this is classic L et’s fight the last conflict mentality. And this is what makes the drone thing kind of dangerous, too. We haven’t had a real enemy to fight since 2003. I mean, an enemy that had MIGs and SAMs and Triple A. So we’ve gotten used to making do with drones plinking targets with little bombs—Hellfire missiles or whatever—and now the idea that, hey, what we really need is some sort of light attack turboprop. Well, okay, that will work against certain enemies, but the enemies that we’re going to have to fight later, I hope not sooner, they’re going to have MIGs, they’re going to have SAMs, they’re going to have anti-aircraft systems and IADS (Integrated Air Defense Systems). Those kinds of planes just aren’t going to live through it. F-16E Block 60 flown by the UAE. , Tyler Rogoway So I would say for the light attack stuff, you subcontract it. There’s plenty of mercenary companies out there, including mine, that do that sort of thing and we do it a lot cheaper and a lot easier and in fact better than the big military does. In fact, the Air Force is on its heels so badly at the moment that they’re going to end up contracting probably all of the adversary air requirements to private military companies , right? I would say stick with jets and high tech and research and development for the big threat and have enough aircraft of all kinds that you can use them if you need to. But keep in mind the private option for threats that don’t require such a big hammer, rather than swing the force all one way and then be left holding the bag open when you get hit in the face by Russia or China somewhere down the road. Does that make sense? Then you let the Russians and the Chinese bankrupt themselves trying to keep up with us technically which they’ve never been able to do. That’s what killed the Soviet Union to a large degree. They’ll never be able to do it and then that side of the force is ready to fight that war when and if it happens or at least act as a very sizable deterrent and you haven’t sacrificed anything in the meantime. Again, I don’t know where this current group of general officers and their ilk come from, but they didn’t come from the same place that I did. Do you see a high-end, penetrating, unmanned combat air vehicle — even if it’s just to go after fixed targets—as part of that concept? Yeah, and under certain circumstances I’m all for it. The strength of manned aircraft is in the tactical environment, okay. You’ve got a human who can think faster than a computer and react accordingly with all the right training and everything else that we use to have. We don’t have it so much anymore. The tactical environment is where manned aircraft really are king. You can use the unmanned stuff for the other things. To a large degree some of the strategic level attacks that we’d have to do, certainly stimulating IADS, that sort of thing. I mean all that stuff could be done, fixed targeting, hitting things that don’t move like buildings, bridges, etc. And again, leave the tactical stuff to the humans. The United States Air Force cannot retain pilots . It’s facing basically a crippling shortage of qualified air crews in the near term and the medium term. What can the United States Air Force do to make staying in its pilot cadre more attractive? Oh, boy. Yeah, you’re right. It’s to the danger level and people don’t realize that. I think most people don’t realize that you just can’t go get somebody off the street and toss them into an airplane. I mean, this takes years to learn how to do and these are people that have something that most others don’t have to begin with. I don’t know what that something is, I just know that it’s the ability to pull nine Gs and think while you’re doing it, and a perfect willingness, even an eagerness, to put yourself in harms way to go kill the bad guy. USAF Unfortunately the Air Force’s mentality in recent years has been “well, everybody’s equal, everybody’s the same.” A lawyer or a logistician is just as important. And before people scream about that, let me say that I know very well I could never fight a war without a logistician. A lawyer, yeah, that’s debatable. You’ve got to have the support folks. You’ve got to have everything that puts this in motion. I’m not denigrating that at all. But in the end, they are not the ones who go out and get shot out, whose wives become widows, whose kids become orphans. It’s the pilots that do that. You’re not going to attract the kind of person that can do that in the current environment that the Air Force has made for itself. It’s just ludicrous. They’ve got something called a Green Dot Training Program now where everybody sits around I think and they listen to statements and decide what would be potentially offensive to somebody. I mean it’s just ludicrous. The Air Force’s Chief of Personnel, Gina Grosso—what a ridiculous individual. Her solution to the pilot training, or the pilot retention problem, was to somehow magically ask the airlines to stop recruiting pilots. You hear that and your mouth falls open. Where does this clown come from and who put her in charge of this? It’s not about the money, it’s not about even deploying or anything like that. It’s the way that they have been basically hounded out and treated since this ultra left-wing wave of political correctness swung through the Air Force. I’m not saying there wasn’t some room for housecleaning, because there was, okay, but it’s gone way too far to the other side. And I think most of the guys I know are out now and the ones that are getting ready to get out, they all decry the Air Force leadership and the way that this is being dealt with. The way that people are getting promoted and kept in and basically trying to kill off the fighter pilot once and for all. In the name of what? I don’t know, the drone, the lawyer, the psychologist? All I know is if we have to fight somebody there’s not going to be anybody left to do the fighting. And they should remember that I think. Does the Air Force even have enough aircraft now to fight a major conflict? It seems like there’s an idea out there that we can do the same amount of work with half the fleet that we had 10 years ago. Any comment on that? Well, that’s a complex question which you probably intended and I would say again it goes down to who you wish to fight, who you intend to fight. God knows, the people that have actually fought, like me, don’t want to fight. I mean, if there’s a way to avoid it, then we avoid it. But you have to be ready to do it if you have to. So the worst enemy on our stage has been the Soviet Union, or Russia now. China to a lesser degree. I don’t think China is really going to attack us they own too much of our national debt for that. A division of F-16CJ Block 50s over Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom, just like Dan flew., USAF You have to prepare for the worst and in preparing for the worst then you can theoretically handle anything less than the worst, right? So who are out potential enemies in the future? I would say we always have to look to the east, we always have to assume it’s going to be Russia in some form or another. Or a surrogate of Russia that they have created and one of our surrogates gets into it and that’s, again, how a Vietnam starts. The F-16 production line remains open, and Lockheed has announced they will be moving it to South Carolina —a process which will start by the end of this year. There’s a real opportunity for the United States Air Force to purchase brand new, highly advanced F-16s like the Block 60—I think now the Block 70 is what they call it for the Indian tender, or the F-16V for other buyers. Would it be a smart strategy to buy these jets alongside a reduced F-35 buy, sort of as part of a high-low capability mix like what we saw during the Cold War? No, I think that’s an excellent idea. I think you need a wing in the Pacific, you need a wing in Europe and then the rest of them stay within the United States, F-35s, and you cut the buy by what? Maybe 50%, maybe 60% of the original number. And you use the money saved then to invest in tried and true technology that works against everything short of the best that Russia can throw at us and that’s for the F-35 and the F-22. And use the Block 50, 60 and even the Block 70 F-16 for the foreseeable future. I mean that airplane is so adaptable and it’s proven the concept—the modular concept—and the ease of upgrade. Everything that they intended it to do it can do. So there’s no reason to suppose that it can’t continue doing that in the future. I would caveat that by saying I remember in 1991 going to war and seeing half a dozen different types of fighters out on the ramp. That’s too much, okay. A mix, as you put it, of two different types, that’s not so far fetched at all. Maybe three, okay. It’s very doable and it makes sense fiscally. You took the Viper to war in Iraq in 2003, and in doing so you were highly decorated for your acts. Your efforts over there were detailed brilliantly in your book Viper Pilot. What are your thoughts on Iraq today and the ongoing fight against ISIS in Mosul? What do you think will happen once ISIS is no longer a common enemy among the different groups that make up the country—including Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish factions—not to mention the external actors that are actively wielding influence over the country? If and when that happens, and I’d like to caveat my answer by saying that this could have been solved five to seven years ago, maybe even longer, if it had been handled right. But the fact is that we’re left with one messy sandwich right now. To answer your question, I think that they’ll fight each other. They generally always have and they probably always will. If I was a Kurdish leader I would think to myself there is no better time to establish an independent Kurdistan than now. And they may do just that. Dan standing in front of his Viper loaded out for a wild weasel mission over Iraq during the 2003 invasion., Dan Hampton As far as what’s left in Iraq, I don’t know if I said this last time we talked, but I did an essay for an agency of our government about alternatives for Iraq. And even five or six years ago I said what Iraq needs is a king. The so-called experiment with democracy was never really going to work in the Bush-Brenner fiasco right after the second Gulf War ended. They don’t have experience with democracy, they don’t understand it, and to be honest, the forcible implementation of a democracy in Iraq for the last decade or so has left a really, really, really bad taste in their mouth. I’m sure people can understand that given what’s going on over there. They associate all their current problems pretty much with democracy and the fact that they don’t have a strong leader. They don’t respond to a president, they don’t respond to voting, they don’t really have a moderately educated electorate which is sort of a necessity for a democracy. What they need is a king. I think what I said in the essay was there is a crown prince. The crown prince of the Hashemite Iraqi Royal Family. He lives in Jordan. I don’t know why he’d volunteer to go in and do this. I wouldn’t if I were him. A very smart guy. I think he went to Johns Hopkins University here in the United States and he’s got a Ph.D. from Cambridge. He married an American. He could certainly do it. I think he’s permanently attached to the UN still. But that’s what they need, whether it’s him or somebody else, they need a legitimate, strong, central figure to hold Iraq together. It was never really it’s own country anyway. If you don’t want to split it up into different pieces you’ve got to have some sort of strong central figure and I think a king with a constitutional monarchy is the best choice. And our ISIS strategy in Mosul, obviously this is an outgrowth of Obama’s strategy that sort of gestated. What are your thoughts on it? You know it’s so convoluted and messy now compared to what it could have been. I’m not going to say it would have been easy to solve a decade ago, but it would have been easier than now. Now there is no alternative but to go in and just clean out the snake pit and I think the best way to do that would be through indigenous folks there on the ground who have a vested personal interest in getting rid of these clowns. And in my mind, the Kurds are still the best option. Much of Mosul is now in ruins and the humanitarian toll from the operation to liberate the city has been high., AP I spent some time in Kurdistan. I know a little bit about the Kurdish people. I have some friends there. They’re great fighters. They would be dependable if they thought they could trust us and I don’t blame them for doubting. But I would have used them to rid their own backyard so to speak of ISIS and just basically given them free reign to do what they needed to do. If Trump had some advisors that had some experience, or maybe he does and he’s not listening to them, I think he should have started with ISIS rather than tackling some of these more contentious issues. If he would have started with something that everybody can agree on, it’s going to do him nothing but good. But he didn’t do that. Well that’s a good jumping off point for us to head to Syria. What are your thoughts on America’s strategy in Syria, and especially on the Trump administration’s recent Tomahawk strike on Assad’s airfield in response to the chemical weapon attack in Idlib province? I think Tomahawk missiles have limited utility. They’re okay for what he’s using them for. Remember Clinton did the same thing. It’s a way to look like you’re actually doing something without really doing a whole lot or risking a lot. And sometimes, in some places that’s okay. I wouldn’t send one American into say the Sudan or Somalia , I’d wail away on them with cruise missiles all day long, but the situation is a lot less complicated then it is in central Syria. I follow it fairly well and even I’m confused now about who’s good, who’s bad, and who’s on who’s side. It’s such a mess. I don’t really have an answer except to say that if this had been handled differently during the previous administration, we probably wouldn’t be facing the mess we are now. Russia already has S-300 and S-400 batteries installed in western Syria, as well as Pantsir S-1 point air defense systems, and now Moscow is saying they’re going to go and protect Assad’s air space with those assets. Before the cruise missile strike, those systems were supposedly there to solely protect Russia’s own airfield and port facility in the country. Then on top of that, because of these strikes, Russia says they are going to now rearm Assad with better surface-to-air missile systems and basically give him an integrated defense system for what sounds like free of charge. You’re one of the most renowned Wild Weasels of all time. How hard would it be in the future for the US to go back in and actually try to neuter Assad’s military capability with those advanced assets now pointing at our aircraft? Couple of things. It sounds an awful lot like North Vietnam in 1964 doesn’t it? The Russians did almost the same thing with the SA-2 that they’re doing now. And you notice from the Tomahawk strikes, how well did their vaunted air defense system work? Either they purposely didn’t use it because they didn’t want to give any of their weaknesses and strengths away, which we already know anyhow. Or it’s really not as good as they make it out to be, or some combination of the two. I kind of tend towards the latter explanation. These things are never as good as their touted to be. It doesn’t mean you underestimate them, but it means you take that for what it’s worth and you analyze what you know. We’ve already done that. S-400 and Pantsir-S1 deployed to Russia’s airbase south of Latakia, Syria., AP There are ways in and around those systems and I will go back to one of my life-long premises—anything that kills a SAM or part of a SAM can be a Wild Weasel. So it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s me in a tactical airframe. It might be special forces teams on the ground blowing up radars. It might be naval warships standing offshore if they’re within range of their guns and just blasting the hell out of them. It could even be, and this is my favorite use for a drone, a suicide drone . A drone that’s been armed and sent in to do one thing and that’s dive into something and explode . I love to use drones for things like that. Drones are useful. I love the idea of sending drones in to stir up an IADS (Integrated Air Defense System). Then you locate the radars, you locate the guns and then you send in the real aircraft to destroy them because drones aren’t going to survive very long in an environment like that. I would say this, the short answer without getting into the technical end of killing those systems, is this: Russia has tried this before and it’s never worked well for them. I think Putin’s a chess player like most Russians are and I think he’s playing chess and to some degree he’s bluffing on the lack of an American plan and America’s national will to get involved with Syria. I could go round and round on that too. But the fact is, Russia is trying to resurrect themselves, as you very well know, as a new world power, and saying ‘hey we’re back in the game.’ They never got over the fact that their world collapsed in the early ’90s and this is Putin’s way of keeping himself in power. He has too. He’s running out of cash. His GDP is down and inflation is up. I think what, a quarter of the Russian banks fell out of the market in 2015. It is not a strong economy, it’s never been a strong economy. They could send guys into outer space but they can’t get crops in from the fields to the markets before they rot, okay. Russia is what, 68% dependent on petroleum? We’re eight. There’s a lot of ways to cripple them and they know it. So I think a lot of this is a poker game and it could have been solved with some competent diplomacy five or eight years ago, but it wasn’t. You spent a lot of time in Egypt, as detailed that in your memoir, training Egyptian Air Force pilots on how to fly the F-16. The Obama administration turned away from the el-Sisi government because it seized power from the Muslim Brotherhood undemocratically through a coup. In our absence, Russia stepped in, they’ve deepened their ties to the Egyptian government and they’ve sold them advanced MIG-29s and other aircraft and weapon systems. The French have too with the Rafael. These likely would have been F-16 orders if the US had stayed engaged. Now the Trump Administration is turning back towards the el-Sisi government and treating Cairo like a close ally once again. So from the guy that was there for years and has the military connections, what are your thoughts about the changing relationship between the U.S. and Egypt? How do you close the military ties with Egypt impact our interests in the region? Well, I think the failure of the previous administration to keep those ties strong is another glaring example of their amateurism, incompetence and hypocrisy too. I mean you’re willing to support regime X in Libya or half a dozen in Sub-Saharan Africa that have no concept of democracy, and yet you’re going to use that (coming to power via a coup) as an excuse for backing away from Egypt. I mean, give me a break. An Egyptian Viper pulls up behind a USAF KC-135 tanker during joint training exercises in 2007., USAF Egypt is obviously in a prime strategic place. The Suez Canal isn’t as important really as it use to be, but it’s still vital to the region. And more importantly, as part of Africa, Egypt can do a lot as far as stability goes especially with its neighbor. It’s close to Libya, it has an interest in seeing Libya stabilized. Egypt could do a lot. So I think it’s well worth having them as an ally and if that means continuing to strength them, then so be it. I mean face it, when one pulls out there’s a vacuum. And when we pulled out the Russians tried to move in as they try to move in everywhere, which is one reason why I’m going to go against the grain here to say that some sort of better accommodation with the Syrian regime probably would have been a better idea because it was a foregone conclusion that if we pulled out of there and threw up our hands and said we’re done, the Russians would move in. You’ve got to expect that. They tried it in Egypt. So I think that the Egyptian regime, as long as it’s playing somewhat by the rules—and nobody’s hands are clean over there—it’s a matter of pragmatism. Okay. As long as they’re somewhat playing by the rules, the rules we make because we’re helping them, then they’re worth supplying, they’re worth training, they’re worth keeping on our side. Better have them with us then against us, right? Again, I’m going to go against the grain here to say that the same thing about Iran. Iran has been a pariah basically since the late ’70s. Well, it’s been time for some time to just put that aside. The bottom line is as bad as the embassy seizure was, they didn’t kill anybody. Okay, I mean, everybody came back. They could have just as easily drug them out in the street and executed them all, but they didn’t do that. I think some 70% of the population in Iran is under age 35. They don’t remember the Shah, they don’t remember the revolution. They’re tired of not having cell phones and computers and being told they can’t dance and hold hands with girls and all the things that they want to do. I think Iran would be a tremendous ally to the United States if it was handled right. Everybody’s goobered up over the nuclear issue. Iran still flies the F-14A Tomcat decades after all support for the jets as embargoed. Roughly two dozen remain in active service., Shahram Sharifi/Wikicommons Well, they’re going to get it one way or another. If they got it from us at least we would know what they have, right? And if they got it from us along with some reasonable terms and conditions, then again it’s better to have them with us then against us. And if they don’t get it from us, they’re going to get it from the Chinese or the Russians and that’s bad for everyone. Iranians, they’re not Arabs, you know that but a lot of people don’t… They would go a long way towards stabilizing that end of the region too. So there’s a lot of things that could be done if we had competent people kind of leading the charge from Washington which we haven’t had and my vote’s still out on whether or not we have it now or not. They seem more interested in squabbling amongst themselves then they do in actually leading. Now most importantly, we want to know what you’re up to. Viper Pilot and Lords Of The Sky were really big hits. I read them and I know a lot of other people that did too. What new projects are on the horizon? What can you share with us? Well, The Hunter Killers came out, what, in 2015? That did really, really well and I had already moved on to writing The Flight which is about Charles Lindbergh’s trip across the Atlantic. It is due out in a month. May 16th is when I think it goes on sale. And I’m under contract to write another book about test pilots which I have to deliver sometime in 2018. Then, what else happened? Let’s see, I did a Breitling commercial. They got six pilots from around the world. They called me and asked me if I wanted to do it and I said have you really looked at my face, are you sure? And they kind of chuckled and said yeah. It was a lot of fun. It’s in most of the airline magazines now and online. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NCDK1vNC3gA Then I went out to the South Pacific in December on behalf of a major network, can’t say who yet, to find out what happened to Amelia Earhart. So look for that in probably June. It’ll come out through, like I said, through a major cable network. Tell us a little bit about your other company, what are your objectives with it? Oh, the private military stuff. Well, we’re involved in West Africa. There’s some counter-piracy and other issues over there that they like to use us for. And water is becoming a big deal in West Africa. Oil always has been. We’ve got some options on the table for helping some of those companies stay protected and stay safe so they can deliver what they need to. Not a place I’d go on vacation, but it’s good for business.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 7, 2020",7 Revolutionary Hardware Changes the US Navy Should Make in the Trump Era,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Along with all branches of the military, the Navy is set for a series of changes over the next four years of the Trump administration. Although an arbitrary if not counterproductive goal of fielding a 350 ship Navy has been set by the administration, there are also seven key changes in hardware procurement related to the naval combat domain that the US Navy and the administration should make. These recommended hardware initiatives range from large strategic ones to smaller tactical ones, but they would all result in a far more flexible and deadly sea faring force, and total force overall. And it’s not just about making use of an increased Navy budget—it is more about spending money more wisely and creating a more adaptable fleet tailored to tackling the unique challenges of the 21st century. Our regular readers will recognize a few of these, as we have discussed some them in great detail before, but for the sake of brevity we will keep each recommendation largely conceptual in scope. Additional links will provide more detail and background on each recommendation. Also, this piece does not include procurement changes that are already emerging or underway, or recommended changes in tactics and operating procedures—such as more training to operate in GPS and space communications denied environments—that are also important but outside the scope of this report. The War Zone’s recommendations are: Procure a diesel-electric submarine fleet with an advanced form of air independent propulsion that can be forward based abroad. The Navy’s mix of Los Angeles , Sea Wolf and Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarines are in extreme demand. With the Virginia class boats currently in production costing over $2.6 billion per unit, the service will be hard-pressed to provide the capacity the USN needs to meet emerging missions demands and threats. These include keeping a resurgent Russian Navy in check, countering China in the Asia-Pacific theatre, keeping tabs on North Korea’s submarine movements, protecting carrier and amphibious strike groups, countering Iran’s naval forces in and around the Persian Gulf, as well as all their other tasks like special operations support and reconnaissance. The Virginia class USS John Warner under construction, Newport News Shipbuilding In all, the US Navy will maintain a force of roughly just 55 attack submarines for the foreseeable future under current plans. Considering a large portion of that fleet is pier-side, in training, or under heavy maintenance at any given time, and how many missions the fleet has to address, that number of boats seems far too small for today, let alone for tomorrow. Adding a few more Virginia class submarines to the inventory would help, but they are so expensive to build and operate that depending on an all nuclear force seems to be a unsustainable strategy. Since the Navy retired its last diesel-electric submarine in 1990— the USS Blueback —many submarine manufacturers around the globe have perfected multiple types of advanced diesel-electric submarines that use a variety air independent propulsion (AIP) concepts. From Stirling Engine based , to fuel cell based to lithium-ion battery based , these technologies allow diesel-electric submarines to dive for long periods of time (multiple weeks in many instances) while remaining as quiet, if not quieter than their nuclear counterparts. As many as five of these vessels could be built for the price of a single Virginia class SSN. With all this in mind, the USN should embrace this new paradigm in sub-surface warfare and procure an advanced diesel electric submarine design alongside serial production of the ever more capable Virginia class. Japan’s Soryu class would be an ideal candidate for the US Navy., AP So that the Navy can get the best submarine for its dollar, license manufacturing a foreign design here in the US, such as Japan’s cutting-edge lithium-ion battery powered Soryu class submarine or even an advanced version of Germany’s proven Dolphin class AIP capable submarine, would be ideal. These vessels can be outfitted with US combat systems and sensors and forward-based in friendly countries abroad, something our nuclear submarines cannot do. They can even be teamed with Littoral Combat Ships that are being fielded under a similar concept. The Swedish A26 is a planned outgrowth of the highly successful and relatively affordable Gotland class AIP submarine. , Saab-Kockums By building say four AIP equipped diesel electric submarines instead of every third or fourth Virginia class boat ordered, the Navy will have a far more capacious attack submarine force. A majority of the regional missions can be executed by these far less expensive but still very deadly submarines, freeing up the big Virginia class boats for missions where their nuclear capabilities are far more of a necessity. In doing so the Navy will be able to meet the growing demands for attack submarine capabilities in the coming decades, and the service will be able to adjust its submarine building requirements more easily based on foreseeable demands. Replace the Littoral Combat Ship with a frigate capable of area air defense as soon as possible. The Littoral Combat Ship program has been a failure. The Navy needs to change course as soon as it possibly can and replace the design with a more capable and survivable frigate that features a potent area air defense capability. This specific capability would come in the form of a vertical launch system (VLS) capable of firing RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles . This feature alone, paired with the proper radar and combat system upgrades needed for targeting, would allow these ships to operate independently of multi-billion dollar and already over taxed Aegis-equipped cruisers and destroyers in medium and even high-threat environments. This way the frigate could not only do anything the LCS can do, but it can also take the pressure off America’s most capable and expensive surface combatants for many missions, like convoy escort duties and protecting key elements that support the sea basing concept. USN Beyond being far more versatile and able to operate much more independently than the standard LCS, this ship will be able to confront the growing anti-ship missile threat, one that it is rapidly proliferating among non-state actors . It will also feature other improvements, like the ability to fire medium-range land-attack and anti-ship missiles. The current LCS configuration—a giant jet boat meant to supposedly fight in the littorals where the anti-ship missile threat is most unpredictable—simply will not do. And that is not to mention the baseline LCS’s many other design and conceptual deficiencies and failures. A model of the Freedom class LCS design adapted for carrying two eight-cell Mk 41 vertical launch systems, as well as other enhancements and added firepower., Joseph Trevithick Currently, the Ingalls Patrol Frigate concept —which is based on the Coast Guard’s Legend class National Security Cutter —seems like the most attractive, low risk and logical fit for this mission set. Yet at this point, even acquiring a reworked Littoral Combat Ship design of either class would be acceptable if it would mean getting these capabilities fielded a better chance of actually happening. Under the Obama administration, the LCS was already truncated to 32 examples (from 50), with just another eight “up-gunned” models that feature enhanced armor and some extra bolt-on weaponry coming to fruition from ship 33 to 40. After which the program is slated to be shuttered, and long before that point, the Navy would have to down-select a single LCS design —either Independence or Freedom class—to be built. If the Trump administration cannot cancel the LCS entirely and work quickly to replace it with a proper frigate, maybe a compromise to rework the LCS deal altogether by putting a “frigate” version—one that includes ESSM capability—into production far sooner than before the 33rd vessel (at best) would be an acceptable way forward. Currently the Navy has contracts through the 26th LCS hull in place, so at the very least, it could switch over to an LCS “frigate” derivative at that time, but sooner would be better. A rendering of what a “frigate” variant that includes ESSM capability of the Independence class would look like. , Austal Even if ultimately less hulls can be bought for the same amount of money by quickly moving to a more complex frigate version of the LCS design or a new frigate design altogether, these ships will have far greater utility and will be able to operate independently in a much wider threat spectrum than their weaker progenitors. Under such a plan a 350 ship Navy may remain elusive, but a 340 ship Navy, where a much higher number of those ships can operate without the need of a multi-billion dollar destroyer or cruiser nearby, and are much more survivable and deadly in actual combat, results in a far more effective and flexible overall force. USS Freedom gets a new diesel engine . The LCSs have been plagued with mechanical and operational issues, which has led to a full reorganizing of the fleet. Now the first four ships will be training and test vessels, and massive manning and training restructuring continues. , USN Both manufacturers, Austal USA and Lockheed Martin in conjunction with Marinette Marine are now actively pitching their enhanced LCS “frigate” designs, and Saudi Arabia was very interested in buying the Freedom class version. If the US agreed to do so as well, some development costs could be shared, along with the realization of larger production numbers, and thus lower unit costs. Build smaller aircraft carriers The supercarrier still has its place in America’s arsenal, but naval aviation and naval warfare have changed since its genesis during the early decades of the Cold War. Since then, the supercarrier has become grossly expensive to construct, with the first of the new Ford class supercarrier costing roughly $13 billion, without research and development included. The second carrier in the class, the USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), is slated to cost roughly $11.5 billion . At the same time, the carrier air wing has shrunk from nearly 90 aircraft during the 1980s down to around 65. In addition, precision guided munitions have allowed one strike fighter to reliably take out multiple targets on a single mission, instead of an entire air wing going after a single strategic target or small set of targets in a single alpha strike in single day. With all this in mind, the Navy’s demand to build ever larger aircraft carriers is counter productive and may be unsustainable in the long term. USS Gerald R. Ford sets sail for the first time., USN Nuclear supercarriers are also extremely costly to operate, and their availability is based around a highly rigid and complex timetable. The recent carrier gap has proven just how little elasticity there is in America’s all supercarrier force. A mix of supercarriers and smaller carriers in the 65,000 ton class would allow for a more flexible overall aircraft carrier force , with greater strike capacity being able to be deployed on short notice. For instance, if the Navy were to replace every third Nimitz class super carrier with two smaller carriers, let’s use a license-built CATOBAR version of the Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers for instance, the fleet would eventually be made up of eight super carriers and eight smaller carriers, for 16 in total. Or replace every fourth supercarrier with two smaller carriers, which would result in a fleet of nine supercarriers and six smaller carriers, for 15 in total. That is based on modifying Donald Trump’s current mandate for 12 supercarriers. You can play with the numbers as you like, but even cutting America’s supercarrier force to ten ships, while adding four smaller carriers, would be a worthwhile endeavor. With the retirement of USS Enterprise , the Navy is down to ten carriers, one less than mandated by congress. Delays in the USS Gerald R. Ford have only made the situation worse. , USN Under such a plan, supercarriers can also have their schedules better adjusted for concentrating on deployments and projecting power abroad, instead of executing more menial tasks like training new Naval Aviators or keeping up fleet aircrews’ carrier qualifications. The smaller carriers could be made available for these tasks, and would expand America’s ability to rapidly deploy naval power as need be along a far less rigid schedule. As to whether conventional or nuclear propulsion would be used for these smaller vessels is up for debate, but there are benefits to both. Regardless, increasing the Navy’s carrier fleet density should be more important than its magnitude. And even if these ships run on nuclear power, they will create more overall carrier availability at any given time. Licensing a CATOBAR version of the QE class could save money, time and lead to certain synergies with the Royal Navy’s planned carrier force. , BAE Systems Some may say that the Navy should just procure America class LHAs that are currently being produced to support the USMC’s growing F-35B fleet. This is also a possibility, but their sortie rates cannot approach anywhere near those of a CATOBAR carrier, nor can the overall capabilities of their air wing. Even the F-35B lacks the 2,000lb class internal weapons carrying capabilities of their counterparts. Still, this would be a very cost effective alternative to continuing with an all supercarrier strategy, and the USMC is already working on its plans to deploy the America class in “Lightning Carrier” configuration , where nearly two dozen F-35Bs would be deployed aboard at one time. America class LHA in a “Lightning Carrier” configuration., USMC The America class could be further modified to support F-35 strike fighter operations as the Navy would have no need for the spaces set aside for the current design’s embarked Marine contingent. As such, hangar space could be further expanded, as could magazine and fuel capacity. Although under such a plan, the US Navy would have to procure the F-35B with its short takeoff and vertical landing capabilities, but that may actually be a good thing when paired with the strategy below. Prioritize the deployment of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) aboard Navy aircraft carriers. The technology exists, it is a game changer, and the aircraft carrier concept can be totally revitalized by it. The advanced semi-autonomous/autonomous UCAV, basically an operational version of the X-47B , would give the carrier air wing what it needs the most—far more reach and penetrating punch. X-47B and Super Hornet high over the carrier., USN With an unrefueled combat radius double or even triple that of their manned fighter counterparts, UCAVs can reach deep into the enemy’s anti-access/area denial bubble and begin to break it down at its core. At their most basic, they can accomplish penetrating strike and surveillance missions, but their true potential becomes unlocked when they can work as an autonomous swarm to break the enemy’s decision cycle and pick out its metaphorical eyes and ears cooperatively. All this and so much more is detailed in my past special feature about this revolutionary technology, which is a must read in order to understand the UCAV’s overwhelming potential to revolutionize air combat, and why they have disappeared from the public’s view in recent years. The X-47B operating from an aircraft carrier, USN The Navy was supposed to field an advanced UCAV for its carriers by the end of decade. Strangely that requirement has been dumbed down into a sensor and refueling platform once dubbed Carrier-Borne Aerial Refueling System, or C-BARS. Now the Navy calls it a MQ-25 Stingray , but what it isn’t is a stealthy, hard hitting, penetrating UCAV that it could have been. The terrible decision to go for a drone tanker and sensor platform over a UCAV—that could have done both roles as well as many others—was likely the result of a cultural override by the Navy that historically protects the fighter pilot as a concept, as well as a move to protect high priority (and highly lucrative) manned fighter programs like the F-35C, and even the Super Hornet to some extent. These aircraft could quickly become far less relevant once the UCAV genie is let out of its bottle. But tanking and orbiting around collecting information, that unglamorous role can be done by the drone without putting the fighter cadre at risk. Sadly, by not procuring a carrier-borne UCAV, America loses, as the UCAV revolution will just be prolonged and our capabilities as a fighting force, not just to strike at the enemy but to survive while attempting to do so, will suffer for it. Not just that, but a very stealthy UCAV could have made procuring the F-35C irrelevant, and frankly it still can. X-47B traps aboard the carrier, USN Pursuing UCAVs over the F-35C would be a valiant endeavor for NAVAIR. It would give the Navy the stealth strike capability it was promised way back in the late 1980s as part of the long defunct A-12 Avenger program. It would also do so likely at far lower cost than the F-35C and with greater range and low observability—all without putting a pilot at risk for the most dangerous of missions. The Navy could still procure the F-35, but in the form of the B variant, alongside purchasing smaller America class derivative carriers as part of an overall revamp of the Navy’s current carrier/carrier air wing force mixture. In fact, a supercarrier loaded with advanced UCAVs, Super Hornets, Growlers and Hawkeyes, paired with a modified America class “Lightning Carrier” loaded with F-35Bs, may represent the best of both worlds. Under such an arrangement, a full variant of the F-35 could be eliminated from production—and the most expensive one at that—the F-35C. Lockheed Sea Ghost UCAV concept derived from the RQ-170 Sentinel, Lockheed Martin Maybe the ultimate modern rendition of the aircraft carrier concept will eventually feature a deck filled with only UCAVs, each easily adapted for a whole host of roles. And once there is no man in the loop directly, and no manned fighter aircraft to integrate with, the efficiency and lethality of automated air combat can be unleashed on a grand scale. Really, the aircraft carrier is more suitable for UCAVs than land bases, especially if the entire air wing is made up of advanced inter-networked drones. Above all else, such a capability would be a quantum leap over anything the enemy has to counter with. Outfit the Navy’s three Zumwalt class destroyers as they were originally intended. The Navy loves to tout its out-of-this-world looking DDG-1000 Zumwalt class destroyers, but really, they are a sad shell of their originally intended selves. You can read all about this grim reality here , and that report doesn’t include the fact that even the DDG-1000’s big Advanced Gun Systems, which take up literally the forward third of the ship, have no ammunition because the Navy cancelled the program due to cost concerns. DDG-1000, USN The “Zunwalts” lack their original radar suite and missile outfit among many other features, and are also having their stealth shaping that came at such a high cost bastardized with bolt on sensors, masts and communications gear to save money. Even their smaller guns have been downgraded to off-the-shelf 30mm Bushmaster cannons. In the end the class of just three ships will be lucky to serve for a handful of years before becoming test ships, and they will probably be cannibalized for parts in the process. USN This sad fate can all be averted if the Navy just commits to letting the design prove itself, and not handicap it severely before it ever even goes on patrol. Fit these ships to reflect their original concept. If they are so good at what they do we can build more of them, and if that threatens the Navy’s highly questionable decision to move on to building Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers instead of more DDG-1000s than so be it. Currently the tiny class is setup to fail, but we have already invested tens of billions into the design. So making the best of those three ships should be an essential goal for the US Navy going forward. The worst that can happen is that we will have three incredible ships to use for decades to come, but I have a feeling these vessels will prove to be far more revolutionary and valuable than that if they are given the chance—and that includes outfitting them as they were originally designed. Expand the Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarine program at the expense of America’s land-based intercontinental ballistic missile force. The Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) will replace America’s aging Ohio class SSBNs. Although the program is proceeding, the budget is very tight for these 12 new boats, and each one is slated to have an average cost of $8 billion—that figure includes research and development costs. The fact is the Navy’s SSBNs are the heart of America’s nuclear deterrent, and represent the core of America’s dedicated second strike capability . Along with constantly improving the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile , keeping this specific portion of America’s nuclear arsenal as capable as it possibly can be should be a top priority for the Pentagon. Doing so is not a cheap affair—it never has been. But as Russia pushes to rapidly improve their own nuclear arsenal, and is building new SSBNs of their own, the US is spreading itself to thin across its own nuclear triad. Rendering of Columbia class SSBN., USN What I propose is controversial, but I think it is wise. At the very least, the Pentagon needs to deeply review options for reorganizing America’s nuclear triad into a nuclear dyad. America’s tired land based intercontinental ballistic missile program could be retired, and those many tens of billions of dollars could refocused to build a larger, far better funded nuclear ballistic missile submarine force. The Air Force would also receive a large portion of those savings to buy the B-21 Raider stealth bomber force it says it desperately needs, as well as a new very stealthy and smart nuclear-tipped cruise missile to go along with it. There is no doubt that some will oppose screwing with the nuclear triad at all, but the fact is hundreds of billions of dollars are required over the next decade to modernize the triad, and still capability sacrifices will have to be made. Yes, America’s ICBMs would theoretically work as a strategic “sponge” to soak up hundreds of enemy warheads during a nuclear exchange, but that strategy can be viewed as flawed on multiple levels. The fact is, the land-based leg of our nuclear arsenal is disposable, and the money it sucks up and will continue to suck up can be used to bolster the other two legs of the triad to an extreme degree. Also, by eliminating the land-based ICBM leg of the triad, not only can the other two legs be greatly improved, but advances in conventional war fighting capability can also be realized as a secondary result. B-52 being loaded with AGM-86 ALCMs., USAF For instance, currently the Columbia class relies heavily on existing technologies, many of which are already found on the Virginia class fast attack boats. If more funds for the Columbia class submarine program were made available, new technologies can be developed that can be used to not only make the Columbia class better and more future-proof, but they can also be adapted for the fast attack submarine fleet as well. Also, significantly more money will allow for more of these boats to be built, and more new and improved Trident missiles to fill their launch tubes. Although the Columbia class is roughly the same size as the Ohio class, the type will have eight less SLBM tubes than its predecessor—16 instead of 24. By adding say another eight Columbia class boats to the planned fleet of 12 would go a long way in realizing economies of scale in their construction and would help even-out the warheads that were lost when the land-based portion of the triad was retired. America’s Ohio class boomers are aging, and the Columbia class will be more maintainable and will feature a “lifetime reactor” that will not need refueling during the boat’s nearly 50 year lifespan., USN When it comes to the USAF, ensuring a larger B-21 buy also would mean a drastic increase in high-end conventional attack capabilities as well. Not just that, but the AGM-86 cruise missile could be retired and money saved could be invested in buying new Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) stealthy cruise missiles. A conventional derivative of this new nuclear tipped air launched cruise missile could also be pursued with these extra funds. It is a tough call, but really an extremely advanced nuclear dyad is better than a aging nuclear triad that is constantly under severe fiscal pressure. And let’s face it, if doomsday came , the world as we know it could end at the hands of our submarine-launched ballistic missiles alone. But by also reinforcing the aerial leg of the triad, the US will retain the ability to deliver a flexible and credible “scaled response” without even having to resort to ballistic missile barrages. Outfit LPD-17 San Antonio class of amphibious transport docks with Mark 41 vertical launch systems. The San Antonio class (LPD-17) has proven to be an incredibly effective “micro military in a box.” These ships can be deployed off the coasts of low-intensity conflicts where they can execute a wide spectrum of missions. These include everything from humanitarian relief to special operations to embassy evacuation to close air support to strike missions, and many others in between. The USS San Antonio’s recent deployment to Libya proved this model to an unprecedented degree. These are incredibly versatile ships, and they don’t necessarily need to be locked within the standard “Gator Navy” concept of operations. The fact that a single ship has a voluminous flight deck and hangar space that can embark a “pocket air force” of AH-1Zs, UH-1Ys, MV-22s and unmanned vehicles, carries an embarked Marine contingent of roughly 700 grunts and their gear, retains a well deck that can accommodate a large variety of water craft ranging from RHIBs to LCACs, and has mission planning and command and control spaces and capabilities, makes the San Antonio class unique. What they lack is the ability to defend themselves from a credible aerial threat and the ability to strike deep into contested territory. They have RIM-116 Rolling Airframe missile launchers fore and aft for point defense, but like the LCS, they lack the ability to provide area air defense for themselves or other ships nearby for that matter. Two San Antonio class LPDs sail side-by-side, USN Luckily the San Antonio’s designers weren’t nearsighted when it came to the ship’s potential, as they actually designed these ships with an area for two eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch systems to be installed. These cells are capable of packing four Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs) each, for a total loadout of 64 highly capable anti-air missiles. Or a mix of ESSMs and other missiles could be carried. For instance, eight of those cells could house BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles , giving the ship an independent penetrating strike capability. Or, upgrade dependent, even the very capable SM-6 could be adapted for the ship’s use. SM-6 has the ability to hit air breathing and some types of ballistic missile targets, as well as possessing a secondary medium-range surface-to-surface/ground capability. In recent months, Lockheed has pushed to get the Navy to fund the installation of the Aegis combat system on LPD-17 class ships, which would allow them to employ the SM-6. The San Antonio class’s large well deck., USN Even without Aegis or the SM-6, the ability to lug around 36 ESSMs and eight Tomahawks would usher in a whole new dynamic when it comes to the ship’s mission capabilities. The Tomahawks could also be sidelined by bolt-on canisters of Norway’s much touted medium-range Naval Strike Missile —which is likely to show up on many other Navy surface vessels in the not so distant future. With these additions, a single San Antonio class ship alone could provide a hardened and capable presence in low and medium threat environments, and would be especially capable of supporting contingency operations in “hot spot” regions around the globe. If they were paired with an LCS or frigate for anti-submarine warfare, they could venture into the high-threat realm as well. The LPD-17 class has am ample flight deck and hangar area that allows the ship to embark unique mixes of Marine rotary-wing air power. , USN The same concept can be ported over to the upcoming LX(R) ships that will replace the Harpers Ferry and Whidbey Island classes of dock landing ships. These vessels will very likely leverage the existing LPD-17 hull design, although their overall capabilities will be degraded compared to their San Antonio class cousins to save money and to better emulate the more basic ships they replace. LX(R) concept based on the LPD-17 design, Huntington Ingalls But providing room for a VLS on these vessels as well may be prudent, even to work just as a remote magazine for Aegis equipped cruisers and destroyers, and especially for their LPD-17 sister ships that will accompany them during most operations. But if not, an LPD-17 class could protect them with their own anti-air capabilities alone, all without the need for a nearby destroyer or cruiser. This would allow for new pairings of ships for various operations. For instance, an single LPD-17 class ship could be accompanied by a single LX(R) for additional war fighting capacity. Basically, in doing so the LPD-17 could double its combat power, without the need of another costly LPD-17. All the high-end combat capability, including air defense capabilities, and the small flotilla’s “brains” are deployed aboard the LPD-17 with the LX(R) working as something of a subordinate force. A VLS equipped LPD-17 could also be useful for sea basing operations, by being able to provide air defense for the assets around it. Once again, this would free up destroyers and cruisers for other tasks. Various sea basing and forward basing strategies the USMC wants to use during a major conflict will see assets spread thin over vast distances., USMC Basically, by giving the San Antonio class its VLS system, it will be able to operate more independently in many more scenarios than it can today. This gets back to the whole arbitrary 350 ship navy mandate. It is better to have a few less ships, but ones that are far less rigidly dependent on others for protection under most circumstances. It allows the US Navy as a whole to be in more places, with more capabilities, at one time than simply demanding “more ships.” Currently 12 LPD-17 ships are planned, a 13th could be ordered to bridge the gap between LPD-17 and LX(R) production if the LX(R)s end up being built based on the LPD-17 hull.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 4, 2020",15 Questions With One of VP-5’s ‘Mad Foxes’ on Flying the P-8 Poseidon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The P-8’s short career with the US Navy has been an outstanding one. The much doubted weaponized 737 has become one of the most in-demand assets in the Pentagon’s portfolio. It has made major news by rescuing castaways, searching for MH370, monitoring China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea, and even being threatened by Iranian air defenses. Four years after its introduction into service, it continues to evolve rapidly in exciting new ways, and the jet has become one of the America’s most successful new defense exports. The last time we talked P-8s with a maritime patrol pilot , the jet was still very much an unknown commodity, with just a handful of squadrons having their hands on it. At that time, the nature of the P-8 future mission profile was very much up for debate. Now The War Zone has connected with one of Patrol Squadron Five ‘s, better known as the VP-5 the “Mad Foxes,” pilots to chat about how the storied unit has continued to break down new barriers with their still quite fresh P-8 Poseidons. What can the P-8A Poseidon do better than the aircraft it replaces, the P-3C Orion? The P-8 Poseidon has a significant leg up on the P-3 Orion when it comes to the airframe itself, crew coordination, and its ability to handle future capabilities. With both forward and aft auxiliary fuel tanks, we can load up with about 70,000 pounds of gas depending on our takeoff limitations. I have flown 10.5+ hour ISR (information, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, with a comfortable amount of gas to land with. By being able to fly higher, faster, and longer than the P-3, we can get on station faster than our predecessor. This also gives us the capability to easily cross the pond, and allows us to be a fairly mobile force if time and mission dictates us to have to pick up and take the plane wherever we need to go. This was also seen recently in the Clyde Challenger rescue in the Atlantic Ocean, where VP-45’s P-8s had to fly over 1500 miles just to get on station. P-8 and P-3 together over PAX River. , USN Secondly, as seen in a recent Boeing article, such a key aspect of passive sonar detection of enemy submarines is based on the ability of the acoustic operators to detect a contact on their grams . Arriving on station in a smoother platform, allows for a better rested crew, resulting in a more alert operator and a higher probability of detection. Based on decades of 737 experience, the P-8 is also more reliable than their P-3 counterparts. The first P-8 I had ever flown in VP-30 had arrived from Boeing the week prior and had less than 30 hours on the whole airframe, and yeah, it did have that new plane smell. All of this being said, the P-3 and EP-3 still provide an invaluable service via the LSRS pod , and ELINT/SIGINT (electronic intelligence/signals intelligence) capabilities that have not yet come online for the P-8. VP-5 will be the first squadron t o receive the new AAS pod following our next deployment. The P-8 has had no problems handling low altitude ASW (anti submarine warfare) and ISR collection. The HUD in the left seat also greatly increases our situational awareness when operating at 200 feet and up to 45 degrees angle of bank. Also, the P-8 can monitor more sonobuoys than the P-3 and the integration of a single rail setup for the operators helps crew communication and crew resource management. By having the TACCO sit next to the COTAC, next to the EWO’s, it is easier to have everyone on the same page. The P-8’s cabin is laid out in such a way that much of the non-flying aircrew sit next to each other at multi-function control stations that can be reconfigured for a variety of roles., USN Any fighter jet or helicopter pilots need not read the next paragraph!: One of the biggest yet very superficial early gripes with the new platform was the coffee maker was never hooked up, and the head is located right next to the two “lay flat” seats that are used for crew rest. With missions sometimes briefing off at 2am, and lasting until 8pm the following evening, coffee is a mission essential item. I had my fiancé send out a Nespresso machine that we hooked up and soon we were brewing up some mean espressos at 39,000 ft over the Gulf of Oman. As if maritime pilots weren’t already known for being Gucci prima donnas, the looks I got from the Marine jet pilots as I stepped to the plane lugging my espresso machine were pretty priceless! Can you give us a tour of the P-8’s sensors and what they bring to the table when it comes to executing real world missions? The P-8 currently has a host of sensors for use during ASW, ASuW (anti-surface warfare) ISR, and SAR (search and rescue) missions. Our APY-10 radar can be used for SAR (synthetic aperture radar), ISAR (inverse synthetic aperture radar), WX (weather), and periscope detection modes. SAR is used to provide long distance imagery of ports, cities, runways, etc. SAR imagery can help identify targets at distances far outside standoffs. ISAR provides a two-dimensional image of ships that can be used to help identify vessels at long distance and used for target classification. ISAR can also be used to determine ship length and overall mast structure. The AN/APY-10 radar being installed aboard a P-8 in 2009., Boeing The EO/IR (electro-optical/infrared) camera can be used to visually identify both land and sea based targets, with the IR camera having both white hot and black hot images. IR can help to detect thermal scarring from submarines, fires during a search and rescue mission (as used on the fishermen rescue in the Pacific ), and other useful target characteristics. ESM (electronic surveillance measures) is used to collect a wide range of emitters used by both commercial and military ship radars, aircraft, and land based facilities at extended ranges. It allows us to be able to geolocate emitters to find a foreign submarine, surface combatant, or land based surface-to-air site. It is also a passive system, which allows us to covertly monitor a wide area. The P-8’s unique tail section with its DIRCM/GPTA defensive suite. , Mad Fox’s Facebook page DIRCM/GPTA ( directional infrared countermeasures /guardian pointer tracker assembly) is our primary defense against surface-to-air missiles, which engages surface to air missiles with a laser to confuse the seeker on the missile. We also have four buckets of 30 flares apiece to also help defeat surface-to-air missiles threats. The P-8 is also equipped with a dry bay fire system. With sensors located throughout the aircraft, the system detects any sort of flames or explosions from small arms or other projectiles that damages the aircraft and immediately extinguishes it. Your squadron deployed the P-8 operationally to the Middle East for the first time recently. What was the deployment like and how did the P-8 perform in the harsh desert environment ? The first P-8 deployment to the 5th Fleet AOR was definitely a trial run for the platform. The P-8 flew missions in the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea. Before the P-8 arrived, these areas were often split up into several different missions for different aircraft during the course of one day. It was actually a suggestion from a junior officer Naval Flight Officer who simply asked “why can’t we just do it all in one flight?” With the endurance and speed of the P-8, a single mission could cover the entire NAG, CAG, SAG, SOH,GOO,GOA, and BAM strait before returning home. The P-8 was also able to use several different airfields around the AOR as refueling points as the mission dictated. The inaugural 5th fleet deployment was also watched closely by our non-allied nations as well. USN The biggest challenge our maintenance team faced was keeping the planes clean from the constant sand and dust blowing into the aircraft’s engines and equipment bays. Despite this, we still had over a 95% on time take off (OTTO) rate. Secondly, it can be incredibly difficult to keep an aluminum tube running literally tons of electronic equipment cool enough in 120+ degree heat. If the systems reach 100 degrees internally, we have to shut down the mission systems to protect the circuits. Eventually, through some MacGyver type work from the maintenance team and Boeing, we stuffed an external air cart connector through a sonobuoy free fall chute, which dumped cold air through the aircraft, and we never suffered a mission shutdown after that. Secondly, from a pilots perspective, the aircraft performance aspect was often a limiting factor on takeoff and landing. The hot and humid air of the 5th fleet AOR made max gross weight takeoffs much more difficult than we normally experience while training stateside. Through a combination of speed increases, full 27,000 pound thrust, bleed air off takeoffs, we were able to take along enough fuel to execute each mission. The P-8 can execute a ton of different mission sets, what were the main ones that you were called on to provide while in the 5th Fleet AOR? Given how congested the waters are in the 5th Fleet AOR, there can be thousands of unidentified small fishing, merchant, and other vessels. Through a combined use of our radar, ISAR, and camera, the P-8 can transit the entire AOR, updating thousands of contacts through Link 11 and Link 16. The area of operation also contains some very popular smuggling routes for narcotic, weapons, and human smuggling. We would often provide overwatch for VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure) teams during boardings of suspected dhows for illicit cargo, often resulting in the successful interdiction of weapons, drugs, and human trafficking. Cockpit of the P-8., USN The P-8 also provided overwatch during US or allied ship transits through maritime choke points (or sea lines of communication) in order to provide the consistent and real time situational awareness required to deconflict any potential maritime interactions that might impede the safety of the maritime environment. We also participated in operations in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, providing support to coalition vessels operating in the vicinity of the Bab al Mandeb Straits. How do the busy and tense littoral waters found in the Middle East, especially in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, complicate submarine hunting ? In the congested and relatively shallow waters in the Middle East, there is a significant amount of ambient noise, which makes the passive tracking of submarines more difficult. With thousands of small fishing vessels as well, it could be easy to miss a periscope on radar amongst hundreds of contacts. The Arabian Gulf plays host for a few different flavors of submarine search. There are some nations who are very competent in their submarine tactics, and others who are still progressing through the early stages of quieting and tactics. The Arabian Gulf does play host to a variety of out of area-deployers that we were active in tracking, which also helped to maintain crew currency before transitioning to 7th fleet AOR. Iran’s mix of attack and midget submarines poses a threat inside the tight confines of the Persian Gulf., AP Did the P-8 partake in any interdiction missions to stop Iran from sending arms to Houthi rebels in Yemen? Yes, as you saw in the article that I sent you , on one of the first missions in theater, one of our crews located and tracked a large dhow suspected of smuggling weapons to the Houthi rebels. Coordinating with the USS Sirocco , the crew stayed on station, resulting in the successful interdiction of hundreds of AK-47s, RPGs, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. This is also where the Triton is also extremely effective. Triton can stay on station significantly longer than the P-8, and is able to provide eyes on any vessels of interest until a P-8 or surface asset can arrive on station. Some of the weapons destined for Houthi rebels seized by the USS Sirocco with an assist by the P-8, USN Iran’s threat against a P-8 flying near its borders made national news . Did you experience any tense moments while flying ISR centric missions near potential enemy borders? There were definitely some more interesting moments while conducting Strait of Hormuz transits in accordance with international law and the United Nations Convention of Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The majority of the time, the questions from foreign controllers were professional; however, there was the occasional query that was a little more challenging. Conducting yourself in accordance with international law and UNCLOS, and responding in a professional and courteous manner is the standard. There is usually at least carrier strike group in the region, along with other US Navy and allied ships, not to mention many aircraft. How does the P-8 integrate with carrier strike group operations? I know that the initial talk was that P-8 might be assigned to specific CSGs, however, as the platform has developed we are not assigned directly to a strike group. Most of the time, we are working in direct support of the strike group or an allied ship in theater. We can provide armed reconnaissance, escorts through congested waterways, full motion video, and help building the common operating picture (COP). We also often use HH-60Rs to help localize and track submarines as well, as their dipper is an effective localization and tracking sensor. USN How will the P-8 work with the Navy’s new MQ-4C Triton version of the USAF’s Global Hawk? Currently, the MQ-4C is being used as a long endurance, maritime ISR asset, that often times feeds us updated posits on contacts of interest. They can fly significantly higher and longer than us and are able to provide a more constant feed of ISR. The Triton will be flown and monitored out of NAS Jacksonville, and we have already seen some pilots and NFO’s being selected to operate the aircraft. MQ-4C Triton, USN How did operating in the Middle East differ to the time you spent in the P-8 over in Asia? The biggest difference between operating in the Middle East and 7th fleet, is the necessity for the immediacy of information. In the middle east, our capability for full motion video, and Link 16 uplinks are extremely important to the on the ground/sea commanders. Things happen in the middle east at a much more explosive pace than in 7th fleet AOR. Sending live updates with encrypted radios and communication is crucial because the information might be too dated to be important by the time we land. In 7th fleet, it is a long game. We are tracking more submarines and building a pattern of life for how other nations are acting. Even the slightest change in phrasing on a challenge from a foreign nation or added infrastructure in the South China Sea can be huge to updating how the political and military situation is changing. The Pacific Theatre compared to the Middle East offers its own, albeit very dissimilar environmental challenges , DoD The big wigs in the Pentagon like to talk about “the tyranny of distance” when talking about operating in that area of the world, which can be very difficult to work around. Building and maintaining relationships was also a big sticking point from last deployment, so that we can work in conjunction with our allied partners and deploy from anywhere to provide ASW, ASuW, and ISR capabilities across thousands of miles. We had aircraft detached out of Misawa, Japan, Kadena, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Diego Garcia, and scores of other countries across both theaters. China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea, and disputed territories off the coast of Japan are serious hotspots in the region, how was the P-8’s presence near and over these international hotspots important? VP-5 has been pretty active in following the building of islands in the South China Sea. The entire first deployment was dedicated to following the buildup of these islands, with the second deployment, in conjunction with VP-8, we continued to see the increase in both AA/AD (anti-access/area denial) and airborne assets being deployed from these islands. What weapons can the P-8 employ today and what are on the list for future integration? Currently the P-8 can primarily employ the MK-54 torpedo and the AGM-84D Harpoon. The i ntegration of the LRASM , HAAWC mod torpedo, and other niche weapons are also on the horizon. Given how new of a platform the P-8 is, we are still in the infancy of truly using the aircraft to its full potential. The P-8 Weapons School is now a completely separate squadron that is pushing forward the newest capabilities for the P-8 down the road. Preparing to load a torpedo onto a Poseidon. , USN Torpedoes are going to be launched from our weapons bay stations, with the capability to carry up to five Mk-54 torpedoes. An ASW attack is currently carried out at a low altitude, with the capabilities for a high altitude ASW coming with the HAAWC kit for the MK-54. For our primary ASuW weapon, we launch AGM-84D Harpoon missiles. The P-8 can carry up to four harpoons as well, and can shoot them in different modes and with both engine start before and after launches, from a wide variety of speeds and altitude regimes. P-8 during a Harpoon test drop sortie., USN The P-8 is the best ASW localize/track platform in the fleet, one of the best maritime ISR assets in the world, with the ability to identify and track hundreds of contacts, and complete the kill chain for both surface and subsurface contacts if necessary. The training wheels of the P-8 are only just starting to come off, and with the development of aerial refueling, AAS pod, Triton, and the Block 2 Harpoon, the P-8 is quickly becoming one of the most complete/multi mission aircraft in the US military. There seems to be two different forms of thought within the maritime patrol community as to how the P-8 and its mission set will evolve. One points to a much broader set of missions, where P-8s may even support ground troops, or provide overland armed reconnaissance, or even work as an arsenal ship along with other functions. The French are doing some of this with their old Atlantique IIs today , kinetic missions included. On the other hand, more traditionalists in the maritime patrol community want to keep the aircraft locked more strictly in traditional ASW, ASuW, sea control and surveillance roles. How do you think the P-8 and its crews will evolve in the coming years? This is purely my own opinion, but what we have seen from the fleet and combatant commanders, is that they want to keep the P-8 a maritime ISR and submarine tracking platform. The aircraft is optimized for this mission set, but it is being expanded with future capabilities like AAS. I believe that you will start to eventually see an evolution of the P-8 over time, in that as the P-3 and EP-3 begin to be phased out, the P-8 will slowly pick up those mission sets. I do not think it will ever become a true overland weapons truck asset; however, the plane definitely has the capability to accomplish these mission sets if the need arises. USN If you could have three things added to the P-8 and/or its weapons menu what would it be? Polled some of the guys in the squadron on this— Block 2 Harpoon will be a nice addition, but the addition of LSRASM is definitely something we are looking forward too, along with a search and rescue kit that can be dropped through the weapons bay for when we are tasked with that mission. Can you tell us about a few missions or memories that you have had in the jet that really stand out as unique, exciting or personally special? From a mission standpoint, it is often the ready launches or last minute tasking that always results in the most exciting days in the aircraft. One flight we were re-tasked to rig a foreign submarine, coming down to a few hundred feet and 300 knots. Seeing the submariners on the bridge while we flew by was a pretty humbling experience. Often times we are operating tens of miles away from our targets, looking through a camera lens. However, flying by and seeing that they’re just the same as your crew, some mid 20 year olds cruising around the world in your government’s couple hundred million dollar asset is a pretty funny realization. P-8 high over the USS Zumwalt., USN Lastly one of my personal favorites was flying into different airfields around the AOR that hadn’t been visited by a US maritime asset since my dad flew into them in a EP-3 in the 1980s. He has just a couple more hours than I do (about 16,000 more) and referring to him for some guidance before a flight was a pretty cool changing of the guard experience for both of us.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 19, 2020",This Crazy Militarized Semi Is Bristling With 240 Artillery Rockets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It looks like it belongs on the G.I. Joe aisle of a toy store rather than on an actual battlefield, but there is no doubt the UAE’s Jobaria Defense Systems were thinking big when they designed their Multiple Cradle Launcher (MCL). The concept combines an Oshkosh M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter with a 29-meter trailer outfitted with four multiple rocket launchers that hold 60 122mm rockets each. That’s a grand total of 240 rockets at the operator’s disposal and a whole lot of firepower for a single land combat system to bring to the table. The main armament for the MCL is the Roketsan TR/TRB-122 Extended Range Artillery Rocket of Turkish origin. These rockets come in high-explosive and steel-ball warhead varieties, the latter of which sends thousands of steel balls flying at very high velocities after being detonated by proximity fuse. Nasty, nasty stuff. The high-explosive TR-122 has an effective radius of 20 meters, while the steel shot slinging TRB-122’s effective radius of double that. Both warheads weight about 40 pounds. Both types of rockets have a range of roughly two dozen miles. The fact that MCL has 240 of them to play with means that the system can rain down incredible destruction over a huge area in a single volley, and putting a lot of ordnance on a target in a short amount of time is what short-range rocket artillery is all about.. The MCL’s advanced fire control system is totally automated and each rocket can be fired individually, or all of them at once in one giant salvo at roughly two rockets per second. As such, the operator can vary the pattern density and warhead choice depending on the target in mind. For instance, to take out large formations of personnel and material scattered over a wide area, TRB-122 rockets can continuously blanket the widest area possible with hot shrapnel. If a highly localized group of structures or armored vehicles are the target, the system can be set to fire a string of high-explosive rockets over a small geographical area, pounding the target to pieces. A mix of both rockets can also be deployed for “mixed” effects. The size of the MCL, although visually impressive, has some drawbacks and advantages. The UAE procured the system because it cuts manning requirements down to just one tenth that of a traditional rocket artillery unit that would require six individual vehicles and 30 people to deploy the same amount of firepower. Also by putting all those rockets into one integrated system, its ease of operation and tactical flexibility can be leveraged to adapt fast to battlefield demands and to create tailored effects on the fly. Even rearming the system is simplified, requiring just one support vehicle that can rearm the entire MCL’s magazine in about 30 minutes during wartime operations. On the other hand, the MCL concept also presents a pretty large and unmaneuverable target to enemy forces. Unlike smaller truck-mounted rocket artillery that can speed about rough terrain and hide in many places, the lumbering MCL is far less survivable under certain circumstances. And if the MCL is successfully targeted, its 240 rocket payload can be wiped out by one strike. The relatively short-range of the rockets it carries also means the MCL will have to work in fairly close proximity to enemy forces. Still, the firepower and efficiency of the system is impressive, and for some sorts of warfare, such a protecting a country’s desert borders from attack, it make some sense. Jobaria is in the process of making a longer-range, harder-hitting companion to the MCL, dubbed the Twin Cradle Launcher (TCL). The concept was shown off at this year’s IDEX weapons expo in Dubai. Instead of four launchers for hundreds of smaller artillery rockets, two sets of four massive 300mm rocket launch canisters are incorporated into the system’s trailer which is about eight meters shorter than the one used by the MCL. This new system can supposedly accommodate two types of existing rockets. The Turkish-built TR/TRB-300 “Tiger” rockets , which have a range of up to 75 miles, or Chinese-built A300 rockets which have a range up nearly 180 miles. Either way, this system gives standoff capability that could help negative its size disadvantage. Although either of these rockets can be used against single targets or area targets, they do not possess the overwhelming area sanitization capability that the far shorter-range MCL offers. Long-range guided artillery rockets have become especially popular in recent years, as their quick employment time and easy deployability can offer aerial precision attack-like capabilities in a much more persistent and inexpensive manner. The Army and Marine Corps’ HiMARS system , and its GPS guided 277mm rockets, have become an all star in Iraq , and is likely to become the same in Syria . Meanwhile, in the highly contested South China Sea, Vietnam quietly forward deployed the Israeli-made “EXTRA” long-range GPS guided rocket artillery system to one of their own islands in the disputed body of water—putting some of China’s man-made island outposts in range of sudden and highly accurate bombardment. It is thought that the MCL, which was first unveiled in 2013, has been used operationally, most likely against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen . Hat tip to Task and Purpose for the video.

Paul Nickell And Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",Taking The F-14A Tomcat On Cruise For My First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In 1982, Paul Nickell was a “nugget” Naval Aviator heading to his first fleet assignment with VF-24 “Renegades” at the now fabled Naval Air Station Miramar near San Diego—also known as Fighter Town USA. His mount was the still somewhat unpredictable but fiercely powerful Grumman F-14A Tomcat. Not long after arriving he would set sail aboard the USS Ranger for his first cruise. In this the third chapter of our multi-part series about Paul’s adventures flying Navy fighters in the 1980s—from chasing SR-71 Blackbirds to having an engine explode beneath him—he gives us an incredibly intimate view of what it was like for a pilot taking the still adolescent Tomcat to sea for their very first time. Perfect timing I arrived at VF-24 in the fall of 1982. The Renegades had recently completed a Westpac cruise aboard the USS Constellation (CV-64) and were starting workups for their next deployment aboard USS Ranger (CV-61) which would begin in the summer of 1983.  It was perfect timing for myself and a RIO from my Replacement Air Group (RAG) class. Arriving at the beginning of the turnaround meant that we would have the benefit of all of the workup training and “at sea” periods before we actually deployed. I was immediately impressed by the professionalism of the squadron, and at the same time the great spirit that the aircrews displayed. Squadron life was unlike anything that I had experienced up to this point in my aviation career. I was no longer a student. Oh I had a tremendous amount to learn, but for the first time since I started flying, no one was filling out a grade sheet on me and debriefing my performance. That’s not to say that we didn’t debrief and learn from our training, but we focussed on what went well and what we could improve on, and to a large extent it was self critique. It was both refreshing and liberating! Courtesy of Paul Nickell Another new thing was that I now had a job within the squadron, as opposed to being just a student pilot. I was in charge of the “First Lieutenant Work Group.” I never knew where that name came from, but it was the group that kept our squadron spaces clean and well maintained. Additionally, since the squadron would be making it’s next deployment onboard Ranger , all of the spaces that we would inhabit when we went aboard had to be prepared for our arrival. The job definitely kept me busy, and during that time I worked closely with the squadron Executive Officer (XO) and got to know him very well. He was a Vietnam veteran, where he had flown the F-4 Phantom. He loved life, and lived it to the fullest. Unknown at the time, our paths would stay close together for the remainder of our time in the Navy. Chasing Blackbirds and evading SAMs Initially, the flight schedule was pretty slow for me, but it still provided more flights than the slow pace that the RAG had. The pace increased fairly quickly though as the squadron progressed through its turnaround. Our Operations Department, otherwise known as “Ops,” did a great job scheduling me on all sorts of varied training flights. On one mission with two Tomcats, we flew into the restricted areas northwest of Los Angeles and ran intercepts against SR-71 Blackbirds. It was great training for the Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) flying intercepts against very high and fast targets. The speeds and altitude differences made the intercepts very challenging, arriving in valid missile launch parameters only for fleeting seconds. From a pilot’s perspective, I remember it being a very stressful flight because as wingman I spent a lot of time flying in close formation at night in the clouds (commonly referred to as ”in the goo”) as we transited back and forth to the restricted area. Renegade into the vertical, USN One mission that I really enjoyed was flying low level routes. It was generally an exercise in navigation and timing, and the Tomcat had a reasonably reliable navigation system to help out. However, we always had topographic charts with routes and timing drawn out on them as a backup. The great part was the sense of speed that you experienced at very low altitude, and also the sight seeing. The bad part was that there was very little margin for error, and very little time to recover if anything went wrong. We also did low level intercept missions. I remember one in particular where we were in a restricted area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with two Tomcats and we were running intercepts down through narrow gorges. It was like some of the video games that are available today, except the rocks were very real and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking.  Other flights included going up to the Death Valley and Panamint Valley areas and practicing evading the surface to air missile (SAM) threats. It was fun for the pilots, but miserable for the RIO’s. Typically it involved all sorts of octoflugeron maneuvers in which only the pilot knew what was coming and the RIO was just along for the ride. In an actual SAM situation the RIOs would have been completely looking outside for missiles, but in this environment there were no real missiles, only electronic indications of missiles airborne. Finicky cats Probably the bulk of our training flights were air combat maneuvering (ACM) missions. We would fight about any other type of aircraft available. Typical ACM flights were against A-4s and F-5s and were usually flown in the Socal area west of San Diego or just east of Yuma, Arizona. At other times we had the opportunity to fight Navy and Marine F-4s, and also hosted Air Force F-15s. David Barnak/USN The one thing that we didn’t do was fight 1 versus 1 with other F-14s (1 V 1 similar). Shortly before my arrival at VF-24, the squadron had lost a Tomcat flying 1 V 1 similar. The problem with 1 V 1 similar is that since you were fighting aircraft of equal capabilities, it all boiled down to aircrew capabilities. Usually they would limit engagements to rear quarter missiles and guns, so the fights would often quickly degrade into groveling for a shot, and because of engine problems, that was not a good place for the F-14A. At slow speed and high angle of attack, with the engines in full burner, the F-14A’s TF30 turbofan engines were prone to compressor stalls. Any air disturbance into the intakes, possibly caused by jet wash or yaw, could cause a compressor stall, and a compressor stall on one engine in this situation could lead to a flat spin due to thrust asymmetry. That’s what happened in the movie Top Gun , and that’s what happened to the Renegade F-14. USN The Renegade crew actually recovered the aircraft from the spin, which may have been a first, but the motors had cooked themselves from being stalled for so long, and they would not restart. Eventually the crew had to eject. The end result was that in VF-24, we did not do 1 V 1 similar until several years after I joined the squadron, and after a very scripted 1 V 1 similar program was put into place. Not long after I arrived at VF-24, one pilot and one RIO were selected to attend the Topgun Power Projection course. They were both in their first tour with VF-24, and both had completed the previous cruise aboard Constellation . They were chosen to attend the course by the squadron CO, based upon their performance in the squadron up to that time. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Depending upon available slots, most fighter squadrons got to send two crews through the course during a normal turnaround period between cruises. At the time, I knew very little about Topgun, other than that they provided adversary support. As the crew progressed through the course, I would see them passing through the squadron on their way to and from Topgun training missions. It quickly became obvious to me that the instruction they were receiving was far above anything I had ever been exposed to. Also they would soon become the leaders in VF-24 with respect to fighter tactics based upon their six weeks of exposure to the navy fighter tactics authorities (the Topgun staff). Although I wasn’t in any position to attend Topgun at the time, I set my sights on attending during the next squadron turnaround. Spinning up for deployment As our turnaround progressed, preparation for our next cruise intensified. We did a “Gun Det” at Miramar. “Det” was short for detachment, and detachments normally meant that you deployed to someplace other than your home base. Dets were always fun because they brought the squadron together and built great camaraderie. Unfortunately, because money was tight at the time, we were not able to deploy to another base, so we did all of our gunnery out over the Pacific, while operating from Miramar. If you couldn’t leave your home base, I’ll have to say that San Diego was a pretty good place to be stuck! For the det, the squadron was divided up into four teams, which competed for the most target hits. We shot at towed airborne targets, and without going into all the details, we were able to get an accurate count on the hits for each pilot. At the end of each day, we would watch all of the day’s gun camera film and debrief from it. Although gunnery was to a large extent done by the pilots, the RIOs played an important role in monitoring the pattern being flown and locking up the target on each firing run. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Shooting the M-61 cannon in the F-14 was a kick in the pants. We were limited to 50 round bursts, and that only took half a second to complete. We were definitely slinging some lead! At the end of the det we had a kangaroo court with awards, both serious and humorous, and all in all, it was a great week of work. I had done a lot of rifle shooting in high school, and air to air gunnery in the F-14 came pretty naturally to me. I did well with it, and that would influence my future role in the navy. Other dets included a two week Red Flag exercise at Nellis Air Force Base , and an air wing det to NAS Fallon, in Nevada. Unlike today, there was very little integration between the Air Force and Navy in the early ’80s. Red Flag was my first exposure to working with the Air Force, and it was definitely different. Red Flag was much bigger picture and larger scale training than I had ever experienced. It involved helos putting people on the ground, B-52s airborne, and everything in between .  It seemed the biggest threat while we were there was getting sent home by the Air Force for flying into the wrong piece of airspace . We were constantly skirting around the Tonopah Test Range and Area 51 , using only topographic maps and landmarks. We constantly made light of all of the Air Force’s areas to avoid and all of their rules, but they were really serious about them. We were threatened a few times, but fortunately none of our aircrew were ever sent home. Courtesy Paul Nickell Soon after Red Flag, we went to NAS Fallon for two weeks with all of the squadrons in our air wing, Carrier Air Group 9 (CAG-9). CAG-9 was composed of one helo squadron, an E-2 squadron, an S-3 squadron, an A-6 squadron, an EA-6 squadron, two A-7 squadrons, and two F-14 squadrons. All of these squadrons would deploy together on our Ranger cruise. Fallon was a great place to fly out of, located in the high desert with high and rugged terrain to the east where the ranges were located. It also didn’t have all of the Air Force rules that Nellis did. The ranges were fully instrumented so that missions could be recorded for debriefing purposes and also simulated missile shots could be taken and recorded. It also had simulated surface to air missile threats available. Early on we did a lot of part task training, but as we progressed through the det, the scale of our exercises got larger until the end where we were conducting large scale coordinated strike missions. “Paddles” in training Intermixed with these detachments, we were starting to conduct at sea periods as an air wing aboard Ranger . Initially it simply involved going out to update our carrier qualification currency. Each pilot got several day and night traps , but other than the Landing Signal Officers (LSOs, but also sometimes referred to as “paddles”), none of the aircrew stayed aboard the ship. Following that we did a ten day at sea period, a five week at sea period, and then our final Operational Readiness Evaluation (ORE) for the carrier and air wing which lasted about a week. All of this was done in the waters off the coast of southern California. Courtesy of Paul Nickell When I checked into VF-24, I told the Operations Officer and the current squadron LSO that I was interested in becoming an LSO. I felt that seeing carrier type landings from the opposite perspective, on the ground watching the aircraft approach and land, had really helped me survive Tomcat carrier qualifications in the RAG. Becoming an LSO was a big undertaking, but I felt it would help me be the best carrier pilot that I could be, and also the squadrons were always looking for pilots interested in taking on that responsibility. Initially it involved working with the squadron LSO during field carrier landing practice (FCLP) periods, attending a two week LSO school, and then working with all of the air wing LSOs aboard the ship. Paul and his LSO cadre standing on the LSO platform aboard Ranger . , Courtesy of Paul Nickell Ultimately, once I was qualified as a squadron LSO, the performance of the entire squadron coming aboard the boat would be my responsibility, and it was a big one. During these workup at sea periods I began to get experience waving aircraft coming aboard. In CAG 9 the LSOs were divided into four teams, so we had LSO duty every fourth day. On our LSO days, we would be on the LSO platform for anywhere from five to seven aircraft recoveries of 15 to 20 aircraft each, and as a rule we did not fly on those days. The other 3 days we would fly and the schedulers were pretty good about keeping us up with everyone else for flights since we missed every fourth day. There was always one of the two air wing (CAG) LSOs plus five to six LSOs from the different squadrons for each recovery. We would take turns waving the recoveries, under the eye of the CAG LSO. Also one of us would be the writer, and record the aircraft number, wire caught, grade, and LSO comments for every landing. Following each recovery, we would journey to all of the squadron ready rooms and debrief the pilots who had just come aboard on their landing. Paul in his LSO vest standing in front of a Royal Navy Sea Harrier with a fresh “Zap” on its fuel tank. , Courtesy of Paul Nickell I loved being on the LSO platform! Just standing out in the raw elements, on beautifully sunny days or pitch black star filled nights, watching those awesome machines maneuver their way aboard was absolutely amazing. Unlike landing the Tomcat, being an LSO seemed to come very naturally to me. I quickly developed an eye for what the proper airspeed and glideslope looked like for the different aircraft of the air wing, and progressed rapidly as an LSO during our workups. It didn’t hurt to be training under our squadron LSO, who was one of the best in the air wing. One of the biggest benefits of my LSO training was the impact it was having on my own landing performance. I wasn’t close to ace of the air wing, but my own landing performance was definitely improving. Putting on the final touches A great deal of the flying off of the ship during workups involved simulated defense of the battle group, and in particular the carrier. We had prepared for this back at Miramar while completing Fleet Air Superiority Training (FAST), which was run by Topgun. It involved a series of classroom lectures and then a number of simulator sessions. This was the height of the Cold War and the training focused on defending the battle group against Soviet Bear, Badger, and Backfire bombers and all of the air to surface missiles (ASM’s) that they could carry. It also involved a great deal of electronic warfare and electronic countermeasures. The simulator was the perfect place to practice these missions. Once we were on workups, we would practice the command and control while aircraft from the beach would fly out and simulate attacks on the battle group assets. As part of the the training for the smaller ships, we were at times tasked with flying missile profiles against them. One of these missions was particularly memorable for me. Courtesy of Paul Nickell We were flying directly at the ship from about 50 miles away, starting at about 45,000 feet and mach 1.4. Passing through about 35,000 feet, all of a sudden I was slammed to the right side of the cockpit and it sounded as if someone was beating on the canopy with a sledge hammer, a couple of times per second. It was pretty intense for about five to ten seconds and I slowly started reducing the throttles back out of afterburner. It turned out to be a compressor stall in the left engine, and once I got it out of burner, the stall cleared and everything returned to normal. We were able to continue the profile and make a low supersonic pass at the fantail of the target ship, to the delight of a large group of sailors jumping up and down and waving. One other thing that I got to do prior to my first cruise was a live missile shoot. On virtually all of our training missions we would carry AIM-9 Sidewinder missile simulators. The Sidewinder was a close in heat seeking missile. The simulator was a Sidewinder, but it had no warhead and no rocket motor. Unlike shooting the gun, we did not go out and shoot air to air missiles on a regular basis because of their expense. However, new missiles were shot at times evaluating different areas of their envelopes, and old missiles were shot for aircrew training as they approached the end of their shelf life. That was the case for my shoot. It was over water northwest of LA, and it was a shot at a drone. Fortunately we were able to locate the drone with the radar, lock it up, get a good missile tone, and take the shot. I never saw the target. It was very small and from about a mile and a quarter straight behind it, I would have needed binoculars to acquire it. Once I had the tone, I squeezed the trigger and instantly the missile departed the right pylon with an audible whoosh, and a trail of white smoke. It actually rolled the aircraft to the left momentarily. It was a non-warhead shot, so there was no explosion. We returned to Miramar and were told that the shot was a success, with the Sidewinder passing very close to the drone. The shoot wasn’t overly exciting, but it was good to know what to expect if I ever had to fire a missile in combat. Courtesy of Paul Nickell With workups complete, we were ready to depart on cruise. Our cruise schedule was like a seven and a half month vacation. On a regular piece of typing paper, double spaced, the ports of call filled the page. We would be in Pearl Harbor in just over a week. After that we would go to the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand before spending some time in the North Arabian Sea south of Iran. Since the Iran hostage crisis had begun, there had always been a US carrier in the North Arabian Sea. But the crisis had ended several years before our cruise, and the decision had been made that there would no longer be a US carrier continuously on station there. We were to arrive there and relieve Midway, spend a couple of weeks on station, and then bolt for ports in Perth, Australia, Hobart, Tasmania, and Sydney, Australia. After that we would make our way back to the Philippines for a long Christmas stay, then on to Hong Kong, Korea, Hawaii and back to San Diego. It almost sounded like a luxury cruise! However, in the final few days before we departed, rumors were starting to spread about unrest in Nicaragua. A sudden turn south Ranger departed the pier at North Island early in the morning in mid July. All of the families at the pier waving goodbye knew something was up, but no one including those of us onboard knew exactly what it was. As soon as we got out to sea, things rapidly went south, literally and figuratively. The battle group turned left and headed for the coast of Nicaragua. On the second day out, a sailor on the flight deck was blown overboard, and his body was never recovered. The next morning, we were awakened by the call of “General Quarters, General Quarters, all hands man your battle stations…this is not a drill.” It turned out that Ranger had been underway replenishing (UNREPing) with a supply ship, and had gotten too close to the supply ship.  Once that happened, the venturi effect of the water passing between the hulls pulled the ships together, and the ships collided side to side. It was not a major collision, but did damage an aircraft elevator and do other damage to the starboard side of the ship, none of which would be repaired until we reached in the Philippines. USS Ranger circa 1983, USN We proceeded on south to the coast of Nicaragua, and assumed a station. For about the next month, we remained there on station, primarily bringing dignitaries out from all of the Central America countries and putting on airshows to demonstrate the power of a carrier air wing. It was a miserable time onboard Ranger . The ship was supposed to be in the shipyard undergoing rework. However, the decision had been made to delay the rework and send it on another cruise. Ranger couldn’t make enough fresh water, so water was continuously being rationed. Just about the time you got all soaped up in the shower, the water, perfumed with a hint of jet fuel, would cut off. As a result, I always filled a five gallon bucket with water before I started soaping up, so I would have water for rinsing. Also, in the warm coastal Pacific waters, the engineering department couldn’t keep the ship cooled down. Our squadron had a 110 man bunk room for a large portion of the enlisted men. By 0100 to 0200 every morning, when the majority were trying to sleep, the room would be over 100 degrees. Most got very little sleep. As the First Lieutenant Officer I did everything I could do to make the situation bearable, but it was a losing battle. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Finally, President Reagan’s “Gunboat Diplomacy,” as Newsweek called it, was over and we headed west for Pearl Harbor. Soon we reached the cooler waters of the Pacific and the ship began to cool down. We arrived at Pearl a day or two short of our first “Beer Day” (45 days at sea without a port). It was a beautiful morning, just after sunrise, and manning the rails in summer whites was a sobering experience as we silently glided past the USS Arizona Memorial to our pier. Pushing west After a quick liberty in Honolulu, we were westbound in the Pacific, and well behind schedule. Flight ops on a carrier require the ship to turn into the wind, which may require the ship to turn 180 degrees and go opposite the direction it’s trying progress. As a result, while we headed for the Philippine Islands (PI), flight operations were limited. However, once west of Hawaii, the Tomcat squadrons began manning alerts any time flight operations were not being conducted. Paul mans an Alert 5 jet, Courtesy of Paul Nickell Normal alert duty lasted for four hours. Initially you would suit up in flight gear and remain in the ready room or wardroom for the first two hours on Alert 15, meaning you had 15 minutes to be airborne. After the first two hours, you would man up the Alert 5 aircraft and sit in it for the next two hours. The Alert 5 aircraft would be parked near a catapult and was required to be airborne within five minutes after the launch was called. It was very easy to doze off while sitting in the alert aircraft with your helmet on and visor down. All of a sudden the plane captain would start beating on the side of the aircraft to signal that they were launching the alert. The race was on between your aircraft and the other Tomcat squadron’s aircraft. Lowering the canopy, starting engines, getting a final inertial navigation position, breaking down the chains and chocks and taxiing to the catapult were all done within three to four minutes. Five minutes after the first startling bang on the jet, you were hurling off the the catapult and accelerating on a hot vector for an unknown target. Talking about a rush, dreams to a cat shot in five minutes, it can’t get any better than that!  Usually you had no idea why you were being launched. Sometimes it was to ID a ship, but often it was to intercept aircraft including Soviet Bear and Badger bombers. Usually they would be intercepted hundreds of miles from the battle group and escorted continuously until far from the carrier and departing the area. A VF-24 Tomcat sits Alert 5, Courtesy of Paul Nickell We slipped into port at Subic Bay, Philippines during the night. Probably before I had awaken, the Filipino workers had boarded and started attacking the mangled metal from our collision on the starboard side of the ship. We spent two weeks there, operating from Cubi Point Naval Air Station. The flying included work with the Air Force from Clark Air Force Base , and also doing night FCLP at Cubi Point to maintain landing currency. Leaving the PI we were still well behind schedule, so our ports in Singapore and Thailand were cancelled, and we proceeded directly to the North Arabian Sea. The Midway was not allowed south of a certain latitude until we were north of it. On station in the Middle East We were now the on duty carrier in the North Arabian Sea. We spent the next several weeks flying a very full flight schedule. Because of all of the time we would have in ports in the latter part of the fourth quarter of the year, we had a lot of fuel money to burn now. Most of the flying involved escorting Iranian aircraft and checking out/photographing all of the ships transiting the area. Occasionally the Soviets would come out and checks us out, providing some higher profile escort missions. Renegade on Bear escort duty, Courtesy of Paul Nickell We also did several days of overland work with the Omani Air Force, flying Hawker Hunters and Jaguars. The pilots were British, they knew the country like the back of their hand, and they loved to fly low. No matter how low you flew, they were always below you, regardless of whether you were on level terrain, or in the canyons. It was a blast working with them. On about October 21st, 1983 we said goodbye to the North Arabian sea, and started steaming southeast for Perth, Australia. October 23rd was a no fly day. We were in an All Officers Meeting (AOM) in the ready room when all of a sudden the ship started healing heavily, which meant we were turning hard. Immediately heads started turning, all of us looking at each other and shaking our heads. Everyone knew that something was up. Within 5 minutes, the captain came on the 1MC (ships PA system) and informed the crew that the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon had just been bombed, and we had been ordered back to the North Arabian Sea—this time indefinitely. A Omani Hawker Hunter circa 1983, Courtesy of Paul Nickell It’s worth mentioning that communications in the early ’80s was nothing compared to what it is today. There were no internet, no email, no cell phones, and no personal computers. The turnaround on normal mail back to the states was about a month. If you asked a question of family back home, a month or so later you might have a reply. In port, you were able to make international long distance calls, but they were very expensive. In the PI, there was a small building full of phone booths that you would go into. You would give the clerk the phone number and then be sent to a booth.  Eventually the phone would ring, and when you picked it up, you would be connected.  Also there was no CNN and very limited news from back home. Consequently, we had very little idea of what was actually going on in the world. As soon as we left on cruise, we started doing contingency strike planning for the different areas of the world that we would be near. So over time, with the lack of outside information coming in, and the constant preparation for combat, you pretty much felt like you were on the brink of war. And at that point during the Cold War, any war could rapidly lead to World War III. We quickly returned to the North Arabian Sea. Since it was generally believed that the barracks bombing had been instigated by Iran, contingency planning for strikes into Iran began in earnest.  We started to fly rehearsals of entire strike missions, but all done over water as opposed to over land. On November 1st, we had another general quarters which was not a drill. A fire had broken out in the number four main machine room, and fire fighting went on for hours.  Finally the fire was extinguished, but six sailors died and 35 were injured in the battle. This seven and a half month “vacation cruise” had very rapidly becoming a pretty dismal affair. Ranger seen from Paul’s Tomcat, Courtesy of Paul Nickell Eventually things settled back down to the normal North Arabian Sea ops. However, there was no end in sight. Soon the remainder of out port schedule began to fall apart. There was no relief carrier in sight, and after the barracks bombing, there was no way that the North Arabian Sea would be left without a carrier for the foreseeable future. Because our schedule had provided so many days in port, we had used up most of our fuel allocation early in the quarter. Now that the ports were rapidly going away, we were short on fuel money to fly, as were all of the squadrons in the air wing. The end result was that there were more no-fly days, and on the fly days the majority of the schedule was night flying so that pilots could maintain their night carrier landing currency of one night landing every seven days. One bright spot was “beer day! ” Normally there was no alcohol on the ship, however if you went 45 days without a port, the ship had a beer day. Obviously it was a no-fly day! Everyone on the ship could have two beers, provided by the supply department. Another bright spot for the aircrew was flying. At least we got to leave the ship for a couple of hours when we flew. The poor non-aircrew never got away from it. Landing aboard Ranger, Courtesy of Paul Nickell The second “Beer Day” wasn’t as bright, as we had now been at sea for 90 days with no ports. In fact it was getting pretty depressing. Finally sometime after Christmas, rumors started circulating that the Midway was coming back to relieve us, and eventually those rumors came true. If we had been allowed to depart the North Arabian Sea a few days earlier, we would have been able to stop in Thailand or Singapore for a port call, but the powers that be would not let us transit south of that magic line of latitude until the Midway was north of it. Homeward bound Standing on the flight deck as we passed Singapore for the second time this cruise without stopping, we at least could see the city and waved. The next morning we made a short detour south to cross the equator and then headed back to the north. With an all morning ceremony, those of us who had remained disgusting pollywogs for the entire cruise, were finally initiated into the ranks of the trusty shellbacks . Courtesy of Paul Nickell We made a brief stop in the PI, and then headed east for Pearl Harbor. We flew enough to remain night current, but kept the ship moving east as quickly as possible. Approaching Hawaii, we were finally able to stand down the alert 5/15 watches. In Hawaii we picked up the Tigers, family members who were allowed to ride the ship back to San Diego, based upon available space. Courtesy of Paul Nickell I was fortunate enough to have my dad along for the week. He was a Navy veteran of World War II, as a B-24 Liberator radioman in the Pacific theater. In his 4 years in the Navy, he had been on a ship once, transiting from San Diego to Hawaii. This Tiger Cruise allowed him to finally complete his round trip back to San Diego. There was plenty to keep the Tigers busy during the week of sailing to San Diego. The air wing conducted an airshow just like the ones that had been conducted off the coast of Nicaragua early in the cruise. Also there were tours of all of the different parts of the ship. The day before Ranger arrived in San Diego, the air wing squadrons flew off to their respective Naval Air Stations. After a full squadron flyby at Miramar, we came back into the break in sections and got our first non arrested landing in a long time. What a tremendous feeling it was to finally be back home. Courtesy of Paul Nickell The next morning we were at the pier at NAS North Island as Ranger docked, and the ships company and Tigers came ashore. Concerning that full page port schedule we had received before we departed on cruise, two things happened as planned. We departed on cruise as scheduled, and seven and a half months later we returned as scheduled. Nothing else between those dates happened as scheduled, and most of the ports didn’t happen at all. But cruise was over—I had survived! Fighter Derby The turn around began. Veteran crews began to leave the squadron for shore duty, and newly trained crews began to arrive from the RAG. Shortly after our return, I was informed that two crews had been selected by the CO and Ops Officer to attend the Topgun Power Projection Course, and I would be one of the pilots. I had seen the difference that the course had made in the previous turn around’s Topgun graduates, and now that I was very comfortable in the Tomcat, I was up for the challenge. It was a dream come true! After graduating from Topgun early in the turnaround, the remainder of the 15 month period went very much like my first VF-24 turnaround.  Another Red Flag, another gun det (this time to NAF El Centro ), another NAS Fallon det, and a det to MCAS Yuma for Fighter Air Readiness Program (FARP) and the Fighter Derby were all a part of it. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Fighter Derby was a competition between all west coast F-14 squadrons for a year period of time. Each squadron would deploy to Yuma at some time during the year and fly their missions on the instrumented range east of Yuma. All of the missions were two F-14’s against four Topgun adversary aircraft plus a wildcard aircraft attempting to sneak in from behind during the intercept. VF-24 had prepared extensively for Fighter Derby and developed tactics based upon the airspace, the threat, and their expected tactics.  I was the section lead for one of our first sections to compete. We started the intercept accelerating to about Mach 1.1. The RIOs did a great job with the intercept, detecting the pincer tactic and spotting the wildcard attempting to sneak in from behind. With forward quarter shots, we took out the two lead bogies, blew through the trailers and flew to the southeast corner of the range. Decelerating, we cross turned back into the remaining bogies chasing us, and tried to reacquire them with radar and visually. Naturally the tiny bogies had no problem visually keeping track of the F-14s, known by adversary pilots as the “aluminum overcast” due to their size. We immediately began to accelerate, and when we did reacquire the bogies, one was rolling in on our aircraft, and one on our wingman. We both started to turn defensively, but the way the geometry worked out, I was able to shoot the bogie off of my wingman, and shortly after that, he was able to kill the bogie that was attacking me. We immediately bugged out to the west and moments later, a “knock it off” was called. Shortly after that my RIO asked, “what happened?” I was never quite sure if he didn’t understand why the knock it off had been called, or if I had put him to sleep with the Gs somewhere along the way and he was just waking up. I laughed for a long time over that. Fighter Derby trophy and the VF-24 crews who won it., Courtesy of Paul Nickell We proceeded back to Yuma, landed, and downed both aircraft for over-stress inspections. Our section got a perfect score for our engagement; four bogie kills, no fighter kills, and detecting the wildcard. A number of other Renegade sections did the same, and all did well. Our tactical game plan had worked. Eventually we learned that the Fighting Renegades were the 1984 Fighter Derby champs! More engine surprises In October of 1984 we manned up for an afternoon flight in the warning area off of San Diego. I don’t remember exactly what our mission was, but we were the flight lead for a section of Tomcats. We were taking off from the shorter Runway 24 Left at Miramar. In VF-24 we did not do section takeoffs, where both aircraft rolled down the runway together in a tight formation. The wingman normally waited about 10 seconds after the lead started rolling, before commencing his roll. I was centered halfway between the left edge of the runway and the centerline, and my wingman was on the right half. I was in minimum burner, and as I hit about 135 knots and was starting to ease back on the stick, there was a huge boom from my right side, and the aircraft immediately started to pull right. I countered with left rudder and kept it on my half of the runway as I slowly continued to rotate the aircraft. Slowly lifting off, I added more burner and carefully monitored the angle of attack gauge, keeping it below 14 units. Early in the life of the F-14, aircraft had been lost because of getting to a higher angle of attack with the large thrust asymmetry associated with an engine failure. Another problem in the early F-14 days was an uncontained catastrophic engine failure where the aircraft was damaged so badly by the engine coming apart, that the crews had to eject. Fortunately for us, each engine was now were encased in a 1,000 pound titanium sleeve to contain engine failures. One of the Tomcat’s massive and troublesome TF30 turbofans, USN The one other thing that had been added to the aircraft to try to prevent flat spins was an engine stall warning system. It consisted of flashing amber lights up on the sides of the windscreen, and an aural annunciation of something to the effect of “right engine stall” repeatedly. The aural annunciation began immediately after the boom, and would not stop! Intercom communication between myself and my RIO, and radio communications with air traffic control (ATC) were almost impossible for me to hear. Our wingman joined up as I flew the departure and limped the jet out over the water. Eventually we got our volumes up and were able to hear each other and also ATC over the stall warnings. We circled back to the east and flew a single engine approach to Miramar. After taxiing back to our ramp and shutting the remaining engine down, we got out and looked into the right engine burner can. It was full of mangled turbine blades. My biggest regret was that I didn’t grab a few blades as souvenirs. After our wingman returned to land, we debriefed our short flight. They informed us that when the engine blew, there was a huge cloud of smoke that temporarily obscured our jet on the takeoff roll. I had survived another close call but not the closest. Distractions We were now approaching our next cruise on USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63). The ops tempo was picking up rapidly with workup at sea periods. I had just been given good news/bad news by my CO. My three year sea tour in VF-24 was just about over, and the detailer had notified my skipper that I could have orders to Topgun as an instructor having completed the course as a student just months prior. Unfortunately, my CO had informed the detailer that he needed to extend my time in VF-24 for the duration of the Kitty Hawk cruise, because our other squadron landing signal officer was leaving the Navy for the airlines. They call it “needs of the Navy.” There was no guarantee that I would still get orders to Topgun when the cruise was over. I was disappointed, but if I wasn’t going to be at Topgun, there was no place better to be than VF-24. I was now in a leadership position there as the Pilot Training Officer and Squadron LSO, and life was very good. There was one significant distraction as we prepared for deployment. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Shortly after we returned from the Ranger cruise, we had used money from our coffee mess to completely rework our squadron ready room in the hangar. When Hollywood decided to film a movie about Topgun , they started scouting out shoot locations, and they chose our ready room to film the opening classroom scene. So in the midst of working long days and then doing FCLP at night, Hollywood invaded our squadron spaces for about a week. With huge spotlights shining in the windows from outside, and a smoky haze being pumped from machines into the room, Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer, and the rest of the cast repeatedly filmed their scenes, and between shoots, wandered around our spaces. It was definitely interesting to witness, but unfortunately we were almost too busy to take it all in. Final hurrah with the Fighting Renegades We departed on cruise on schedule, and Kitty Hawk was a much better ship from which to operate. It was significantly larger, and the flight deck arrangement made operations much easier than on Ranger . Besides Hawaii and the PI, we had two additional ports on this cruise; Mombasa, Kenya and Columbo, Shri Lanka. Neither was high on our list of places that we wanted to go, but both were better than nothing, and we made the best of them! Courtesy of Paul Nickell Fortunately this cruise had no beer days. As we transited back through the PI on our way home, we had our final Foc’sle Follies where carrier landing awards were passed out. The VF-24 Fighting Renegades won the Top Hook award as a squadron for the best landing grades of the cruise. One of our department heads took the individual Top Hook award for the entire cruise. I was awarded three Top 10 patches for being in the top 10 pilots in the air wing for two of three line periods, and for the entire cruise. Finally , I felt vindicated for my landing struggles in the RAG. It had been a long and painful process, but I had learned lessons that I would use and pass to others for the rest of my aviation career. I also received word that I would be receiving orders to Topgun upon my return to Miramar. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Leaving VF-24 was bittersweet. It was probably the most exciting and fun time of my life. Being a young junior officer (JO) flying a Tomcat around Miramar, the USA, and on and off of an aircraft carrier was just about unbeatable. The morale of the squadron itself was without a doubt the best. We had a tremendous group of mostly bachelor JOs, and the few wives that we had could hang with them. Our senior officers were JOs at heart. No matter the situation, we found the humor. The activities that we planned, the skits that we came up with, the videos that we made, all were absolutely hilarious. You know that you’re in the right place, when the JOs from your sister squadron want to come to your squadron activities and parties. VF-24 had been the time of my life, but it was now time to move on.

Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka,"Posted on Dec 27, 2019",A Hornet Weapon Systems Officer’s View of the Navy’s Suffocating Jet Crews,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Being hypoxic in a military fighter jet is no joke. Back in 2010, my pilot and I were returning from a training mission in the southern California desert when we noticed the cabin pressure gauge in our F/A-18D Hornet had spiked to nearly 20,000 feet. This was essentially our current altitude—and not a good place to be if you do not have supplemental oxygen. To complicate matters, I was not wearing my oxygen mask on our transit back from the training area. Normal cabin pressurization hovers around 8,000 feet, so my habit (like many others) was to not wear supplemental oxygen when in a purely administrative flying mode. Big mistake. I noticed pretty quickly that I could not say or remember my flight’s callsign. I fumbled with connecting my mask for what seemed to be eternity. In reality, it was probably only about 10 seconds but my hand dexterity had diminished. The lack of oxygen to my brain turned a simple task into a very difficult one. Once I was able to properly secure my mask and receive a good flow of air, using supplemental oxygen from the jet did not immediately remedy my affects. I still felt sluggish and slow. Thankfully, my pilot had his oxygen mask on the entire time and said he felt fine. NATOPS procedures require an emergency descent below 10,000 feet to get the jet and cabin to a safer altitude. We quickly descended at a rate of about 6,000 feet per minute, while our wingman followed us down. This was not a comfortable situation, as the terrain rises steeply into mountains just east of MCAS Miramar. After about a minute below 10,000 feet, I began to feel normal, but the resultant lack of oxygen was a shock to the system, and a clear indicator that hypoxia onset is quick, debilitating, and potentially deadly. My situation is referred to as “histotoxic hypoxia,” which is the disorienting feeling associated with lack of oxygen. I tell this story to let folks know the recent issues with F/A-18 Hornet cabin pressure and oxygen incidents are nothing new . More importantly, I am scared for my fellow F/A-18 Hornet and T-45 aviators and I know something must be done to correct this situation. Naval Aviators are climbing into a machine that may kill them—and it’s not from what you may think, say, a surface to air missile or an enemy fighter. Because of a recurring problem with the oxygen and cabin pressurization systems—more commonly known as OBOGS, which stands for On-board Oxygen Generating System—in the Navy’s F/A-18 fighters and T-45 trainer jets, an alarming increase in episodes of hypoxia for aircrew have occurred. Hypoxia is a deficiency in the amount of oxygen to the body which can lead to fatal consequences. This problem has become so serious and frequent, T-45 flight instructors boycotted training flights last week. Ed Darack via Getty Images The biggest concern is that this is a glaring safety issue beyond what is an already dangerous job. A job that includes night arrestments on aircraft carriers and dropping bombs in hostile areas of Iraq and other locations we cannot speak about. Now, naval aviators are having to deal with malfunctioning equipment that is truly a silent killer—causing lack of precious oxygen in the cockpit, and to air crews’ most important instrument—their brains. Unfortunately, the Navy admits progress on solving the issue is currently at the head-scratcher stage. But the real question is this: Has Naval leadership and engineers at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) really done all they can do to try and solve the problem? It’s not like they haven’t had a great deal of time to come up with a fix. According to testimony from Navy leaders to Congress this week, “Since May 1, 2010, all models of the F-18 show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes.” The Navy has investigated 382 cases of physiological episodes induced from the F/A-18 system. Investigators have determined failures occur in two main categories: breathing contaminated air and loss of cabin pressurization. According to the Navy, 130 incidents involved some form of oxygen contamination while 114 involved a failure of the jet’s system that maintains cabin pressure. USN Every naval aviator goes through altitude chamber training so they can recognize early onset of hypoxia caused by cabin depressurization. The instructors take the chamber up to 25,000 feet where trainees remove their masks and then try to play a simple game of patty-cake. The results are both humbling and hilarious. Most folks can’t clap their hands together after about 15 seconds. Continued oxygen deprivation at those types of altitude leads to an unconscious state and ultimately death. It is safe to say that quickly recognizing hypoxia is a critical element to staying alive—even for private and commercial jet aircrews. https://youtube.com/watch?v=AGOsB2_um1k For the record, cabin depressurization is what killed professional golfer Payne Stewart and his fellow passengers back in 1999. In a strange twist of fate, Payne joined me and 15 other trainees in the Navy’s pressurization chamber as we were going through altitude training together back in 1998. The 1991 and 1999 US Open champion had been invited to ride in a Navy F-14B as part of a morale, welfare, and recreation event. He followed up his Tomcat ride by playing nine holes at the NAS Oceana golf course, where the crowd followed as he talked about each shot. The Tomcat did not have an OBOGS system, but relied on pure oxygen instead. OBOGS provides oxygen rich breathing gas to the aircrew using engine bleed air that is cooled and then routed to an OBOGS concentrator. Inside the concentrator, nitrogen is removed using two molecular sieve beds—commonly known as “kitty litter.” The resultant cleansed air is then pumped to the aircrew. The system provides a continuous supply of oxygen, avoiding the need for constant replenishment of liquid oxygen like in the F-14. Today’s fleet naval aviators appear to be getting a good old fashioned run around as no current solution for repairing OBOGS currently exists. Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker admits that the oxygen issues are “the number one safety priority.” But he also admits there is “no smoking gun” they can find to solve the problem. With a problem that has been going on for greater than seven years and shows no signs of slowing down, one would think there was at least some concerted effort to indicate what is causing the problem with OBOGS. The only known treatment for the issue has been to regularly change out the kitty litter. In addition to increased aircrew training, the Navy has also gone so far as to install a decompression machine onboard deploying aircraft carriers. Both of these solutions seem to be only treating the resultant issues and not the actual causal factors. It is time for a far more concerted effort to defeat this problem. NAVAIR must take a critical look at data from a much larger cross section of jet flights. The problem appears to be with the system and not jet specific—as even the latest Super Hornet, the EA-18 Growler, has reportedly had issues . A small sampling of data from only a few training command flights is not enough information to determine the causal factors across the fleet. Additionally, pilots must report after every flight how the system worked—or did not work—along with critical flight parameters. Maintenance teams will need to track and periodically check OBOGS potentially after every fight. Maybe this is already being done, but naval leadership has not communicated up and down the chain of command what the plan is to solve this problem. Lack of communication has led to some serious consequences and I personally applaud those T-45 instructors who took a stand. T-45 Goshawk, USN I don’t personally have an answer to this problem, but I do know that time is no longer on a Naval Aviator’s side with the OBOGS issue. Delayed production of the F-35C (and ultimately a reduced number of purchase Lightning IIs) means the Hornet and Super Hornet, along with its OBOGS problems, are here to stay. To Naval Aviation leadership’s credit, there has not been a “fly or else” mentality towards pilots who have to climb into those machines. However, not flying over the long term is simply not an option. Solving this problem is going to require an all hands effort from pilots, engineers, and leadership. It must or it will be just a matter of time before we will lose someone. Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka is a valued contributor to The War Zone.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 21, 2021","Here’s America’s Plan for Nuking its Enemies, Including North Korea","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States had terse and cryptic words for North Korea’s reclusive communist regime after it tested yet another ballistic missile on April 4, 2017. Unnamed White House officials said the “clock has now run out” for authorities in Pyongyang and reiterated a previous threat that “all options are on the table.” “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote in an unusual three sentence statement . The curt remarks were the latest in a string of increasingly tough rhetoric between American and North Korean officials beginning in March 2017 , including a Pyongyang spokesman’s threat of “ a preemptive nuclear attack ” if the United States resorted to unilateral military action. But how might the United States actually respond to these provocations and potential doomsday scenarios? Well, we’ve found some answers inside the U.S. Strategic Command’s (STRATCOM) Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8010. While it doesn’t explicit allow for an American preemptive strike, it is the literal nuclear option. “With the end of the Cold War the international landscape has changed,” the July 2012 version of the document explains in a section called “framing the problem.” “The global security landscape is marked by protracted conflict, constant change, enormous complexity, and increased uncertainty.” “While dynamic security concerns in space and cyberspace evolve, traditional threats to national security continue to be presented by sovereign states, both the peer and near-peer and those regional adversary states with emerging WMD [weapons of mass destruction] capabilities,” the authors wrote, adding their own emphasis. STRATCOM We obtained a heavily redacted portion of this document through the Freedom of Information Act, as well as a similarly censored excerpt from a previous, February 2008 edition. The 2012 version wouldn’t otherwise have been up for its first declassification review until 2022. There is a section that details “countries that present global threats,” but the un-redacted portions of the document do not describe North Korea by name. Unclassified text specifically mentions Russia and China, but to does not suggest either one is an imminent danger to Americans. “The term ‘enemy’ is used in the singular form throughout this document for simplicity,” the OPLAN says. “However, because of the global view of this plan and the varied nature of the adversary set, multiple enemies are addressed.” STRATCOM Though not necessarily surprising, “normally they don’t like to list any names,” Hans Kristensen, head of the Federation of American Scientists’ Nuclear Information Project, told The War Zone in an Email. “It looks like there are now (2012) five adversaries in the plan: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and Syria,” he posited, based on the number of redacted paragraphs. This would make sense, given that officials in Washington see all of these as potential adversaries who either have nuclear arsenals or are seeking to obtain them. Russia and China both maintain stockpiles with hundreds of warheads, as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the United States. The U.S. government believes Iran’s nuclear program is focused on weapons development, despite repeated denials from their counterparts in Tehran. And in 2007, Israeli warplanes bombed an apparent covert nuclear reactor in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor governorate. Kim Jong-Un makes regular and well documented visits to the country’s nuclear sites., North Korean State Media Of course, it’s possible that instead of Syria and Iran, the paragraphs could have mentioned nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, who continue to experience significant tensions, linked in no small part to the continuing disagreement over the final status of the Kashmir region. The publicly released portions only refer to actors seeking WMD, too, which could encompass countries or non-state groups seeking to build up large stockpiles of chemical, biological, or radiological weaponry. “Rapid technological evolution and the wide civil availability of formerly advanced military capabilities have reduced ‘entry costs,’ making available completely new weapons and enabling actors to access capabilities that would not have been available to them in the past without significant investment,” STRATCOM’s plan says. “Blurred boundaries and overlapping claims to sovereignty in global domains will continue to present national security challenges.” But it seems unlikely North Korea hasn’t made the list. Under the helm of its young leader Kim Jong-Un, the country routinely declares its intention to build nuclear weapons—ostensibly as a deterrent to the U.S. military and its allies in South Korea and Japan—describes itself as a nuclear state equal to America, and repeatedly threatens to use these arms in a confrontation with its sworn enemies. Since 2006, it has detonated at least five suspected nuclear devices of varying strengths. The fifth test in September 2016 involved a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile, according to North Korean state-run media. “We don’t really know how big North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is, or will be once the ‘standardized’ warheads are deployed to the missile forces,” Jeffery Lewis, who runs the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, wrote at the time for Foreign Policy . “But its not a small number, and certainly not just a handful. And it’s likely to keep growing.” On top of its nuclear warheads, North Korea has been steadily improving and expanding its ballistic missiles with an eye toward being able to threaten the United States, or its territories in the Pacific Ocean such as Guam and Hawaii. In the April 2017 instance, U.S. Pacific Command initially said it believed the country had launched an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) called the KN-15 . Two months earlier , Pyongyang’s forces had debuted this weapon , known inside the country as Pukkuksong-2, which appeared to be an advanced version of an earlier missile intended for the North Korean navy’s submarines. Later, other reports suggested the weapon fired just days ago might actually have been a medium range ballistic missile (MRBM) known as the Hwasong-7, also called the Scud-Extended Range or Scud-D. In March 2017, North Korea fired four of those weapons toward Japan. North Korean State Media MRBMs generally feature ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 kilometers. IRBM class weapons have ranges between 3,000 to 5,500 kilometers, according to the Pentagon. A missile in this second, longer range category would be able to hit American military facilities in Guam from anywhere in North Korea. If officials in Pyongyang resort to WMD attacks for any reason, OPLAN 8010 swings from “deter” to “defeat,” stressing in its text the need for American political will to employ “strategic forces if deterrence fails.” As part of a standing mission dubbed Operation Global Citadel, the Pentagon maintains a so-called “Nuclear Triad” of nuclear-armed heavy bombers, land- and sea-based ballistic missiles. Smaller fighter jets can carry the B61 thermonuclear gravity bomb, if necessary. The United States is deeply invested in a multi-year effort to both upgrade its nuclear weapons and delivery platforms. At separate events in 2016, the Air Force announced it would call its future stealth bomber the B-21 Raider . Northrop Grumman is planning to build dozens of the flying-wing style stealth aircraft, hopefully delivering the first examples sometime in the mid-2020s. The Air Force is also exploring plans to replace its Minuteman III ballistic missiles, amid reports of delays over costs . The U.S. Navy is working toward beginning construction of its new Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines . The service expects to buy the first boat, the first-in-class USS Columbia , in 2021. A new nuclear bomb and cruise missile are also in the works. Whatever weapons STRATCOM employs, the goal is clear: “attack the appropriate enemy ‘system’ to eliminate the enemy’s capability to fight and influence key decision makes to cease hostilities.” B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers sit next to each other at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam., USAF Unsurprisingly, specific details about the actual missions for any of these weapons, current or planned, are still classified. Reliable deterrence is a balancing act between giving potential opponents just enough information to be scared, but not enough to develop safeguards that would make the strikes ineffective. That means there are still important elements that are free to share. The most important is that the United States does not have a policy of “no first use” when it comes to thermonuclear war. Most of the specific thresholds are redacted, but the OPLAN specifically says the president can order STRATCOM to respond “in the event of a hostile act or intent.” STRATCOM “There is nothing in this [OPLAN] that indicates a constraint on potential nuclear use, except that strikes have to comply with the Law of Armed Conflict, etc,” Kristensen explained. “That is in and of itself important, not least because the 2013 Nuclear Employment Strategy explicitly states that the United States does not target civilians.” But that leaves open a lot of room for interpretation. While the United States does not deliberately target civilians, it still kills them accidentally in conventional strikes, as have been reported in Iraq , Syria, and Yemen . The presence of innocent bystanders is not necessarily enough to abort a strike. “The implication is nuclear use only in extreme conditions,” Dr. William Burr, who runs the nuclear history documentation project at the National Security Archive at The George Washington University, told The War Zone in an email. “I would say that in such a circumstance, the decision would be left to the president and his advisers. One size would not fit all so to speak.” Given the immense power of America’s nuclear weapons, one might hope that the danger of causing massive collateral damage would be major factor, but it’s not a given. That’s where the OPLAN’s specific mention of “proportionality” comes into play. “The use of any weapon, kinetic or non-kinetic, must comply with the key principles of [the Law of Armed Conflict]: military necessity, avoidance of unnecessary suffering, proportionality, and discrimination or distinction,” the document explains. “All of these principles will be taken into account when developing and executing courses of action.” The ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland fires an unarmed Trident II D5 during a training exercise. , USN Taken together, these factors “all mean—to the extent they are followed and not watered down by operational considerations—that there is at least an intent to try to limit collateral damage and civilian suffering that presumably is reflected in the strike plans,” Kristensen says. “The requirement in OPLAN 8010-12 for “proportionality” raises the issue of how a nuclear response to a conventional attack could ever be proportional? However, in 2010 and again in 2013, U.S. government reviews on how and when to employ nuclear weapons concluded that they were not “sole-purpose,” meaning the President should only be able to authorize their use during an all-out nuclear conflict. From the parts of OPLAN 8010 that are available to us, the United States has and continues to leave open the possibility of using these weapons in response to a conventional or non-nuclear WMD attack on Americans or allies covered by mutual defense treaties, such as South Korea and Japan. If North Korea were to launch a nuclear-tipped barrage of missiles, a U.S. military strike in kind would hardly be disproportionate. “The use of WMD by any state has impacts to international security,” a declassified portion notes. “Strategies for one adversary will not necessarily be appropriate for another adversary.” In addition, it is possible that STRATCOM’s “proportional” strikes could involve conventional rather than nuclear weapons. Though the headquarters has operational control over America’s nuclear arsenal, its aircraft in particular could carry conventional payloads. Since 2014, first B-1 and then B-52 strategic bombers demonstrated this dual ability as they pounded Islamic State terrorists in Iraq and Syria. In January 2017, B-2 stealth bombers flew all the way from the United States to drop smart bombs with high-explosive warheads on one of the group’s camps in Libya . STRATCOM In this vein, it’s important to note that the official title of the 2008 edition of the OPLAN was “Global Deterrence and Strike.” STRATCOM changed this to “Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment” four years later. This change in phrasing could have something to do with plans for the employment of conventionally-armed bombs and missiles, or not . The handy “classification guide” – a comprehensive table of what is and isn’t secret – from the 2008 version says “that OPLAN 8010 consists of various attack options” can be unclassified, secret, or top secret depending on the details. “The fact that OPLAN 8010 consists of various nuclear attack options is unclassified. The number of nuclear attack options is secret. The details of nuclear attack options are top secret,” an additional note explains. This would seem to imply the plan covers nuclear options only. During the administration of President George W. Bush, there was another plan that appeared to cover global, strategic conventional strikes, including pre-emptive operations, called OPLAN 8022 . A separate nuclear plan, OPLAN 8044, also existed. Pentagon efforts to create a capability called “Prompt Global Strike” created confusion about whether this involved nuclear or conventional arms, or both, and whether it would be dangerously difficult to tell the two apart. A ballistic missile carrying a high-explosive payload wouldn’t necessarily look different from one with a thermonuclear warhead at the tip. “Eventually, the two missions merged to some extent into OPLAN 8010,” Kristensen noted. “It is a fuller strategic plan that attempts to incorporate more elements of national power to apply pressure and achieve strategic effects on specific adversaries.” An unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile rockets away from a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California during a test., USAF Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee North Korea will get the desired message. The pariah state has long defined itself by its opposition to intimidation and pressure and as we at The War Zone have already reported , the stern American rhetoric may only validate their opinions and propaganda, pushing them further toward a rash decision. OPLAN 8010 specifically mentions this and six other risks. Four of the others are almost completely censored. And what do you do when “adversaries misperceive messages?” The plan recommends nuclear commanders “constantly assess culturally appropriate strategic communication strategy, tightly integrated through the interagency process.” Regardless, “we’ve always had all options on the table,” former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said on CBS’ “ This Week ” earlier in April 2017. “I wouldn’t take any off.” One of those options available to Trump and his administration is definitely the strike plans inside OPLAN 8010.

On Jan. 14, 2017, in one of his last trips as U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry climbed aboard a U.S. Air Force C-146 Wolfhound cargo plane at Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City. The small military plane with a discreet, civilian-style paint job would take him more than 150 miles southwest to Ca Mau. The airport serving the small city south of Mekong Delta was too small to accommodate Kerry’s more common transport, the C-32, which is a derivative of Boeing’s 757 airliner. In Ca Mau, the top American diplomat and Vietnam War veteran would take tour of some of the old battlegrounds, talk with locals about reconciliation efforts in what was once part of South Vietnam, and learn about environmental restoration projects in the area. But this wasn’t the first time Kerry made use of a C-146 for official visits to more remote parts of Vietnam. In December 2013, a Wolfhound took the Secretary of State and more than 40 staff to the Mekong Delta region and then on to the Philippines to announce a $25 million aid package following the devastating Typhoon Yolanda. And that time, a previously unknown U.S. special operations task force helped him get where he needed to go. According to documents The War Zone obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Joint Special Operations Air Detachment – SN (JSOAD-SN) was responsible for making sure Kerry reached his destinations safely. This unit is mentioned in the footnotes of a heavily redacted copy of the 2013 annual history for the Air Force’s 353rd Special Operations Group, which is headquartered at Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. We do not know what the “SN” stands for in the acronym. Censors removed nearly any mention of the detachment’s operations from the history’s main narrative. We also don’t know if the unit was still active as of January 2017, when Kerry returned to Vietnam. At the time of writing, U.S. Pacific Command had not responded to questions about the unit’s name and basic functions. Department of State However, one can still glean a significant amount of detail from the history, related documents and other publicly available information. Most importantly, the Air Force’s 524th Special Operations Squadron undoubtedly provided the aircraft and crews. The squadron, nicknamed the Hounds, is the only unit flying the C-146s. As of June 3, 2013, there were two Wolfhounds in the Pacific region, according to another table the author previously obtained via the FOIA. Moving Kerry around definitely seems to have been one of the bigger operations for JSOAD-SN during 2013. On Oct. 30, 2013, the detachment drafted a concept of operations specifically for the specialized airlift mission in Vietnam, according to the citations. “The theater [commander] selected the Hounds based on their professionalism, reliability and ability to operate in austere environments,” the 524th declared in a review of its activities after being named the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) squadron of the year for 2013. The author received this document through yet another FOIA request. But the detachment was not dedicated solely to moving dignitaries around remote areas of the Pacific. Soon after Typhoon Yolanda made landfall in the Philippines on Nov. 8, 2013, American special operators rushed to assess the damage, distribute aid and move wounded and displaced civilians to safety. This support came in no small part from American troops already in the country conducting counter-terrorism operations and others who had arrived shortly before for separate training exercises. A stock shot of one of the 524th’s C-146 Wolfhound , USAF “On 18 November [2013], the first MAGMA C-146 crews from JSOAD-SN arrived,” according to the 353rd’s annual history. The 524th commonly uses the call-sign “Magma” on missions all around the world . The specific mention of the detachment made it clear the unit was distinct from Joint Special Operations Air Detachment – Philippines (JSOAD-P) at Edwin Andrews Air Base in Zamboanga on the island of Mindanao. In the Philippines, the Wolfhound flew from Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base on the island of Cebu, “which they used as a hub to conduct relief shuttles to and from airports in the disaster zone.” With the help of multiple crews, the C-146 was flying nearly non-stop during the disaster relief mission, which the Pentagon dubbed Operation Damayan. In just four days, the team from JSOAD-SN was responsible for rushing two civilians to a hospital in Manila for surgery, delivering more than 40,000 pounds of humanitarian aid and transporting nearly 270 refugees to safer areas. The special operators performed their last flights on Nov. 22, 2013. And that wasn’t all. The 353rd’s annual review cites two JSOAD-SN after action reports unrelated to Operation Damayan or assisting Kerry and his staff. One is dated March 13, 2013, while the unit published the other on Aug. 26, 2013. A C-146 at Duke Field, Florida , USAF It is entirely possible these secretive missions were actually quite banal, involving the discreet movement of advisors or gear for training exercises or other exchanges with long-standing partners, such as the Philippines or the Republic of Korea. It is equally possible these were missions of a more secretive nature. During 2013 alone, the 524th’s activities “included discrete operator movements, SOF [special operations forces] team airlift to austere locations, hurricane evacuation, humanitarian aid, ammunition resupply for [U.S. Army] Special Forces, and even SOF airlift in support of the President of the United States,” the squadron’s report for that year proudly declared. In January 2013, the squadron’s Wolfhounds brought elite troops right to front lines in Gao, Mali to support the French-led intervention against Al Qaeda’s north African franchise. Then, in December 2015, photographs appeared on social media showing a C-146 on an apparent covert mission in Libya along with elite American troops and their gear. There are no shortage of potential threats in the Pacific, which might require special operators and their unique skills. Since 9/11, the Pentagon has worked with allies in the Pacific to battle a number of Al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups. On top of that, U.S. military personnel have worked with counterparts throughout Asia to counter North Korean’s proliferation of missile and nuclear technology, illicit shipments of conventional weapons and other activities. Drug smuggling and piracy are always a concern, too. What we do know is, during 2013, the “Magma” crews from JSOAD-SN were keeping busy in the Pacific and were clearly ready for whatever missions came their way.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Lockheed Once Pitched the Massive C-5 as a Flying Command Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since its introduction in 1970, Lockheed’s C-5 Galaxy has been the U.S. Air Force’s largest cargo plane. In the late 1980s, the famous plane maker suggested its massive airlifter could take on a new role: airborne command post. On March 2, 2017, Lockheed posted artwork of this proposed model, unofficially known as the EC-5B. The firm intended it to be a replacement for the earlier EC-135C Looking Glass flying command centers, which would issue orders to the Air Force’s nuclear forces in a doomsday scenario where a major attack destroyed similar facilities on the ground. “Promotional literature noted the EC-5B is capable of accommodating all current and future [command, control, and communications] mission electronics, battle staff, support personnel, consumables, rolling stock, maintenance equipment, and spares,’” according to the caption Lockheed provided for the art, which is dated circa 1990. This configuration would replicate and improve upon the basic capabilities of the existing Looking Glass aircraft, which had first entered service in 1963. The EC-135Cs were just one of many variants of the prolific C-135 series, including the KC-135 tanker, all of which were relatives of the iconic Boeing 707 airliner. An Air Force EC-135C Looking Glass., USAF Lockheed would have been keen to try and snatch the contract away from one of its biggest competitors. By using the existing C-5B, which was still in production at the time, the company clearly hoped to offer benefits no Boeing product could match. For one, the EC-5B doomsday plane concept featured a rear-mounted aerial refueling boom. But along with its long-range communications gear, all the EC-135Cs had this equipment in order to perform this function on a limited basis in an emergency. This could have been critical to keeping the planes on airborne alert if a sneak attack blasted other supporting aircraft or if the demands of any counter-attack required additional tankers. However, unlike the smaller Boeing aircraft, Lockheed’s proposal envisioned a plane that could perform its function in the sky or on the ground. In its transport configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to 83,000 pounds of cargo. The standard C-5B could accommodate more than three times that payload. As a result, the previously cargo-carrying EC-5B would have space for “life support provisions for autonomous operations over a protracted period from small, austere dispersal airfields,” the art’s caption noted. In short, crews could decide to land the aircraft at safer, remote locations and continue operations without immediate outside support. This is where the C-5’s huge size may have been advantageous as it could theoretically sit on the ground at an austere location, even operating in a pressurized state for long periods of time during a nuclear crisis or exchange. The jet’s ability to get back into the air again is a whole other issue considering the C-5’s notoriously low mission capable rate. Ultimately, the Air Force decided not to buy Lockheed’s super-sized flying command post. On July 24, 1990, the service stopped its continuous Looking Glass missions, instead keeping the EC-135C fleet on the ground on 24 hour alert. A standard C-5B cargo plane., USAF Then, in 1998, the Pentagon decided the U.S. Navy’s E-6B Mercury , another Boeing 707 derivative, would take over the mission as part of the expanding role of the centralized U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Previously, these naval airborne command centers had only been responsible for maintaining contact with ballistic missile submarines if an attack knocked out other communications systems, a mission known as Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO). The Pentagon is aware that their collection of 707-derivatives will finally be nearing the end of their lifetimes in the coming decades. The Navy accepted the first E-6A in 1989 and then began transforming the entire fleet into the improved B models eight years later. The E-6s are among the last 707 derivatives Boeing ever built. Among various communication equipment and other systems, these aircraft now carry the airborne launch control system , which can issue fire commands to troops in missile silos down below. The last set of major E-6 upgrades, which Boeing completed in 2003, is supposed to keep the Mercuries operational through 2038. The Air Force is hoping to replace its E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) and E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) radar planes, as well as the OC-135B Open Skies surveillance aircraft well before 2040. By 2018, new Boeing KC-46A tankers should be starting to take over for the older KC-135s. The E-6Bs have received other minor updates since 2003, too. In 2014 , one touched down at Patrick Air Force base sporting an additional dome, possibly housing a new communications antenna. On Feb. 7, 2017 , another left Edwards Air Force Base in California after testing a set of three new antenna radomes , a modification that will likely become standard across the fleet. The most recent series of upgrades for the E-6B saw its outer mold line change with extra bumps on top and bottom., USAF Still, it takes time to develop and test new aircraft in general. This is especially true for specialized planes intended for critical missions such as the E-6. “We’re only 20 years from 2038, but if you’re going to build large aircraft with huge command and control you need to start thinking about those things right now,” Air Force General John Hyten, head of STRATCOM, told reporters on March 8, 2017. “That’s what the Navy is starting to do. I’ve requested that they start looking at defining what comes next.” Hyten also suggested it would be smart for the Air Force to team up with the Navy to figure out what an upgrade or replacement for the E-6Bs might look like in the end. “The requirements on the Air Force side – the size and shape of the airplane, the capacity, the endurance – are very similar missions,” the general said. Both services will undoubtedly want a plane with state-of-the-art communications and defensive gear, shielded against everything from nuclear explosions to cyber-attacks . Ever more fuel-efficient engines to help keep flying costs down and endurance up will also be a must have for any Mercury replacement. Though Lockheed could partner with another firm to offer a proposed replacement, the company does not currently make a readily suitable aircraft for this mission itself. With the Galaxy long out of production, and seeing as those that are still flying, even in the modernized C-5M form, are expensive machines to operate, it is all but certain we will never see the EC-5 airborne command post concept become a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Shedding Some Light On The Pentagon’s Most Shadowy Aviation Units,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On May 2, 2011, a group of special operators from the top secret Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) descended on an unassuming compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In an ensuing fire-fight, members of SEAL Team Six shot and killed infamous Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Due to an accident during the operation, the elite troops had to leave behind evidence of previously unknown stealthy transport helicopter , likely related at least in part to the ubiquitous UH-60 Black Hawk. The incident offered a rare window into the activities of the U.S. military’s most secret aviators and a look at their unique aircraft. Although the secretive 160th Special Operations Air Regiment , otherwise known as the “Nightstalkers,” may get all the attention, layers of clandestine units far more obscure exist. Some of them are silently blazing the path for special operations aviation’s future. Though they often involve various military units and personnel from intelligence agencies, these sort of “black ops” are most commonly associated with the nebulous JSOC. When planning America’s most demanding military operations, which officials in Washington might never admit even occurred, these elements sometimes need very specialized aerial support. So, with help primarily from the U.S. Army and Air Force, the Pentagon has steadily formed a permanent and secretive infrastructure to provide aircraft and helicopters for these missions. As of January 2017, this included at least four different units across the services and within JSOC itself: the joint Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AVTEG), the Army’s Flight Concepts Division and the Air Force’s 66th Air Operations Squadron and 427th Special Operations Squadron. The bland-sounding AVTEG is situated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the home of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and JSOC. While little is known about this organization, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, we can now present its official organization. The U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) provided the following chart in response to a request for information about the group’s organizational structure. SOCOM The breakdown is almost completely standard. A unit made up of individuals from across the services, AVTEG has a command group and seven “joint” offices, including typical administrative, operational and supporting elements. The numbering scheme is standard across the Pentagon and the absence of a “J7” – usually set aside for a group in charge of creating joint operational plans, doctrine, training materials and exercises – is not necessarily notable. The sections specifically for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) – distinct from the common operational and intelligence components – are more unusual. With no description of the functions of these offices or details about their size and associated equipment, the chart provokes more questions than it answers. We have no idea whether or not it is even complete. Of course, none of that is surprising. A Russian-made Mi-17 helicopter from 6th Special Operations Squadron, also seen at top, which is the kind of foreign aircraft top-secret aviators might have, too., USAF Details about the other units are similarly scant. The Air Force Historical Research Agency, which had official records on every unit in the service, has nothing in its file for the 427th after 1972. It does not list the 66th among active squadrons on its website, either. It is possible that these are unofficial or cover designations rather than the formal nomenclature. However, the 427th resides at Pope Airfield in North Carolina and “provides U.S. Army [special operations forces] personnel opportunities to train on various types of aircraft for infiltration and exfiltration that they may encounter in lesser-developed training,” according to an official mission description that aviation researcher Andreas Parsch obtained through his own Freedom of Information Act request. The only readily available public mention of the 66th is from an Air Force manual on forward-area refueling point (FARP) operations, which also name drops AVTEG. Both units are exempted from over-arching rules regarding pre-site surveys and “for short-notice exercises and contingencies, AVTEG and 66 AOS may authorize the use of temporary FARP sites” based on the service’s approved parameters, according to the handbook. Oh, and there’s also its awesome patch . USAF Researchers and journalists have found evidence that these Air Force squadrons fly a mix of traditional military type aircraft like the C-130 and less common types, including Cessna C-208 Grand Caravans, Pilatus PC-6s, and CASA 212s and C-295s, over the years. The service went so far as to assign the official designations U-27A and C-41A to the Caravan and 212, respectively. There is even less information about the Flight Concepts Division or what aircraft it has in its inventory. But it would be reasonable to expect its fleet includes a diverse collection of American and foreign aircraft. In his 2015 book Relentless Strike , Sean Naylor said this unit had quietly transformed into the E Squadron of the Army’s equally secret 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment D, more commonly known Delta Force. However, on July 8, 2015, Army Colonel Paul Olsen briefed Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Norfolk District’s work, in which he described work on the Flight Concepts Division’s hangar as something “you will soon see.” Again, its possible that one or more cover names is in use to refer to these units. The obscure building itself sits secluded at Fort Eustis, Virginia behind multiple layers of fencing. The base’s fire chief isn’t even allowed in to check things out for emergency planning purposes. “Research activities are also conducted by the Flight Concepts Division that is highly secret and access for pre-planning purpose is non-existent,” an undated job posting explains. “Nature of their work is known to be hazardous.” A rare shot of a C-41A, believed to be assigned to the 427th Special Operations Squadron, at Andrews Air Force Base in 1993., USAF The exact relationship between these units, as well as AVTEG, remains unclear. There is, understandably, little official information available. A cursory Google search of .mil websites mainly turns up biographies of officers who list one of the elements among their previous positions, as well as vague job postings. Titles like “ operations officer ,” “ troop commander ,” and “ fire support officer ” are just standard military positions that offer no obvious clues as to the specific nature of the missions – no doubt by design. Of course, the U.S. military has had these types of units for decades. However, by and large, they had historically been ad hoc formations that lasted only as long as specific conflicts. During World War II, in Europe, what was then the Army Air Forces used modified attack planes and medium and heavy bombers to drop intelligence agents behind enemy lines, insert Office of Strategic Services (OSS) teams – a precursor to both the Central Intelligence Agency and Army Special Forces – and resupply those efforts and friendly partisan troops. From the United Kingdom, the Eighth Air Force’s used the nicknamed “Carpetbagger” for its component of these operations. The 801st Bomb Group (Provisional) and then the 492nd Bomb Group flew the actual missions with a mix fleet of B-24 Liberators, C-47 Skytrains, A-26C Invaders and British Mosquitoes. Another unit, which ultimately became the 885th Bomb Squadron (Heavy) (Special), conducted its own sorties first from sites in North Africa and then from bases in Italy. Similar “air commandos” supported operations in China, India and Southeast Asia, including providing dedicated air support for allied guerrilla units such as Merrill’s Marauders – the predecessors of the 75th Ranger Regiment – and the British Chindits . Modified B-24 Liberators, similar to these standard bombers, were among the U.S. military’s first special operations transports., USAF When the war ended, the Pentagon shut them down, only to have to bring them back for the Korean War. This procedure continued for covert and clandestine missions around the world for much of the Cold War. The CIA created its own network of cover companies, including the famous Air America, for similar duties. By the time America’s war in Southeast Asia was in full swing, things had not changed dramatically. To support an explosion of so-called “special activities” – covert and clandestine missions requiring the United States to be able to plausible deny involvement – in South Vietnam, Laos and then Cambodia, the Pentagon rushed to stand up new secretive aviation units. In 1964, the top U.S. military headquarters in Vietnam created a single entity to handle these top-secret operations, blandly titled the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observation Group (MACV-SOG). Though regular and special operations units worked with MACV-SOG, the Airborne Studies Group (OPS-36) was responsible for dropping agents and propaganda leaflets into North Vietnam and Laos, as well as parachuting supplies to teams already on the ground. The group’s First Flight Detachment at Nha Trang had six specially modified twin-engine C-123 Provider transports sporting a special dark-colored camouflage paint job and equipped with special navigational and communications gear. To help conceal American involvement in this operation, nicknamed Heavy Hook, American personnel trained Taiwanese and Vietnamese crews to fly the actual missions. Special brackets on the sides allowed personnel on the ground to swap out American and South Vietnamese Air Force insignia as necessary. An MC-130E Combat Talon in flight in 1991., USAF The C-123s were not particularly popular for the demanding missions. “The C-123 load capacity, operating range, and inability to fly in adverse weather greatly hampered airborne operations,” one 1964 review explained, according to a subsequent Air Force study of special missions. After initially resorting to shorter range helicopters, in 1965, the Pentagon approved plans to convert a number of four-engine C-130Es for specialized missions in Vietnam and elsewhere. These aircraft were the forerunners of the MC-130E Combat Talon and arrived at Nha Trang in 1966, where they joined the 15th Special Operations Squadron. For a time, both the 15th and First Flight Detachment flew together. MACV-SOG used the codename “Heavy Chain” for missions involving C-130s. Air Force and Army UH-1, CH-3, and CH-53 helicopters, along with Air America and other private companies working for the CIA also provided support to MACV-SOG and other clandestine units in the region. But “throughout the Vietnam conflict, [unconventional warfare] operations were tainted with the constant infusion of conventional military thinking,” the Air Force complained in its post-war review of special activities. “‘Dedicated air assets’ was a concept antithetical to the Air Force concept of the Single Manager – centralized control.” So, despite these activities, when the Pentagon decided to launch Operation Ivory Coast in 1970, the daring raid on the Son Tay prison camp in North Vietnam, officials had to craft yet another temporary task force. This process repeated itself nearly a decade later for Operation Eagle Claw, the attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran who had been swept up in the country’s revolution. An MH-6 Little Bird of the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, similar to the civilian Hughes 500s that Seaspray reportedly flew., US Army That embarrassing debacle, which left eight Americans dead at a remote site named Desert One, provoked a significant amount of soul searching in Washington and increased support for developing a standing set of special operations units to respond to various crises. International terrorism, the War on Drugs, and continued Soviet-backed insurgencies had already contributed to the Army’s decision to create Delta Force in 1979 and the U.S. Navy forming SEAL Team Six the following year. This in turn led the U.S. military to ultimately create new secretive aviation elements to support those forces. The most notable of these was a shared CIA and Army special operations element codenamed Seaspray , which reportedly had a mixed fleet of Hughes 500D helicopters and Cessna Grand Caravan and Beechcraft King Air fixed-wing aircraft. The Agency already had significant experience with flying specialized helicopters on top-secret missions, having crafted a pair of ultra-quiet, long-range, night-flying Hughes 500Ps as part of a project to tap phone lines in North Vietnam. Based at Fort Eustis, the group flew covert and clandestine missions from the Middle East to Latin America, routinely working with Delta Force, SEAL Team Six and the Army’s Intelligence Support Activity. Authorities in Washington ultimately decided to clearly delineate the responsibilities of intelligence agencies from the military and gave the Army full control of the unit, who renamed it the Flight Concepts Division. The force has continued to operate since then, shielding its operations for at least for a time under the codename Quasar Talent, according to Michael Smith’s Killer Elite . An Iraqi Air Force Cessna C-208, similar to the U-27As the 427th Special Operations Squadron has reportedly operated., USAF Though there is no official public record, it is likely the Air Force established the 427th and the 66th after Seaspray came under full military control as part of the Pentagon expanding these aviation capabilities. But there is little doubt these special operations aviators have been busy since the 1990s, though it may take decades for any formal information about their latest operations to come out into the light. I n December 2001 , Russian authorities arrested a group of contractors working for the Army – reportedly for the Flight Concepts Division – and the CIA in the far-eastern city of Petropavlovsk. The group was trying to surreptitiously buy Mi-17 transport helicopters for operations in Afghanistan. Nearly a decade later, there was the Bin Laden raid in Pakistan. Though members of the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment reportedly flew the stealthy chopper, this was precisely the sort of product one could expect to see come out AVTEG or the Flight Concepts Division. There’s also the matter of these shadowy Sikorsky S-92 helicopters operating in northern Syria surfaced on social media . For more than a year, these mysterious choppers had made appearances first at a major U.S. military base in Djibouti, then in Erbil in northern Iraq, and finally near the city of Kobani in Syria. No one seems to know who owns these rotorcraft, which have been devoid of any national markings, but they could belong to various U.S. government outfits or another regional actor. Officially the Pentagon does not operate the S-92, but it is exactly the kind of “non-standard” or “off-the-books” aircraft AVTEG or another of the secret aviation elements might provide for discreet operations. The fact that we don’t know for sure is the entire point of having these groups in the first place. We may just have to wait for another tidbit to turn up through FOIA –  and hopefully not another accident during an actual operation – for the next set of new details to emerge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 2, 2021",The Pentagon Thought it Could Retire the U-2 in 1969,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has gone back and forth repeatedly over whether it’s finally time to retire the venerable U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane. After the Budget Control Act capped defense spending in 2011, the service had even more reason to consider how much money it could save by replacing the iconic aircraft with other systems—most notably North Grumman’s RQ-4 Global Hawk drone. Now, newly declassified documents show the Pentagon thought advanced aircraft and satellites, as well as improving air defense networks, would render the U-2 obsolete decades earlier. As early as 1965, at which point the Dragon Ladies had been flying missions for a decade, military intelligence officials were already planning for their retirement. “Through long experience, the U-2 has proven to be an economical means to obtain high resolution photographic reconnaissance on a prompt basis,” a 1966 code-word classified recommendation explained. “Beyond the next two-to-three year time period, however, the need for the U-2 is less clear.” On March 13, 2017, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) released this information and more as part of Sunshine Week, a national initiative focused on open government and transparency. U-2 prototypes at Area 51 in , USAF In 1966, the Air Force’s Strategic Air Command (SAC) had 15 operational U-2s of various types, plus another four set aside for research and development, according to the report. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had another nine aircraft. The two parties had shared the project since 1954, when they agreed to work together rather than compete over funds and resources. The Air Force had canceled its own X-16 spy plane program as part of the deal. The next year, Lockheed’s U-2 made its first flight unintentionally at the secret Area 51 test facility , also known as Groom Lake, in Nevada. The aircraft’s design was so efficient it gained enough lift to take off as it taxied around on the runway. In 1956, the slender, single-engine aircraft began overflying the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. U-2s flew over Egypt’s Suez Canal during the Anglo-French-Israeli intervention. Over the next decade, operations expanded into Asia. The Air Force and CIA initially hoped the aircraft’s high-altitude performance would protect it from enemy interceptors and surface-to-air missiles. The U-2A could fly above 70,000 feet and the improved U-2C had a service ceiling of nearly 75,000 feet. But in 1960, the Soviet Union shot down one of the top secret planes, captured pilot Gary Powers, and exposed the project to the world. The United States immediately stopped all U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union immediately after the incident. In 1962, Soviet air defense troops knocked down another U-2 over Cuba during the missile crisis. The documents the NRO declassified show that military and intelligence officials were concerned about the Dragon Lady’s ability to continue performing its mission. The Air Force had installed countermeasures to jam enemy X-band radars. The CIA had initiated a secret project called Rainbow in an attempt to reduce the plane’s radar signature. However, The final outgrowth of that work had been Lockheed’s development of a successor aircraft, the high and fast-flying A-12, codenamed Oxcart. Able to reach speeds of Mach 3, that aircraft in turn led to the Air Force’s SR-71 Blackbird. In addition, the U-2’s limited range was becoming a problem. To solve that problem, the Air Force and CIA both installed aerial refueling receptacles on many of their U-2As and Cs, which became U-2E and Fs, respectively. They even successfully flew variants off aircraft carriers—U-2Gs and Hs—to get imagery of remote locations. The Air Force continued upgrading the U-2s, leading to the vastly improved U-2R. This version had an enlarged airframe and wing pods to carry additional sensors and fuel. A U-2R lands on the aircraft carrier USS America , US Navy But it still appeared the aircraft’s days were increasingly numbered. The 1966 recommendations noted the Dragon Ladies were only available for reconnaissance over “areas not heavily defended by surface-to-air missiles” and could respond to crises only “where defenses permit.” A separate 1966 proposal NRO released regarding plans to send A-12s to monitor developments along the Sino-Vietnamese border reinforced this point. “The survivability of this aircraft [the U-2] against strengthened Chinese air defense facilities is becoming increasingly doubtful,” CIA director William Raborn wrote to NRO’s head Alexander Flax. From NRO’s perspective, a combination of the A-12 and SR-71, a supersonic drone codenamed Tagboard, Corona and Gambit spy satellites, and upcoming air and space systems would simply make the U-2 unnecessary. With all of these assets available, the apparent risks of the old aircraft wouldn’t warrant investments beyond what the Pentagon and CIA had already budgeted. USAF Fast forward nearly 50 years and it’s possible to see how wrong these predictions were in the end. The reasons center mostly on the Air Force’s ability to rush U-2s wherever they might be needed and the ever-present cost factor. Spy satellites did usher in a new era of surveillance, but they couldn’t be everywhere at once. Unlike the U-2 or other spy aircraft, you couldn’t rapidly send satellites over a new area during crises, either. This remains a key limitation of publicly known space-based imagery systems. Tagboard was a flop. Originally, Lockheed intended special versions of the A-12, called the M-21, to launch the drone, known as the D-21. The mothership carried the pilotless plane on top of the fuselage. In the first flight test, the D-21 separated cleanly, but stayed dangerously close to the launching aircraft. During the fourth flight tests, the drone’s engine failed, causing it to slam into the M-21. The resulting collision destroyed both planes. Lockheed’s Kelly Johnson suggested the B-52 bomber as an alternative launching platform after the accident. But to get that arrangement to work, the drone needed a massive rocket booster so it could get up to speed. The Air Force launched just four of the redesigned D-21Bs over China between 1969 and 1971. Due to a series of technical problems, the United States never recovered any of the film canisters from these missions. The poor results, along with President Richard Nixon’s efforts to thaw relationships with the Communist government in Beijing, killed the project for good. The high costs of operating both the A-12 and the SR-71 dogged both aircraft. As Soviet air defenses and interceptors improved to the point they could challenge the planes—no matter how fast or how high they flew—those costs became even more pronounced. The CIA retired its last A-12 in 1968. The Air Force stopped flying the SR-71 in 1989. USAF At that time, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said it cost the Pentagon $85,000 per hour to fly the sleek jets. In 1993, a small number of SR-71s came back into service, but went into retirement for good five years later. Although there have been persistent rumors , there is no proof that the USAF ever received a replacement for the Blackbird, as penetrating persistent reconnaissance became a much more pressing need than something that replicated what a spy satellite could produce. Despite the appearance of newer aircraft and stealthy drones, such as the RQ-170 , the U-2 soldiered on. New upgrades and overhauls —but especially a satellite data link that pilots could share information with command centers and commanders on the ground in near real-time—gave the latest U-2S aircraft a new lease on life. Despite its age, the Dragon Lady cost less than $31,000 per flight hour as of fiscal year 2013—less than half of what it had cost to operate the SR-71 more than two decades earlier. After the end of the Cold War, the U-2s kept flying over or very near hotspots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and the South China Sea, as well as helping collect images during natural disasters. Between 2005 and 2015, the Air Force had pushed back plans to retire the U-2 at least four times.  As of 2016, the service was considering sending the planes to the boneyard for good by the end of 2019. The plan would be to replace the Cold Warriors with RQ-4s, which have become cheaper to operate as the fleet has grown. Not everyone was pleased with this idea, though. In June 2016, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) wrote a letter, which a dozen other California lawmakers signed, to then-Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James. “We understand that the U-2 fleet has almost 80% of its airframe life remaining, making it sustainable well beyond FY2019,” the legislators explained . “Retirement of the U-2 in the coming years is expected to result in a reduction in high altitude [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capacity, including the loss of the U-2’s unique intelligence gathering capabilities.” USAF It is important to note that California is home to both Lockheed’s legendary Skunk Works aircraft design outfit—which crafted the U-2 and the SR-71—and the Air Force’s 9th Reconnaissance Wing, which flies Dragon Ladies and Global Hawks. It’s true that the Global Hawk can’t fly as high or as far as the U-2, but Northrop Grumman’s large drones have been increasingly able to carry the U-2s most important equipment. In December 2016, the Air Force announced it had flown an unspecified sensor on a Dragon Lady for the last time, passing the mission off to the Global Hawk. This was most likely the Senior Year Electro-optical Reconnaissance System 2 (SYERS-2), which the RQ-4B successfully carried in a test that month . Three months later , Northrop announced they had successfully integrated the MS-177 multi-spectral sensor onto the Global Hawk, which could be a complete replacement for the older system. In the meantime, Lockheed has continued trying to pitch one of its own systems. In 2014 , Lockheed had also proposed a pilot-optional version of the U-2 as an alternative to retirement and a year later the company’s Skunk Works divison unveiled an entirely new drone concept that reuses components of the Dragon Lady, called the TR-X . In addition, it is possible that top defense contractors have already produced, or are actively working on, other advanced manned or unmanned aircraft that remain classified. All in all, it looks like the U-2 may be nearing the end of its lengthy service to the U.S. military again. Despite that, however, history has shown the aircraft have gotten many reprieves over the years and may still have a lot of flying hours left in them.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",This ’80s Promo Video Will Make You Want A F-20 Tigershark So Freaking Bad,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop’s F-20 Tigershark, an evolution of the company’s highly successful F-5E Tiger II—which itself was an evolution of the F-5A/B Freedom Fighter and The T-38 Talon—never made it into production, but many thought it should have. The aircraft provided high performance and multi-role capability on the cheap, both in terms of procurement and operating costs. But the Reagan administration’s loosening of export rules on military equipment, including fighters, allowed the already deep into production, larger and more advanced F-16 to edge out the F-20 on the world-wide fighter jet marketplace. There were still a few opportunities for Northrop to get its self-funded fighter into production, with the Navy’s Fighter Weapons School—better known as Topgun—being in the market for a new highly maneuverable “4th generation” dissimilar adversary aircraft. In the end, here too the F-16 won out, giving birth to the hotrod F-16N (make sure to read all about F-16N and Topgun’s proposed F-20s here ). By 1986, after over a billion dollars invested and the failure to produce a single customer, along with a spate of high-profile crashes, Northrop’s “people’s fighter” of sorts that was born out of the “ Fighter Mafia” of the 1970s was finally put to rest. The marketing surrounding the F-20 was somewhat unique. Seeing as it was a company program, with few government dollars invested, Northrop went about demoing the jet around the world and building some pretty awesome promotional materials around it. They even hired retired General Chuck Yeager to become the spokesperson for the program, which included him flying and personally endorsing the jet. Maybe the best thing remaining of the F-20 is this awesome long-format promotional video that goes into the features of the jet. It does an awesome job at selling why the Tigershark was its own breed of fighter, and how it could get so much done without a large logistical footprint and with low operating costs. Today the Tigershark concept lives on to a certain degree in aircraft like the JAS-39, JF-17, and advanced fighter-trainers like the FA-50. Some of the F-5E/F Tigers IIs still in service have been extensively upgraded to give them similar if not superior avionics to the F-20. But even with these upgrades, these jets lack the Tigershark’s upgraded mechanical systems and extreme performance. Maybe the closest thing to a modern F-20 was Northrop Grumman now defunct T-X contender , the Model 400 . Sadly we may never know what this jet’s true performance capabilities were. In some ways the F-20 makes more sense now than it did 30 plus years ago. As fighter aircraft have become so expensive to procure and maintain, some countries are left with fleets that are just a shadow of their previous selves. Not just that, but the digital avionics revolution has resulted in a higher focus on sensors and sensor fusion than on an aircraft’s size or raw performance. And many of these systems have shrunk considerably in recent years making them lighter and more adaptable to smaller fighter aircraft designs. For instance, today a small but powerful AESA radar can easily fit into the F-20’s tight nose cone. Additionally, the almost total reliance on smart weapons by western air forces, which are becoming ever smaller and more accurate, mean that aircraft that could carry large payloads are not as useful for most missions as they once were. A single F-20 carrying four 1,000lb GPS guided bombs can take out four targets in any weather conditions reliability. The same jet could be loaded up with 16 Small Diameter Bombs , giving it a high-volume, rapidly targetable, standoff precision striking capability. Such striking potential was just a dream back in the mid 1980s. Simply put, the old days of needing multiple fighters to attack a single target are long gone, and a single fighter can now attack multiple targets on a single sortie, regardless of the jet’s size. Finally, the F-20 is a small target, both visually and on radar. Combined with the latest electronic warfare systems, far less capable aircraft have been proven to be a handful for even America’s F-15C/Ds . While an aircraft like the F-20 may not be able to go “downtown” into a “triple-digit” SAM engagement zone with ease, for most all other missions, including providing air sovereignty, an upgraded F-20 would be more than good enough. Who knows, maybe we’ll see the rebirth of the lightweight fighter even here in the US. There is a chance that the winner of the T-X competition could end up being bought also as a light multi-role fighter much akin to the F-20. On a lower-end of the spectrum the USAF will be kicking off its light air support experiment this summer, which will be populated mainly by turbo-prop powered “mud movers,” although Textron’s adaptable, “no frills” jet-powered Scorpion will also be attending. Although it will never feature the blistering performance of the F-20, the Scorpion’s simplicity and cost effective approach to air warfare is relatable to the F-20 program’s original goals. In the end the F-20 just never got the breaks, and just a handful of years later, a much more advanced Northrop creation—YF-23 Black Widow—would also impress but be passed over for another (now) Lockheed product—the F-22 Raptor. Although there seems to be more regret about YF-23’s rejected than the F-20’s, both aircraft seemed to hit the nail almost too hard on the head, and together would have been quite the perfect pair that defines a “high-low” capability force structure mix.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",Here’s the USMC’s Plan for ‘Lightning Carriers’ Brimming With F-35Bs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USMC wants to be able to deploy between 16-20 F-35Bs to its amphibious assault ships, turning them into so called “Lightning Carriers” (CV-L). The new America class (LHA-6) flattops , which do not have a well deck and are more focused on aviation capabilities, could field nearly two dozen of the 5th generation jump jets under the concept. Really, the idea is nothing new. In decades past, “Gator Navy” amphibs were turned into “Harrier Carriers” loaded with dozens of AV-8Bs. This came at the expense of not deploying the usual Air Combat Element dominated by a full range of helicopters. Such a capability begins to encroach on the mission of America’s hugely expensive fixed-wing carrier fleet, although Harriers have operated from these ships in the past as well. And still, the Harrier has limited capabilities compared to what the aircraft from a supercarrier’s Air Wing can provide. USS Bataan being used in the “Harrier Carrier” role for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. , USN Aside from a reduction in combat radius, the inability to carry 2,000lb class munitions internally and some smaller differences, the F-35B will be just as capable as any fighter flying off the decks of America’s supercarriers, or those on land for that matter. Also, the F-35’s high-end sensor suite and electronic warfare capabilities make it less dependent on Airborne Early Warning and Control and dedicated electronic attack assets in most threat environments compared to its 4th generation fighter counterparts. In essence, the F-35B is the most relevant of the Joint Strike Fighter family as it gives America’s eight “other carriers”—the amphibious assault ships—a very high-end multi-role fighter capability that can be used on the first day of a major conflict. Under normal circumstances, like its Harrier forbearers, just six to eight F-35Bs will be deployed aboard one of these ships, but under the “Lightning Carrier” concept this is not the case. I went into this reality in great detail years ago in my piece Seven Things The Marines Have To Do To Make The F-35B Worth The Huge Cost (as a side note, it is amazing how many of my recommendations have been satisfied or are in the process of being satisfied). I also discussed how the Harrier Carrier concept could be adapted to the F-35B to great effect, stating: “During multiple conflicts, these Gator Navy flattops have been used as “Harrier Carriers,” where dozens of the jump jets were packed aboard for sustained operations. The F-35B will make this concept even more relevant with its ability to accomplish a full range of missions, including taking the first shots of a conflict—in effect tearing down the enemy’s surface-to-air missile, aircraft and sensor network barriers so that other, less survivable aircraft can eventually operate over enemy territory in a safer manner. The new LHA “America” class of amphibious assault ships was built with just this in mind, doing away with the traditional well dock to carry a larger air wing with more fuel and munitions stores. Some concepts exist where a pair of amphibious assault ships work together within a single, albeit larger, Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG). One carrying a couple dozen F-35Bs and the other carrying a few dozen helicopters. Such a concept would allow for a continuous F-35B presence over the battlefield, and would even allow for the ESG to mount fixed wing “alpha strikes,” where the majority of the F-35B force prosecutes a set of strategic enemy targets during a single mission, much like a Navy carrier air wing currently is capable of. An ESG configured in this manner is in many ways even more capable than a nuclear carrier’s deployed air wing as it also retains an incredibly powerful ground assault capability. This ability to “surge” assets and integrate them directly into a single ESG represents a true multirole flotilla, able to flexibly threaten any foe within hundreds of miles of the ocean, not just via air strikes but also via amphibious or inland assaults. Seeing as the F-35B has the potential to almost double America’s “first day of war” carrier footprint, a great thing during a time when the nuclear carrier force will most likely continue to shrink, and it will allow an ESG to operate much more independently than ever before, the Marines have to look seriously at maximizing this game changing technology.” USMC Now, the USMC in its 2017 Marine Aviation Plan seems to agree, stating: “In the 2017-2027 time frame the Marine Corps will possess the majority of naval 5th generation aircraft. By 2025, the Marine Corps will operate185 F-35Bs—enough to equip all seven L-Class ships. While the amphibious assault ship will never replace the aircraft carrier, it can be complementary, if employed in imaginative ways. The CV-L concept has previous been employed(five times) utilizing AV-8B Harriers in a “Harrier Carrier” concept. TheARG/MEU’s mission, and 13 mission essential tasks (METs), will not change; however, a Lightning Carrier, taking full advantage of the amphibious assault ship as a sea base, can provide the naval and joint force with significant access, collection and strike capabilities.” Under the Lightning Carrier plan, over 40 sorties across a wide spectrum of air combat missions sets, can be fielded in a single 14 hour period with 16 F-35Bs., USMC The thing is, not only could the Lightning Carrier concept take some pressure off America’s supercarriers, especially for supporting smaller conflicts, but it can also be mixed and matched with different assets, including embedding it into a supercarrier’s own flotilla. In doing so, a Lightning Carrier could drastically augment the 5th generation fighter capacity forward deployed as part of a Carrier Strike Group. Currently, the Carrier Air Wing of the future is slated to include one F-35C squadron of roughly 12 jets, and possibly two squadrons for most Air Wings as the 2020s roll on. As such, a LHA configured in “Lightning Carrier” mode could nearly triple the amount of F-35s the Carrier Strike Group has to play with. But really where such a concept shines the most is for operations as part of a larger, more capable and operationally independent Expeditionary Strike Group. Lockheed The USMC states that it is likely the Lightning Carrier concept will include a quartet of MV-22 Ospreys equipped as aerial tankers. Although this may take away a small amount of room for F-35Bs, it would be a massive force multiplier, and allow the F-35Bs to fly longer missions and ones that take the jet deeper into enemy territory. It would also add a margin of safety to flight operations and decrease the overall sortie demands on the ship, which are limited compared to their catapult and arresting gear equipped supercarrier counterparts. The V-22 Aerial Refueling System is should hit the fleet within the next year. V-22 Aerial Refueling System prototype (VARS) in action., Bell Although the USS America (LHA-6), and to even a greater degree her sister ship, the USS Tripoli , have their decks strengthened and other modifications made to allow them to sustain higher sortie rates of F-35Bs and MV-22s, the existing Wasp class LHDs do not. As such, it is unlikely they could take full advantage of the Lightning Carrier/CV-L concept, at least without more extensive modifications. That’s not to say they cannot carry a full load of F-35Bs, but sustaining continuos flight operations at a very high tempo is likely impossible due to the high thermal loads put out by F-35B, and to some degree the MV-22. Still, as the Navy struggles with its “carrier gap,” and while some, including the author, have called for building smaller, more flexible and more plentiful aircraft carriers, the America class in particular and the “Lightning Carrier” concept is definitely intriguing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 25, 2020",The U.S. Navy Tried to Turn Whale Songs Into Secret Code,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An American submarine desperately needs to get in contact with other ships in the U.S. Navy, but Soviet anti-submarine aircraft and warships are on the hunt, listening for any clues as to its whereabouts. During the search, the sonar operators hear a pod of whales singing to each other and don’t give it another thought. However, what they just heard was actually the sub using a secret, covert communication system that mimics sea mammal noises. This wasn’t a scene from a spy novel or blockbuster Cold War submarine thriller—it was how the U.S. Navy once envisioned real life undersea operations. In 1959, the Navy Electronics Laboratory got to work on the concept as part of Project Combo. The work centered on the understanding that, under the right conditions, certain marine mammal sounds and the vibrations they generated might travel over very long distances underwater. More importantly, they’d appear so common as to go unnoticed by the enemy. “Marine animal sounds are common and prominent components of the natural underwater sonic environment,” engineers at the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) explained in a report more than two decades later. “Military communications based on natural animal sounds confound detection by even informed enemy surveillance because the messages are but a small portion of the total biological chorus.” A private individual obtained a copy of the review through a Mandatory Declassification Request. Government transparency website GovernmentAttic.org posted a copy online in December 2016. Submariners and their boats have long proven their worth for patrolling large areas discreetly, performing surveillance missions, and quietly inserting elite troops and agents behind enemy lines. Roving ballistic missile submarines, which are especially hard for opponents to locate and target, are a key component of the America’s “ Nuclear Triad .” They call it the “silent service” for good reason. But rapidly communicating and sharing information with other friendly forces was a persistent problem. One of the biggest underlying problems was that radio waves simply don’t travel well through salt water. As radars, sonars and other sensors continued to improve after World War II, a submarine riding on the surface sending signals home increasingly risked giving away its position and becoming a prime target. The boats could use sounds to send messages while submerged. Unfortunately, sub hunters could keep their ears open for those artificial noises, too. Submarines could broadcast very-low frequency messages while submerged, but had to be relatively close to the surface. An antenna in a tethered buoy might allow crews to send and receive messages from greater depths, but enemy aircraft and ships could still intercept and zero in on the transmissions. USN This is where the Combo gear came in. The basic plan was to develop coded messages from recordings of whales, dolphins, sea lions, and seals. The submarine would broadcast the noises and a computer – the Combo Signal Recognizer (CSR) – would detect the specific patterns and decode them on the other end. In theory, this idea was relatively simple. As work progressed, the Navy found a number of complicated problems to overcome, the bulk of which centered on the authenticity of the code itself. The message structure couldn’t just substitute the moaning of a whale or a crying seal for As and Bs or even whole words. In addition, the sounds Navy technicians recorded between 1959 and 1965 all had natural background noise. With the technology available, it would have been hard to scrub that out. Repeated blasts of the same sounds with identical extra noise would stand out to even untrained sonar operators. And that’s not even getting into how not all sea life lives in the same regions or “talks” the same way. Using a whale or porpoise code in an area that those animals didn’t live might expose the whole system. You wouldn’t want to be broadcasting mating calls when it wasn’t mating season, either. “These speculations presume a knowledgeable interpretor [sic],” NSOC noted. Nevertheless, it was a very real set of concerns for the Combo team. USN In the end, the Navy recorded more than a dozen different species in the wild. Researchers determined that whales with a “cosmopolitan occurrence” in multiple regions, such as pilot and killer whales, would probably be best for Combo’s needs. Their songs remained more consistently audible underwater over reasonable distances than many smaller marine mammals, too. In 1970, the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s top advanced research and development arm, became involved with Combo. The organization put up the funds to synthesize the recorded sounds into a useful audio library. Naval Ship Systems Command (NAVSHIPS) sponsored the work on the actual communications equipment. Crafting a flexible code from the audio collection turned out to be too difficult. The ultimate solution was to match specific recordings to pre-determined messages. A submarine or other ship would play the sounds and the CSR or improved CSR-II would display an arbitrary numeric code. The receiving crew would then consult a code book to figure out the meaning. To improve the reliability of the system, Combo’s gear would pump out the same message three times at varying frequencies. The CSR could then double check to make sure it had detected the right message. If the computer couldn’t figure things out, the LED display would light up the word “BAD.” The Combo system could pump out pilot whale sounds on any of nine preset frequency bands. To protect the code’s integrity, depending on the particular day, the operators would only use specific frequencies as indicated in their code book. On top of that, the full recordings would bury the specific, meaningful notes inside a longer track full of arbitrary natural-sounding ambient noise. The Navy understood that these messages would have to contain “low data,” such as “I am a friendly ship” or “mines ahead.” These pre-arranged communications would not be able to include detailed specifics. In 1973, the service conducted two series of undersea tests near Santa Catalina Island, one of California’s Channel Islands near the city of Los Angeles. Static speakers and receivers sent and received six pre-configured messages at distances of five, 10 and 20 miles. In the first round, technicians placed all the devices at depths of approximately 150 feet. They almost doubled that to 250 feet for the second set of experiments. USS Dolphin , which participated in Project Combo in 1974., USN The equipment worked almost perfectly, according to NOSC. The original CSR computer successfully translated every sent message the five and 10 mile distances, and 90 percent of the sent messages at 20 miles. The next year, the diesel-electric research submarine USS Dolphin successfully exchanged a number of messages with a ship on the surface. The noises even reportedly attracted a number of whales. In 1975, the Navy performed more static experiments with revised codes, but simply to gauge how much distortion there might be underwater as the sounds traveled between 3 and 16 miles from the source. NOSC reported that messages could be viable out to a maximum distance of 50 miles. Additional experiments sought to determine whether standard sonobouys could receive the noises and pass them along via radio to a CSR or CSR-II for decoding. These demonstrations showed the floating beacons would pick up the whale songs between 5 and 7 miles away, and then pass them on successfully, all of which could have greatly expanded the range of the system. Pilot Whales, like the ones shown here, had their unique “language” used as part of the Combo program., Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) With these successes in hand, by 1980, engineers working on Combo recommended continued development of the equipment as part of an existing “Low Data Rate/Quick Response” communications program. They also wanted an extended library of marine animal sounds and related information. We don’t know what ultimately became of the project’s work, but the Navy seemed to disagree when it came to its usefulness. There were also a number of parallel projects that could have doomed the whale song code. The Navy might have just been disappointed with Combo’s range and message sizes. With research suggesting sea animal noises carrying across hundreds or even thousands of miles, sending a note to a ship 50 miles away would have been a major let down. Coding enough fixed, simplistic messages for the equipment to be truly useful might easily have been daunting task. And by 1980, engineers had already spent more than two decades just proving the system could work. “It was never successful,” Dr. Christopher Willes Clark, founder of the Cornell Bioacoustics Research Program, wrote to Atlus Obscura in an email. “The process of projecting coded ‘whale’ sounds out to functional distances is not viable.” It’s possible that Combo was the victim of decades of improvements in more conventional communications tools. In 1968, it had begun separate work on extremely-low frequency (ELF) radio transmitters that could reach submarines deep underwater. After a series of proposals and tests, work finally began on Project ELF in 1981. The final system became operational in 1989 with multiple ground-based transmission stations scattered around the globe. Over the same period, the Navy had steadily improved a fleet of airborne very-low frequency (VLF) radio relays, as part of system of systems called Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO). The main job of these flying command centers was— and still is —to get orders to ballistic missile submarines in a doomsday scenario where an enemy attack destroyed land-based communications sites. Of course, TACAMO never completely solved the sub-to-sub or ship-to-sub communication gap. A TACAMO EC-130Q., USN In 1989, the Navy began replacing its EC-130Q TACAMO planes, based on the C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft, with larger and more capable E-6A Mercuries. In 2004, it shut down the Project ELF sites altogether. More than a decade later, improved E-6Bs were still flying, though the Pentagon was looking into a future replacement. In the near future, submarines may end up communication via further improved radio systems, with underwater drones as relay nodes, or even with beams of light . There’s no indication the Navy is still interested in putting communication system based on animal sounds into service on submarines or any other warship. But if that ever changes, someone will probably have to go looking for the Combo tapes. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Navies Sea U.S. Navy"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2019",The State Department’s Armored Vehicle Program Is a Mess,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Sept. 18, 2010, a ferry belonging to Tarzan Boats left the harbor in Nigeria’s capital Lagos carrying 10 U.S. Department of State armored sport utility vehicles (SUVs). To prevent anyone from selling or salvaging the worn out trucks, the American Embassy in the country hired the private company to dump them into the Gulf of Guinea. On the way to the disposal area, one of the vehicles broke free from its chains and slammed into the ship’s front loading gate, knocking it off and throwing four people into the water. A fifth person clung helplessly to the SUV’s bumper. Though State’s mission in Nigeria later reported they had worked with Tarzan Boats in the past without incident, not all of the crew during the accident were wearing life vests, or could swim. One person went missing and presumably drowned. After discussions with American officials in another boat and Nigerian Navy sailors aboard a corvette that rushed to the scene, the remaining crew pushed the other nine vehicles into the ocean and returned home. Unfortunately, what might otherwise have sounded like a freak accident actually turned out to be part of a pattern of mismanagement. Over the course of more than seven years of investigations, the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found the entire armored vehicle program to be a bit of a mess. “The armored vehicle program continues to be at significant risk for fraud, waste, and abuse,” State’s top watchdog declared in a wide-ranging February 2017 report . This latest review found vehicles were missing or not fully functional, did not meet official requirements, or were just sitting idle, resulting in a waste of more than $50 million. When most people think of organizations that own a large number of armored vehicles, their first thought probably isn’t State. But America’s diplomats and supporting staff work in some of the most dangerous places on earth and need protection in order to do their jobs. A DS agent waves at another driver to move aside in India., AP The threats are very real. Between 2006 and 2015, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) recorded dozens of significant attacks on the department’s diplomats and other employees in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. Even before 9/11, there had been a steady need for more security at American diplomatic posts around the world. In 1998, Al Qaeda infamously claimed responsibility for bombings at embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In many cases armored vehicles prevented—or could have prevented—deaths or injuries. In December 2015, an unknown individual shot at an embassy vehicle traveling to Bangui M’Poko International Airport in Bangui, Central Africa Republic, hitting a passenger side window, but causing no injuries. On Oct. 11, 2012, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists murdered the senior foreign service national investigator for the U.S. Embassy in Yemen as he sat in his car in the country’s capital Sana’a. As of May 2016, was responsible for a sprawling fleet of more than 4,500 up-armored SUVs, vans and other trucks across the world and in the United States itself. Though the exact base specifications for these up-armored vehicles is classified, the collection of trucks includes modified Chevrolet Suburban and Toyota Land Cruiser SUVs and Chevrolet Express and Ford E-series vans. But in its broad review, OIG discovered nearly 260 vehicles had gone unused for at least a year and State spent almost $25 million just to store them at sites in the United States. On top of that, the department had given away another 200 armored trucks to other agencies, without getting anything in return, effectively losing over $26 million in the process. The watchdog simply couldn’t find five more trucks, worth over $530,000, that DS listed in its master inventory. Above and below, workers in Haiti break down a one of the State Department’s up-armored SUVs., State Department During visits to various embassies, investigators found additional vehicles that did not meet State’s internal standards or had not yet received new upgrades to meet changes in those requirements. At the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia – the capital of a country struggling to finally end decades of civil war and still battling drug cartels, paramilitaries, and other organized crime groups—more than 20 armored trucks had insufficient armor. The diplomatic post technically operated another 10 vans sitting idle in Front Royal, Virginia waiting to get the necessary modifications. In certain cases, diplomatic staff relied on vehicles from other agencies that also operated out of embassy compounds, but which did not meet State’s strict guidelines. This included vehicles from Streit, a Canadian firm with offices in the United States, which has made potentially illegal sales to governments in war-torn South Sudan and Libya , as well as reportedly performing work for individuals linked to gangs . In 2013, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), another federal watchdog, agreed with State’s decision to exclude the company from future armored vehicle contracts over concerns about its basic quality of work. In addition, OIG explained that unauthorized vendors would have extreme difficulty making compliant vehicles, since it only distributes the secret standards to approved companies. This apparent lack of proper oversight had a negative impact on maintenance, too. OIG’s staff found over 200 vehicles that should have failed their inspections at six different posts in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. These trips included visits to the U.S. embassies in Israel and Jordan, where security is undoubtedly a major priority. Some of these problems were relatively minor, such as low tire pressure or improper labeling. However, more than 30 percent of vehicles had problems with one or more of their bullet-proof windows, 16 percent had mismatched tires and 10 percent had broken doors, all of which could be serious deficiencies in an attack. State Department In the course their work, investigators crafted nearly 40 individual recommendations in total and sent them to DS, as well as other offices and specific embassies and consulates. To be sure, State rushed to fix many of these very serious issues. By the time OIG published its audit, it acknowledged that only eight recommendations remained unresolved. “The Department has responded to and has already taken steps to resolve the vast majority of the OIG’s recommendations,” a State Department official told The War Zone in an Email. “We intend to prioritize the OIG findings and address the corresponding recommendations accordingly and as quickly as possible.” But the eight unresolved issues are still significant, as are the disagreements between OIG and DS over how to move forward. For one, the review explained the State had no clear mechanism for figuring out just how many armored vehicles any particular post might actually need to fulfill its duties. DS officials countered that this was virtually impossible to do because the relevant factors could include anything from terrorist threats to how many parking spots an embassy had available in its lots. OIG was unconvinced, insisting officials could craft at least some baseline metrics. The report pointed to the fact that security officers already had standardized requirements for diplomatic housing, regardless of where those residences were located. Contractors, some wearing flip-flops, dismantle a State Department SUV in Nigeria., Department of State Two additional recommendations stemmed directly from this issue of “right-sizing” the fleet. If State didn’t know how to determine where to send vehicles in the first place, it couldn’t regularly check to make sure it was still meeting those requirements or have regional security offices (RSO) give their own assessments. Again, OIG disagreed with the assertion that these tasks were just too hard to complete. Beyond that, the watchdog wanted the DS’ leadership to create a single, comprehensive plan for how big the fleet should be and how and where to employ the vehicles in general. Censors redacted the specific reasons why department officials disputed this recommendation. However, OIG highlighted the fact that something needed to be done to prevent unused vehicles from sitting in warehouses, costing tax payers millions. Elsewhere in the report, security officials did stress that unforeseen crises or changes in priorities made long term planning difficult. “Due to the changes in the Department’s priorities for Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan posts, our armored vehicles requirements were reduced, directly resulting in an unforeseen surplus of armored vehicles,” the State Department official added in their Email. The watchdog also wanted to make sure State wasn’t just giving away vehicles in the future without getting some kind of reimbursement. DS contended that it would actually be illegal to charge other agencies. In turn, OIG pointed out that the relevant regulations only applied to State’s assets inside the United States and its territories, leaving the possibility open to sell off armored vehicles overseas to other law enforcement agencies or the U.S. military. In addition, the rules for transfer of personal property would not preclude the department from using authorities in other statutes or arranging separate quid pro quo agreements to get compensation. “OIG does not purport to give guidance on precisely how DS could obtain reimbursement, but the high-dollar value of the unused property more than justifies exploring the availability of such options,” the report continued. “The intent of this recommendation is to encourage DS to consider whether reimbursement is available.” A DS convoy in Amman, Jordan., AP The watchdog and State’s top security officials disagreed on three more recommendations relating to who was responsible for vehicles in the field and whether certain staff needed additional training. In spite of objections from DS’ management, OIG insisted that RSOs needed to make regular inspections – not something included in their existing duties – and that both those security officers and general services office personnel needed to know how to properly dispose of armored vehicles. These issues were all indicative of a larger, problematic trend of confusion over responsibilities and a general lack of information and planning. Crises would undoubtedly erupt, but there seemed to be no clear course of action on the part of DS to shift armored vehicles around in response or in the aftermath. In July 2014, a convoy of armored vehicles took American officials overland from the embassy in Tripoli, Libya to the safety of neighboring Tunisia. Nearly a year later OIG found that this glut of trucks was sitting within the embassy compound in Tunis as officials continued to debate what to do with them. “All Tripoli vehicles were either placed in-service by Embassy Tunis, remain stored until needed, or were transferred to other USG [U.S. government] agencies,” another State Department official told the author in a separate Email in March 2016. “Most were placed in-service by Department of State, some transferred to other USG agencies and others remain stored waiting registration, assignment, etc.” Unusued vehicles in an open lot in Front Royal, Virginia,., State Department As State found out in Nigeria in 2010, just getting rid of unused or broken trucks can be difficult. Since their specifications are secret, embassies and other diplomatic posts can’t just sell them off. As of February 2017, there were five approved methods for disposing of armored vehicles. Contractors could cut them into sections no bigger than two square feet, crush them, burn them, literally blow them up, or bury them, but only on U.S. soil, including within embassy compounds. In 2012, State stopped allowing hired firms to dump the trucks into the sea under any circumstances. In January 2017 , OIG released a report highlighting continued concerns about the health and safety of State-employed or hired contractors who were still smashing and crushing vehicles in countries such as Haiti and Nigeria. Investigators had taken striking photographs of workers, often without any protective gear at all, bashing in windows with hand tools or squashing SUV bodies with heavy construction equipment. One image caught two men cutting a section of a vehicle with a blow torch next to a no-smoking sign within the U.S. Embassy compound in Nairobi, Kenya. According to OIG, DS had already adequately responded to the two recommendations in that review by the time it released the much larger report the following month. The February 2017 report also did not touch on the separate matter of training for DS staff operating the vehicles abroad. With their added armor and gear, the protected trucks didn’t handle like their commercial counterparts. Drivers needed special training to get safely around the often congested streets of lesser-developed countries. Vehicles from the Libyan evacuation sit inside the U.S. Embassy compound in Tunis, Tunisia., State Department In April 2016 , a convoy carrying then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power through a village in Northern Cameroon accidentally hit and killed a seven-year-old boy. An ambulance with the group tried to rush the child to a nearby hospital. At the time, though Power smartly insisted on apologizing to the family in person and State compensated them with money and other goods, the incident seemed to highlight the inherent conflict in keeping American diplomats safe abroad. These individuals are supposed to be the public face of the United States, but are often insulated from the general public in the countries where they work due to security concerns. “What can you say?” she said later during an interview on ABC’s “Nightline.” “You come here to help.” But in 2016, OIG released the results of inspections that suggested these deadly incidents were more likely part of the larger issue of how DS was handling increased security requirements and the expanding armored vehicle program. Investigators found State’s armored vehicles had been involved in more than 770 “mishaps” since 2015 and classified nearly 60 percent of them as “preventable.” In 10 of the 12 instances where the vehicle had killed someone, State cited a lack of driver training as the primary contributing factor. “The Department provides specialized operator training that includes handling armored vehicle dynamics,” OIG explained in a July 2016 review. “But it is mandatory only for drivers of chiefs of mission/principal officers, none of whom were involved in the 12 fatal mishaps.” A DS convoy moves through Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince in 2015., State Department There had clearly been a negative trend in the management of the armored vehicle program. Though State clearly tried to respond quickly to specific issues as OIG uncovered them, taken together, the reports paint a picture of officials consistently overwhelmed by the sheer scope of their responsibilities and struggling to catch up. Budget cuts can’t have helped matters. During the 2011 fiscal year, members of congress trimmed nearly $130 million from diplomatic security in President Barack Obama’s proposed budget. In the next fiscal cycle, legislators cut State’s budget as a whole by another $330 million. In his first budget proposal in March 2017, President Donald Trump suggested the department could do without $11 billion in the next year. If approved, this would amount to a total budget nearly 29 percent smaller compared to one in the previous cycle. How this would impact the armored vehicle program specifically would depend on a variety of factors. Though DS oversees it as a whole, individual embassies and other diplomatic posts are often responsible for training drivers and otherwise operating and maintaining the individual vehicles. Changes across the budget could impact any plans to resolve the long-standing issues related to the fleet. Whatever happens, State clearly knows there have been and still are problems in how it manages its armored trucks. Only time will tell if officials find comprehensive ways to truly start getting out in front of the persistent issues.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 3, 2019","This Small, Obscure U.S. Navy Unit Hunts Terrorists and Smugglers","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An obscure U.S. Navy unit produced hundreds of “high value” intelligence assessments in 2015. What those reviews covered remains a secret, but the unit was definitely actively hunting terrorists and smugglers around the world. In 2007, the service stood up the Navy Expeditionary Intelligence Command (NEIC) as the service’s only operational intelligence command. Since then, it has supplied human and other intelligence directly to combat commanders across all six of the Pentagon’s geographic commands. “NEIC is a ‘game-changing’ capability that has been employed across the full spectrum of Navy and Joint operations,” Navy Commander Benjamin Snell, then head of the command, wrote in his annual assessment for 2015. “NEIC capabilities are also suitable or have been successfully used in many other missions/operations, to include, phase-zero, theater security cooperation, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, and non-combatant evacuation operations planning.” The War Zone obtained a heavily redacted copy of Snell’s 2015 Command Operations Report for the NEIC through the Freedom of Information Act. USN At least in 2015, the unit was relatively small, with less than 150 individuals in total. A U.S. Marine Corps rifle company has more than 180 personnel. The command’s ability to respond to such diverse situations comes mainly from its nine intelligence exploitation teams (IET). Each one has 11 individuals, including a commanding officer, five human intelligence specialists, two personnel trained in both electronic warfare and information operations, and three intelligence analysts. NEIC also oversaw two more teams from the U.S. Navy Reserve. In his annual review, Snell described each IET as “non-traditional sensors” – in short, an intelligence-gathering tool akin to a spy satellite or a reconnaissance plane. But his sailors could get into places those systems couldn’t reach, working hand-in-hand with other Navy units and other services’ forces out in the field. Among their other core skills, each team was trained to ride out with naval boarding teams to help inspect suspicious ships and question the crew. “This flexible and adaptable capability bridges the critical information seam between the sea and land,” Snell wrote. Another joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard boarding team approaches a skiff full of suspected pirates in the Gulf of Aden in 2011., USN During his tenure, NEIC received a Department of Defense Human Intelligence Collection Team (Overt) award from the Defense Intelligence Agency for supporting efforts in 2014. In 2015, the 11 active and reserve teams produced hundreds of intelligence information reports (IIR), according to the annual report. Analysts later evaluated nearly 1,000 of them as “high value.” Two more contained details of “major significance.” IIRs come from sources that may turn out to be unreliable or that might be spreading deliberate misinformation. So, intelligence personnel do not consider them useful without this additional analysis. We do not know what were in these reports. The Navy is understandably tight-lipped about the information and its sources and methods. When releasing the annual history, censors removed all descriptions of NEIC’s findings for the year, citing national security concerns. Here’s a sample of the “information” about NEIC’s intelligence work we received through FOIA., USN The “teams supply expeditionary warfighters with timely relevant intelligence to deny the enemy sanctuary, freedom of movement and use of waterborne lines of communication while supported forces find, fix and destroy the enemy and enemy assets within the operational environment,” the command’s sparse official website says. In 2015, the United States was actively engaged in a variety of missions that could have benefited from their specialized skills. As of February 2015, the U.S. Special Operations Command alone was conducting at least 14 named operations , primarily in hotspots around Africa . As the year went on, the Pentagon stepped up its campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, continued to work with Afghanistan’s military holding the line against the Taliban, and aided the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In addition, there was always the long-standing American military mission on the Korean Peninsula, routine patrols in the Gulf of Aden and the South China Sea, and the Navy’s support for the on-going War on Drugs. The intelligence reports could have covered any number of topics. American commanders planning their own operations would have an interest in knowing as much as possible about potential terrorist attacks, significant changes in militant groups and their objectives, new details about arms or drug smuggling, and other significant information about their surroundings and the overall situation. Arms the U.S. Navy seized on a ship in the Gulf of Aden in 2016, which the Pentagon believed were headed for rebel forces in Yemen. , USN However, in October 2016 , the NEIC received a Meritorious Unit Citation for activities stretching from April 2013 to October 2015, which noted that the teams had targeted specific terrorists and uncovered illicit cargoes.  The command succeeded in “disrupting terrorist and insurgent networks, seizing narcotics and weapons linked to terrorist organizations, apprehending high-value individuals, discovering unidentified systems aboard adversary platforms, and deterring adversary intelligence threats,” the award explained. And since the teams were trained to help out during natural disasters or other crises, they could have also deployed as part of various American response forces. In April and May 2015, U.S. troops rushed to Nepal after a devastating earthquake rocked the small Himalayan country, killing thousands and forcing millions more from their homes. However, if the IETs had taken part in humanitarian missions, one imagines at least some of those details would have been unclassified. Whatever they were doing, it seems reasonable to assume the teams were busy. Demand for their services probably hasn’t decreased since 2015, either. Navy Commander Danielle Lukich took over from Snell as head of the unit in June 2016. “I truly am amazed with the global reach of NEIC,” she said at the change of command ceremony.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 5, 2020",Watch These Old World War II Bombers Launch Target Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While unmanned aircraft have become synonymous with America’s way of war since 9/11, they’ve actually been an important feature of military aviation for the better part of a century. In the early years of the Cold War, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) turned two of Avro Lancasters in unique training aircraft, able launch and control jet-powered target drones rather than bombs. In March 2017, the San Diego Air and Space Museum posted a series of videos online showing these specialized Lancaster B Mk 10DCs in action. The museum’s archive had digitized the footage from a collection of films the Ryan Aeronautical Company donated in the 1990s. In 1951, American plane-maker Ryan began building the portly Firebee unmanned aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Army. Canada was among the first foreign customers. The pilotless planes were ideal training tools. With a top speed of over 500 miles per hour and a wing span of just 11 feet, the drones were more agile and challenging for pilots and gunners than many towed targets, which were limited by the characteristics of the tug aircraft. Since they weren’t physically attached to the controlling aircraft, the Firebees made things safer for everyone involved, too. Trainees could shoot live rounds at the drones without worrying about accidentally shooting down another plane. Crews could recover the unmanned aircraft even if they suffered significant damage. The flying targets had a two-stage parachute system that would deploy if the engine failed or the radio signal with the control station cut out. The individual controlling the Firebee could also trigger this sequence manually. The Firebee wasn’t without its own faults. The aircraft could only stay aloft for around 50 minutes at a time. In addition, the range of the radio link was limited, meaning the drones had to stay relatively close to the control station. The U.S. Army launched its versions from the ground using an expendable rocket booster. This worked fine for low-altitude training exercises for anti-aircraft crews. For training higher-flying fighter pilots, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy launched their variants in mid-air from modified twin-engine Douglas B-26 Invader attack planes and Lockheed P2V Neptune patrol aircraft. The RCAF took a similar approach with the modified Lancasters. The four-engine planes were each capable of carrying two drones, one under each wing. An early Firebee drone with a colorful paintjob., Ryan Aeronautical via the San Diego Air and Space Museum The iconic World War II bomber would have made sense since it both had the payload to carry the Firebees and was readily available. During World War II , Canadian company Victory Aircraft Limited produced 430 B Mk 10s for service with RCAF units under the Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command. Able to carry 14,000 pounds of bombs, the Lancaster series was a key component of the RAF’s bombing campaign in Europe. Special versions could carry the 22,000 pound Grand Slam bomb , which were supposed to break through reinforced structures like submarine pens, and unique “bouncing bombs” as part of a daring, top secret plan to attack dams in Germany and cause catastrophic flooding. An RCAF B Mk 10MR maritime patrol aircraft at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in Florida in 1953., USN After the war ended, many of these planes made their way back home and ended up in new roles, like as drone motherships. With bright orange noses, wing tips, and tails over a natural metal finish, the B Mk 10DCs soldiered on well into the 1950s. Fighter pilots in Canadair Sabre , Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck , and McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo jet fighters could have squared off against the Firebees. Canadian forces might have also tested early surface-to-air missiles against the drones. In the early 1960s, the RCAF retired the last of its Lancasters, still in service as maritime patrol planes and search and rescue aircraft, with its own fleet of Neptunes. Ryan continued to upgrade the Firebee family , building improved targets, unmanned spies, and experimental pilotless attackers, primarily for the U.S. military.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",F-22 Now Has AIM-9X But Still No Helmet Mounted Display To Use With It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF is quick to tout that the F-22 Raptor fleet has been finally upgraded to use the AIM-9X Sidewinder—a long awaited move that will allow the most advanced air superiority fighter in the world to ditch the relatively ancient AIM-9M version of the iconic short-range air-to-air missile. But even with this new capability, F-22 pilots still lack a helmet mounted display (HMD) to take advantage of the missile’s high-off boresight (HOBS) abilities, and there doesn’t seem to be much talk about fixing this long standing deficiency in the near term. You can read all about the F-22’s short-range missile and helmet mounted display fiasco here. The AIM-9X Sidewinder, Raytheon There is no doubt that adding basic AIM-9X capability to the F-22 is a significant upgrade over what the AIM-9M had to offer. Some F-22s have had the ability to carry the missiles for about a year or so, but the software to deeply integrate with the jet and give the pilot the proper symbology to easily employ it was only installed with the Increment 3.2B software that is now being made available to the Raptor fleet. The AIM-9X Block I has bit longer range, it’s faster, has a wider field of view, much higher maneuverability and a far better imaging infrared seeker that is very tough to fool with existing countermeasures than its Cold War era AIM-9M predecessor. The missile can even be used against ground targets in a pinch if the jet has the right software. Defensetech.org recently spoke to an experienced Raptor pilot with the 95th Fighter Squadron about this new arrow in the F-22’s quiver: “With the AIM-9M ‘Mike’ we kind of went out there going, ‘We have six missiles’… With AIM-9X, we step out the door going, ‘We got eight missiles on the jet.’ It’s literally that big of a difference… Night and day different… It brings us on par with most of the other infrared missiles around the world.” He also added that the AIM-9X gives Raptor pilots the ability  “shoot a lot further with better tracking capability out of the seeker.” USAF Chief Master Sergeant Chuck Jenkins, a wing Weapons Manager based at Elmendorf AFB in Alaska also commented about the F-22’s new missile in a USAF article, stating : “This has been in the inventory for the Air Force and Navy for some years; it’s nothing new to the military. But to put it on the Ferrari of aircraft—the F-22, the most advanced aircraft we have—it gives the pilots more maneuverability, larger range, and it’s a much faster missile.” But now that the Raptor finally has widespread AIM-9X capability, it seems that the USAF is still putting off giving Raptor pilots the “point and shoot” ability that goes along with this new missile, not to mention the enhanced situational awareness that a Helmet Mounted Display provides. In essence, the missile’s most important feature, its ability to engage targets even over a pilot’s shoulder, still cannot be unlocked by the Raptor, even after both the AIM-9X and F-22 have been operational (although separately) for well over a decade and other far less technologically complex fighters, like the F-15C/D and F-16C/D have had such a capability for just as long a time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6YMSfg26YSQ Instead, the Raptor will wait for its next round of upgrades around 2019, which will allow it to field the AIM-9X block II. This second iteration of the AIM-9X is already operational and features lock-on-after-launch capability. This will allow Raptor pilots to engage a target without locking the AIM-9X’s gimbaled seeker onto that target before firing. The missile is equipped with a data-link and upgraded autopilot that receives information from the launch aircraft as to where the target is located in space and time so that it can fly-out toward it once it has left the jet’s launch rail. In some cases, the missile can make a nearly 180 degree turns to engage targets behind the aircraft, and then lock onto them once headed in that opposite direction. F-22 launching an AIM-9X during testing., USAF In the F-22’s case, this means the AIM-9X Block II will not have to be shoved out into the airstream so that the pilot can obtain a hard lock before letting the missile fly. Instead the Raptor’s side weapons bay doors can remain closed until the command to launch is given—and in doing so the F-22 can remain stealthy longer during the weapons engagement portion of a dogfight. Lockheed Martin But once again, for close-in dogfighting, instead of relying on a pilot to point his eyes at the target through a HMD in order to engage said target, the AIM-9X Block II will rely on the F-22’s sensors—primarily its APG-77 AESA radar—that has roughly a 120 degree frontal field of view —to provide cueing and telemetry to the missile’s data-link. This is called “helmetless high off bore-sight” (HHOBS) capability. It may be possible to leverage information from the jet’s ALR-94 electronic support measures suite, and from third party sensor sources, such as other F-22s and even AWACs aircraft when employing the AIM-9X Block II in lock-on after launch mode, although at close range this is doubtful. But once again, the Raptor will not take advantage of the missile’s full engagement envelope without giving its pilot a HMD. Not just that, but the F-22 lacks a spherical infrared sensor system like the F-35 Distributed Aperture System that could potentially provide directional cueing for the AIM-9X Block II even without the F-35 pilot’s highly advanced Helmet Mounted Display being pointed at the target. For the HMD lacking F-22, where the AIM-9X Block II will really shine is in its ability to reach out and kill targets at intermediate ranges—much farther than its predecessor due to a new rocket motor design and lock on after launch capability. In essence, a pilot can lock up a target on their radar farther than the AIM-9X’s seeker can see, and let the missile fly. It will be guided via data-link towards the enemy until AIM-9X’s seeker head acquires the target itself and makes its terminal attack run. This gives F-22 pilots, who are highly limited by the missiles they carry internally, the ability to engage at near or beyond visual range distances with all of their eight missiles, instead of just their six AIM-120 AMRAAMs. Hughes Missile Systems Although these advances are welcomed, it is easy to find it relatively absurd that the most advanced air-to-air fighter ever built still won’t have the same high-off boresight missile capability as a 40 year old F-15 even after receiving continuos upgrades since it was declared operational some 12 years ago. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) used by American F-15, F-16, F/A-18s and a few other US combat aircraft is not an option for the Raptor because its magnetic tracking concept is incompatible with the stealthy cockpit features of the F-22. Still, other HMDs exist, some with arguably better features and adaptability than JHMCS. As of 2015, the USAF was supposed to be working towards fielding a version of the highly capable Thales Scorpion HMD for Raptor pilots. Although the system was given an abbreviated test with Raptors assigned to Nellis AFB in 2014, and the pilots really liked it, official testing was supposed to begin this year with entry into service scheduled for around 2020. Yet not much has been heard about this plan in the last two years, and there has been other talk that a new helmet may be tested instead sometime in the future. On numerous occasions, F-22 pilots have said they do not want a version of the F-35’s helmet . It brings some very unique capabilities to the F-35 , which was literally designed around it, but supposedly it has been deemed too heavy and has a forward center of gravity that will make straining under high Gs less than optimal for hard maneuvering Raptor pilots. The Scorpion HMD visor fits to the Raptor’s pilot’s existing helmet, and uses a “monocle” in front of one eye to display high-definition color imagery. Not just that but a version of it is already deployed on the A-10 and some F-16s, and it is easily adaptable to night vision goggles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrfTUXcWarM It’s frustrating to think that a solution to the F-22’s HMD woes exists, and it’s an off-the-shelf one at that, but the USAF will not move forward with procuring it for the Raptor community. After spending roughly $70 billion on the F-22 program, you would think that giving it a basic capability that was shortsightedly slashed in the 1990s as a desperate cost saving measure would be an absurdly logical move. Especially considering the total force relies so heavily on the small fleet of Raptors for air supremacy today. In the end the already outstanding F-22 will never be all that it can be without this glaringly obvious and overdue upgrade. Until then, the world’s most deadly air-to-air fighter will still have one wing tied behind its back, and it does so at the direction of the USAF brass and its army of bean counters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 29, 2021","During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Army Turned Hueys Into “Mad Bombers”","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In 2017, video and pictures of Islamic State fighters dropping modified and homemade grenades from quad-and hex-copter type drones highlighted the group’s ability to craft surprisingly advanced weapons. While novel, this particular combination is hardly the first time militants—and even established militaries—have turned to improvised aerial bombs in combat. In September 1966, the U.S. Army’s top headquarters in South Vietnam told aviation units they were formally allowed to turn UH-1 helicopters into impromptu bombers. Yet for months already, Huey crews had been dropping modified mortar bombs on enemy positions. The crews dubbed their creation the Mortar Aerial Delivery System (MADS), and some gave the choppers with the new gear installed the nickname “Mad Bombers.” “Its simplicity of installation and operation provides a new dimension of fire support when difficult targets in mountainous areas are discovered,” one 1967 report from the 1st Cavalry Division declared. To say the system was simple would be generous. The original setup devised by troops from the 173rd Airborne Brigade and 145th Aviation Battalion was little more than an open-topped wooden chute mounted in the main cabin of either short-fuselage UH-1B/C gunships or the longer UH-1D/H transports. The entire assembly held 20 modified 81mm high explosive mortar rounds. A equally crude sketch of the MADS, US Army The procedure to turn them into small air-dropped bombs was relatively easy. Ground crews would first remove the projectile’s nose and base fuzes, as well as the propellant charges. Then they would install a World War II-era M158 bomb fuze, which would detonate the mortar-bomb’s explosive charge on impact. These fuzes had been available during World War II and Korea for use on a variety of larger weapons, including the 115-pound M70 and M70A1 mustard gas bombs. Delivering the bombs was a similarly uncomplicated procedure. At one end of the chute, technicians had cut a slot and slipped in a removable plywood board. At the right moment, a member of the crew would manually pull this stopper out and the mortar bombs would just roll out. How would you know how when that moment had arrived? The pilot would point the chopper at the target while flying at approximately 2,500 feet high. Then he would wait until the target lined up with a part of his foot pedal through the small windows underneath the Huey’s nose. “Sensing the mortar rounds as they detonate, adjustments for target sight picture and wind conditions can be made and greater accuracy will result,” a standard operating procedure the 145th drafted in April 1966 explained. In short, there was a lot of personal skill involved in putting the small bombs in the right place. US Army The weapon was perfect for scattering potential ambushers from landing zones, attacking enemy forces on the ground during aerial assaults, or simply blasting targets of opportunity, including reinforced bunkers the Viet Cong built in remote areas, according to the MADS procedures. But wary of complaints from the U.S. Air Force about stealing its roles and missions, the Army aviators were quick to point out that “the ‘MAD’ system in no way duplicates or parallels the prestrike, or landing zone preparation and close air support mission of the USAF Tactical Air.” After the Pentagon created the independent Air Force in 1947, it repeatedly sparred with the Army over which service would get to fly which missions and how. During Vietnam War, with the Air Force continued to complain about Army fixed-and rotary-wing encroaching on its turf. So to read the reports, the “Mad Bomber” was just another piece of artillery. The gear simply allowed ground commanders to put more mortar rounds on target faster and more accurately. Still, “a variety of targets may be engaged with accuracy and the tactical employment of this weapons system is unlimited,” the 145th’s guide declared. “Excellent results have been obtained when this weapons system is employed against targets located in dense jungle areas where secondary forest canopies are prevalent.” And barred by agreement with the Air Force from flying fixed-wing attack aircraft, the Army was very interested in the potential of the new armament, no matter how crude. After learning about the weapon, and with the approval of the Army’s top officers in South Vietnam, the 1st and 25th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry began to test out the MADS. Marshall, S. L. A./US Army The units’ experiences over the course in nearly three years of operations differed wildly. The 1st Cavalry Division, operating from bases in South Vietnam’s central highlands, found the setup effective in the rugged terrain. In July 1967, the division went so far as to produce a study of MADS operations, which included “means of overcoming the factors which decrease the accuracy of the system, e.g., airspeed, altitude, moving targets, etc,” according to another report . The 2nd Battalion, 20th Artillery Regiment, an aerial rocket artillery unit equipped with UH-1 gunships toting 2.75-inch rockets, had developed their own version of the system, though it’s unclear what improvements the troops made to the initial design. The next month, the Army added sections on dropping mortar and cluster bombs from helicopters to official field manuals. The official doctrine specifically described rotary-wing bombers—not mentioning of the Huey specifically, as CH-47 units were flying similar missions—as a substitute for mortars in challenging environments. “The responsiveness of this support is reduced when the mortar and its ammunition must be transported over difficult terrain by foot-mobile units,” the amended manual explained. “The use of armed helicopters for delivery of droppable munitions, to include modified mortar projectiles, and cluster bomb units (CBU) can be integrated into the ground unit’s plan action.” US Army via Ray Wilhite But elsewhere, Army Major Gen. Fillmore Mearns, head of the 25th Infantry Division situated northwest of the country’s capital Saigon near the Cambodian border, decided the system wasn’t really all that useful. More than a year later, however, his successor Army Major Gen. Ellis Williamson apparently came to a different conclusion. “This system has been found to be useful…to deliver ordinance that otherwise cannot be effectively placed due to heavy jungle canopy,” the division’s staff explained in January 1969 review of recent operations . “MADS is, in some situations…an effective substitute for infantry high angle of fire weapons that cannot be employed due to triple overhead canopy jungle.” However, “the system is not recommended for use by other aviation units as in other types of terrain, the stand off capability of armed helicopters employing rockets is considered an adequate fire support means,” the report added. Shortly afterwards, the 1st Infantry Division, situated nearby, also arrived at the conclusion that the mortar bombs were in no way a substitute for artillery. Instead, the division’s 1st Aviation Battalion used the chutes to drop sensors to try and catch insurgents moving around in the jungle below. The aviators also dropped white phosphorus rounds to mark targets and even built a version that could handle larger 4.2-inch mortar rounds. The improvised flare launcher that did make it into the 1971 report. , US Army via Ray Wilhite Needless to say, units’ opinions of the “Mad Bomber” were decidedly mixed. A 1971 Army compendium of field expedient helicopter modifications in South Vietnam doesn’t mention the system at all, though a locally-made flare dispenser did get a mention. Despite the reported combat use, there are no readily available pictures of the MADS in action. After the fighting in Southeast Asia ended, the Army made no effort to refine the MADS concept. Today, the weapon is just one footnote in the history of aviation operations during the Vietnam War. However, the basic idea of a small, low cost aerial weapon never went away. In 2012, General Dynamics and the Army announced successful work on a kit to turn regular 81 mm mortar rounds into small guided bombs for small drones. It’s possible the U.S. military dropped one of these Roll Control Guided Mortars (RCGM), or a similar, improved weapon, on Al Qaeda deputy leader Abu Khayr al Masri in Syria in February 2017 . Of course, the RCGM’s GPS-guidance is decided more advanced than rolling bombs out the door of Huey.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 16, 2021",Letters Of Last Resort Are Post-Apocalyptic Orders for UK Vanguard Sub Crews,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The idea that the UK’s entire command and control apparatus, and even the country as a whole, could be wiped off the face of the earth in a single nuclear barrage is chilling. Yet it is this possibility that prompted a dark and sobering tradition among Prime Ministers following the advent of the UK’s “second strike” nuclear deterrent —their nuclear ballistic missile submarines. As soon as a new Prime Minister takes office, they receive highly classified briefings regarding the country’s nuclear weapons capabilities—specifically on the massive destruction that a single Vanguard class nuclear ballistic missile submarine and its 16 Trident II D5 missiles can convey.  They also hear about the immense amounts death the UK’s potential nuclear armed adversaries can deliver on a moment’s notice. Afterwards, and in conjunction with their top military advisor , the Prime Minister pens four identical letters in their own hand writing outlining instructions on what to do if a nuclear exchange has occurred and the British government, including the Prime Minister and a designated second person, has been killed or incapacitated. Under the worst of  circumstances, the Letter of Last Resort would stand as the last act of Her Majesty’s Government. … Once the letters are written, they are transferred to the four Vanguard class nuclear ballistic missile submarines that makeup the UK’s nuclear deterrent. Onboard, they are stored inside double nested safes and will remain there until the Prime Minister decides to change the orders or their reign ends. After which time they will be destroyed in sealed condition so that nobody knows what the orders were. During the time following a perceived attack, a series of progressive checks are made by submarine crews leading up to the captain opening the letter. These include trying to listen for radio transmissions from various levels of Royal Navy and Ministry of Defense command using multiple methods, and most famous of all, listening for new radio broadcasts by BBC Radio channel four, and specifically new episodes of BBC Today. If all else fails, following a certain predetermined period of time, rumored to be a matter of a few days, the skipper of the Vanguard class submarine will move toward extracting the letter and executing its blind instructions. Daniel Martyn Commanding Officer of HMS Vigilant next to a safe that contains the Prime Minister’s last resort instructions, on board Vanguard class submarine HMS Vigilant (AP photo): … There are a handful of known instructions the Prime Minister can choose from when penning their Letters of Last Resort, and a combination of them can also be stated. These commands include retaliate, don’t retaliate, use your own judgement, put yourself under the command of the US Navy if it still exists, or go to the same in Australia. Clearly the secrecy surrounding the letters is key as without knowledge of what the fail-safe second-strike commands are, the nuclear deterrent remains credible. If a Prime Minister’s command is to not retaliate, it may be because they have gamed out that if the letter is opened, the nuclear deterrent has already failed. Thus raining down more destruction will only result in more lives lost and lower chances that Earth can recover from the heavy radiation, fallout and nuclear winter that may follow. Obviously under most situations commands to launch would be delivered via an emergency action message, that can even be conveyed via America’s VLF communications capabilities. The Prime Minister would have just minutes to order a retaliatory strike through established channels before the enemy’s warheads detonated over London and other population centers, as well as key government and military installations around the UK. In a Daily Mail expose , Peter Hennessy and Richard Knight described the room where this order would be received and pushed out to the Vanguard class submarine on patrol: “Were the order to fire to be given from a still-functioning government, it would come to CTF 345, a bunker known as ‘The Hole’ at the Northwood facility in Middlesex. There, inside a perimeter of intense security, a small group of Naval officers sit waiting for that unlikely communication. We went to CTF 345, the first journalists ever to visit, to meet those men. They are, like their colleagues in Vanguard, quietly efficient, businesslike and matter-of-fact. They explained that the heavily encrypted message arrives on a computer from wherever the Prime Minister had issued it — which would most probably be the Government Emergency Room in a bunker deep beneath the MoD in Whitehall. The officers then collect codes from two safes attached to the far wall of the ops room. Those safes are monitored constantly, via CCTV, by Royal Marines. If anyone approaches them who is not properly authorised to do so, the Marines will storm the room with weapons ready. The officers of CTF 345 showed us how they would, in pairs, authenticate the message and, finally, put it onto the transmission system for communication to the submarine on patrol, together with the encrypted coordinates of the designated target.” Alternatively, if a surprise strike wiped out the UK’s ability to communicate with their Trident missile equipped boats, one of which is on patrol in the Atlantic at all times, the Letter of Last Resort can work as a sort of automated fail-safe response that ensures the second strike capability is activated as a means of vengeance. The trigger that fires D5 Trident SLBMs aboard a Vanguard class SSBN. It is made out of the grip of a Colt 45 (AP photo): … Some cite the Letter of Last Resort system as flawed, not just over the fact that a person who is probably dead is dictating the fate of millions of lives without knowing the exact details of the situation, but if submarine commander is ordered to strike, how do they know exactly who to strike? Not just that, but it seems that glitches in the system are possible, especially considering that an already isolated submarine’s ability to gauge who is left alive in Britain, and within the governmental command authority, in a relatively short period of time no less, is questionable. Letters of Last Resort are not deployed aboard America’s nuclear ballistic missile submarines, but the US, with it large landmass, extensive command and control infrastructure, and nuclear triad is more survivable to a sudden nuclear attack than the UK. Only the President or Vice President can order nuclear weapons release, and that decision has to be made either very quickly once an incoming barrage is detected, or the hope is that the President or Vice President can survive the strike, along with Strategic Command’s flying outposts, in order to relay commands to execute a retaliatory strike.

Paul Nickell And Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021","How To Fight To Win In The F-14, A-4 and F-5 At The Navy’s Topgun School","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At height of the Cold War, and just months before the public’s perception of US Navy tactical aviation would be forever changed by the blockbuster action movie Top Gun , F-14 Tomcat pilot Paul Nickell would arrive on Topgun’s doorstep. After graduating from the elite fighter weapons and tactics school, Nickell would become an instructor there himself, flying against student pilots in the same F-5s and A-4s that had taxed him and his Tomcat to the max just months before. In the second in our three part in-depth series about Paul’s experiences flying fighters for the US Navy in the 1980s, he tells us how to fight and win in some of Topgun’s most iconic jets, and what it was like to attend and later teach at the legendary US Navy Fighter Weapons School. Paul Nickell posing in front of one of Topgun’s F-5E Tiger IIs, Courtesy of Paul Nickell Showing up to the first day of school I think it was the second oldest hangar at Miramar, but it was designated Hangar One. It sat at the east end of Runway 24 Right, just to the north of the hold short line. Most likely built in the 1950s, it wasn’t there in the early 1940s when my dad was stationed at then Camp Kearny as a B-24 radioman. It had survived a flamed out pilotless F-8 Crusader crashing into it in December of 1969, a tragedy that took 14 lives. Across the north side of the hangar, facing the road, in huge deep-blue block letters was the word “TOPGUN.  At the time, Topgun was not a household word. The average American had no idea what it was, but that would change soon. After parking in the lot across the street, we walked past a couple of large dumpsters on the side of the parking lot entrance, crossed the street, climbed a few steps and returned a salute from the gate guard. About 50 feet away, in the northeast corner of the hanger, was a single width blue metal door. Above the door was a white metal sign screwed to the corrugated grey metal siding which read “WELCOME TO NAVY FIGHTER WEAPONS SCHOOL” in black stenciled letters. In the center of the sign was a large sticker of the Topgun emblem. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Entering the door, we were in a stairwell that went half way up and then switched back to complete the journey to the second level. The walls of the stairwell were painted gloss white and were covered with neatly spaced red silhouettes of MiG aircraft kills from Vietnam.  Below each were the aircrew names and the date of the kill. Additionally there were two recent silhouettes from Libya. At the top of the stairs we turned left and started down a hallway. The right side was solid and was the exterior wall of the hangar. There was one opening on the right, about the size of a double door, with an accordion metal contraption across it so that no one would accidentally walk out the opening and fall 20 feet to the ramp below. The remainder of the wall was covered with a small group of pictures of the current Topgun staff and plaques.There were several rows of plaques that ran the length of the hallway, probably 100 yards or more. Each plaque was a gift from a crew that had attended training at Topgun, and each had a unique story behind it. There were literally hundreds of them. San Diego Air & Space Museum collection Down the left side of the hallway were the squadron spaces. The CO and XO offices were first with a secretary in front. There was a small ready room where the Squadron Duty Officer sat during flight ops. There were several small groups of briefing and debriefing rooms, along with two relatively large classrooms. Beyond that was the operations office and the training office.  We were directed into Classroom One which was walled with 4X8 sheets of imitation wood paneling. There were tables and chairs to seat about 35 students plus a row of chairs with no tables across the back for additional guests. The left side of the classroom had a single air conditioning window unit that dumped the heat and humidity from the classroom into the hangar.  There were a few large TV’s in the corners. At the front of the classroom was a whiteboard, a podium, and an opaque plastic screen that slides could be projected onto from behind. At numerous places around the room there were models of different types of US and threat fighter aircraft attached to wooden dowels that could be used for briefing and debriefing purposes.  Most of the furnishings of this room and the rest of the spaces had probably been lifted from somewhere else on the base, or traded for through the navy supply system. Obviously none of it appeared nice enough to have had origins on an Air Force base.  We found our places at a table denoted with paper name tags and a stack of handouts for each of us. It was day one of Topgun. Putting Topgun’s lessons to use The course progressed in a logical fashion. The first two days were filled with lectures. From day three on, most days began with a lecture, followed by multiple flights. Week one flying was all 1 V 1 against A-4E’s and F-5 E/F’s. Week two involved 2 V 2 and 2 V Unknown missions.  As the weeks progressed, the missions got larger and more complex until the final class “Alpha Strike” mission. We had a number of memorable flights, but for me, the following were the most memorable. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Somewhere around Friday afternoon of week three we flew our final 1 V 1 flight, otherwise known as “Grad 1 V 1.” Unlike all of the previous 1 V 1 missions that we had flown in week one, for Grad 1 V 1 all instructors and all crews briefed in one large classroom. Additionally there were unknown Air Force and Marine pilots, and a couple of other unknowns gents in flight suits.  At the end of the briefing, the Rules of Engagement (ROE) were briefed and concluded by one crew member from each type of aircraft briefing the stall/spin recovery procedures for their type.  The types of aircraft going through the class and those flown by the instructors were recited, followed by the Air Force pilots reciting F-15 and F-16 procedures, and the others briefing P-51 and F-86 procedures. At that point all participants were handed a sealed envelope, and the briefing was complete. Inside each envelope was a card that told us our “Goon” callsign, which warning area and which end of that warning area to go to, and what time to be there. Unlike all of our previous 1 V 1s, we had no idea what type of aircraft we would be fighting, and since these engagements would start with an intercept, we would not know until the merge. After the brief we drove down to the VF-24 (my Tomcat squadron at the time) hangar and advised maintenance what time we needed to man up to make our range time. Unfortunately we had no “up” aircraft. Even though our Topgun flights had priority, VF-24 was relatively early in its turnaround cycle, and thus low on the priority list for aircraft parts. The closer squadrons got to deployment, the higher their parts priority went up. We called the Topgun Duty Officer and advised him of our situation, and then we waited. Finally just as it looked like we would miss our Grad 1 V 1 sortie, an aircraft was ready. We ran to it, did a quick preflight, and manned up and started. As soon as we had an the inertial navigation system aligned, we had the ground crew pull the chocks, taxied as fast as possible to the runway and blasted off. Communicating with the Topgun Duty Officer, we knew that our bogey was at the south end of the restricted area holding and trying to save as much gas as possible for us. As soon as we entered the warning area, we stroked the burners and headed to our restricted area at about Mach 1.2. Arriving, we checked in on our discrete frequency with our Goon call sign and got a reply from our bogey using his Goon call sign.  We immediately called “Fights On” and commenced about a 30 mile intercept. Approaching the merge, we slowed to about 425 knots, giving us some extra energy, but not so much speed that we couldn’t bleed the energy and turn. We had discussed game plans for the different aircraft types that we might encounter, but I was pumped up and my heart was pounding as we approached five miles. Dave “Bio” Baranek Attempting to use the environment and vertical separation to make us harder to see, I brought the nose on and had a speck in the target diamond on the heads up display (HUD).  By about 2 miles the bogey had spotted us and turned nose on, and just inside of a mile I was able to visually identify (VID) him as an A-4E Skyhawk. Our game plan was set. We passed left to left, turned left just far enough to keep him in sight, unloaded, accelerated and attempted to build separation. As the bogey’s nose was coming around towards us and approaching three miles separation, I went to idle power and extended the speed-brakes to slow rapidly to about 350 knots so that the Tomcat would turn at a good rate and small radius. The difficulty now would be to maintain sight of the relatively tiny A-4. At three plus miles of separation and nose on, the A-4 was a speck as we looked over our left shoulders about 160 degrees aft of the direction we were heading.  We had the separation; it was now time to pitch back and shoot the A-4 in the face. The hard part would be maintaining sight. It was difficult enough while extending away, but now smack 6.5 Gs on and it would be infinitely more difficult, but we were successful. USN As our nose approached the A-4, my Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) in back got a radar lock on the A-4. With a AIM-9 Sidewinder missile selected, the missile’s seeker head immediately slaved to the radar track. We got a shrill tone indicating the seeker head had acquired the A-4’s heat signature. At about a mile and a quarter nose-to-nose, I squeezed the trigger on the stick grip and called “Fox 2.”  After a few seconds the A-4 “Goon” driver called “that’s a kill” followed by “knock it off.” It wasn’t the most glamorous and flamboyant way to kill a subsonic but highly maneuverable bogey, with stalls and spins and groveling gunshots, but it was effective, lethal and it was what Topgun taught. It required discipline, skill, and it was much more challenging than the former approach. We were ecstatic! The A-4 was at bingo fuel from waiting on us, and we were at bingo fuel from our high speed transit to the restricted area. He joined up on our wing and we, as the victors, led him back to the overhead break at Naval Air Station Miramar. The speed limit coming into the break was 325 knots. We probably deserved a speeding ticket that day! Alpha Strike Another memorable flight at Topgun was our final event called an “Alpha Strike.” I think the name originated during the Vietnam War where certain targets were designated “Alpha” targets and large coordinated strikes were conducted against them. By the end of the class we had gone from working together as a crew flying 1 V 1 engagements, to working as a section with another crew from our sister squadron, VF-211, to working as a division with four fighters. For the Alpha Strike we would combine two divisions plus our Air Intercept Controllers (AICs) who were going through the class with us. David “Bio” Baranek The strike took place on the ranges south and east of China Lake Naval Air Station, so there was also a surface-to-air threat simulation present. And then there was the always difficult group of Topgun bogeys providing an air-to-air threat. As a class we planned the strike and then on the next to the last day of the course, we flew the mission. With several aircraft representing the attack package, eight fighters, and what seemed like an unending stream of bad guys, we executed the strike amid simulated surface-to-air missiles flying. There were aircraft everywhere. We then all returned to Miramar for our final debrief.  With so many aircraft involved, it was a challenge for any one person to know everything that happened exactly, or to debrief it. The range was not instrumented so we would have to rely on our own individual accounts to piece the battle together. Each fighter crew went through what they had seen and done, and then the bogey drivers stepped in with what they saw. In the end, we were able to put together a reasonable reconstruction of what had had occurred. Overall our strike had been a success, but there were lessons learned especially in the areas of timing and communications. The beauty of the Topgun debriefing style was that it was impersonal. Lessons were learned in a non threatening environment, and the debrief was a positive learning experience. It reinforced the positive things that had occurred, and looked for ways to improve things that had not gone so well. That night we had a class party with numerous skits put on by the students and staff. Paul’s Topgun class, Courtesy of Paul Nickell The next morning we graduated. We didn’t win the Topgun trophy, and neither did any other crew. There was no such thing…at least not until the movie came out . Topgun had truly been a life changing event for me. A lot of things about flying and fighting jets, and using them to project power had come much more clearly into focus during my short visit there. Fighting Topgun’s aggressors with the Tomcat I had previous experience fighting F-5s and A-4s from my time at the Replacement Air Group and also from my time at VF-24. They could both definitely be a challenge. Every aircraft has its strengths and weaknesses. In roughly the first 40-50 years of air combat, most fighters were evaluated based upon speed and altitude capability. Also during that time, their weapons, guns and early infrared missiles, were primarily effective from behind the target, saddled in at close range. By the 1970s and 80s we had forward-quarter capable missiles that were effective, but sometimes unreliable. As a result, we simulated forward quarter shots, but often didn’t call kills except for rear quarter shots. As Topgun came into existence due to poor air combat experiences in Vietnam, they started looking at other measures of aircraft performance, namely turn rate and turn radius. The speed at which an aircraft gets its best turn rate with minimum turn radius and no loss of energy is called its “corner” speed.  For a given aircraft, this speed varies with altitude; slower at lower altitudes and increasing at higher altitudes. Having said all of that, with a neutral start, an aircraft with a slower corner speed (and smaller turn radius) and equal turn rates should start working further and further behind an aircraft with a higher corner speed (and larger turn radius), eventually getting it into position for a gun or aft-quarter missile shot. usn An aircraft flown below its corner speed could decrease its turn radius (good), but would also decrease its turn rate (bad). Flown above corner speed it would normally increase its turn radius (bad) and rate (bad). Since the A-4s and F-5s flown by Topgun couldn’t match the F-14s ability to turn, their tactic was almost always to increase their turn rate by bleeding energy, and end up in an offensive position, but much slower (lower energy) than the F-14. The F-14’s advantage was its ability to add energy and extend away horizontally or vertically and then employ all aspect missiles. So intimidation was one of their key tactics. The A-4 and F-5 had several other advantages. They were both extremely small and difficult to keep track of especially nose on to a fighter whose crew would most likely be under high G forces. Additionally, for the subsonic A-4 which lacks an afterburner, it could easily fly for more than an hour at full military power. The F-14, with 16,000 pounds of fuel at takeoff, could burn close to 2,000 pounds of fuel per minute in full afterburner. As a result, the F-14 had very little engagement time, much less any time to grovel. It was a losing proposition. Tomcats over Socal in the 1980s, USN Ultimately to be successful in the F-14, a crew was required to be disciplined and precisely fly the Tomcat to defeat the F-5 and A-4. It needed to get in, take its shots, and get out. Another realistic advantage that the bogeys virtually always had was numbers. Flying the Tomcat, you could always plan on being outnumbered by the bad guys who were difficult to gain and maintain sight of, and you had to know that they could easily keep sight of you. Consequently you didn’t want to grovel and you didn’t want to stick around long. And finally to top it all off, these aircraft were being flown by the best bogey drivers out there bar none. Returning to a fleet squadron as a Topgun graduate We graduated on Friday morning, walked back out past the dumpsters into the parking lot, and drove back to VF-24, which was also based at Miramar. We spent a good bit of the afternoon wandering around the Maintenance spaces thanking the sailors who had supported us and given us good aircraft throughout the course. Additionally we had a month and a half’s worth of work to catch up on. Fortunately VF-24 had several Topgun graduates, and two senior officers who were former Topgun instructors. Consequently the information that we had learned while attending Topgun was highly sought after and wholeheartedly accepted by all members of the squadron. Within several months, I assumed the job of Pilot Training Officer. Through this position, I was able to share the information that I had learned with the rest of the squadron. Part of the charge as a Topgun graduate was to “talk the talk”, and we were both able to do that with lectures and briefings. The other part of the charge was to “walk the walk”, and we did that through the way we briefed, flew, and debriefed our flights. There was no way that Topgun could have direct exposure to all squadron pilots and RIOs in the fleet, so they trained the trainers who then went back to the squadrons and trained the remainder of the pilots and RIOs.  Given the small amount of assets available, it was a very effective way of accomplishing such a goal. Learning to be the teacher If you think walking into Topgun as a student might be a humbling experience, try walking in as a new instructor. The one comfort zone that I had, flying the F-14, was now gone. Quickly I was given a ground job in maintenance, but unlike the fleet, I did very little towards that job. I had a Chief Petty Officer working for me, and he took care of everything. The two immediate priorities were to get qualified to conduct a lecture and get checked out in one of two aircraft, the A-4 Skyhawk or F-5 Tiger. Courtesy of Paul Nickell I was assigned the “Course Rules” lecture and given about six weeks to be prepared for my final “murder board.” Course Rules was about an hour review of all of the airfields and areas where the students might operate over the duration of the class. I received a pass-down from the instructor who had been conducting it, and then was on my own to research the presentation and make any changes I felt necessary. I then spent countless hours preparing to present it to the Topgun staff who would critique, or “murder” every aspect of the presentation and decide if I was ready to present it to a class. Passing murder boards was nowhere near a given; many had to be repeated. It was a terribly rigorous process. Fortunately I did pass the murder board. During my time as a Topgun instructor, I would eventually pass Course Rules on to a new instructor, take over a lecture on Combat Gunnery, and develop a completely new lecture on Threat Tactics. Taking on new lectures never got any easier, in fact it was just the opposite. The more qualified you got and the more involved you got in the day-to-day operations of Topgun, the less time you had to take on a new lecture. New lectures involved many 16 to 18 hour days, and weeks without a day off. It was amazing the standards that we held ourselves and each other to in an effort to uphold the reputation of the school. From a flying standpoint, I first checked out in the A-4E. The syllabus was called Familiarization/Tactics or FAM/TAC. It consisted of 12 to 15 flights. Because Topgun had no two seat A-4s at the time, I seem to recall going to VF-126 for three or four TA-4 rides to get an A-4 NATOPS qual (qualification). In addition, I completed VF-126s spin recovery training in the T-2C Buckeye. The beauty of that training was that while in the T-2C, you could use whatever spin recovery procedures your particular aircraft used, and it would recover from both upright and inverted spins. After that, the syllabus was comprised of multiple 1 V 1 flights with FAM/TAC instructors flying A-4s and F-5s. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Although building experience flying and fighting the aircraft was a big part of the syllabus, there was a huge emphasis on briefing, leading, and debriefing the flight. Once in a restricted area, a typical FAM/TAC flight would consist of an eyeball calibration, a snapshot drill, and then multiple air combat maneuvering (ACM) engagements, usually 3 to 4. For the eyeball cal, we would start about a half mile abeam and then slowly separate with the leader calling out ranges out to about 2 miles. It was important for fighter pilots to be able to estimate ranges visually to determine when they were within missile and gun envelopes. The snapshot drills consisted of two aircraft starting out about a mile abeam and then flying a weaving pattern with one practicing a high angle off snap shot with the gun on each merge.  It was good to see from an offensive standpoint when a high angle off gun shot might present itself, and from a defensive standpoint to see when you might be susceptible to a high angle off, but potentially lethal gun attack. We also practiced defending against gun snap shots. Courtesy Paul Nickell As a FAM/TAC student instructor, it was your job to orchestrate all of this and keep your flight within the restricted area along a certain TACAN radial between two different DME distances.  We would then set up for the ACM engagements, usually commencing at about 20,000 feet, 300 to 350 knots, and a mile to a mile and a half abeam. Typical engagements would last anywhere from a minute and a half to three or four minutes. “Knock it offs” usually were the result of a valid shot, a neutral stagnation of the fight, or a successful disengagement (bug out) by one of the aircraft. The student instructor would then get the aircraft back together and on a heading to remain in the area. At the same time both aircraft would be climbing back up to the starting altitude of the next engagement and getting the speed set. As if that wasn’t enough, simultaneously each pilot would be writing notes on a card on their kneeboard about the previous engagement, for debriefing purposes. Successive engagements would occur until the first jet reached bingo fuel and then the student instructor would lead the flight back home. As I was getting started in the FAM/TAC syllabus, there was a break between Topgun classes and a gun detachment (det) was planned to NAS Key West. The F-5’s had operable guns, but the A-4 did not. Even though I had yet to get checked out in the F-5, I went on the det as all of the instructors were going and also the squadron took the A-4s so we could conduct FAM/TAC from there. One of my early FAM/TAC flights out of Key West was against another A-4 flown by the Topgun Training Officer.  He was a Marine and long-time veteran of Topgun, so I was excited to fly with him. We took off, crossed the white sandy beach which gave way to the beautiful turquoise waters of the gulf, and headed for our operating area. Little did I know that on this day I would be exploring the edges of the envelope, of the aircraft…and of myself. We made our way out to the restricted area conducting our eyeball cal and snapshot drill enroute. Once in the area we flew two or three engagements to knock it offs, and having enough fuel remaining, set up for one more. Fairly quickly this engagement turned into a vertical fight. I don’t really remember either A-4 having an advantage over the other, but I do remember starting up with the other A-4 topping out several thousand feet above me. Courtesy of Paul Nickell There was a caution in the A-4 NATOPS flight manual about running the jet out of airspeed with the nose 90 to 110 degrees nose high. In other words with the nose pointed anywhere from straight up to on its back, basically within 20 degrees of straight up. I was totally focussed on the other A-4 above and as he started tracking down toward the horizon, I realized that my nose movement was slowing rapidly. Pointed pretty close to straight up, it stopped…and then all was quiet. You’re never conscious of the air noise in an aircraft…until it is silent…and then the silence is deafening!  I was now exploring the caution area described in the manual, and was about to learn why there was a caution about it! I neutralized the controls, reduced the power, locked my harness, and ran the stab trim down to about two degrees nose up. At the same time I raised the flaps. By this time I was falling with the nose still high, but then it started slicing down and to the right. Finally! The nose was starting down towards earth so I could regain some airspeed.  To my amazement, as it came slicing down through vertical it kept right on going back up toward the horizon and at the same time the jet was rolling upside down. As it got close to the horizon and I was staring straight down through the top of the canopy at the turquoise water, I realized that the nose was now starting to move laterally close to the horizon. There was a dull audible cycling whine beginning, and it was getting louder and cycling faster. To this day I don’t know if it was a real noise, or just something created in my inner ear by the forces. It quickly became obvious to me that I was entering a spin, and it was getting quite violent. I was being tossed around the tiny cockpit in every direction. Most of the time my view was water, while hanging from the straps, but at times it was blue sky with my butt firmly planted in the seat. I checked the AOA gauge and it was flopping from pegged high to pegged low, thus I couldn’t tell for sure if it was an upright or inverted spin, although I think in eventually settled into an inverted spin. I had done the things I needed to do to avoid a spin, but now it was time to counter it. Checking the turn needle, it was pegged to the right. I put in full left rudder. The airspeed was well below 100 knots. Checking the altimeter I was approaching 10,000 feet.  Meanwhile my instructor saw what was happening and was chasing me down in his A-4.  Several more rotations went by and at that point he told me I was at 10,000 feet and called for me to eject. Things went into slow motion. The conflicting emotions of defeat, distress, fear, disappointment, dread all weighed heavily. It was hard to accept that this was really happening…this was a perfectly good aircraft and the last thing that I wanted to do was leave it in the Gulf of Mexico! During the brief moment of this nuclear explosion of emotions in my brain, I suddenly realized that things were changing. The frequency of the cycling whine was slowing, the nose was getting lower below the horizon, and that beautiful air noise was starting to replace the diminishing whine. I slowly relaxed the left rudder, rolled back upright, and called out over the raidio, “I got it, I got it!!!”  Now with flying speed I shoved the throttle to the stop, pulled back on the stick and bottomed out somewhere slightly above 5,000 feet. My instructor joined up and said, “let’s go home!”  I, my jet, and my instructor had been through a lot in the last few minutes. Getting back on deck safely was the order of the day. After parking, I wrote the aircraft up for an over-stress inspection; 6 positive Gs, 2.4 negative Gs.  Maintenance ultimately had to replace several of the major bolts of the fuselage. We debriefed the entire flight, then called it a day. Courtesy Paul Nickell That evening at the Staff Meeting (STAFFEX), with no advance notice, I was asked to tell the story. Being the new guy, it was very intimidating, but the other instructors asked questions and were genuinely interested in the details. No one gave me a hard time. The biggest lesson that I learned and used the rest of my time in the Navy was that in a situation where you run out of airspeed while nose high, don’t quit and let the aircraft do what it’s going to do. The nose has to come down, but you’ve got to control the rate. If it’s developing a high pitch or yaw rate while coming down, counter it with stick or rudder so that it doesn’t go right through the vertical and back up toward the horizon with no airspeed. That worked well for me both in the A-4 and F-5 on a number occasions. No longer would I sit back and let it do its thing. To this day, any time I fly near tropical turquoise waters, I flash back to that A-4 cockpit with those beautiful waters spinning up above me as I fell out of the sky toward them, and it haunts me. I had survived again, living by the old aviation adage, it’s better to be lucky than good! How to fight and win in the F-5 and A-4 I completed the A-4 FAM/TAC syllabus and was able to fly with the next class, at least in the multi bogey events. I was now a full up instructor, but I still had to qualify in the F-5. Over the next couple of months I was able to complete the FAM/TAC syllabus in that jet also. Courtesy of Paul Nickell The second FAM/TAC syllabus was definitely easier than the first, since I had already become proficient in briefing, leading, and debriefing from the first aircraft syllabus. Once checked out in both aircraft, probably the biggest advantage Topgun instructors had was time in the jets. We had plenty of money for flying, and we had great maintenance personnel who kept our machines up and running. Virtually all of our time was ACM. While classes were in session, most of our flying was with the class. However in the weeks between classes we supported the fleet working out of Miramar and other Navy and Marine bases that had Hornets and Tomcats, and also supported air wing dets at NAS Fallon in Nevada. By the time I was an instructor, all of the Topgun class aircraft were either F-14’s or F-18’s, both of which were superior to the A-4 and F-5. However, the A-4 could hold its own with both, if it could get them to slow down, which it usually did through intimidation. The A-4 had aerodynamic leading edge slats which once deployed would significantly help its turn rate at slower speeds. Unfortunately sometimes they would deploy asymmetrically causing a rolloff at the worst of times tactically. Additionally we used the flaps a great deal at slower speeds. There was a three position flap handle, up, down, and hold, located near the throttle that could be used to gradually lower the flaps as the airspeed decreased. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Probably the biggest advantage available was trimming the horizontal stabilizer. The elevator on the trailing edge of the stabilizer was tiny compared to the overall area of the stabilizer.  Trimming the stabilizer up helped greatly in keeping the nose up at slow speeds.  I would usually wear a hole in the right thumb of my leather flying gloves every couple of months from working the trim button so much while fighting in the A-4.  Additionally our A-4s were stripped of unnecessary parts, giving them the best thrust to weight ratio possible. All in all, it was a very good simulator of the MiG-17. If the A-4 pilot could maneuver aggressively and out of plane enough to intimidate the fleet fighters and get them to slow, it had a fighting chance…and with no afterburner, it could fight for a very long time. Additionally a great advantage of both the A-4 and F-5 was their small size, especially when viewed from nose or tail on.  It was much easier for the bogeys to keep sight of the fighters than the reverse. The F-5 was like a sports car. You wore a survival vest and G suit when you flew it, and hauled a parachute out from the parachute rigger (PR) shop. After putting your chute in the seat, you literally walked around it, kicked the tires, hopped in and lit the fires! It was so simple. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Although it had a very small cross section nose on, the fuselage was significantly wider than the A-4, so the cockpit was much wider and seemed spacious. It had a higher wing loading than other aircraft that I had flown, thus its takeoff and approach speeds were noticeably faster. It was not a good aircraft for landing on wet runways, and had a drag chute just in case. Fortunately at Miramar we had little rain and a 14,000 foot runway. The F-5 was a much better simulator of the MiG-21. It had maneuvering flaps and slats controlled by a thumb switch on the throttle which would help as it got slower. When simulating a MiG-21, we would normally limit it to rear quarter IR missiles and guns. Flown well, it could give the F-14 and F-18 a good fight initially, but would lose the battle if they managed their energy well. It was also fuel restricted and could not grovel for long periods like the A-4. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Because of its afterburner and supersonic capability, it could be an effective simulator of the MiG-23 if flown accordingly; high speed and relatively low G. We would normally use it in later class missions to simulate some of the newer Soviet threat aircraft with forward quarter capability. However, with no radar it was very difficult to simulate these threats and shots effectively unless on instrumented ranges which were often unavailable. We were definitely aware of the newest Soviet fighters and their capabilities, and the fact that they were being exported to third world countries. We did the best that we could do with the equipment that we had, but it was becoming a losing battle attempting to simulate the newer threats. Fortunately those that had come ahead of us had the foresight to plan for a more capable threat simulator.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For nearly a century, diesel-electric submarines relied on constantly charging traditional lead-acid batteries by running their diesel engines either on the surface or later on, while snorkeling near the surface . This left them constantly vulnerable, as they could only hide deep beneath the surface for hours or a couple days at a time. Over the last few decades, Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology has revolutionized the traditional diesel-electric submarine  Performance capabilities approaching the the domain of highly expensive and large nuclear submarines have became available for a fraction of the cost in the form of smaller, AIP equipped diesel-electric submarines. Now the diesel-electric submarine is on the verge of yet another revolution, one that will return to type to its original roots, relying on diesel engines and batteries alone to go about its clandestine business. AIP technology describes an idea more than one strict submarine configuration. The same general concept can be achieved via multiple methods. The most modern versions range from using Stirling Engines , to the French MESMA (translated as autonomous submarine energy module) closed-cycle steam turbine system, to cutting-edge fuel cells to power the submarine while it is submerged for long periods of time. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, with cost, complexity and technological risk being major factors beyond raw performance. For instance, Sweden’s deadly but comparatively simple and proven Gotland class uses Stirling Engines for AIP, and although the technology is well proven and affordable, it also requires the boat to lug around liquid oxygen oxidizer, which can have its own dangers, as well as inert gas to mix with it. The Stirling engines and other infrastructure needed to make the system work, much of a relatively small submarine’s bulk gets taken up by the system. Additionally, Stirling Engine based AIP has many moving parts, which can make noise even when a high-degree of soundproofing is designed into the submarine. Sweden leased a Gotland class submarine to the Navy in the mid 2000s to work as an aggressor boat. It proved to be a very dangerous enemy, with its AIP technology causing major concerns among US Navy tacticians. The impact of these prolonged war games are still being felt today (US Navy photo): USN The French MESMA form of AIP, as used in Pakistan’s Agosta 90B class , is far more complex than the Stirling Engine AIP concept. It basically acts in a similar fashion as a nuclear reactor, although it uses ethanol and liquid oxygen combustion to generate steam, not a nuclear reaction, to spin a turbine and generate electricity. Once again, the boat has to lug around ethanol and volatile liquid oxygen as well as complex machinery—which produces noise—to make the system work, but it can produce a lot of power, which is good for high-speed operations. Cost is a major factor as MESMA is not a cheap technology to acquire or maintain. Finally, fuel cell-based AIP , although very high-tech and not capable of quickly ramping-up its power output like say a MESMA configuration can, is very quiet as there are few moving parts in the system. It also is a very efficient system for long endurance missions. So if you don’t have to sprint very fast but have to stay silent and stealthy for long periods of time, the technology has huge benefits. It is thought that Australia’s upcoming Shortfin Barracuda submarines , of French origin, will use fuel cell AIP propulsion. These massive submarines will offer as close to nuclear propulsion capabilities as possible. Israel’s latest Dolphin class boats also use fuel cell AIP, which makes sense as they work as Israel’s second-strike nuclear deterrent. All sensors and weapons being equal, a Navy has to justify what type of diesel electric submarine to choose based not just on cost but also on what type of tactics they aim to employ and what type of combat environment they are most likely to fight in. For instance, if long-range patrols and ambush tactics are common, along with the need for maximum stealth, fuel cell AIP technology may be best. If bursts of high-speed during attack and evasion maneuvers are needed often, along with high endurance, MESMA may be most appropriate. For shorter-range littoral combat operations, the Stirling Engine-based AIP technology may make the most sense. The thing is that with the large leaps in battery technology realized over the last couple of decades, AIP technology may soon face serious competition in the world of submarine warfare. The first electric submarine was the Peral Submarine built for the Spanish in 1888: … High-tech diesel-electric submarines may begin to return to their simpler roots as Japan is pioneering a concept today that aims to eliminate AIP altogether. Their next generation Soryu class diesel-electric attack submarines will be equipped with lithium-ion batteries, and just like submarines dating back before World War I, they will run undersea on battery power alone. The Soryu class is already a very modern submarine, having been introduced into service just over a decade ago. As an outgrowth of the previous Oyashio class , these are not tiny boats, displacing 4,200 tons submerged and measuring 275 feet long, They are the largest submarines Japan has constructed since the end of World War II. They also feature an “X” tailplane configuration for extreme maneuverability in tight littoral environments. The profile of the Soryu class (Mike1979Russia/wikicommons): … Today seven boats are operational, all of which leverage Stirling Engine AIP technology licensed directly from Kockums—the same Swedish company that produces the Gotland class. Japan, an island nation with long and complex coastlines, uses its submarines to patrol its territorial holdings and to protect its shores. As such, the proven and affordable Stirling Engine-based AIP technology, paired with the class’s large size and ample fuel reservoirs, was a good, balanced fit for their needs. But now Japan wants to eliminate AIP technology altogether without losing its benefits, and in doing so free up room for other capabilities while also simplifying design, construction and sustainment of their future submarines. Above all else, this new configuration should result in quieter operation than most existing AIP capable submarines. The idea is to install thousands of lithium-ion batteries along with powerful diesel engines and generators, as well as large exhaust and intakes stacks to accommodate them, into a tweaked Soryu design. A new power handling system that can deal with high power loads and optimize efficiency is also included in the concept. Basically, the configuration is similar to a standard diesel-electric submarine, that uses diesel engines and batteries alone for propulsion, but infused with new technology. … Lithium-ion batteries have a ton of advantages over their old-school lead-acid cousins. They keep up their output even when their charge runs low, they are lighter than lead-acid batteries, they can be charged exceptionally fast (hence the more powerful diesel engine and generators), and they can store much more energy. Compared to the AIP system they aim to replace, endurance should be similar, while the overall boat’s propulsion system design will be less complex and bulky. Not just that, but lithium-ion batteries can provide large output on demand, allowing the boat to dash mush faster while dived compared to one running on an AIP system. The main downside to lithium-ion batteries is very well publicized: they are known to “runaway” and combust—exactly what you don’t want on a submarine. When they do so they produce very high heat, give off toxic fumes and expel conductive dust. They are also hard to extinguish using traditional means. But because weight is not as much of an issue on a large sea-going vessel, new methods of abatement can be put in place to lower the risk of a fire and its potentially catastrophic results. Soryu class boat undergoing maintenance (Hunini/wikicommons): … Suppliers are working with Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force to overcome these concerns by building larger lithium-ion cell matrices with reinforced boundaries and enhanced chemistry that is less susceptible to these types of events. Extensive short-circuit, saltwater intrusion, drop and impact testing has also been done to certify the batteries for such critical use. Also, a specialized fire extinguishing system will be installed aboard advanced Soryu boats to neutralize a fire quickly and automatically in its battery compartments should one occur. Lithium-ion batteries have had their problems in aircraft and in submersibles before , but Japan is investing billions into making the technology work, with the last three Soryu class boats being earmarked for lithium-ion propulsion. The seventh boat in the class, which is in the water now, may also use lithium-ion batteries, although it may be in combination with the four Stirling Engines found on earlier models. This boat could act as a “bridge” between the new all lithium-ion battery configuration and the older AIP configuration and could also serve as technology demonstrator for fielding the new batteries on a smaller scale aboard a submarine. The Soryu class is almost entirely covered in acoustic tiling (Norio NAKAYAMA/wikicommons): … With this new Soryu class configuration, Japan has the potential to raise their profile as builders of an excellent class of attack submarine to the realm of world leader in new conventionally-powered submarine technology. This could mean serious exports if the type proves to be reliable and safe. Down the road, the success of Japan’s lithium-ion battery powered subs could also mean a large cut in price for their AIP-like capabilities. Not just that, but other configurations, where existing AIP technologies are paired with lithium-ion batteries could also emerge, offering the best of both worlds for some users. The pairing of lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells for instance could result in highly capable and versatile submarines that feature extreme endurance, very quiet operation, fast acceleration and high dash speeds. In fact, there are rumors that China is working on pairing lithium-ion batteries with its own AIP submarines right now. But such a hybrid design would come at greater cost and complexity than what Japan or most navies require. A diagram of the so called “Super Soryu” class of submarines that was intended to fulfill Australia’s requirement for a new advanced attack submarine. It would have used lithium-ion batteries instead of AIP and many thought it was a favorite to win the tender. In the end DCNS won with their Shortfin Baraccuda concept that supposedly leverages fuel cell AIP technology. Considering the extreme range requirements that Australia puts on their submarines, it really is no surprise that even the enlarged “Super Soryu,” which was designed for more territorial operations, was passed over: … The US Navy, which got out of the diesel-electric submarine business 27 years ago , has since experienced a submarine deficit, one that has no sign of abating. If Japan is successful in proving that higher-tech, yet simpler and possibly cheaper lithium-ion powered diesel-electric submarines can achieve similar or better performance as AIP equipped boats, all with less of equal acoustic signature as the best nuclear submarines, the US should move to adopt the technology. The USS Blueback was the last diesel-electric submarine in the US Navy’s fleet. For years it worked as aggressor boat, but by 1990 the Navy had moved on to an all nuclear submarine force. Blueback was featured in Hunt for the Red October and now resides at Oregon Museum of Science and Industry: … As we have discussed before , there is every reason for the US Navy to invest in diesel-electric submarines now that they have evolved so much over the last three decades. For so many missions, a nuclear submarine is not needed, and their massive infrastructure needs and security concerns makes forward basing them in foreign countries impossible. But now that AIP may not even be needed, the Navy could solve its attack submarine capacity woes by adopting Japan’s technology and building their own version of the advanced Soryu class under license. This would provide the highest-tech solution at the lowest possible cost. Roughly four Soryu class boats could be bought for the price of a single Virginia class SSN today. If a Soryu derivative were put into wider serial production, their price would drop event further. Sadly, the politics and special interests behind naval shipbuilding in the US, and especially submarine building, along with the Navy’s blind unwillingness to deviate from its nuclear only submarine strategy, makes such a logical proposition all but impossible to realize. Regardless of the US Navy’s elitist obsession with keeping an all nuclear submarine force, it will be interesting to watch Japan as they move forward with fielding their first lithium-ion powered diesel-electric attack submarine. And don’t expect them to be shy about possessing such a capability. Once they have found the technology to be stable they will likely show it off in an attempt to offset their investment with export sales.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",The Pentagon Has Slowly Fallen In Love With H&K’s Take On The AR-15,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Operationally, its career in the US Military started out among the highest rungs of the special operations community, and was made famous by SEAL Team Six as the assault rifle that was used on the raid that killed terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden. Now, a half-decade later, the Army and the Marine Corps have selected versions of the rifle, but for wildly different uses. The Marines in particular have anted up with orders for thousands of units, and these weapons also represent an evolutionary change in tactics for the UMSC, one spurred by hard lessons learned over the past 15 years of perpetual warfare in the Middle East. German small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch is world renowned for making some of the finest, most durable firearms on the planet, and they aren’t afraid to go their own way when it comes to design. From being the first adopter of polymer for combat firearms to their super-accurate “lemon squeezer” P7 series of handguns to firearms designed to be used by combat divers underwater—as well as legendary and widely used weapons like the MP5 submachine, PSG sniper rifle, USP handgun, to the G3 battle rifle. The company’s achievements go on and on. But outside the special operations community, where budgets aren’t so generous or flexible and procurement is a precarious bureaucratic maze, H&K has struggled to achieve big orders from the Pentagon. Price has a lot to do with it. The company’s firearms aren’t cheap to say the least, even when manufactured in large quantities. But this situation has slowly started to change with the advent of the HK416 assault rifle. HK416, H&K For a company that likes to go their own way design-wise, building yet another AR-15 derivative seems too pedestrian. But after being spurred by the Army’s tier one counter-terrorism force, better known as the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta or just “Delta Force,” it wound up being a wildly good business decision. Built with the special operator in mind, the HK416 adopts the usual AR-15 format but gets rid of the direct impingement style gas system that Eugene Stoner came up with well over a half century ago. Instead, a gas piston and pushrod is used to cycle the weapon when it’s fired, similar to the famously indestructible AK-47 and similar to H&K’s G36 assault rifle. … Gas-piston AR-15s have been around for some time, and they have become increasingly popular, offering the same ergonomics and modularity of the AR-15, but with a cleaner and more reliable action. H&K also packaged their gas piston AR-15 derivative with a series of smaller additions, include a proprietary grip, butt-stock, recoil buffer system, iron sights, accessory quad rail and even a heavy-duty steel box magazine. But most importantly, the design included a medium contour match-grade barrel, with different lengths available, that had no chrome plating inside its bore to affect accuracy. All this added up to an incredibly usable, durable, adaptable and reliable design that felt familiar in operators’ hands. Most of all, it was incredibly accurate. The HK416 rifle was chambered in 5.56 NATO just like its AR-15 based cousins (M-16, M4 etc), and a 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester variant was also developed similar to the AR10/LR308. This rifle was dubbed the HK417. https://youtube.com/watch?v=M9-KnrvJ7Qc Although the first units were delivered to Special Operations Command for “testing” around the middle of decade, with Delta Force trying the weapon out originally, the HK416s were still pretty rare within SOCOM on May 2nd, 2011, when SEAL Team Six took down Bin Laden. The gun that did the job was the HK416 . Once this leaked, interest in the HK416 exploded, but the writing was already on the wall for the rifle. Its reputation inside firearms and special operations circles was already on fire, and other special operations and law enforcement units from around the globe and at home begun to purchase it for their most elite operators. H&K also developed slightly downgraded, semi-automatic models for the civilian market—the MR556 and the MR308. While SOCOM was playing with the HK416 back in the mid and late 2000s, the USMC was evaluating a variant of it as well as part of their decade-long Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR) initiative. About a half dozen competitors put forward designs to fulfill the Marines’ needs. By 2009 H&K’s entrant was selected as the winner. It was quickly designated M27. Marine firing M27 in full auto. Note the Trijicon optic, and bipod., USMC The IAR competition, and the resulting M27 that came out of it, aimed to replace the belt-fed M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) with a lighter more conventional automatic rifle that put an emphasis on accuracy and range over raw volume of fire. It is a large departure from a fairly well proven and established model, but it’s just one example out of many regarding the changing ways in how USMC ground combat forces fight, and even how they are configured. The M27 paired with a Trijicon 3.5X magnification ACOG sight and a bipod could reach out to 600 meters in a highly precise manner, and could perform area/suppressive fire out to 800 or so meters. Instead of carrying ammunition in 200 round box magazines or belts, the M27’s automatic rifleman would carry 20 30-round PMAGs that can also be used in M16s and M4s. The idea is that not only is the M27 less than half the weight of the SAW, but ammo could be more easily spread across a Fireteam. The M27s heavier contour 16.5 inch barrel and piston system could handle extended continuous fire, but it could also be extremely accurate, offering more maneuverability and overall flexibility. The need for such a change came out of the lessons learned primarily in Afghanistan, where being able to hit a target at range was more useful than just spraying suppressive fire over closer ranges. The weight of the SAW, and it’s less than favorable handling at extremely close range has also been a long-time drawback for the weapon. The M249 can weigh over 22 pounds with its magazine and optics, more than double that of a loaded out M27., USMC After selecting the M27, the USMC spent the next few years deeply evaluating the weapon in multiple environments and combat-like situations. By 2011, four battalions that were deploying to Afghanistan were issued roughly 500 M27s as the exploration of the concept expanded into the operational realm. After glowing reviews from soldiers in the field, 6,500 M27 IARs were ordered, with all the rifles delivered by the end of 2013. Each Marine Fireteam has one automatic rifleman with an M27 or a M249 SAW, the SAW sticking around still for now as an option for certain missions where shear volume of fire is needed over the more balanced M27. Then just this month, the USMC has put out an order for a whopping 11,000 M27s, which made some believe the Marines were looking to replace their assault rifles with the HK416 variant, or at least beginning to do so. There have been some signs that the Marine Corps may be interested in actually doing this. Just last November an entire battalion was equipped with M27s instead of M4s during an exercise as an experiment. Now it seems that the force wants to at least insert more M27s into arsenal, further increasing their Fireteams’ overall reach, accuracy, and if need be, volume of fire. The M27s aren’t cheap, costing about four times that of the $750 M4, and the USMC moved to universally adopt the M4 for its rifleman over the M16 and longer barreled M16A4 just last year . As such it is unlikely the force will totally divest itself of M4s at this time, but it would seem that a slow, quiet transition could be afoot. 1st Marine Division Major General Daniel O’Donohue told Military.com the following last November: “I think the fundamental is the accuracy of the weapon, the idea that you’re going to use it for suppressive fires. And at first contact you have the overwhelming superiority of fire from which all the tactics evolve… So it starts with the fire team and the squad, if you give them a better weapon with better fire superiority, you’ll just put that vicious harmony of violence on the enemy. As for what those more involved with the actual trigger-pulling think of the weapon, Chief Warrant Officer Christian Wade, the infantry weapons officer for the 2nd Marine Division, stated simply: “It is the best infantry rifle in the world, hands down … Better than anything Russia has, it’s better than anything we have, it’s better than anything China has. It’s world-class.” USMC While the USMC falls deeper in love with H&K’s take on the AR-15, the US Army is doing the same for its bigger brother, a derivative of the .308/7.62 chambered AR-10/LR308, the HK417. A variant of the type won the Army’s Compact Semi-Automatic Sniper System contract last April which aimed to replace the Knight’s Armament M110 , which itself replaced the venerable M24 (Remington 700) bolt-action sniper rifle about a decade ago. Dubbed the G28, H&K’s semi-automatic sniper rifle is lighter (by about 3 pounds) and shorter (by about 3 inches) than the M110, but has familiar layout and does not sacrifice anything in terms of accuracy. About 75 percent of the parts used in the G28 are interchangeable with the standard HK417. G28, H&K The Army’s contract for roughly 3,650 sniper rifles is slated to cost $44.5 million, which works out to roughly $12,200 per rifle, although the contract includes other items, like support and spare parts. Either way, the G28 isn’t cheap to say the least, but the best never is. So what’s next for H&K’s AR-15 like rifle that has reached near mythical status? There has been some rumors that the Army may look at it as a replacement for their M4A1s, but this is unlikely, or at least it was unlikely under the past administration. The M4A1 supposedly takes the lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq and incorporates them into an overhauled version of the M4 carbine, which itself is really a shorter version of the M16A2 with some other small alterations. The M4A1 includes a heavier profile barrel for better durability during sustained firefights. The M4’s selector switch, which has semi-auto or three round burst, has also been replaced with one that allows for fully automatic fire. Ambidextrous controls have also been added. US Army soldiers on the range with their M4A1s, US Army The M4A1, the latest government reboot of Eugene Stoner’s direct impingement design that had its roots in the special operations community, has had generally good reviews from the field, but it not comparable to the HK416. And even the M4A1 was slated for another light upgrade under the M4A1+ program , which would add a quad-rail handguard and free-floating barrel design for enhanced customization and accuracy. Other smaller changes were also included like detachable iron sights, pre-camouflaged parts, flash suppressor and improved trigger group. Now that the Army is shelving these plans, there may be an opportunity to introduce the HK416, even if in a limited manner, although the basic M4A1 upgrade path still has years to go and will presumably continue until the end of the decade. When it comes to “big Army” procurement, price is key. Doling out $3,000 rifles to infantry would mark a monumental increase in what the Army spends on each soldier’s weaponry. Also, the massive Army bureaucracy has an absolutely miserable—so funny if it weren’t true—track record when it comes to following through with long and meandering small arms replacement initiatives. But now that may be changing, as the service did just pick a new sidearm after many years of trying, and a fairly unorthodox one at that. Also, change is clearly afoot in Washington when it comes to sequester and defense budgets. If the Trump Administration opens the floodgates on military spending, maybe the Army will trade in its Chevy Corvettes for Mercedes GTs—metaphorically speaking of course. One thing is for certain, the HK416 and its many outgrowths is becoming the automatic rifle by which all others are judged. And considering it is packaged in a very American design concept, its penetration into the Pentagon’s small arms portfolio will only continue to deepen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 14, 2020",Have Submarine-Launched Anti-Aircraft Missiles Finally Come Of Age?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The concept dates back to the dawn of aerial anti-submarine warfare, when anti-aircraft guns were mounted on the decks of submarines to defend themselves against aerial attack while surfaced. During the Cold War, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) were tested by the Soviets on submarine periscopes. Nothing much came of it as targeting was a troublesome affair. NATO countries also played around with the idea. The UK went maybe the farthest, with a submarine-launched version of the Blowpipe missile . The concept featured four remotely controlled missiles clustered around a TV camera, mounted atop a telescoping mast on the sub’s sail. The seaborn Blowfish never saw widespread operational use, but there are rumors that the Israelis did purchase the system. Now, decades later, submarine-launched air missiles (SLAMs) are back on the table, but are they necessary—or even tactically viable? … Not a one-size-fits-all capability Emerging SLAM capabilities come in a few flavors of complexity, and some still remain more theoretical than operational. The simplest of these new systems is similar to the UK’s Blowpipe concept, as it encloses an existing MANPADS air-to-air missile design in a pod attached to a turret mounted atop a submarine’s telescoping mast. The idea is that, if the submarine was cornered by an aerial anti-submarine asset, it could pop up to a very shallow depth, extend the anti-aircraft missile system, lock up the target and kill it. Hopefully doing so would give the submarine time to slip away, assuming no other anti-submarine assets were nearby. The French A3SM submarine-launched MICA missile system is based on this same concept, and the Russians supposedly have developed a similar system for use on their Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines. It remains unclear if this capability has been deployed, either domestically or to one of the Kilo class’s many export customers. A more advanced SLAM concept offers better survivability and maneuvering flexibility for the launching submarine, but it’s far more complex than the basic mast-mounted A3SM. This concept utilizes a torpedo-like underwater vehicle fired from the submarine that makes its way to the surface. Once there, it releases its missile—or missiles. Alternatively, no canister or vehicle may be needed at all, and the missile may be able to make its way to the surface and fly out without any assistance at all. One such system test fired by both German and Norwegian diesel-electric submarines is the Interactive Defense and Attack System (IDAS) built primarily by Diehl Defense. Initially designed for Germany’s popular Type 212 family of submarines, the missile itself is based loosely on the IRIS-T short-to-intermediate range air-to-air missile , but it travels at a subsonic speed and trails a fiber-optic cable. Like the French MICA, the IDAS primarily uses infrared homing to engage its target; but other seekers can be fitted, and the system is envisioned to even be used against small surface and shore targets in the future. Because a wired link between the submarine and the missile is kept at all times, target ID and even damage assessment can be made by the submarine crew during the engagement. … Here is Defense Update’s description of IDAS : “Four missiles will be stored in a magazine that fits into a standard 21″ torpedo tube. The missiles are ejected from the magazine into the water, extract their wings and separate quietly from the submarine, where they ignite the rocket and transition to airborne flight, propelled by the weapon’s rocket motor. One of the development challenges was the propulsion system. The same rocket was required to provide thrust for both underwater and airborne flight. The rocket was designed to sustain the missiles at optimal velocity in submerged flight, and accelerate to subsonic flight while airborne, reaching effective range of 20 km. Another concern was sustaining the optical-fiber through the transit below and above water. Diehl’s engineers were concerned how the fiberoptic bobbins will behave in the different environments (below and above water) the test provided clear evidence this will not be an issue. Diehl initially considered using the IRST seeker for IDAS, however, this high performance and all aspect seeker may not be the only option, and other seekers might be considered to pick up the target, provided with passive cuing from by the submarine sonar. The submarine can acquire ASW helicopter when submerged, by localizing the ripple effect created by the rotor downwash. According to Diehl, the accuracy of such cuing system is adequate to provide bearing and range, bringing the missile seeker to autonomously acquire the target with high level of confidence. The fiber optical link would then be used by the crew to verify the target, confirm the intercept and perform battle damage assessment.” The French also have a system under development that uses the Mistral short-range MANPADS missile twin-packed into a torpedo-like vehicle that brings the missiles to the surface before launching on their own power into the air. The US Navy also played with a similar concept that has blurred into the developmental shadows in recent years. During the late 2000s, the US Navy, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman worked to migrate the highly flexible AIM-9X short-range air-to-air missile to the undersea world under the Littoral Warfare Weapon program. The AIM-9X would be vertically launched in a canister from a submarine , then the missile would climb into the sky when the canister broke the surface, locking onto its target after launch. Tests during the mid 2000s had the AIM-9X fired from a vertical launcher as a proof of concept demonstration. A few years later, an AIM-9X was launched from an actual submarine as part of a series of integration tests . Since then the program seems to have disappeared from public view, but it’s likely development has continued on in the classified world—especially considering that submarine-launched unmanned aircraft have been an operational reality within America’s nuclear submarine fleet for some time. … Other more elaborate concepts exist where short-range air-to-air missiles are mounted inside existing cruise missile designs. The submarine launches the missile which then performers a pre-selected low-level patrol pattern in the area of the submarine, giving it a form of top cover. If its radar or electronic sensor suite picks up an aerial contact, it pursues it and launches missiles at it. Although this type of concept is highly intriguing, it is also very expensive, complex and calls into question the ethical issues of unmanned weapon system autonomy that the DoD is struggling with today. Not just that but the presence of the missile is a great sign that an enemy submarine is nearby. There are no clear indications that this type of submarine-launched counter-air capability is actively being developed at this time, but that could change considering how the marketplace is evolving. Pros and cons There’s clearly development and investment within the global defense industry for SLAM systems, so there has to be a strengthening demand for them right?  Well, don’t consider the case for them to be overwhelming. Think of these systems as a last line of defense for submarines that have been located, and are facing imminent death from an aerial asset above. Using them as an offensive weapon is highly unlikely and tactically bankrupt in almost all circumstances. This is especially true for systems like the A3SM, which require the sub to come very near the surface for a shot on a helicopter operating low, slow, and relatively close by. This leaves the submarine vulnerable, and likely results in a showdown between the ASW aircraft and submarine itself—one in which the first to fire might be pulling the trigger on a major conflict as well. Then again, a submarine downing one ASW helicopter at near-point-blank range doesn’t necessarily mean the nationality of the sub that fired the deadly shot would have been known prior. Popular submarines designs can be used by multiple countries in a single region, some of them being potential foes of one-another. Pair this with the murky world that these weapons currently reside in today and you begin to deduct that plausible deniability of such an act could be a real possibility. Most modern ASW helicopters and low-flying maritime patrol aircraft have advanced and highly automated infrared countermeasures suites . While a submarine may be able to get a SLAM launch off, it doesn’t mean they’ll kill their target. Worse for the sub, initiating such an attack will also clearly give away their presence and their intent. If they don’t eliminate nearby aerial threats in the process of their attack, they’ve pretty much guaranteed their own destruction. There’s also the question of targeting: On lower-end systems, a small, high-frequency radar extended on one of the boat’s masts can cue the turret for targeting, or an infrared camera system could be used, albeit less effectively. Combining a radar and infrared camera would offer both target discrimination and quick detection and engagement capabilities. This is a lot of gear to install on the limited real-estate of a submarine’s conning tower/sail. For more advanced SLAM concepts where a canister or the missile itself is launched to surface, getting the missiles in the right area and hunting in the right direction quickly is key. The boat’s passive sonar could be used for initial, albeit lower fidelity, targeting. Then the missile’s gimbaled, high-off bore-sight seeker head can quickly scan for its target in a section of predesignated sky as it lifts off from the surface. All this sounds good on paper—and probably looks cool in a powerpoint presentation—but getting it to work reliably, quickly, and in a broad range of environmental conditions may not be an easy proposition. In the end the system has to be reliable, as a missed shot is likely worse than no shot at all. … There is a deterrence factor that must also be credited to a weapon system like this. For anti-submarine warfare helicopter and maritime patrol aircraft crews, knowing that your prey can bite back could change the game substantially. Then again, it’s a double-edged sword. If the submarine fires at an ASW aircraft, air crews will know where that submarine is and can immediately prosecute their own attack—and rules of engagement would probably dictate doing so. ASW tactics can also be modified to deal with the threat of SLAM equipped submarines. Hunting in larger groups of diversified aerial assets, or at least in pairs, would give sub-killers and advantage, and are already a well honed and widely used ASW strategy. Additionally, modern anti-submarine weaponry is featuring more standoff capability than ever before , keeping potential targets outside a submarine’s SLAM reach. Knowing an enemy’s submarines were armed with anti-aircraft capabilities may actually work against that submarine, as it could make the sub hunting aircraft’s tactics, and their assigned rules of engagement, far more aggressive than they would be otherwise. … There is also the question of if naval commanders would want this type of weapon on their submarines at all, as it gives a submarine commander a possible out once detected. The whole idea of submarine warfare centers around not being detected in the first place—such a weapon system may have a hard time fitting into that proven concept of operations. Who needs it most, if anyone? So are submarine-launched air missiles really a capability we’ll find widespread on submarines in the future? Maybe: But there will be a clear delineation in the motives of the countries that deploy them. These systems might prove most valuable on diesel-electric submarines , especially those that are not air-independent propulsion (AIP) equipped , and have to surface far more often to recharge their batteries. With the window for undersea operations narrowed, a SLAM at least gives air-breathing subs a shot at defending themselves from an imminent attack. These boats spend much of their operational careers close to shore in littoral combat environments where hiding places are prevalent, but once detected, escape options may be limited. But even then, SLAMs would be a weapon of last resort—used under extreme circumstances due to its massive implications. Another hindrance is that diesel electric subs have less space for weaponry and sensor masts than their larger and more complex nuclear counterparts. Taking up valuable real estate with a questionable last line of defense weapon may prove unpalatable. IDAS, with its potential land and surface attack capability, would at least exchange multi-role flexibility for the space it takes up and the cost of integration and training. Considering China’s large fleet of diesel-electric submarines , shallow operating areas in the South China Sea, and the prevalence of American , Japanese and other navies in the region operating high-quality anti-submarine warfare capabilities, a Chinese SLAM may become a reality in the near future. In fact, the PLAN has worked on various submarine-based anti-aircraft weapons concepts in the past. … Israel’s Dolphin class diesel-electric boats are used as second-strike nuclear deterrents when outfitted with nuclear-tipped Popeye Turbo cruise missiles. During these patrols, it’s the boat’s job to go hide for long periods of time. Leveraging AIP technology, they can do this for days or even weeks at a time. Considering they could be called upon to enact nuclear revenge at any moment, adding a counter-air missile to their quiver may be just a logical step in ensuring that their mission will succeed, no matter the circumstances. Nuclear submarine-equipped countries like the UK, France and especially the US may end up fielding SLAMs—or they may already have—because it’s just another integrated capability to have at the submarine commander’s fingertips. These boats cost billions of dollars each. Spending a comparatively small amount on additional capabilities, even capabilities with very narrow use, is not out of the question, especially since we already spend billions on other capabilities that have a low probability of use. Also keeping in mind where these big stealth vessels go , having a new tool to get away alive from a prowling ASW helicopter may be a better solution for a boat filled with a nation’s most guarded military technology secrets than getting sunk deep in enemy territory. Finally, there’s more room on these boats to deploy new capabilities compared to their relatively tiny diesel-electric cousins. Giving up one vertical launch tube —if even that—for a submarine derringer pistol of sorts is not such a huge sacrifice. … So yes, there may be a place for SLAMs after all—and the marketplace for such a capability will likely grow in the coming decade. Is it a necessary capability? That depends on how you look at it, and how navies plan to employ the weapon. But generally, no. The systems conflict with the traditional tactics of subsurface warfare. If the cost isn’t horrendous, and the integration challenges aren’t severe, the question shifts to one of why not? If the cost is significant and the integration issues are intense, even wealthy navies would be better off spending their money keeping their boats from being detected in the first place. No matter what, robust training programs featuring various engagement scenarios will have to be funded and fielded in order to leverage a SLAM system reliably once a boat is equipped with it. If a Navy is unwilling to come to terms with this additional cost—one that will remain persistent as long as the system is deployed—then they should save their money. In the end, should submarine-launched air missiles become widely proliferated, they will be countered with increasingly effective countermeasures suites on ASW aircraft, as well as changes in standard operating procedures and applied tactics by ASW forces. Like all things subsurface warfare, the game of measure and countermeasure will take off running, with no end in sight. … Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 26, 2019",This Primer On Midcourse Intercept Ballistic Missile Defense Is Marvelous,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ballistic missile defense (BMD) is always a tough topic to address technically because it’s far from monolithic in nature. What makes up America’s still relatively rickety concept knows collectively as BMD are a wide ranging cocktail of capabilities, some of which are more intertwined than others. Anti-ballistic missile capabilities can largely be adapted into anti-satellite capabilities, which are at the heart of growing fears that space is becoming the high-stakes battlefield of tomorrow. Layers of defenses, each focusing primarily on a flight profile of a certain category of ballistic missile, with some overlap in between, utilize an array of interceptors and sensors to get the job done. The MIM-104 Patriot missile battery can be used to counter short-range ballistic missiles over a localized area. THAAD is aimed at taking out medium to intermediate range ballistic missiles within a specific theatre of conflict. AEGIS at sea and ashore can swat medium to longer-range ballistic missiles out of the sky within an entire region. Finally, there’s America’s hulking ground-based long-range interceptors focused on taking out ICBMs before their warheads descend onto the US. … All these systems are supported by a massive array of remote sensors and communications nodes, ranging from a constellation of orbital infrared surveillance systems , to a shy fleet of massive radar equipped tracking ships. This short primer video made by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) goes specifically over longer-range midcourse ballistic missile defense and the challenges that go along with it: The video makes the point that the more disparate sensor data fuse together during an intercept, the better chances that that intercept will be successful. Some shadowy areas of this capability include satellites that can track “cold bodies” traveling atop earth’s atmosphere at acute viewing angles. By taking all these data sources and fusing their information together, high-speed computing and AI can predict which objects are within the “threat cloud” are an actual threat while excluding debris and multiple types of countermeasures. Once identified, an interceptor vehicle, or vehicles, can execute a terminal attack plan on the object and even better identify it using their own sensitive onboard infrared sensors. This is similar to how long-range air-to-air missiles can be guided by data-link using “third party” telemetry towards their targets over great distances, and then use their sensitive imaging infrared or radar seekers to make an automated high-probability of kill terminal attack on the most vulnerable part of the target. It all comes down to the need for better target discrimination, thus enhancing the probability of kill for each interceptor fired. Currently, Russia’s most advanced long-range ballistic missiles have robust capabilities to confuse and even surprise American anti-ballistic missile defenses. The truth is, America’s BMD capabilities are nowhere near advanced or numerous enough to have any chance of countering an ICBM barrage from a peer-state competitor, and especially one from Russia. So for now, even though it remains fairly immature after many billions spent, the system provides a decent defense against short to medium-range ballistic missiles in regions and theaters of combat, and a some level of plausible defense against small volume ICBM attacks on the US. Trump will likely push to enhance America’s BMD capabilities . But with so many other pressing needs, not to mention a whole stack of other expensive promises he made during the campaign, we will have to wait and see if BMD becomes a larger investment sink for the DoD.

An incredibly unique photo was snapped by White House photographer Pete Souza while President Obama was making his historic trip to Cuba last March .

The photo was shot as the two discussed the terror attack is Brussels with Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco via secure teleconference. Their location at the time of the photo was the Havana residence of the U.S. Chief of Mission in Cuba.

One contractor who builds these facilities describes them as such: “Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (pronounced “skiff”), a U.S. Department of Defense term for a secure room.

SCIFs are used to deny unau­tho­rized per­son­nel, such as for­eign intel­li­gence ser­vices or corporate spies, the oppor­tu­nity for unde­tected entry into facil­i­ties for the exploita­tion of sen­si­tive activ­i­ties.” These facilities are built up to TEMPEST specifications, which are designed to keep sounds, electronic emissions, and vibrations from escaping, and thus potentially compromising what is happening inside. The White House, embassies, intelligence installations, military bases, defense contractors, and even some non-defense or state related corporations have a need for SCIFs. As such, there is a cottage industry of contractors that build them in all types of configurations and scales. In recent years, containerized SCIFs have become popular, as they can be transported anywhere in the world and are as close to a plug-and-play affordable option as any. Such a system is what Obama and Rice are using in the photo above. Yet SCIFs also include much larger or even smaller areas, that are custom built or retrofitted as part of a new or existing structure. For instance, an entire group of rooms, or even a floor of a building—in fact even an entire large building itself—could be a SCIF or could contain a network of SCIFs. At American air bases around the world, large SCIFs allow pilots and aircrews to examine classified intelligence on enemy weapons systems, talk openly with other personnel about classified tactics and capabilities, and even brief and debrief entire missions. On a larger scale, entire intelligence centers and secure server farms can be built as giant SCIFs. Even vehicles can be designed to SCIF standards and containerized war rooms that can be quickly re-deployed around a theatre of combat exist so that commanders can plan battles under high-security . When heads of state travel abroad, tiny modular SCIFs are erected inside hotel rooms to keep spying governments from obtaining critical information. Another rare shot showing Obama and his advisors in a tiny makeshift SCIF in a hotel room in Rio de Janeiro: , This rare look of a President inside one of these facilities, which is a far cry in terms of austerity from the accouterments of the White House Situation Room or the confines of Air Force One, is a reminder of the steps that are taken to keep sensitive information and command decisions secure. Yet these contraptions can only do their job if the materials and the principals that read those materials, or make command decisions, are inside them when these things happen. Famously Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had her issues with using a non-government, unsecure server for email, which some classified information, or at least communications of a classified nature, moved through. It was an absurdly stupid and damning choice that could have resulted in severe consequences. Today, the Trump administration is under fire for possibly using private email accounts of their own, and also for the President’s use of an non-secure mobile phone , which is is becoming a major issue on Capitol Hill. The issue of how the Trump administration handles classified information exploded further into the media spotlight today following photos taken and accounts given of how Trump and his team handled the aftermath of North Korea’s missile launch , which you can read about in detail here . During the incident, aids and cabinet members used cell phones to read supposedly very sensitive documents in the packed and dimly-lit dining room of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. Trump himself was said to have read vey sensitive information at the table in full view of the wait staff. Photos were also taken by guests of White House documents. The irony could not be more clear, as the same issue Trump made such a big deal about during the campaign in regards to Hillary Clinton, and rightfully so, is now infesting his own young administration. Even if a SCIF was not present at the club to accommodate Trump’s national security team, which is highly unlikely considering how long the White House had to plan for being at the location frequently, an empty room with a closed door and decent lighting would have been a far better choice for looking at sensitive documents and for discussing major foreign policy decisions. If these allegations prove true, it marks an extreme lapse in security protocol not just by neophytes into the classified world, but by experienced professionals, that could damage Trump’s credibility when it comes to “being smart” about national security.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Many Americans are heartbroken over the loss of yet another one of our space pioneers . Eugene Cernan was one of a kind—a daring, focused and super charismatic guy, and his long list of accomplishments, which includes flying into space three times and being the last man on the moon proves it. Even among the elite cadre of test pilots that made up the backbone of the US astronaut corps in the 1960s and early 1970s, Cernan stood out. But his bold nature did get him into a little trouble, and almost cost him his trip to the moon. It was 1970 and training for mankind’s third mission to land on the moon was well underway. Apollo 14 would follow NASA’s incredibly triumphant failure that was Apollo 13. Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell made up the mission’s primary crew, all but Shepard had never been in space, and he only had been up there for a matter of minutes. The backup crew for the mission included Gene Cernan as mission commander, as well as Ronald Evans and Joe Engle. Although it seemed as if Gene’s crew would never need to make the mission, and the training to do so was just for contingency purposes, the training continued in earnest nonetheless. Part of that syllabus was for Cernan, a fixed-wing naval fighter pilot by trade, to keep current on helicopter flying. There were loose similarities between flying a helicopter and handling the lunar module, and being a test pilot it was just another airframe to master. A small fleet of Bell 47Gs were used by the astronauts for this training, one of which Cernan found himself in on January 23rd, 1971, just a week before Apollo 14 was scheduled to leave without him. … After taking off from Patrick AFB near Cocoa Beach, Florida, he took the chopper down to the Banana River, then over the Atlantic, before turning back in towards the coastline. As he made his way towards the Indian river at around 300 feet, he began dropping in altitude. Eventually he was skimming mere inches above the water when the Bell’s left skid submerged, and the helicopter somersaulted into the river, the spinning rotor smashing against the water’s surface and detaching from its mast. A fire quickly broke out when stricken aircraft’s fuel tank ruptured. As the helicopter sank to the river’s shallow bottom. Cernan, who had been fighting to get out of the obliterated aircraft, and eventually surfaced and began swimming away from the wind and fuel-fed fire. Cernan was not wearing a lifevest at the time, but the helmet he was wearing told a very deadly story. The entire top of it that had floated to the surface was totally charred. He was lucky that wasn’t his him. … A 19 year-old in a boat nearby rushed to help the helicopter’s occupant, fearing that they would be badly injured from the violent impact and resulting fire. That wasn’t the case. Gene was alert, mobile and aside from some 2nd degree burns and singed flightsuit and hairline, he seemed fine. After being transported back to Patrick Air Force Base for emergency treatment, the doctors couldn’t find much wrong with him that would require further care. In fact, Cernan seemed barely shaken by the near-death incident. Following the the crash, James Lovell of Apollo 13 fame headed the investigation board tasked with finding out what happened. Eventually a handful of potential causes for the crash were identified. These human factors were largely associated with illusions of speed and distance that occur when flying over smooth water. Cernan’s past experience as a Navy fighter pilot was also cited as the visual cues while flying at low level in a high-speed fighter are very different than those experienced when plugging along at under 100 knots in a gangly helicopter. … After the investigation ended, Cernan’s assignment as commander of Apollo 17 was put into jeopardy. How was NASA going to hand over a Saturn V rocket, command module and a lunar lander to a guy that just flew a sluggish Bell 47 into a river? Apparently, that was the subject of very heated debate within the institution. As a result of cutbacks following Apollo 13, NASA’s ten planned missions to the moon were cut down to just six. As such, those astronauts that were in the running to go on an Apollo moon-landing mission were faced with the fact that the chances of doing so were much lower than they had been originally. Under the revised flight schedule, Apollo 17 would be the last mission to the moon and two crews were competing for it. Considering Cernan had the helicopter crash under his belt, it seemed logical that another commander would take his place. Dick Gordon was that other commander. … One man in particular, the head of flight crew operations and Mercury Seven alumn Donald “Deke” Slayton , held much of the power as to who would get to fly and on what mission. Apparently he wanted Cernan, not Gordon to command America’s final moonshot. Geologist Harrison Schmitt,that was originally part of Gordon’s crew was ported over to Cernan’s crew in the shuffle, which added to the friction between the two command-level astronauts. Today the Apollo 17 crest reads Cernan, Schmitt and Evans. In the end even dumping a perfectly good helicopter in a river couldn’t keep Cernan from reaching the lunar landscape, and as a result, Gordon would never touch the lunar surface. … The 1971 crash wouldn’t be the last time Gene Cernan had a brush with death while traveling in a helicopter. On October 29th, 2001 nearly 30 years after his first helicopter crash, Cernan, fellow astronaut John Blaha and Cosmonaut Vladimir Remek were flying aboard a Mi-8 over the Czech Republic when the aircraft rapidly lost engine power and crashed roughly 60 miles south of Prague. Nobody died in the incident, but two of the crew were badly injured. Once again Cernan walked away from the helicopter, or at least what was left of it, unharmed. Cernan, like many of us, has become fairly disgusted with the state of America’s space program , and was a strong advocate for going back to the moon and beyond. He has also been incredibly forthcoming about the complexities of the incredible life he lived, and how work often took precedence over family. Something he described as “a selfish life” in recent years. A true hero, Cernan was not unafraid to openly share his own weaknesses and failures as well as his triumphs. … Thankfully, this complex American icon conveyed many of his reflections on life, both inside a flightsuit and out, in the marvelous documentary “Last Man On The Moon.” You will have a hard time finding a better way to spend your time or money than renting it here on YouTube , especially to reflect on and to celebrate the amazing life of this modern-day explorer In closing, I would like to share Gene’s last word’s on the Moon, they are also the last ones any human has spoken on another celestial body: “…As I take man’s last step from the surface, back home for some time to come–but we believe not too long into the future–I’d like to just say what I believe history will record: that America’s challenge of today has forged man’s destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus–Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.” Godspeed Captain Eugene Cernan, who died at 82 years young yesterday, January 16, 2017. … Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 21, 2020",The Air Force Desperately Needs A Stealth Tanker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sitting on the table at Lockheed Martin’s booth at this year’s American Institute of Aeronautics And Astronautics Sci Tech Forum in Texas was a large model of a plane that looked as if it was ripped right from Hollywood’s latest science fiction war epic. And although its design surely includes loads of science, the need for such a machine is anything but fictional—a hard truth that the USAF seems to be finally coming to terms with, albeit slowly. @LockheedMartin stealthy tanker concept #aiaascitech – aimed at @usairforce requirement beyond @Boeing KC-46A pic.twitter.com/CaUCBLgbFi — Graham Warwick (@TheWoracle) January 11, 2017 @LockheedMartin tanker based on hybrid wing-body HWB concept adapted for stealth – eg embedded engines #aiaascitech pic.twitter.com/jSZpRSwA9Q — Graham Warwick (@TheWoracle) January 11, 2017 The USAF’s great capabilities mismatch The term “stealth tanker” just sounds frivolous doesn’t it? Like something out of a Transformer’s movie—nice mil-tech eye candy, but not much logic behind it. Yet the reality is the concept is anything but frivolous, especially now, and the logic behind it is undeniable. The problem lies in the fact that the Air Force has dumped massive amounts of resources into developing and procuring relatively short-ranged but very high-tech and grossly expensive stealth fighter aircraft—aka the F-35 and the F-22. In past decades, the US has fought against countries of limited geographic size and military resources. These conflicts also featured prevalent nearby basing for allied air power that was relatively safe from large-scale attacks. In fact, in the last 18 years the US has operated almost entirely in uncontested airspace. At the same time, near peer state competitors have been investing heavily in next generation integrated air defense systems , ones that have far greater range, sensor fidelity and data fusion abilities than those that came before. The “layered” nature of these new air defenses, their mobility, and their increasingly networked means of operations also means they are far more resilient than their simpler and often fixed-position progenitors. So what the USAF has ended up with is a glaring mismatch between the combat capabilities of its most advanced and most numerous tactical assets, and their ability to fly far enough to actually strike enemy targets that necessitate their extreme and high-cost abilities. It is an issue we have touched on many times before—the fact is that anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities , including these new air defense systems, will increasingly push America’s fighters out too far from their targets to be effective in most peer state conflict scenarios. Combat radius conundrum The F-35A, with a combat radius of roughly 600 miles, will have to rely on fuel from a tanker or basing no further than the distance from the targets it is tasked with striking. In reality this distance will often be decreased considerably when fuel for contingencies and unique mission flight profile demands are concerned. Fighters like the F-35 and F-22 may be stealthy, but their support assets, namely their tankers—KC-135R, KC-10A, and soon the KC-46A —are anything but. This leaves them vulnerable to detection and attack. Not just by increasingly long-range surface-to-air missiles, both those based on ships and on land, but by long-range fighter-interceptors— some of which are of the stealthy variety —carrying very long-range air-to-air missiles . America’s potential enemies know this, especially China , and plan on exploiting it to the max during a time of war. Not just that, but nearby basing, even within many hundreds (and even thousands) of miles from the front lines will likely not be achievable for allied aircraft due to the ballistic and cruise missile capabilities of America’s most capable enemies. USAF When it comes to providing close air support and counter-air patrols over ground troops operating in contested areas, something the USAF says it will have to provide in the future, doing so with fifth generation fighters supported by traditional tankers may be impossible. Loitering over an area of the battlefield to provide cover for troops below burns a lot of gas and takes a lot of assets to achieve in a persistent manner. Today, F-16s can stay on station for less than an hour without requiring fuel from a tanker operating in relatively close proximity. The F-35 won’t be drastically different in this respect, and the F-22 is already known to be quite tanker dependent with a fairly short combat radius, especially when using its supercruise capability for extended dashes. So basically, the USAF has fighters that have been built at great cost to be able to fight in contested airspace, but only if that airspace is in close proximity to a tanker. Yet once again, the problem is that a tanker may be pushed out many hundreds of miles from an enemy’s borders in order to be safe from SAM attacks, and even then enemy naval vessels and fighters could still post a serious threat. Couple this with the fact that America’s most capable foes have large land masses, and key targets may be located hundreds, or even thousands of miles from the country’s border or shoreline. This means that an F-35A’s combat radius may be 600 miles, but that may only give it a hundred or two hundred miles of penetrating range into the enemy’s territory, due to the distance its flying fuel source has to stand off from the country’s border. For persistent operations like combat air patrols, armed reconnaissance and close air support, any flight of fifth generation fighters may have just a few minutes over their target area before having to make the long trip back to the tanker for gas. USAF planners have built a force than can technologically fight the enemy in its own backyard, but does not have the gas to do it effectively against a major peer state competitor in most theatres. Clearly the USAF has a big problem here, and as enemy A2/AD capabilities increase, and the safe operating distance for existing tanker aircraft increases, it will only get worse. Am armada of fighters and tankers seen during the opening days of Desert Storm: USAF Red Flag may be one of the best examples of this. For two or three weeks a few times a year the Air Force’s largest set of wargames takes place north of Las Vegas. Weekdays see two major launches and recoveries each day (known individually for each aircraft as “Vuls” or vulnerability periods), one at night and one during the day. During any one of these large force employment missions over the Nevada Test and Training Range complex , F-22s, F-16s, F-15s and all the rest of tactical fighter cadre needs to get gas from tankers about halfway through the three-hour long air battle. The entire range complex where this air combat takes place equates to about 12,000 square miles of airspace—akin to an 80 mile by 145 mile area—and a good portion of that is not always used for the exercise or is restricted for other purposes ( like Area 51’s box ). This airspace begins less than 100 miles north of the base where almost all the participants in the exercise launch out of—Nellis AFB. This relatively tiny patch of sky—huge as far as ranges go but infinitesimal compared to fighting in an A2/AD environment like the Pacific—that sits just minutes from the base supporting almost all its players, still sees America’s short-legged fighter force gulping down thousands of pounds of fuel off the boom of a small armada of tankers launched each mission. And these tankers are positioned at the edges of the airspace described above, giving thirsty fighters quick and easy access to the fuel they carry. Obviously in a long-range combat situation measures would be taken to drastically extend a fighter’s range and air crews would be far more selective about using their gas compared with a training operation like Red Flag. But still, it is a telling example to draw from and underlines just how dependent the bulk of America’s air power is on close proximity tanker gas. USAF Take that same Red Flag strike package, and launch it 2,500 miles from the Nellis range complex, and make it so the tankers that support it can’t get within 350 miles of the range’s borders and you can see how the whole operation becomes much more asset intensive, complex, and frankly, less effective. In the end, if the tanker can’t survive close enough to the assets it supports, the mission simply doesn’t happen, or in the case of deep-strike missions against fixed targets, the mission may get passed on to far less prevalent platforms like the B-2A or a $1.5 million cruise missile—both of which cannot sustain a major conflict alone. Not even close. Multiple solutions to a pressing problem This glaring deficiency can be addressed in a number of ways, and the best way to do so would be to combine a cocktail of strategies, although that may be wishful thinking. First off, the USAF could rapidly develop and procure unmanned combat air vehicles which offer far greater range and loitering time, along with a ton of other advantages, than their manned counterparts. The problem is that even though the technology clearly exists, having shown incredible promise during its development over a decade ago, the USAF acts as if it doesn’t . As I have explained in great detail before , either the USAF has been working on the technology deep in the classified world or they haven’t at all due to a handful of petty factors. Either way, not fully embracing advanced unmanned combat air vehicles now is extremely detrimental to America’s national security. Northrop Grumman rendering of UCAVs in action: … The service could also procure fighter-bomber aircraft that cast aside maneuverability in exchange for range , stealth, weapons capacity and in some cases sustained speed. Two concepts, both based on the Advanced Tactical Fighter contestants, had been floated previously to satisfy such a mission set— the FB-22 and the FB-23 . Either of these concepts could have provided advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground (and probably electronic attack) capabilities over regional ranges that would allow tankers to standoff at very long distances. They could also carry more weaponry than their more highly maneuverable fighter counterparts, which means they can destroy more target when in enemy territory. Neither of these aircraft were ever built, but rumors circulated at one time that an FB-23 like design was tested in the late 1990s, although once again, this was just a rumor. Aside from some official models that have popped up , no hard evidence exists that the design ever made it into flying form. … The FB-22 concept surfaced in the mid-2000s as part of a short-lived “interim bomber” initiative. This was a big mistake, and frankly, it was very easy to see that it was one at the time. The FB-22 was the right aircraft for the future, especially in its most elaborate and stealthy tailess configuration. Politics were involved in all this of course. Why would Lockheed want to build an FB-22 when it had the ultimate cash cow about to fly—the F-35? Meanwhile, for the USAF, the regional fighter-bomber concept threatened both high-end fighter and bomber procurement initiatives at the time, so there was not much incentive to see it through no matter how logical it seemed. With the idea of restarting the F-22 production line becoming mainstream , developing an FB-22 alongside an improved F-22 would be extremely logical, although the chances of any of this happening are very, very small if not non-existent. Another way to help the situation is for the USAF to invest much more heavily into survivable long-range strike capabilities, namely in the now active B-21 Raider program . Purchasing a couple hundred or more of the bombers instead of around one hundred, at the expense of a portion of F-35A production, could offset some of the long-range strike risk that currently plagues the USAF. Although cutting F-35 numbers dramatically to build more B-21s would be a hard sell, especially considering the power of the F-35 lobby. USAF Some have floated the idea of just buying more standoff weapons that can be fired from F-35s and other tactical jets from a couple hundred miles away from their targets. The truth is that this is a must as it is in order to slowly degrade and dismantle an enemy’s advanced integrated air defense system . No aircraft is invisible, and using standoff weaponry early in an air campaign to open up weaknesses in an enemy’s air defense will be required even for 5th generation fighter aircraft to operate in the area without assuming excess risk. Even in a limited conflict with an enemy like China, tens of thousands of targets that would need to be hit. The shear size of such a target list would make a strategy relying heavily on standoff weaponry unaffordable and unsustainable. It is simply a function of how many tons of weapons need to be thrown at a campaign to make it effective. Relying on one-use, high-cost standoff weapons, which cannot be replenished quickly, is simply unfeasible and very risky. Also, these weapon may be capable against fixed targets, but for moving targets and for targets of opportunity they are more rigid in nature compared to tactical aircraft sporting shorter-ranged and far more affordable munitions. F-15E launches a stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) during testing. -Lockheed Image. USAF The final alternative is that the US develops a stealthy tanker aircraft to match its big short-ranged stealth fighter fleet—one that can push far closer to enemy territory and survive than those based on existing commercial airliners. This aircraft could work as an enabler for the short-ranged fighter fleet not just in terms of offloading much needed gas within the enemy’s A2/AD bubble, but also by working as a networking hub for F-35s, F-22s, B-2s, stealthy unmanned systems and other aircraft using low-probability of intercept data-links. It may also be able to offer electronic warfare support, such as standoff jamming to help mask the location of stealthy aircraft operating downrange. It could even be outfitted with a laser to help defend itself from attacks while operating beyond the edges of contested airspace. Considering how deeply invested the USAF is in the F-35 program, and the limited number of very costly F-22s they already have in inventory, as well as their bizarre propensity to act as is UCAVs don’t exist , the stealth tanker seems not only like their best bet, but an entirely necessary one. And even if UCAVs eventually come into the picture, they too can benefit from a stealthy tanker. … Not a new problem or a new solution The thing is that it’s not like the glaring need for a stealth tanker is really anything new, but it has come into the domain of the mainstream defense media in recent months after General Carlton Everhart II, chief of Air Mobility Command, floated the concept last September, stating : “What is on the cusp of groundbreaking technologies? That is what we want on that airplane?… Is it stealthy? I don’t know. Is it large? I don’t know. Is it medium, is it small, what is the combat offload?…Now that you are getting near-peer adversaries who have different technologies and they have studied the way we fight, that is starting to change our calculus of how we might execute the next war.” He continued to describe a platform with an increased emphasis on low-observability. But once again, it is almost laughable that this is a major issue just now. It’s not like China’s drive to exploit every weakness in America’s technological warfighting machine and battlefield doctrine is something new, nor is the USAF’s massive addiction to tanker gas. In fact, I have been saying this for many years, putting it in writing in various articles, including this passage from 2012: “It is somewhat preposterous to think that if the US were really going to face a peer state with serious firepower that we would have an elaborate and incredibly expensive force of short-legged tactical fighters sweep towards the enemy’s borders undetected, followed by big, unstealthy tankers lumbering a couple hundred miles behind. With other countries procuring long-range surface to air missile systems, both land and sea based, as well as stealth fighters, the way we have done the fighter business for decades simply will not do. With an almost all stealth fighter force, you need a contingent of stealthy tankers to support such a fleet during combat far from home, especially during the opening weeks of such a conflict. These stealthy tanking aircraft would not be used as aerial “bridge” tankers in the traditional sense, such as dragging fighter aircraft across benign airspace enroute to their targets, or working as “lily pads” for tactical aircraft regularly traversing long distances. Instead they would be utilized to accompany low observable combatants the last 500 miles or so from their targets, and to provide them with gas close to the enemy’s shore, as well as on their way out of enemy air space after completing their missions…. In the end betting the budgetary farm on a fleet of thirsty stealth fighters that have combat radiuses in the realm of 500 miles while at the same time stating that the Pacific Theater, with all of its distance challenges, is our new strategic focus, is just ridiculous without a stealth tanker. China is fully aware that it cannot do battle with our tactical fighters on a toe to toe basis and win without saturating an area with aircraft and thus absorbing huge losses. Yet they do know of our ridiculous dependence on aerial tankers. It is a lot easier to shoot down a tanker that eight individual F-22s depend on for gas than to shoot down the F-22s themselves. Hence China’s J-20, an aircraft built with long-range in mind and a has stealthy skin, all aimed at sneaking by our fighters and taking out their source of nutrition, the lumbering and very detectable aerial tanker. With a stealth combat tanker this damning issue ceases to exist.” China J-20 which is slated to enter limited service with the PLAAF soon. -AP photo AP That same year I also wrote extensively how America needs a “heavy stealth revolution” in terms fielding low observable tankers, transports, bombers and “flying sensor and communications trucks,” and later that year on the possibility into combining all these capabilities into a common low-observable platform. The latter of which obviously didn’t happen as America’s next stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, is now well underway development-wise. This could have been a massive missed opportunity, but with the possibility of a stealthy tanker on the USAF’s horizon it would be very smart to include even a limited tactical transport capability along with it if possible, or potentially adapt the new stealth bomber design for the stealth tanker role. The truth is that stealthy transports are something the Pentagon has been after for a very long time. Many concepts originated under a veil of secrecy, such as SENIOR CITIZEN and SOFTA , which were focused on satisfying various short-takeoff and landing stealthy tactical airlift requirements. The need for this capability was largely borne out of the ashes of the Desert One/Eagle Claw debacle of 1980. It is unclear how many of these concepts made it to the test flight stage, but it is likely at least a handful did. Today the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) CV-22 Osprey, although not a stealth aircraft, has low-level penetration and electronic warfare defensive capabilities that allow it to fulfil this role to some degree and in some circumstances. The stealthy Black Hawks used in the Bin Laden raid also fill a part of this mission profile as well, although over a very limited range. Yet having the ability to insert special operations teams deep behind enemy lines via a stealthy high-altitude penetrating transport opens up a ton of new possibilities when it comes to future battles, especially those against peer-states with large geographical areas. It also fits the Pentagon’s lust for enhanced forcible entry capabilities . USAF Even procuring a stealth tanker that is mainly just that, a tanker, is absolutely necessary if the USAF, and the Pentagon in general, wants to continue investing very heavily on short-ranged manned 5th generation fighter aircraft without wasting tons of money doing so. The problem is that developing a big stealth jet like Lockheed’s concept model is historically a very expensive affair, especially considering the design is not being piggybacked on an existing airframe. Even if this new aircraft’s subsystems are off the shelf, integrating them into an entirely new design, and testing that design, won’t be cheap. Stealth tanker providers The Long-Range Strike Bomber, now known as the B-21 Raider, is slated to cost around $511 million per copy. This aircraft already has a ton of risk reduction work done on it , possibly including flying articles , and largely draws on mature subsystems to lower cost, risk and developmental timeframes. The B-21’s price, which has been officially validated twice, is still seen as optimistic by many, especially considering the USAF’s past track record on developing new combat aircraft, and particularly bombers . But that $511 million price tag only comes after tens of billions will have been spent on development for the type. With this in mind, building yet another large stealthy aircraft, even one that is not as stealthy as penetrating bomber or loaded with advanced sensors and combat systems, will still be a very expensive endeavor. Considering the USAF can’t even afford the Air Force it already has , nor its list of pressing procurement priorities, achieving stealth tanking capability at the lowest possible cost and risk is likely the most attractive avenue, regardless of what additional capabilities the aircraft may bring to the table or not. There is a real possibility that Northrop Grumman could adapt their still yet to be unveiled (in any great detail at least) B-21 Raider design for the tanking mission, offering a stripped down “KB-21” model for the stealthy aerial refueling mission. This could save massively on development costs, and may work to decrease the unit cost of the B-21 program overall by increasing airframe production numbers. Boeing has provided jet tankers to the USAF for 60 years, with the 767 based KC-46 moving into production now. -Boeing … Northrop Grumman could also pair with another contractor, like their competitor on the ruthless KC-X and Long Range Strike Bomber competitions of the past, Boeing, in an effort to win a stealthy tanker contract over Lockheed Martin. Boeing could provide all the aerial refueling know-how while Northrop Grumman provides a developed high-end stealth airframe that the USAF is already planning on operating over 100 of. As we recently learned, even turning a mature commercial airliner that has already been turned into a tanker once before into another tanker can be a serious undertaking . Northrop Grumman paired with Boeing could offer a stealth tanker solution that features both commonality with existing systems—B-21 and KC-46A—as well as low risk and extremely high capability. What Lockheed may have going for it is that its tanker design, as expected, appears to be based on the “Speed Agile” concept that the company, Boeing, NASA and the USAF have been toiling with for years. Speed Agile is a decade long initiative to explore a new design concept for a short takeoff and landing capable tactical transport that also offers extreme efficiency in cruise and heavier lifting abilities than existing tactical transports. The USAF describes the program officially as such : “The Speed Agile Concept Demonstrator (SACD) concept is a four-engine, multi-mission aircraft that offers speed agility; operates routinely from short, improvised airfields; carries larger and heavier payloads; and employs precise and simple flight controls. The SACD’s high-efficiency STOL design incorporates a hybrid powered lift system. This lift system features a simplified mechanical design and low-drag integration. Together, these features greatly reduce both the vehicle weight and overall drag on the vehicle, resulting in greater efficiency and payload capacity than conventional powered lift systems. An aircraft employing Speed Agile technology could potentially operate from short, unprepared airfields. These benefits, coupled with the overall vehicle efficiency, could result in an extremely versatile aircraft capable of quickly and safely transporting equipment, supplies, and troops to remote areas.” … Large amounts of data on this design concept, in multiple unique configurations, has been amassed over the last decade or so, including extensive wind tunnel testing. This gives Lockheed its own unique advantage, and may allow them claim their design already has risk taken out of it and represents a substantial return on investment for money the USAF has already spent. Additionally, the Skunk Works have become very well versed in leveraging the most effective manufacturing processes for large structures like those used on a stealthy transport aircraft. … By basing their stealthy tanker design on Speed Agile technology, Lockheed could very well include tactical transport capabilities into it, something Northrop Grumman could not do with a “KB-21.” Although a pure flying wing design like B-21 would likely be significantly more stealthy than Lockheed’s concept, especially when it comes to evading a wide spectrum of radar bands from all aspects, the need for such a high degree of low observability for a stealthy tanker is debatable. By leveraging what they have learned from Speed Agile could also offer the company its own significant advantage as basically the USAF would gain two unique capabilities in one aircraft, and there may even be funding from Special Operations Command to help develop and field such a platform. Even if transport capabilities were omitted from Lockheed’s design, being able to takeoff from shorter runways, even by couple thousand feet less than its airliner-derived tanker cousins, could open up far more numerous basing possibilities. With more accessible airfields available to it, such a tanker could operate forward of its more predictably based counterparts. This could mean greater sortie generation and better survivability, especially in the vast Pacific theatre. … Then again, Lockheed has not built a large aircraft since the C-5 Galaxy and L-1011 Tristar, so they will probably need a partner to pull an aircraft like this off. Of course Boeing comes to mind not just because they are masters at building big reliable jets, but because they were also a team member on Speed Agile. In fact, there is nothing to say Boeing could not attack such a requirement all on its own, although risk sharing on big programs in this day and age may be a corporate necessity. Solving for KC X, Y and Z As for where the money for a stealth tanker could come from, the good news is that the USAF will have to continue replacing its rapidly aging tanker fleet as time rolls on, and the Air Force is already planning for this. The KC-46 is slated to go for a production run of at least 179 airframes if everything works out, and on the horizon is KC-Y, a competition to replace the USAF’s KC-10 Extender fleet. KC-Y is slated for execution around 2024, while another tanker replacement program, the KC-Z, is slated for a decade later. A study looking into what KC-Z should be will begin this year. USAF The USAF could and should remodel its tanker replacement plans, potentially buying more KC-46s and rolling KC-Y into a stealthy tanker program. The KC-Z program would effectively be dead until it would need reviving in the coming decades, at which time blended wing body aircraft may be a feasible option for providing a heavy tanker capability. Lockheed’s blended wing body aircraft concept is slated for flight testing in the coming decade. -Lockheed … Under such a plan no KC-10 heavy tanker replacement would be available, but between the KC-46 and the KC-Y stealth tanker , the aging KC-135Rs could be more rapidly put pasture, and we already know the KC-46 offers more capability than the KC-135R it replaces. In the meantime, if the USAF could extend the life the KC-10, and/or if it needs access to a heavier tanker than the KC-46, they could look to the private sector for just that. Boeing Outsourcing can be a very good thing I have long argued the USAF should move toward obtaining a significant portion of its aerial refueling needs from private contractors who can offer tailored tanking solutions and elastic capacity. Doing so would mean the USAF would not have to invest so heavily up-front in tanker fleets or the infrastructure needed to support them, while contractors can procure fleets of smaller and larger aircraft based on what the market demands. As the KC-46A comes online, it will be a great time for potential commercial tanker services providers to absorb retiring KC-135Rs, or introduce new platforms depending on what their customers want.  Even smaller tankers, like those based on the 737 or G550, can fulfill many missions where large tankers simply are not needed, and do so at a far lower cost. USAF Under such a concept, it has been proven that industry, the service and the taxpayer win. On the tanking front, Omega Air has been doing this for some time now for the Navy and international customers, and other countries are following suit . Additionally,  private tanker companies’ adversary air support contractor cousins will increasingly provide aggressor training for the same US Navy and USAF fighter aircraft that private tanker companies of the future could be supporting as well. Doing so will introduce competition into the marketplace and will allow the USAF to invest heavily on higher-end capabilities, like stealth tankers, instead of maintaining a one-size fits all tanker armada. The problem is that without the weight of the USAF in the marketplace, there really won’t be a robust marketplace at all. Offsetting a portion of the USAF’s tanker needs to contractors makes so much sense, but cultural hurdles and fear of mission loss within the USAF will likely continue to block it from happening. It will take the right leadership to come along who can see the big picture over petty service heritage and cultural issues to get it done. Once the service realizes it can have more for less in the tanker department, the private tanking industry in the US will explode to meet the demand. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gS7xMGamc60 Once again, the same thing is already happening with private adversary support contractors. It is simply too expensive and wasteful to fly an F-35 around as a intercept target for another F-35, the same can be said for putting large formations of enemies up in the air at one time to really challenge a 5th generation fighter pilot. As such, the USAF will follow the Navy’s example and will become more dependent on private adversary support companies for their training needs as their 5th generation fighter fleet continues to grow. Not embracing a similar strategy now for offsetting a portion of the USAF’s tanker needs is wasteful as procurement decisions are being made without factoring what is more of a eventuality than a possibility at this point. If the USAF were to embrace a restructuring of their tanker recapitalization plans and were to widely accept that private contractors can provide a portion of their tanker needs, these savings could be reinvested into a stealth tanker program and to build more KC-46s at a lower unit cost. … In the end, the sad part about the emerging stealth tanker debate is that it was totally foreseeable. A stealthy tanker should have been in development long ago alongside the F-35. So why didn’t that happen? Most likely because admitting that the F-35 needs a high price tag stealth tanker to make it tactically relevant in the battles of the future would have put the program in question and would have sent the USAF looking for more money it did not have. Plus, having to build a couture tanker for what was pitched as an “affordable fighter” really doesn’t fit that narrative. Still, it’s better late than never, and now that the F-35 is farther along in its development—literally a weapon system that’s too big to fail— and that the B-21’s development is officially underway, it’s time to plug this massive capability gap once and for all.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Why the B-2 Stealth Bomber Was Used to Strike ISIS Camps in Libya,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Six years ago, US-backed coalition airpower tore down Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi’s air defenses. Since then the dictator has been killed. So have a US Ambassador and three other Americans, and thousands of Libyans. Libya, in general, descended into chaos following the death of Gaddafi and the winding-down of coalition air operations over the country. Today, militant factions of varying levels of extremism are aligning themselves to suit their political, tribal and religious ties. Terror groups like ISIS found the chaos of the Libyan civil war a rich incubator for their ideology and operational goals, while at the same time small glimmers of hope have emerged under the Libyan unity government—but for now let’s just say the country has a long way to go before being considered a stable state. In the last half decade following the fall of Gaddafi, the US has quietly leveraged a minimalist brand of air power in an attempt to hunt and kill high-value targets inside the country. Primarily this included using F-15Es on sporadic long-range missions from the UK , and a constant presence of Predator and Reaper drones in Libyan skies. Last Summer this policy changed, and a Marine Amphibious Group’s Cobra attack helicopters and Harrier attack jets began pounding ISIS-aligned militants that had flooded Gaddafi’s hometown—the central coastal city of Sirte. These missions wrapped up early last Winter, when ISIS elements were finally pushed from the city. Now, both figuratively and literally out of the black, America’s most capable and deadly aerial weapon, the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber, has laid waste to a pair of training camps south of that city. Which begs an interesting question: Over a country that remains in disarray with air defenses supposedly neutered years ago, why would stealthy B-2s be needed for such a mission? A nighttime raid Yesterday at around 2AM local time, three B-2A Spirits (two primary, one spare) took off from Whiteman AFB and headed east. Under callsigns CLIP11, CLIP12, CLIP13 the stealth bombers crossed the Atlantic, sometime after which two of the jets “cleaned up,” pulling in all their antennas to make the aircraft as stealthy as possible. The two black jets then began their run into Libyan airspace, towards a pair of terrorist training encampments located about 30 miles southwest of Sirte, in an area of relatively open desert. It was here that a large group of ISIS affiliated militants had assembled after Sirte fell—and where the US Secretary of Defense said the fighters were planning attacks on Europe and US interests abroad. Long before the B-2s arrived over their targets, special operations personnel and a flock of armed MQ-9 Reaper drones were surveilling the camps at a distance, providing real-time updates as to the alert posture of those inside. Then—over half a day after they had left Missouri—the B-2s’ weapons bay doors opened and unleashed dozens of individually targeted joint direct attack munitions on pre-selected targets around the encampments. A still from a short clip shown by the DoD during a Pentagon press briefing of ISIS fighters at one of the targeted camps unloading munitions from a pair of technicals: DoD In a ferocious crescendo of fire and shockwaves, the B-2s’ cargo obliterated fixed targets at both sites. Anyone or anything who ran was likely to be quickly engaged by the loitering Reaper drones armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and 500lb GBU-12 Paveway laser guided bombs. The lion and the vulture, the Lion takes down the big game, and the vultures come in to pick up the scraps and poke at the bones. A short clip showing a small portion of the airstrikes near Sirte that was presented during a Pentagon media briefing: DoD Reports state that the installation was obliterated and around 100 ISIS fighters fell under the crosshairs of an incredible 100 individual air-to-ground munitions during the strike. The B-2s made it back safely to their master base in America’s heartland after nearly 34 hours in the air, facilitated by a slew of aerial refueling. Remember: Nobody kicks ass without tanker gas—not even ultra long-ranged B-2s. A strengthening Spirit The shear amount of surgically applied death and destruction a single B-2 can unleash on one pass is really unprecedented in the history of air combat. Each B-2 airframe can carry up to 80 individually targeted, GPS-guided 500lb GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). Basically, take a satellite image of an airfield (or a town) and pick out the 80 things you want to make into a crater. Then load the coordinates of those things onto the jet and weapons and fly the mission. With the GBU-38’s accuracy rate just a few points off 100 percent, there is a very good chance a well trained B-2 crew and targeteers will make those targets selected in the photo disappear. Not just that, but mixed loads can also be carried, including bunker buster BLU-109s, 2,000lb and 1,000lb JDAMs alongside their 500lb counterparts—so larger targets and bunkers can be attacked alongside smaller ones on the same mission. And the B-2 can dump its whole bomb load in a single run over a localized area—or it can make multiple drops along a route. This helps with survivability, as surprise is a key element of the aircraft’s effectiveness, and once its bay doors open the jet is no longer stealthy. When it comes to attack runs on targets, “one and done” has been optimal operating procedure for the B-2A over the last two decades. In recent years the B-2 has been on the receiving end of much-needed upgrades as part of an ongoing effort that will run into the 2020s. These include plans to enhance the jet’s defensive systems and electronic surveillance measures, boosting its crew’s situational awareness and ability to adapt to changing threats drastically during combat. Cockpit interfaces and mission computers (which remained ‘80s high-tech till recently) are also being upgraded , allowing for retargeting of smart munitions on the fly. The jet’s huge twin electronically scanned array radars are also getting a major boost in capabilities. But one of the most exciting upgrades is to “The Beast’s” communications systems, which will include high-frequency satellite data connectivity, as well as the inclusion of other high-volume data-link modems that will allow the jet to receive real-time targeting information and battlefield data—and even video feeds from third parties like Reaper and most likely RQ-170 drones. It seems very possible that a portion of this new communications and re-targeting capability was tested during this mission, where instead of having the B-2s quickly exit the theatre after their drop, they may have loitered with weapons still available to provide re-attacks on targets that need a little extra help dying. The MQ-9’s real-time streaming video can provide nearly immediate bomb damage assessment (BDA)  imagery to intelligence folks, and could, using the B-2’s enhanced communication suite, convey instant coordinates to the jets’ crews to make follow up attacks on not fully destroyed targets. The B-2 can also help in verifying its coordinates via the use of their increasingly high-fidelity synthetic aperture radar. USAF So did the Spirit try a few of its new bag of tricks on this mission? Considering the circumstances and their overt interoperability with the drones and special operations forces below their flight paths, it seems possible. A report from the Air Force Times also mentions an interesting quote from outgoing Secretary of Air Force Deborah James that seems to support this theory: “The B-2s were dispatched from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, flying 34 hours to conduct the attack, James said. The bat-shaped bombers were chosen, she added, because they are capable of carrying a large number and variety of weapons, and because they’re able to loiter afterwards — to “mop up” if necessary.” As mentioned earlier, loitering around after the fact is not the B-2’s traditional calling card, especially considering that it is meant to penetrate deep into contested airspace, strike targets by surprise and get out alive. That mission really doesn’t call for hanging around over a recently appearing hellscape of its own creation. But in low to medium-threat environments, the ability to target on the fly and work alongside other platforms or ground units is clearly going to change tactics. The reasoning for its use So why not send the B-52H or B-1B to do the job? Those jets have the added benefit of toting around their own targeting pod that can lase targets, moving or stationary, for the laser guided bombs they drop, and they also carry the JDAM like the B-2. First off, no other force in the Pentagon’s portfolio is more trained and ready for complex global strike missions than the B-2 Spirit community. It’s very much a silver bullet force of just 20 aircraft—of which just a handful are available for conventional attack operations at any given time. They train arduously for missions that can last as long as two days; missions where human factors can become almost as big a threat as the enemy. Additionally, the B-2 community is not committed all around the globe and worn down from over fifteen years of perpetual combat operations like the B-52H and B-1B communities are. They are almost entirely a single-garrison force, one that is unleashed for select missions only. USAF The B-2’s stealth capabilities, though not nearly as relevant over Libya today as they were during their attack runs as part of the opening strikes of Operation Odyssey Dawn in 2011, still offer something other platforms cannot—volume of fire and the best chance of surprise. Radar sites are active in Libya today, mainly at the country’s larger airports concentrated along the coastline—just a couple dozen miles from the camps that were struck. There is a chance that the detection of an unidentified aircraft, even just as primary returns, could have been passed along to ISIS affiliated fighters, sending them scattering. For such an attack to be most effective, the targets need to be asleep in their beds. All it takes is one ISIS sympathiser working in relation with Libyan airport staff or the military, or even someone monitoring radio communications chatter about incoming aircraft, to realize something is up. The B-2 largely ensures the element of surprise remains intact. There are also a mishmash of MiGs still prowling the skies over Libya . Although an encounter at night with a B-2 would be highly unlikely, why take the chance? And while Gaddafi’s massive MANPADS arsenal —which was notoriously looted during the uprising against him—may get the most press, heavier SAM systems have began appearing in Libya in recent months. Specifically these include the SA-3—the same type that took down a USAF F-117 during Operation Allied Force. Although there is a low chance that one of these missiles or their operators could take down a B-2, or would even be able to detect it in the first place, it’s still a possible threat—especially considering the questionable command and control organization within even US-friendly military factions in Libya. Overall it’s not like Libyan airspace is totally permissible and deconflicted. It is also unclear how much the recognized Libyan government knew about the strike prior to its execution. Though lower-flying drones and smaller tactical aircraft buzz around the country daily, large bombers don’t. By using an aircraft that gives no warning of its arrival, the element of surprise could be ensured and there would be no need to pass potentially compromising information about the strike to Libyan officials in advance. USAF The B-2 also allows the Pentagon to deal out incredible amounts of destruction with an amazingly small footprint. For most missions the jet is better off going it alone than being part of a massive strike package. This means the normal armada of suppression of enemy air defenses, counter-air, and in some cases electronic warfare aircraft, along with an array of standoff support assets like tankers, combat search and rescue packages, airborne early warning aircraft, and other assets, are not needed or are needed in far smaller numbers. Were fighters were used instead of heavy bombers, the strike package might include dozens of strike aircraft alone, not counting all their support assets. In essence, using the B-2 means less assets and lives put at risk against an objective. It also means the whole battle plan can be simplified, executed faster, and with fewer avenues for disruption. Maybe the most compelling reason to use the B-2 for this mission was to try out some of the jet’s new capabilities as described earlier, and to put to use the B-2’s evolving joint operations doctrine that has been trained for but not tested in combat. If anything else, this may have been our first “preview” look at “B-2 2.0” in combat, and by what we are being told it was brutally effective. Finally, this was almost certainly the very last major military operation executed by outgoing President Barack Obama and his national security staff, including Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, as well as the Secretary of Air Force and others in political leadership within the Pentagon’s five walls. There is risk in any operation, no matter how high-end the hardware used is and what the enemy’s capabilities are. Going with the very best possible asset that can provide the lowest overall risk, even outside of the normal rationale, and was likely a major factor in the B-2’s appearance over Libya yesterday evening. Having a “Black Hawk Down” type of incident on the last day of your Presidency would be a disaster of epic proportions. In fact, I give Obama credit for approving this mission at all, with that in mind. And hey, nobody can say that he didn’t go out with a bang, right?

It was a common poster on the wall of boys growing up, and it probably still is today—the imposing heading-on view of a fully loaded American supercarrier bristling with fighters and support aircraft. On the bow of these most complex of fighting ships, two prong-like structures stuck out over the water, ramped downward as if to give the aircraft riding along the ship’s catapult tracks a few extra feet of help before leaping into the air. The strange protrusions gave these ship’s an ever more menacing appearance, but over the last few decades they have disappeared from American supercarriers. So what were they and where did they go? The USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) AKA “Big John” seen underway from an impressive angle (Huntington Ingalls image): Enter the “bridle catch,” also known as a “bridle arrestment sponson,” a utilitarian structure used to catch the slinging bridles that attached carrier-borne naval aircraft of yesteryear to their host ship’s catapults. A bridle was a heavy-duty cable-like lanyard that attached to rearward facing hooks on either side of the aircraft, and would then run down toward the deck in a “v” to be attached to a single-point notch in the catapult’s shuttle. A similar single line device was also used on some aircraft like the S-2 Tracker, it was called a pendant. A VF-111 Sundowner F-4B seen being strapped in via a bridle before launch aboard the USS Coral Sea during the Vietnam War: … Once the green shirts hooked the aircraft up to the catapult and it fired ( read all about this process here ), the bridle or pendant that links the shuttle to the aircraft would pull it down the catapult track at increasing speed. At the end of the deck the aircraft would depart into the air. The bridle or pendant would then be flung out into the sea, or if the carrier was so equipped, it would whip down onto the sloped bridle catcher so that it could be recovered and used again and again. In essence the bridle catcher was a feature of economy more than anything else. The reason for angling the bridle carrier extension downward was so the bridle would not bounce up and strike the aircraft as it left the deck. A TBM Avenger (left) seen with a bridle attached while sailing aboard the USS Cape Gloucester in 1945. A FM-2 Wildcat (right) seen launching off the deck of the USS Makin Island, bridle being hurling into the ocean, in 1945: … The bridle and pendant system got Navy carriers into the catapult business, but the system was more complex and time consuming than it had to be. There were always concerns over broken bridles and connection points, and the wellbeing of carrier deck crews that had to strap the big aircraft in before each launch was of an even greater concern. It wasn’t until the early 1960s and the introduction of the E-2 Hawkeye (W2F-1 at the time) that the bridle was replaced by the integral catapult launch-bar attached to the aircraft’s nose gear. Diagrams detailing and comparing the two systems: … The first launch by an E-2 using the system occurred on the 19th of December, 1962. Tests were largely successful and substantial gains in safety and efficiency were realized by the new system. Going forward every new US Navy aircraft designed for carrier operations would be equipped with a similar nose gear mounted launch bar. An E-2A being launched via its integral launch bar from the USS Oriskany in the early 1960s (San Diego Air & Space Museum photo): … Over time, as older aircraft that used bridles and pendants were retired, bridle catchers would begin to disappear from America’s aircraft carriers. The last carrier built with bridle catchers was the third Nimitz class nuclear supercarrier, the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) , which began construction in 1975 and was officially commissioned into the fleet in 1982. The Royal Navy’s Audacious class carriers featured bridle catchers on both the bow and the waist catapults, as seem on the HMS Ark Royal (R09) below: … Towards the end of the millennium, American supercarriers that had bridle catchers began having them removed during deep maintenance and overhaul periods. The last active US carrier to have them was the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) which pulled into Naval Station Norfolk for inactivation with her bridle catchers still intact on November 4th, 2012. … Just last July, the last NATO fixed-wing carrier aircraft to use a bridle, the French Super Étendards Mordernise (SEM), was retired once and for all . The carrier these aircraft operated from, the Charles De Gaulle (R91), was never built with bridle catchers. For many years SEMs slung bridles into the sea with reckless abandon. A SEM launching off the deck of the Charles De Gaulle: … Today, really the only aircraft that may see the bridle once again are Brazil’s handful of upgraded AF-1 Skyhawks . Their antique carrier, the surplus French Clemenceau class carrier Foch , now named São Paulo , is supposedly finally getting the upgrades it needs to be operational again. If this indeed comes to pass, its bridle catcher will see use once again—as the last of its kind and a monument to naval aviation’s heritage.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 24, 2019",ISIS Drone Dropping Bomblet On Abrams Tank Is A Sign Of What’s To Come,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the major tactical developments during the war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq has been the deployment of hobbyist and even homemade remote controlled aircraft—often referred to as “drones”—armed with small explosive charges. During the Battle of Mosul especially , Iraqi forces have experienced a threat from aerial bombardment by low-end drones on a level never seen before in combat. Meanwhile US forces in Iraq and Syria have also scrambled to adapt to and counter this growing capability. Yet the hard truth is that the Department of Defense has had plenty of time and warning to do just that. In fact, they spent many millions of dollars looking at the problem , but no hard action was really taken to develop countermeasures, which makes their scramble for countermeasures now all that more frustrating. The weaponizing of these increasingly prevalent and cheap hobbyist drones has been warned about for years by many of us outside the Pentagon’s five walls, and likely by some on the inside as well. Meanwhile, the DoD seemed focused on countering the problem with very high-end systems, such as emerging solid-state laser capabilities , which are more suited for the protection of extremely high-value targets than for providing a shield for soldiers on the battlefield. Some counter-rocket and mortar (C-RAM) systems, which use kinetic means to kill, with cannon shells or missiles, have also been adapted for this use to a limited degree, but these are also geared to defending fixed positions and can be horrifically expensive to use. Videos like the ones below, from various militant groups in the Middle East, have become increasingly common, although taking on a M1 Abrams main battle tank, and the tanker standing in its hatch, certainly is one of the most sensational we have seen. Warning, this is graphic video. The tanker supposedly died in the attack. The second video is a compilation of many similar strikes: https://youtube.com/watch?v=7X2ORSlPJ10 Photo of drones captured in Iraq—Presumably the same type that drops the bomblets in the videos above (photos via defense-blog.com ): Now, the industry is rushing to develop “squad level” solutions for the hobby-drone threat. These largely include directional jamming systems that cut off a drone’s radio control and GPS signal, and thus hopefully defeat it entirely. This concept is being advanced, and even deployed to a limited degree, in a couple forms. The first as a rifle-like system , where the user visually acquires the drone, and then aims the emitter at it just as if they would a long gun. The other type is more cumbersome , and uses high-frequency radar, infrared and/or electronic surveillance to detect and track the drone. A turreted directional jammer then cues on the target. This type of setup is more of an area solution than the shouldered version which has no automated detection and targeting capability. Eventually versions of this more elaborate system will likely be deployed on moving vehicles, just as other medium and heavy weapons would be. On the higher end, directed energy systems (solid state lasers) have taken small unmanned aircraft up as their primary intended targets as they still lack the power and range to take on larger targets at range effectively. These systems can provide other functions than just anti-drone capabilities and are becoming more powerful and less cumbersome as years go by. Eventually they will find themselves on the front lines, but even their utility is limited against large quantities of small, cheap drones attacking at one time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KBtyy8HcW4g https://youtube.com/watch?v=LdhKMDJ92fw Still, these countermeasures don’t take into account that in the future, these cheap, highly available tool/toys turned into weapons will be used in greater numbers and, eventually, will feature autonomous flight coordination, also known as swarm technology . As such, solutions need to migrate from taking down one enemy drone at a time, to denying their use, even in large quantities, seamlessly over an entire area. Omnidirectional broadband jamming is an issue because the US military uses a wide range of the same frequencies. Not only that, but small hobby-like drones are increasingly used by the America’s own land forces , including suicidal ones that work just as well as guided missiles than as surveillance systems. Jamming yourself and neutering your own drone capability doesn’t help the situation for allied troops fighting on the ground. One possible solution for what will be one of the most pressing tactical issues of the near future is countering low-end drone swarms with low-end drone swarms. Basically sicking one flock on another, with the ability to work as a team to home in on an enemy swarm and to knock it out of the sky. Clearly this is going to become a much more complicated business than anyone would like imagine, especially as these “over-the-counter” drone systems become smaller and more autonomous . Even here at home, as time passes, murder by drone is likely to become a very real thing. The police have already killed a suspect using a robotic system , and criminals may find that the drone is far better tool for taking out one’s enemies from afar than a gun’s bullet, especially consider that said bullet cannot turn corners. As our lives become more encompassed by these buzzing craft, distinguishing friend from foe will be all but impossible. Washington DC and its surroundings is already a drone free zone , as are other sensitive areas . Expect many others to follow especially if the technology cannot be regulated to the point where it can’t be so easily abused. This is a problem pro-drone industries should confront head-on as the future of the technology and its applications likely depends on it. The thing is that we have rapidly moved from small but deadly and expensive suicide drones capable of inflicting lethal force, to even simpler and cheaper ones that drop expendable munitions and can be quickly reused again. What’s most concerning is that the majority of the innovation in this field has been achieved by the enemy in a warzone.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 18, 2019",Reagan Invited Thatcher To Join The Top Secret F-117 Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dubbed “Project Moonblower,” during the height of the F-117 Nighthawk’s secrecy in the mid 1980s, the Reagan administration, and even the Gipper himself, offered an invite to the UK Ministry of Defense to join the highly classified program. In newly unsealed UK National Archives files obtained by The Guardian , Reagan’s offer to his good friend and Prime Minister of the UK Margaret Thatcher was casual as can be, with Reagan penning a diplomatic cable that stated in part: “Dear Margaret, I am delighted to hear that you will be able to see Cap (Caspar Weinberger, the US defence secretary at the time) to discuss the special program I wrote you about… I look forward to receiving your reaction. Sincerely, Ron.” On the communique the word “stealth” was lightly written in pencil. The “Iron Lady” wrote back to Reagan following the brief, stating: “Dear Ron, I was immensely impressed by your splendid achievement: three cheers for America! I was also very touched by the generosity of the offer of participation which Cap brought. It brings home once again who our real friends are… I am so much looking forward to seeing you in Tokyo. With warmest best wishes, yours sincerely, Margaret.” The two enjoyed not only the “special relationship” between the US and the UK but they were also good personal friends. , Rogers/Express/Getty Images The MoD ended up not taking up the DoD’s offer to participate directly in the program at the time. In a Ministry of Defense letter written in December of 1986 to Charles Powell, the Foreign Affairs Adviser to the Prime Minister, the decision and a description of its uneventful aftermath were made clear: “Mr Weinberger has offered us a chance to purchase the current US aircraft but we have replied that we would not wish to actually buy hardware while the programme remains strictly black… Younger (the MoD defense secretary) raised the subject very briefly with Mr Weinberger this morning… just sufficiently to test whether Weinberger is disappointed at our reaction so far. He certainly does not seem to be.” Nearly a decade later, when the F-117 had fully emerged from the “black” world, the UK was offered the jet once again. This time it would not be a baseline F-117A on the table but a heavily upgraded and anglicized F-117B, which itself would be based on the Navy’s F-117N/X Sea Hawk concept. The F-117N/X (among other titles) was used as a springboard for the UK F-117B offering. , Lockheed Renderings The type was aimed at satisfying the Royal Air Force’s Staff Target Air 425 deep-strike requirement that emerged following Desert Storm. The F-117B’s airframe would have been partially built by BAE, the jet’s avionics would feature some British components, the A model’s GE-F404 engines would be replaced with Eurojet EJ200 turbofans—the EF2000 Eurofighter’s powerplant. As found on the F-117N/X concept, new serrated non-grilled intakes would be featured as well as a revised exhaust, both of which were similar to those found on the B-2 Spirit. The wing would have less sweep and a greater span than the A model’s. Horizontal tailplanes would also be added aft of the wing. A bubble canopy would replace the A model’s sectioned one. The jet’s classically flat bottom would be recontoured in a constantly curving manner to make more room for weaponry and decrease its detectability to radars. Combined, these features would give the F-117 more capability on multiple fronts, including better slow speed handling, shorter field performance and increased endurance. The B model in particular would have been able to carry nearly double the bomb load and would have featured double the mission radius of the A model. Lockheed Martin bid the F-117N/X to the US Navy initially at a cost of $70 million per jet , based on a total production of 255 new airframes. If the UK jumped onboard it was claimed that this price could be decreased further, but considering the special configuration of the UK model, this may well have not ended up an accurate assessment. The revised F-117 2.0 of sorts would have been a striking looking aircraft. , Lockheed renderings The F-117N/X—and there are even subtypes of those designations—was part of the Navy’s mad scramble to come up with a replacement for the doomed A-12 Avenger program. In the end the F-117N/X would not be built. Instead the Navy chose to go the safest route possible and procure the Super Hornet as a one-size-fits-all strike-fighter solution. Without the Navy onboard there was no chance the UK was going to pursue the type on its own. Instead it reinvested in the Tornado fleet and focused on fielding the EF2000 in the coming decade. Yet even after the decision not to buy the F-117B was made, the UK’s interest in acquiring its own stealthy combat aircraft quietly continued through the late 1990s and 2000s, most notably in the form of the BAE Replica and now the flying Taranis UCAV. In 1999 during Operation Allied Force the F-117’s reputation for invincibility was shattered when a Serbian SAM crew shot down a Nighthawk with an SA-3 “Goa.” The circumstances for the shootdown were complicated, but at least to the public, the F-117 was proven “touchable” for the first time. In the end the type would not see another sub-model built, and the fleet of roughly 60 F-117s were retired under curious circumstances in 2008 , although a handful are still plowing the skies over the Nellis Range Complex. In many ways, a second F-117 variant in new configuration would have given Lockheed the opportunity to get the jet right. The A models were so experimental for their time, as was their underlying technology, that the ability to tweak the jet’s design and its subsystems could have resulted in an incredible combat machine, and built on the F-117A’s amazing legacy . On the other hand, it is unclear how long a facelift of a first generation stealth aircraft would remain viable. Operating the F-117 has never been a cheap affair, regardless of its sticker price. The Tornado GR4 and Europfighter Typhoon make up the backbone of RAF’s combat punch today. , Crown Copyright The Super Hornet and the Tornado have suited the wars of the last 20 years well, so in the long run the decision not to procure the F-117N/X/B seems to have been an acceptable one. And both the US Navy and the UK MoD will be getting their stealth aircraft finally in the form of the F-35B and F-35C, some 20 years after the F-117 2.0 was pitched for sale, and nearly 30 years after the Reagan administration invited the Royal Air Force entry into the then hyper-elite stealth combat aircraft secret society. It’s yet another colorful and intriguing facet of a program that still fascinates the mind over forty years after the competition to build the first flying stealth aircraft officially begun.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 26, 2020",John Glenn’s Combat Nickname Was “Old Magnet Ass” For All The Right Reasons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sure, he was the first American to orbit the earth, and he went on to win a Senate seat, but John Glenn was also a down and dirty fighter pilot. He flew F4U Corsairs in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, then went back to war over the skies of Korea in Grumman F9F Panthers. It was during his 63 missions with VMF-311 “Tomcats” over Korea that he gained an off-color but awesomely fitting nickname: “Old Magnet Ass.” The nickname may sound like a ribbing—it’s anything but. “Old Magnet Ass” came into being as a result of the way Glenn would aggressively pursue ground targets in his Panther. At times he would bravely dive in for attack runs long after the element of surprise had been lost. In the process he would attract so much anti-aircraft artillery fire that his jet would come back riddled with holes. On one flight near Sinanju, he spotted a North Korean AAA pillbox, though by the time he positively identified the position he would have to circle back to make an attack run. He swooped down and opened up at close range with the Panther’s 20mm cannons, and the North Korean gunners returned the favor with prejudice. Although he nailed the AAA emplacement, his jet was a wreck and nearly uncontrollable, flying far out of trim in the vertical axis. VMF-311 F9Fs in Korea., DoD Amazingly he made it back to K-3 airfield, his home base at the time, and was able to set the plane down in one piece. Upon landing, ground crews were stunned by what they saw. The Panther’s tail had a massive hole blasted in it, nearly large enough to crawl through. Another 250 or so perforations were found on the aircraft. It was amazing that the jet made it back, and Glenn along with it. In the end, once the Panther had a completely new tail grafted on and the holes were patched the jet returned to action. Glenn swore that it would be the last time he would make a second pass on a target, especially on one whose only mission was to shoot back. A week later Glenn’s Panther was hit once again, but this time a AAA shell detonated a napalm canister on its wing. Once again, the astronaut-to-be limped the charred and badly damaged airplane back to base and lived to tell about it—though this time there was no saving the aircraft—it was literally burnt to a crisp. The straight-winged and portly Panther was fairly antiquated from its birth in the ultra-fast evolving jet tech jumble of the 1950s. While it had a reputation as stout ground attack jet that could take a hit, as an air-to-air fighter it was less than sprightly. Glenn missed dogfighting, and after he completed 63 missions with VMF-311 he put in for an exchange slot with the USAF where he would fly America’s new hotrod of the skies—the swept-wing F-86 Sabre—an aircraft that could directly tangle with MiG-15s being flown by the North and its communist allies. John Glenn standing proudly in front of his USAF F-86F Sabre. , USAF Glenn patrolled the MiG Alley constantly, in the hope of taking on the Soviet-designed jets. Eventually this thirst for air-to-air action got him his second nickname: “The MiG Mad Marine.” Eventually his dogfighting wishes would come true, and he would down three MiGs during his 27 F-86 missions of the Korean War. For his incredible combat actions in both wars, as well as his more publicized flying feats that came after, Glenn received six Distinguished Flying Crosses—among an avalanche of other medals and awards. John Glenn’s “MiG Mad Marine” F-86 Sabre during the Korean War., USAF Later the man would go on to become an elite Navy Test Pilot, set a cross-country speed record in a an F-8 Crusader , then become the first American to orbit the earth.

He remains the oldest human to ever fly in space. John Glenn seen before his 1957 transcontinental record breaking trip in an F-8 Crusader. , AP Although his death is clearly sad, it’s impossible not to celebrate John Glenn’s amazing life. He is the definition of an American hero, and an inspiration to so many people on so many different levels. When reflecting on the loss of such an amazing American, it brings into focus the stark reality that these heroes from our glorious and gutsy space faring past will one day, in the not too distant future sadly, be gone. Why don’t we have heroes like this anymore? Or maybe a better question, how can we have heroes like this once again? John Glenn going literally where no man has gone before during his historic flight into space. , AP They say timing in life is everything, and the heroes of the “Right Stuff” era certainly were in the right place at the right time. They worked excruciatingly hard and took massive risks that few can comprehend. It is hard to argue that America neglected its ability to create environments in which risk takers—explorers and the best among us—can turn become a hero of John Glenn’s level. The sad state of our space program , and a huge aversion to risk in just the places where we need to risk the most can be at least be partially blamed. In the end maybe John Glenn’s passing will be a stark reminder of what the greatest among us are capable of, when the right medium for fostering massive success is put into place. In the meantime, we can also all admire a special man that became a hero so many times over, and that accomplishing amazing things became the norm not the exception.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Behold the Pioneering A-6C Intruder With its Massive Ventral Sensor Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Few aircraft have captured my imagination like the Grumman A-6 Intruder, and the aircraft’s history is sprinkled with awesome obscurities, thrust vectoring nozzles being one of them . Over the decades, the type was adapted into a tanker (KA-6D), and suppression of enemy air defenses aircraft (A-6B), and, most famously, into the an outstanding electronic warfare platform (EA-6A and EA-6B), the latter of which still serves the USMC today . But lots of other sub-variants were built, and maybe the most intriguing is the A-6C. Only a dozen A-6Cs were fielded, all of which were converted from A-6As starting in 1968 with their combat debut occurring in 1970. Their role was to specifically go after targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail , North Vietnam’s key logistical route that cut in and out along the Vietnam-Laos border. Even under mass bombardment, breaking the trail had been nearly impossible, so the Pentagon looked towards high technology to affect the situation. One such application was the A-6C with its massive and somewhat futuristic TRIM pod attached to its belly. A-6C’s TRIM pod. , … The name stood for Trails, Roads, Interdiction, Multi-Sensor, an adequate description for the pod’s mission and configuration. Inside the big fairing were low-light and infrared cameras that allowed A-6C crews to navigate visually and to identify targets such as people vehicles along the trail at night. The optics were a far cry from the FLIR systems and targeting pods found on virtually every American tactical military aircraft today, or even those found domestically on police and news helicopters, but at the time the technology was cutting-edge. The two systems were mounted side-by-side behind flat panes of glass in a rotating turret located at the front of the pod. The low-light TV camera offered a wider field of view than the more narrow field of view offered by the infrared camera. The components of the A-6C TRIM pod., … In addition to the A-6C’s optical sensors, the Black Crow engine ignition-detection system was also fitted. This system was effective in any weather and even while targets were concealed visually under thick jungle canopy. It detected the microwave emissions from a vehicle’s spark plugs firing and gave targeting coordinates for the host aircraft to fire on. The first AC-130 gunships also used the system over the Ho Chi Minh Trail successfully. In addition to the TRIM pod and Black Crow, the charlie model of the A-6 also saw major upgrades to its navigational and fire control radars and other avionics systems. The unique lines of the A-6C., … Although the concept behind the A-6C held great promise, the technology was lacking, and the big pod imposed a severe performance tax on the Intruder. This included substantially limiting the amount of ordnance the jet could bring back to the boat if no targets were found during nighttime hunting missions, as well as increased fuel burn throughout the aircraft’s flight envelope. A-6E TRAMs loaded with bombs in the early 1980s. You can see the TRAM turret on the bottom of the Intruder’s nose. , USN Just one A-6C was lost in a mishap, and many of the surviving examples ended up being converted over to the Intruder’s ultimate operational configuration following the end of the war. Even though the A-6C was not a huge success, it paved the way for this final A-6 variant, as the A-6E TRAM (Target Recognition and Attack Multi-sensor) would feature much more evolved and miniaturized infrared systems. These were housed in a small turret under the A-6E’s nose that contained a FLIR, laser designator and spot tracker, and a computer that tied the system into the A-6E’s integrated avionics suite. Many of the lessons learned in the A-6C program were taken into account when developing the A-6E TRAM. A-6E TRAM loaded with laser guided bombs during Desert Storm., USN A-6Es would see service in Libya and in especially in Iraq, where they pummeled targets with laser-guided bombs. Although the A-6E TRAM was an amazing all-weather war-fighting machine, no version of “Flying Frying Pan” could compare charismatically with the pioneering, rare, and futuristic looking A-6C. It was another short-lived but unique highlight in what was a very diverse time for naval aviation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 14, 2021",What Oddities Can You Spot In This Tour Of Russia’s Aging Aircraft Carrier?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s only aircraft carrier, the aging and quirky Admiral Kuznetsov , means many different things to many different people. To some it is a symbol of Russian might, to others it is a dangerous relic of the Cold War, one that holds little real strategic value. Some have even used it as a metaphor for Russia’s military and extra-territorial aspirations. No matter how you see it, one thing is for certain, the ship and its mission are downright interesting. That’s why this tour of the vessel is so worth watching. The amateur video, which was posted in our comments section by Mister Bond, depicts a group of civilians being guided through the bowels of the ship. Exactly when it was shot is not clear, although it looks fairly recent, say within the last five years. It appears to have been taken while the carrier was docked in its home port of Severomorsk , which is also the headquarters for Russia’s Northern Fleet. As you can see, the ship appears to be very dated inside, with a sprinkling of computer technology, and even that is far from cutting edge. Much has been made of the carrier’s poor and even deadly reliability and nasty living conditions . Yet maybe the most publicized disparagements against the vessel have to do with the signature black smoke that it trails around while underway. Russia’s carrier spitting black smoke as it sails through the English Channel., AP Russia admits that the ship’s propulsion system is based on old technology, but exactly how bad a condition its boilers are in remains unclear. The carrier is followed around by ocean-going tugs as breakdowns are seen as almost a certainty, something that also affects the ship’s ability to operate aircraft in “blue water” conditions far out to sea. Here is another video showing the inner workings of the ship: The tweet below has been circulating supposedly comparing the Kuznetsov’s dilapidated boilers to the Indian carrier INS Vikramaditya , which was built-out to a similar configuration as the Admiral Kuznetsov from an existing Kiev class aircraft carrying missile cruiser , the same type that the Kuznetsov class’s design originally evolved from. India’s acquisition of the ship from Russia took far more money and time to complete than originally planned, but Russia eventually delivered the ship in late 2013. The third picture in the tweet is of the same sort boiler setup, as seen on China’s only carrier the Liaoning . The vessel, which is Admiral Kuznetsov sister ship, was bought from Ukraine as a rusted hulk to be used as a hotel and casino, but that was just a cover story and China totally refurbished the ship and reverse engineered much of its design in the process. As you can see, the difference in quality of each engine room is stark. The rusted hulk that was once the Kuznetsov’s sister ship, the Varyag , seen dockside in China before its transformation into the Liaoning . , Globalsecurity.org Admiral Kuznetsov was supposed to undergo a deep overhaul and refit after its last deployment but that was delayed till 2018, instead the ship got a light refresh before being sent out to sea. This delay was enacted largely so that the ship could participate in the Syrian air campaign and show off its new air wing capabilities in the form of MiG-29KRs and KA-52Ks. One MiG has since crashed and it seems the bulk of the operations, including
 bombing sorties , are being executed by the slightly upgraded Su-33s at this time. Now the ship’s overhaul in imminent, and there has been some information on what it could entail, although nothing can be certain at this point. From my previous feature detailing the carrier’s history and design: “Whether the P-700 missile tubes are still active and filled with live rounds is unknown. It’s possible, as the ship is slated to go through a much deeper refit when it returns from its Syrian deployment. On its return home this capability will most likely be removed, once and for all, with new hangar space making room for the Kuznetsov’s modernized air wing that will increasingly be made up of MiG-29KR strike fighters and KA-52K attack helicopters. Other improvements slated for the ship during its deep refit are rumored to include new gas turbines, replacing the dated boiler system that has plagued the ship’s reliability for years. New missile defense systems, including medium-range surface-to-air missiles and a navalized version of the Pantsir point defense system would be added. New communications systems and sensors would also replace long-obsolete ones.” In the meantime, the ship will continue operations off Syria’s coast, as this pretty sweet 360 degree video released by Russian media highlights: https://youtube.com/watch?v=223h3d_7UsI What interesting features can you spot in the Kuznetsov tour video, let us know in the comments section below.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",Meet The Biggest And Baddest Ships In the US Army,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you think of the US Army, large seagoing vessels don’t come to mind. Maybe they should; the service has its own expansive fleet of boats and ships, and the USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda and its sister ship the USAV Major General Robert Smalls are the biggest of them all. While the Marines have their own specialized high-end armada of Navy ships, sometimes referred to as the “Gator Navy,” to support their amphibious operations, the Army has no such luxury. But what the Army does have is a far more understated beach landing and logistics naval force that relies on a simpler sea-bound logistics concept. At the heart of this concept are the Army’s largest class of ships, the Logistic Support Vessels (LSVs) of the General Frank S. Besson class. Eight of these ships are in service with Army, six of which were built between 1987 and 1994. Following the retirement of the Newport class Landing Ship Tank (LST ), they are now the largest of their kind within the Pentagon’s inventory and are reminiscent of Russia’s massive amphibious landing ships. The class has the ability to pull right up onto beaches., DoD These first six ships are 273 feet long, 60 feet wide, and displace 4,200 tons. They were designed to convey cargo and vehicles, and can be loaded and unloaded by crane right onto their decks, or by ramps on the stern and on the bow of each vessel. The bow ramp in particular is designed for direct beach/shoreline access, with ships pulling right into the surf for loading and offloading. Abrams tanks are loaded onto to the class’s 10,500 square-foot deck. , DoD These ships are capable of carrying any of the Army’s land vehicles, including the massive M1 Abrams main battle tank. In fact, it can haul up to 15 of the Abrams at a time. It can also carry a maximum of 82 double-stacked 20-foot long ISO containers, a big tugboat —even a Boeing C-17 fuselage. A huge Boeing C-17 fuselage being loaded onto a Besson class LSV., DoD The maximum load for the early Besson class is 2,000 short tons spread over the vessel’s 10,500 square-feet of deck area. It’s an extraordinary accomplishment for a ship with a draft of just 13 feet. Drawing so little water helps for expeditionary operations when docks are not available. An MRAP being loaded onto the ship via crane. , DoD In the early 2000s a subclass of the type was launched consisting of two ships, USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda (LSV-7) and its sister ship USAV Major General Robert Smalls (LSV-8). These are the largest ships in the Army’s inventory, with 42 feet added to the earlier General Frank S. Besson class design. Both variants of Besson class LSVs operated by the US Army seen side-by-side while deployed in the Persian Gulf. , DoD This increased length is largely due to a modification of the ship’s bow. Instead of having the flat, shovel-like front dictated by the ship’s forward ramp, a “visor” is fitted that can lift up and down. When in the lowered position, this fairing makes the ship much more hydrodynamic, and capable of handling rougher seas than their predecessors. LSV-8 with its rounded bow lifted., DoD This modification, along with the ability to generate large quantities of fresh water, double the horsepower, and expanded internal volume for creature comforts, gives the subclass the ability to take on global missions better than its six forebeares. With a range of nearly 6,500 miles, these ships can reliably self-deploy to hotspots on short notice. These modifications come with the penalty of increased mass. The two $26 million ships displace an extra 1,800 tons each compared with the other ships in their class. LSV crews train for operations in many conditions., DoD The General Frank S. Besson class of ships, like other US Army vessels, are crewed by a little-known cadre of soldier-sailors (they prefer the name Army Mariner). Each of these ships has roughly eight Warrant Officers, and between 14 and 24 enlisted crew. Unlike most other parts of the service, Army vessels don’t run on rank structure necessarily , instead they run on a license-type hierarchy. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sh1KIp_rqQE In general, it seems that morale aboard these ships and crew retention is exceptionally high, and let’s face it, saying that you are assigned to a ship in the Army is a great conversation starter—so that’s one big perk. Also, these crews work as small, close-knit units, and many get to see exotic ports around the globe—some of which big Navy ships don’t even get to call on. An LSV tenders a foreign submarine during RIMPAC. , DoD A further two variants of the same class were built for the Philippine Navy in the early 1990s, and are configured as multi-role patrol ships. Dubbed the Bacolod City class, these vessels are adaptable to different mission sets and are very inconspicuous. A helicopter pad is fitted to the rear of the variant’s superstructure, and small boats can deploy from the ship’s rear ramp area. These vessels can also still be used in a material transport role when needed and are up-gunned with 20mm cannons and enhanced sensors. Bacolod City class LSV seen during US-Philippine exercises in the South China Sea. , DoD The multi-role light helicopter carrier configuration—which the Bacolod City class is a version of—was one of a handful of alternative uses for the General Frank S. Besson class design. Semi-submersible and troop carrier variants were also put forward, but never fully developed. When it comes to the ability to move a lot of hardware right to the beach the LSV reigns supreme within the Pentagon’s inventory. , DOD The US Army’s small fleet of General Frank S. Besson class logistics vessels are gaining a whole new level of prominence as the Pentagon attempts to pivot away from sandy land warfare in the Middle East and towards the watery and remote challenges of Pacific. A US Army LSD offloads vehicles directly onto the rear well deck of a “Gator Navy” amphibious assault/dock landing ship. , DoD While the Navy, Air Force, and Marines have a front row seat at the table when it comes to fighting in a combined manner over the vast distances in the Pacific Theatre, the Army has struggled to find its place in this new strategic order. These LSVs, especially the more deployable two latter ships in the class, could be just the bridge the service needs to make itself more relevant. An eclectic mix of US Army hardware on the deck of an LSV., DoD The Navy is spending big bucks on creating huge mobile sea bases, and even Special Operations Command is getting in on the action by creating their own afloat mobile staging base . It would only seem logical for the Army’s LSVs to play a strong role in this growing sea basing and Pacific theatre expeditionary fighting strategy. If anything else, they represent an affordable bridge between small and rudimentary landing craft with localized reach and the Joint High Speed Vessels that are growing in number within the Pentagon’s war-fighting portfolio. The LSV’s amphibious capabilities are undeniable. , DoD With all this in mind, expect these little-known but capable and proud ships to become a much more “visible” Army capability,—and don’t be too surprised if the service decides to order more of them in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sweden has built some fascinating aircraft over the years, but the SAAB 37 Viggen has to be one of the most interesting. The jet was unique—its delta-canard configuration was cutting-edge, and its ability to operate in austere conditions made it quite independent compared to most other western fighters of the era. The Saab’s unique engine choice not only resulted in its stout appearance, and also gave it unique performance characteristics—especially when it came to short field operations. In the early 1960s while turbojets still filled the sky SAAB designers pursued a turbofan engine for their new multi-role fighter-attack-reconnaissance-interceptor. The type even had a maritime patrol variant. It was a broad mandate: The requirements for what became the Viggen dictated that the jet be capable of Mach two at high altitude and Mach one at sea level, all while possessing very good short takeoff and landing capabilities with good fuel efficiency at low and medium altitudes. The only remaining flyable Viggen performs at the RAF Waddington Air Show in 2013. , John5199/wikicommons Few engine options were available that could satisfy such demanding specs. Turbofans were just emerging as the next great thing in aerospace propulsion technology. SAAB ended up with a license-built version of the Pratt & Whitney JT8D—the same engine flown on the 727 and DC-9 airliners—known locally as the Volvo RM8. A “naked” JT8D-9 version of the venerable engine. , Alan Radecki/Wikicommons Beyond having its internals tweaked for supersonic operations, the RM8 featured some major additions to the JT8D’s baseline design that were specifically suited for the Viggen’s mission set. A large afterburner can was attached to the end of the engine, this massively increased thrust, but also turned the engines miserly fuel consumption into a gas guzzler when it was activated. The second was the addition of a set of thrust reverser petals housed inside the engine’s exhaust nozzle, along with perimeter bypass veins that would allow air to exit in a forward direction when the reversers were activated. The RM8B blasted out an incredible 28,100lbs of thrust in afterburner and 16,200lbs of ‘dry’ thrust without. To give you an idea of just how powerful the engine was for a fighter of the day, the popular General Electric J79 turbojet which powered the F-4 Phantom and F-104 Starfighter put out between 16,000lbs and 18,000lbs depending on the variant. The Pratt & Whitney F100 that would equip the state-of-the-art F-15A/B years after the Viggen first flew put out about 24,000lbs of thrust. The Viggen trainer—this one a SK37E electronic warfare trainer aircraft—was especially cool looking with its staggered cockpit layout. , Teijo Hakala/wikicommons For what the Viggen gained in thrust with its RM8, it lost in sleekness. The large diameter engine necessitated a thick fuselage, but area-rule was still applied to the design to give it better supersonic capabilities than otherwise. With the jet’s fixed inlet design, it was never meant to be the fastest aircraft in the air anyway. The Viggen’s unique powerplant was paired with very tough landing gear—four wheels for the mains and two for the nose gear—and a unique vortex generating “double delta’ canard design, with flaps making up the trailing edge of the canards. All this added up to a marvelous short-field performer, with the Viggen being able to get airborne in less than 1,500 feet and become agile at low speeds right after liftoff. An impressive lineup of Viggens., Rune Rydh/wikicommons If Viggen departures were often dramatic, its landings were even more so. The jet would make flareless high-rate of descent landings—with sink rates of 15 feet per second being normal—in order to plant the jet firmly on the ground as soon as possible. The RM8’s thrust reversers were automatically triggered to engage once the nose wheel touched down, at which time the Viggen would throttle up and the pilot would engage the aircraft’s brakes to quickly slow its velocity as it chugged down the runway. The Viggen’s thrust reversers could also be engaged for ground handling, including backing out of tight spots and especially for executing the Viggen’s trademark J-turn on the runway. The jet could touchdown, slow with its reversers on, and keep them engaged while it flipped around and took off in the opposite direction and in the same distance—all without ever coming to a stop. Although nowhere near as sleek and beautiful as its J35 Draken predecessor, it was truly a special brute of a machine. The jet’s whole short takeoff and landing capability went along with a larger concept of austere and dispersed fighter operations that Sweden has held onto ever since.  But the Viggen’s impact extended even further. The Saab packed pretty exciting technology for its time, including a heads-up display, digital mission computer, anti-skid braking system and an electronic flight control system—the first of its kind in a production aircraft. A fairly exotic Tactical Instrument Landing System was also fielded, which made precise landings on short strips much more reliable. Yet above all else the Viggen was built to be reliable and easy to maintain without the dense infrastructure needed by comparable fighters. At war, Viggens would be expected to operate from airfields that were nothing more than narrow and tree-lined strips of rural highway, with concrete caverns or camouflage netted revetments in the vicinity to park and service the aircraft. In fact, the jet’s tail was made to automatically fold over via an actuator system so that the aircraft could fit in low-slung parking areas. A Viggen inside a fortified cavern with its tail folded. , Alan Wilson/Wikicommons There are stories of these jets operating from roads in horrible weather conditions, including snow, mud and ice, and being just caked with muck sprayed up by their big thrust reversers after days of flying. These were truly tough machines. The Viggen’s thrust reversers remain an oddity till this very day—only the Panavia Tornado has employed a form of the concept with its “bucket” style thrust reversers. In general, tactical aircraft used simpler and lighter drogue chutes and anti-skid braking systems to slow themselves down. Short takeoff and landing requirements have taken far less precedence on the high-tech fighters. Today though, the ability to operate from austere locations—even with fighters not specifically designed to do so—is making quite the comeback. The Panavia Tornado’s bucket-style thrust reversers in action., … 329 Viggens were built, and the aircraft served from 1970 to 2005 in a variety of roles and configurations. While the plane never achieved export success like the JAS39 Gripen that followed, it will long be remembered for prowling low and fast over Swedish countryside—and above all else, for its dramatic short field takeoffs and landings. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pRSVHxT-ziM Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2020",This Bird Strike Reminds Us it Doesn’t Take a Missile to Down a Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The possibility of taking a bird strike, especially during the terminal phases of flight around airports, or while flying at low level, is just a fact of life for aviators. Different types of aircraft that travel at different speeds, in different flight environments and with various forms of propulsion have their own unique vulnerabilities when it comest to run-ins with birds. This has resulted in specific design elements built into modern aircraft that work as countermeasures against bird strikes and engine ingestions. For instance, fighter jets often have reinforced windscreens capable of lessening the severity of a bird strike at lower speeds, while airliners, with their big high-bypass turbofan engines, are designed to be able to ingest birds up to a particular size without flaming out. But even the most advanced engines can only ingest so much mass before realizing a catastrophic loss of power. Maybe the most famous example of this was the “Miracle On The Hudson” when Captain Sully made a successful gliding descent into the Hudson in an A320 full of passengers after ingesting geese in both of the aircraft’s engines shortly after takeoff. High performance fighter engines, with lower bypass ratios, are more susceptible to catastrophic bird ingestions than their big high-bypass turbofan cousins. As such, fighter pilots take a particular interest in avoiding birds, especially flocks of them. But considering the speeds that these aircraft are moving at, and how busy their pilots are in the cockpit, sometimes birds cannot be avoided, as seen in the video below. In fact, even if the bird doesn’t take down the jet, the pilot’s reaction to the strike could. An amazing example of this is the photo seen above, taken by aviation photographer, air traffic controller, and veteran AWACS crewman, Louis DePaemelaere ( check out his site here ), at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado. The picture shows one of the 120th Fighter Squadron F-16C’s blasting out of Buckley and right into a small gathering of birds, one of which had a dramatic collision with the Viper’s ALQ-131 electronic countermeasures pod mounted on its centerline station. A bit higher and the result of such a collision could have been far more severe. The result of an F-16’s canopy meeting a bird in flight. , DoD Although the F-16’s single-piece bubble canopy was engineered to withstand a strike from a four pound bird while traveling at 350 knots, and the Block 30 F-16C’s GE-F110 engine was designed with bird ingestion failure resistance in mind, encounters with birds can lead to quick and dramatic flight terminations for the single engine fighter, as seen in the amazing video below. And even in the case of the photo above, maybe ingesting one of these bird would not have resulted in the total loss of the aircraft, but multiple ones surely could have. The USAF takes bird strikes very seriously, and along with air bases and co-located civilian airports that their aircraft are based at, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) prevention programs have been put into place. Th e DoD describes its BASH initiative and the need for it as such: “Each year, civil and military aircraft strike thousands of birds. The Federal Aviation Administration annually reports at least 2,300 wildlife related strikes involving civil aircraft; the Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps report at least an additional 3,000. Strikes involving military aircraft cause in excess of $75 million in damage every year. Yet only an estimated 20 percent of actual bird strikes are reported. Because pilots and crews use the same low altitude airspace as large concentrations of birds, the prevention of bird strikes is of serious concern to the military. DoD continually implements and improves aviation safety programs in an effort to provide the safest flying conditions possible. One of these programs is the Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) prevention program. Throughout the military, air operations, aviation safety, and natural resources personnel work together to reduce the risk of bird and wildlife strikes through the Operational Risk Management process. Development and implementation of an effective BASH program requires constant interaction between air station’s natural resources, aviation safety, and air operations communities as well as the pilots and aircrews. Habitat modifications and scaring birds away from the runways is an integral part of the answer, but understanding the behavior and movements of birds in relation to the airfield environment and military training routes by pilots and aircrews is also a critical factor in reducing bird strikes.” “Knowing what types of birds and animals are using the airfield environment throughout the year is critical to reducing BASH risks. A Wildlife Hazard Assessment will identify areas of the airfield that are attractive to wildlife and provide recommendations to remove or modify the attractive feature. Corrective recommendations may include removing unused airfield equipment to eliminate perch sites, placing anti-perching devices on equipment to remain, wiring streams and ponds, brush/tree removal, the use of pyrotechnics, or changing the grass mowing program. By identifying the bird species involved and the location of the strike, researchers and airport managers can better understand why the species is attracted to a particular area of the airport or training route. To identify birds involved in strike events, remains of the birds must be collected and turned in for analysis. If the remains are only snarge (blood, bits of tissue, and goo) or feather fragments, these are sent to the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian Feather Identification Lab can do DNA analysis on blood samples as well as microscopic feather analysis. Using a feather bank developed for the military and civilian aviation communities, the Smithsonian Institution can analyze the micro-structure of the barbs from the sample to narrow down a bird involved in a birdstrike event to species. In knowing the species of bird involved in a birdstrike event, managers can investigate the habitat and food habits of the species and begin the process of reducing or eliminating the attractants.” Technology is also advancing BASH risk reduction effectiveness. Radar ornithology uses radar images obtained from the National Weather Service’s WSR-88D Doppler radar or mobile radar units to track migrating birds and important stopover areas. GIS layers of bird radar activity can be layered with actual low level route information along with historic birdstrike data. Some of the tools using radar technology include the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM), Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS), and mobile marine radars that are implemented at the airfield.” So yeah, BASH is not just about telling pilots to watch out because it’s migrations season, it is much more scientific than that and the technology being garnered from it will continue to have a positive impact on both military aircraft and civilian aircraft operational safety.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 25, 2020",This Shot Is an Example of Veterans’ Unique Dedication to Dedication,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This Veterans Day, I want to tell story about an experience that has always stuck in my mind. Back on March 28, 2014, I had heard that a group of USMC AV-8B Harriers from VMA-311 “Tomcats” had landed at Portland International Airport, and they were here to do a flyover at a funeral. Aviation photography is a serious passion of mine , and I wanted to catch these guys going out on their mission, so I hauled out to the airport to catch them leaving. The only problem was the weather wasn’t just the usual rainy muck we see in the Pacific Northwest, it was especially horrible. Sheets of blowing rain were blasting through the area, and at times the ceiling dropped down to just a couple hundred feet, with intermittent mist below that. It was a dark day. I thought there was no way these guys were going to attempt a flyover in this storm. What would be the point? Then the canopies opened up and the ground crews emerged. The division of Harriers sat with their engines running, preparing to taxi. Even air traffic controllers seemed surprised they were going to complete the mission. As they made the long taxi to the end of runway 10L, the storm worsened—the sky was dumping water by the bucket and the cloud deck plummeted. Wind gusting and the rain pouring, I wondered how these guys would even be able to see their targeted flyover point, or each other for that matter, and was just amazed that they were going to attempt the formation. The jets departed, their exhaust nozzles churning up massive clouds of mist that obscured them from view as they muscled into the air. I was soaked to the bone, but I got a few shots. Later that day I had heard that the flyover was for a very special Marine. Staff Sergeant Francis G. Scott, who lived in Oregon City about ten miles south of Portland, was a Silver Star recipient for his actions during the Battle of Tarawa had passed away at 93 years old. Here is the official citation for his Silver Star: “The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Sergeant Francis G. Scott (MCSN: 299979), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving with Battery B, First Battalion, Tenth Marines, SECOND Marine Division, during action against enemy Japanese forces at Tarawa, Gilbert Islands, on 22 November 1943. Discovering an unexploded naval shell in the position assigned his howitzer section and realizing the danger to his entire battery, Sergeant Scott immediately seized the projectile and boldly carried it through the enemy’s shattering machine-gun and rifle fire to an unoccupied area two hundred yards distant. His fearless initiative, prompt action and valiant disregard of his own peril served as an inspiration to all men in his vicinity and reflect the highest credit upon Sergeant Scott and the United States Naval Service. Action Date: November 22, 1943” I also learned that the four-ship of Harriers flew visually, in tight formation, below a ceiling of around 500 feet, down the Willamette Valley, and pulled off what was probably one of the best funeral flyovers ever. The mission was a shining example of courage, not to win a battle but to pay homage to another man who displayed even greater courage in battle. Oorah Marines, Oorah. And a huge thanks to all those who have served our country on this Veterans Day.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2020",Boeing To End 747 Jumbo Jet Production After More Than 50 Years: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing will reportedly stop making 747 Jumbo Jets for good after it completes the last of the 16 aircraft currently on order now. The final 747 is now expected to roll off the line in the next two years or so, after which time the type will have been in production for more than five decades. The impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had across the air travel and aviation industries have only further depressed an already declining market for the iconic plane, which is lovingly nicknamed the “Queen of the Skies.” Bloomberg was first to report the impending closure of the 747 production line on July 2, 2020. Boeing has, so far, declined to confirm or deny that it has made any final decision about the future of the Jumbo Jet. The Chicago-headquartered plane-maker has reportedly not yet informed workers at its plant in Everett, Washington, near Seattle, where the latest version of these aircraft, the 747-8 variant , is assembled, about any upcoming changes. The facility in Everett, which has been responsible for pumping out finished 747s since the end of the 1960s, remains the largest building by volume in the world. “At a build rate of half an airplane per month, the 747-8 program has more than two years of production ahead of it in order to fulfill our current customer commitments,” Boeing told Bloomberg . “We will continue to make the right decisions to keep the production line healthy and meet customer needs.” As it stands now, Boeing has orders for 16 747-8F freighters, including an order for 12 from global logistics firm UPS. The remaining aircraft had been wrapped up in a legal dispute with the Volga-Dnepr Group in Russia. A UPS 747-8F freighter., Melv_L – MACASR via Wikimedia In January, the Russian company had informed Boeing that it might not be able to pay for four 747-8Fs it had ordered, as well as three 777F freighters, ostensibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June, a U.S. court ruled against Volga-Dnepr in its attempt to block the re-sale of those aircraft to other customers. UPS has already agreed to buy one of these aircraft, bringing its total order to 13 aircraft. There had already been growing signs that the 747 production line was nearing its end in recent years. Production had slowed to just one aircraft per month in 2015 and is now proceeding at only half of that rate. In November 2019, Bloomberg also reported that Triumph Group, the largest of Boeing’s Jumbo Jet subcontractors, was auctioning off manufacturing equipment from a plant in Hawthorne, California that makes 747-8 fuselages, signaling a slowing of work at that site. This facility has made the fuselage for every single 747 since PanAm ordered the very first examples in 1966. These initial Jumbo Jets, able to carry large numbers of passengers across long distances for the time, contributed to an already revolutionary moment in air travel spurred on by a host of new jet airliners. Unfortunately, demand for 747-8 models, the only version of the Jumbo Jet still in production, has been dwindling in the past 15 years and airlines around the world have been steadily retiring older 747 models in recent years, too. Boeing hasn’t sold a 747-8i passenger subvariant, the first flight of which took place in 2010, since  the U.S. Air Force bought two to convert into new VC-25B Air Force One presidential aircraft in 2017. These aircraft were not new production, however, having been built originally for the now-defunct Russian airline Transaero . One of two 747-8is destined for conversion into VC-25B Air Force Ones., Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films The prospects for additional sales seem to be increasingly limited. Beyond possible commercial or even private buyers , the only real potential military order would be for a variant to meet the U.S. Air Force’s requirement for an aircraft to replace its existing 747-based E-4B Nightwatch doomsday planes . This would probably be a long shot, though, and it seems more likely that a derivative of a smaller aircraft, such as the 767-based KC-46 Pegasus aerial refueling tanker. All told, Boeing has sold less than 50 747-8is to date. If the 747-8 production run ends after the company fulfills its current orders, it will have produced just over 153 examples, in total, including those configured as freighters. Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst with the Jeffries Financial Group, told Bloomberg that Boeing has lost an estimated $40 million on each 747-8 sold since 2016. Boeing’s experience reflects a general market trend, as well. In 2019, European aviation consortium Airbus announced that it would shutter production of its A380 , the only real direct competitor to the 747, in 2021 due to lack of demand. When that production line shuts down, a total of 251 A380s will have been built, a fraction of the more than 1,550 747s of all models that Boeing has built since the 1960s. An A380 belonging to Emirates, the largest single operator of the type., Maarten Visser via Wikimedia The COVID-19 pandemic, which has decimated the air travel industry and caused a widespread global economic downturn, has only further compounded the situation. The air cargo industry has fared better , but there is still not nearly enough demand there to justify keeping the 747-8F production line going. Boeing’s commercial side has run into a number of other serious issues in the past decade or so unrelated to the 747, as well. This includes difficulties in the development, initial production, and early years of service of its 787 Dreamliner airliners in the late 2000s and early 2010s and, more recently, the massive scandal surrounding the 737 MAX. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), among others, grounded 737 MAXs in 2019 following a series of deadly crashes. The FAA recently concluded a series of re-certification tests on the 737 MAX in cooperation with Boeing, a major step forward toward getting those aircraft back in the air. However, EASA has already said that it will run its own tests to determine whether the aircraft are safe to fly again and Boeing had already lost a large number of sales of the type in the intervening months before the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Shutting down the already increasingly unprofitable 747 line would certainly offer a way to try to defray at least some of the company’s other losses. Boeing could then potentially use that the newly freed-up production space and other associated resources for other purposes. Of course, 747s of various types, including freighters and the future VC-25B Air Force ones, will continue to fly for decades to come after the production of new Jumbo Jets ends. At the same time, the instantly recognizable 747 family has entered into the twilight of its existence. Contact the author: Joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If a band of pirates were to have stolen an F-117 Nighthawk in an alternate dystopian reality, it probably would have looked exactly like YF-117A #781 does above. It’s not every day you see one of America’s most sensitive and exotic combat aircraft stripped of its paint and stealth coatings and rattle-canned with graffiti, but that’s exactly what happen on June 27th, 1991. Just a couple of years after the F-117 was declassified , and just months after its incredible performance during Operation Desert Storm , YF-117 #781 “Scorpion 2” was selected to be retired to the National Museum of the United States Air Force , located at Wright Patterson AFB. At the time, #781 was just ten years old, and had racked up just 437 test flights, but it was a pre-production test aircraft—the second of its kind—and could not be reintroduced into the operational F-117 fleet. Transferring #781 to a museum was a pretty big deal, as no F-117 had ever been put on public display—not to mention the fact that the aircraft was packed with classified systems and coated with some of America’s most sensitive material. Simply flying it to the museum and pulling out some avionics was not in the cards; the “Black Jet” had to be totally stripped and modified inside and out before being rolled out to the public. To remove any trace of the highly classified radar-absorbent material that coated the F-117’s faceted surfaces, the aircraft was “media-blasted.” This is a process similar to sand-blasting, but utilizes sodium bicarbonate crystals instead of sand so that the jet’s bare skin, which is an amalgam of composite and metallic materials, would not be harmed in the process. While media blasting was safe for the jet, it was abhorrent for the crews that had to do it. Everyone involved had to be covered head to toe in protective gear and masks, any open seam sealed with tape. Apparently, the fine particulates got everywhere and into everything—no crevice was too small. It was a nasty, arduous process—and precisely where the “Toxic Death” moniker and skull and crossbones emblazoned on both sides of #781 came from. Since the aircraft was going to be repainted before being put on display anyway, the crews had some fun with their blank canvas. The “Ray Who?” inscription seen painted in red behind the cockpit apparently refers to the name of gregarious flight test engineer that worked with the Baja Scorpions, the Lockheed-USAF integrated test unit that conducted F-117 developmental flight testing during the jet’s infancy at Area 51 . The Baja Scorpion’s insignia and a photo of the first YF-117, which actually flew in a pastel camouflage scheme., … The freshly stripped #781 made its way to Wright Patterson AFB, and once it arrived was gutted of a ton of other sensitive materials, systems, and reusable parts. Many of the jet’s classified avionics, like its air-data computer, the radar-diffusing grids over its intakes, and low-observable (stealthy) screens over its FLIR and DLIR, had to be dealt with. Once picked clean, #781 had to be built back up to look like any operational F-117. Certain frequency selective panels, the jet’s exhaust tiles, tail fins, and other sensitive body parts had to be pulled and replaced with lookalikes. Finally, the project was capped off with the application of the Nighthawk’s signature flat-black paint. It was all a very time-intensive and expensive undertaking. A somewhat “censored” #781 sitting on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force., National Museum of the USAF So that’s the wild tale of the “Toxic Death” F-117, just another facet of the Nighthawk’s wonderfully bizarre history, one that even included a Klingon Cloaking Device and that continues to intrigue to this very day.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 24, 2020",Now the Head Of the USAF Is Jumping On the F-22 Production Re-Start Bandwagon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of us never got over Washington’s abysmal decision to shutter the F-22 production line early , a move that has resulted in an unfairly small Raptor force of just 125 combat-coded jets at any given time. In the past year or so, higher-ups in the USAF’s power structure have conceded that their predecessors blew it by deciding not to build more of the world’s only truly operational fifth-generation fighter . Now, Congress is calling to look into restarting the F-22 production line , and even the USAF’s outgoing head honcho is jumping on the F-22 production re-start bandwagon. General Mark Welsh stated the following at an Air Force Association event today: “I don’t think it’s a wild idea, I mean the success of the F-22 and the capability of the airplane and the crews that fly it are pretty exceptional. I think it’s proven that the airplane is exactly what everybody hoped it would be… We’re using it in new and different ways and it’s been spectacularly successful and its potential is really, really remarkable. And so going back and looking and certainly raising the idea: Well, could you build more? It’s not a crazy idea.” Lockheed Martin Within the Pentagon, the subject of building more Raptors has been taboo for the better part of a decade, after the Defense Department circled the wagons around the F-35 program in the late 2000s. Pursuing anything that could compete with the F-35’s existence was seen as heresy. The conversation around ending F-22 production was an especially prominent pain-point between Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Mosley and Air Force Secretary Michael Wayne. Mosley and Wayne were eventually ousted at least partially because they opposed Gates’s push to end production of the Raptor at just 187 production examples, a move tacity supported by the Bush Adminstration and fully endorsed by the Obama Administration. Lockheed Martin Now, close to a decade later, it is clear this decision was a monumental mistake, as the F-35 program continues to flounder and its air-to-air combat deficiencies become clearer . Meanwhile, the now combat-proven F-22 has risen to prominence as one of America’s most valued and high-demand foreign policy tools . Even with the momentum building in Washington to hatch new Raptors, and as the USAF completes a congressionally mandated study into how much a restart of the F-22 line would cost, don’t get your hopes up. The Air Force is already scrambling for budget to pay for the fighter fleet it plans for the future , with funding diving into the red as early as 2021. More F-22s would come at the expense of outrageously pricey F-35 program. Even if the USAF is changing its tune when it comes to procuring more F-22s, it would likely mean a drop in the USAF’s F-35A total buy of 1,763 jets. The manufacturer of both aircraft, Lockheed Martin, says that the move would lead to higher F-35 unit costs and could send the program into a death spiral. (And no, Lockheed doesn’t win either way just because they build both jets.) The F-35 represents the largest defense acquisition in history, one that will provide massive amounts of cash flow well into the latter half of the 21st century. By comparison, producing a couple hundred more F-22s is a drop in the revenue, even if a highly upgraded version of the jet was pursued. The “ built in 46 states ” F-35 isn’t the only program that stands in the way of an F-22 production line re-start. Other big-ticket priorities like the B-21 bomber stand in its way . Even a pipe-dream sixth-generation fighter is on the USAF’s fiscally unsustainable wishlist, which is an even harder sell when you are pumping out upgraded F-22s. USAF It is also notable that Welsh is making this statement as he exits his jobs as the chief of the USAF. What really matters is what his successor, General David Goldfein, thinks. So far he is saying the right things about other key USAF weapon systems, like the highly relevant A-10, a plane Goldfein sees as highly valuable in the fight against ISIS, stating the following to the Military Times : “When we made decisions on retiring the A-10, we made those decisions prior to ISIL. We were not in Iraq, we were coming out of Afghanistan to a large extent. We didn’t have a resurgent Russia at the time frame that we were talking about retiring the A-10, and so when the assumptions change and they don’t pan out, we’ve got to be agile enough to adjust.” Maybe Goldfein, who has time in F-16s, F-117s and a smattering of other aircraft including unmanned systems, will put this more “agile” mindset to work by pushing for more F-22s. But still , even for a guy that was shot down behind enemy lines over Serbia , it may be too ominous a battle to fight. Contact the author at tyler@thedrive.com .

A finite amount of Presidential limousines exist, with between 16 and 20 being an estimate. Careful planning and a logistical symphony has to take place in order to pre-position the most capable (and usually newest) vehicles based on the threat level and operating environment at each destination. It is not uncommon of for the President to visit three separate cities during a single day, especially during campaign season. That means three separate motorcade detachments need to be forward deployed to those cities. This is done via USAF heavy-transports such as C-17s, or on some occasions, a single C-5 Galaxy. A pair of Presidential Limos are loaded onto a C-17 Globemaster III., USAF In addition to the Presidential Motorcade being forward deployed to where the President is heading, it is now usually customary to deploy a pair of Presidential Airlift helicopters to the destination regardless of if they are used or not. These could be either a pair of “Marine One” VH-3D Sea Kings or VH-60N Black Hawks belonging to Marine Helicopter Squadron 1, otherwise known as HMX-1 . The unit is located along the Potomac River in Quantico, Virginia. Like the motorcade, these choppers usually arrive via USAF heavy transport and they are often not seen outside of a local orientation and maintenance check flight that occurs days before the President arrives Marine One VH-3D and support MV-22s, all belonging to HMX-1, as well as the “The Beast,” seen during a Presidential visit to Manhattan. , Reuters Their main mission is to offer the White House and the Secret Service a contingency presidential transport solution in an any number of types of emergency or special circumstance. Multiple USAF heavy transports are required to facilitate a single presidential visit, and those flights come at a steep cost. “The Beast” rolls across the apron with C-5 Galaxy transports in the background., AP The Presidential Motorcade consists of a wide variety of vehicles. The exact configuration changes depending on the mission and the assets at hand, but the basic layout diagrammed in this story is fairly customary. Sometimes extra cars are added in different positions, and just because the Presidential limousines are in motion, the President isn’t necessarily inside one of them. The protective detail of the Secret Service are masters of what they do, and they know how to optimize their capabilities against a potential enemy’s weaknesses and strengths. Generally the Presidential Motorcade is made up of the following components: The key components of the Presidential Motorcade. , The Drive Route Car & Pilot Car The Route Car runs minutes ahead of the Presidential Motorcade, presumably checking the route and providing guidance for inbound “sweepers” [see below] while also providing intelligence to the entire motorcade. The Pilot Car does the same but runs a minute or even just seconds in front of the motorcade. It may be accompanied by motorcycle police to cut off key intersections and highway overpasses. Sweepers These are usually throngs of police on motorcycles and in patrol cars as part of a Presidential Motorcade. They deploy in front of the motorcade, clearing the way so that the motorcade’s speed can remain as consistent. Lead Car The lead of the core of the Presidential Motorcade formation. It works as a guide and a buffer for what lies ahead. It can be a Secret Service Suburban, a local marked police car, or really any car the Secret Service chooses—such as the BMW pictured. A BMW lead car with the Presidential Limo in tow makes its way through tight streets in the UK., AP Presidential Limousine: Code Name “Stagecoach” or “Spare” The Presidential limousine rides at the very center of the motorcade “package.” What appears to be a very heavy Cadillac is really an extremely survivable and luxurious armored car. “The Beast” as latest addition to Presidential limo history is known, is outfitted with a plethora of unique capabilities and countermeasures, each one aimed at keeping the President safe and allowing him to rapidly evade danger during an attack, whether direct (ambush) or indirect (gassing a city, etc).

Other rumored features include infrared smoke-screen and oil slick deployment capability, as well as tear gas dispensers, and, frankly, just about anything you or Tom Clancy can think of. All of this is in addition to a state-of-the-art communications connectivity system, including internet and secure telephone communications. “ The Beast” at the Capital steps.

For all its obvious benefits, this cool-looking Presidential hauler has its detractors . The limousine is more of an armored assault truck than a car, yet it does not benefit from an assault truck’s ground clearance. It can be tricky to maneuver on tight city streets , is said to be extremely heavy, and has broken down while on high-profile missions . To be fair, the older model was not immune to breaking down either. A secret service agent dusts off The Beast while on a mission. , AP There are a finite number of these new “Beast” cars and oftentimes the President will be seen riding in a 2005 Cadillac DTS inspired Presidential limousine, or even one of the Secret Service’s up-armored Suburbans that are regularly used to move the Vice President and other VVIPs around. One of the Secret Service’s armored Suburbans., AP In fact, when traveling overseas to especially dangerous locales with questionable road conditions, armored Suburbans can make up almost the entire Presidential Motorcade.

Obama heads to Camp Victory in Baghdad., White House The ‘Stagecoach,’ the name for whatever car the President is in, is the whole focus of Presidential Motorcade. Everything is centered on making sure that car makes it to its destination. In addition to ‘Stagecoach,’ at least one identical car always accompanies it, and sometimes many more. These cars, known as ‘Spares,’ are used as a backup and blocking vehicle should POTUS’s vehicle have a mechanical issue or is attacked, as well a serving as decoys. While the motorcade is in motion, highly trained Secret Service drivers execute a classic roving ‘shell game,’ weaving Stagecoach and Spare, or Spares, in and out among each other so that a would-be attacker would have a tough time picking the car actually containing the President. The Presidential limousines even have identical plates. A pair of “Beasts” act as Stagecoach and Spare. , AP The Secret Service agents that drive the Presidential limousines are among the best and most trusted personnel in the institution. They go through constant drills at the Secret Service’s sprawling James J.

In some configurations, it may also work at detecting incoming projectiles and small unmanned aircraft via short-wave radar. This vehicle, along with others in the motorcade, may also provide laser warning (used by some anti-tank guided missiles) and radar warning for the convoy. If a threat is detected, such as one using a laser for designation and ranging, or if a threat radar were detected, IR smoke, chaff and targeted jamming could be deployed, disrupting such an attack. Electronics countermeasure vehicle with its unique profile. , Paul Carter Counter-improvised explosive device (IED) and communications selective and barrage jamming technology have come a long way after almost a decade and half of counter-insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. During the height of both wars, remotely detonated IEDs were the leading cause of casualties among deployed forces. Systems such as the CREW Duke have likely saved hundreds, if not thousands of lives overseas. Even more advanced technology has been deployed across Afghanistan and Iraq on MRAPs, APCs and armored cars during the latter half of the last decade, much of which is also likely deployed on this life-saving support vehicle. Control Vehicle & Support Vehicles Support Vehicles usually transport high-value staff, such as parts of the President’s cabinet and their security detail, as well as additional security personnel and the President’s doctor. The Control Vehicle carries a top military aid with the highest level of clearance, who would assist the Commander-in-Chief during a major military incident, giving operational guidance, and if need be, activating the Nuclear Football . These vehicles are usually modified SUVs, such as Chevrolet Suburbans with enhanced communications and low-profile police lighting, or rented vans. The Presidential Motorcade makes its way through traffic on a rain-soaked highway. , AP Counter Assault Team Vehicles: Nicknamed “Hawkeye Renegade” These vehicles are also usually black Suburbans or some other large SUV, with police lights, rails and running boards for external transport of agents, and they always have their rear gates ajar with a heavily armed and armored commando hanging out of the back, assault rifle at the ready. The Secret Service’s Counter Assault Team, known as the ‘CAT,’ gives the Presidential Motorcade its heavy hitting combat punch. These elite Secret Service operators, selected from a tiny fraction of those who apply, carry state-of-the-art arms, including assault rifles, night vision goggles, expendables like flash bangs and concussion grenades, and sometimes heavy body armor. The heavily-armed CAT riding in one of the motorcade’s Suburbans. , AP The CAT is the direct action unit that rapidly counter-attacks if the convoy is ambushed, or it sets up a defensive buffer if the convoy were about to be attacked. Meanwhile, the President’s Security Detail would work to rapidly evacuate the President from the scene. Imagine an advancing, overwhelming, wall-like onslaught of suppressive fire and you get the picture of what these highly trained operators are all about. If they can’t vanquish a threat as it emerges or immediately extinguish an attack as it is initiated, they buy the President’s security detail time and space.

Hazard Materials Mitigation Unit This black work truck carries sensors to detect, and gear to respond to, nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) weapons attacks that threaten the Motorcade. It also works as a roving storage vehicle, carrying supplies and other classified capabilities. The HAZMAT Mitigation Unit on the roll. , Paul Carter Press Vans These vehicles are usually large vans that carry the White House Press Corps in the motorcade. Obviously, this space is reserved for major news outlets and the White House media team. This includes a camera, wire and general press vans. The White House Communications Agency Vehicle: Code Name “Roadrunner” Roadrunner, also known as the Mobile Command and Control Vehicle, is one of the most conspicuous vehicles in Motorcade. A beefed-up Suburban, it houses a large satellite communications array and posts an antenna farm along its roof-line. White House Communivation Agency vehicle code named Road Runner. , Paul Carter This vehicle keeps the President and White House officials securely connected to the world, providing encrypted voice, internet and video communications via the Pentagon’s constellation of hardened communications satellites. This vehicle may also be able to handle communications for nuclear arms release. Roadrunner also helps facilitate secure communications within the Motorcade itself. Think of it as a big rolling data encryption center, wifi hotspot, radio repeater and doomsday communications control center. Ambulance An ambulance is a constant feature at the rear of the Presidential Motorcade. It is there to treat injuries that may occur following an attack, a wreck or an unexpected biological event. This resource is primarily reserved for the President. An ambulance is always in tow. , Paul Carter Rear Guard This is usually a phalanx of local police vehicles, such as motorcycles and marked patrol cars. Their job is to provide early warning and a defensive buffer for the rear of the motorcade. A brace of police motorcycle officers makes up the Rear Guard., AP Overwatch When the President travels, the Secret Service gets access to a Department of Homeland Security helicopter that provides intelligence, planning and over-watch for presidential movements.

Obama waving from the entry of Ground Force One. , AP So there you have it: the real anatomy of the Presidential Motorcade. On a personal note, I have had the pleasure to see the whole motorcade, Air Force One, Marine One, Secret Service ballet multiple times with my own eyes. It is an absolutely amazing spectacle to watch. The incredible focus and professionalism of everyone involved, and the way they balance time and risk, is mind boggling. When you think of the term ‘well-oiled machine,’ this is the picture that should pop into your head. There is an absolutely astonishing amount of moving parts that go into each and every Presidential movement. The Presidential Motorcade touring Jordan’s historical sites. , White House The times I’ve had the privilege to watch Air Force One’s arrival and departure, the motorcade moved into formation almost magically, zooming up to the President at the exact moment and speeding triumphantly across the tarmac in a wheel-like formation when he returned. Once stopped at the steps of Air Force One—just as its jet engines were spooling up—the President got out of his limousine, ran up the stairs and waved goodbye, the cabin door shutting after he entered. At that exact moment, the iconic 747 was rolling down the apron. Meanwhile the motorcade was ripping off back across the tarmac to prepare for transport. It is a single fluid and perfectly-timed set of movements. I had never seen anything like it in my life and it plays far different in person than on television. What I took away from these experiences, including observing the throngs of sharp shooters and heavily armed men and women staring at virtually everything behind tinted sunglasses, is this is not only a critical mission, but it is also an art form and a showcase of what we are capable of as a nation. The Presidential Motorcade speeds across the tarmac after leaving Air Force One., AP I have seen this in the military before—to varying degrees, and especially in top tier units, where it is not just about schedules or procedures, but also about nailing it exactly the same way every time and making it look easy. Of course, it’s anything but easy, and the Secret Service has to get it right every time. All the technology that goes into protecting the President is amazing, and frankly, so is the price tag. But there is a reason why this incredible traveling show, perhaps the most expensive in the world, rarely makes news beyond the objective of the mission itself. That is because the people orchestrating it are absolutely the best at what they do and they go about their business knowing that the world is watching. The Presidential Motorcade moves along Highway 101. , AP Sure there have been recent controversies , but the White House arm of the Secret Service is a national treasure. They have a mind blowingly difficult job and they deserve much more recognition than they will ever receive. The fact that the most powerful and targeted man on earth can drive around where he wants to go on a regular basis, and it all seems normal and uneventful, is just a reminder of that.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 18, 2020",Could the F-35 Become the Biggest Electronic Intelligence Collection System Ever Devised?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Much ado has been made over the F-35’s Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) backend cyber support infrastructure. It’s supposed to do everything from controlling the F-35’s worldwide parts supply chain to mission planning and debriefing. This system, among the F-35’s most troubled components , could be viewed as the jet’s cyberspace Achilles’ heel. Alternatively, it could be a huge asset, when you consider the potential it holds for electronic intelligence gathering on an unprecedented scale. When it comes to aerial combat, mission planning is as vital to success as executing the mission itself. For stealthy aircraft weaving their way between enemy radar installations, planning is even more crucial with a “Blue Line” route being carefully devised to make the most of the jet’s low-observable features. To build this path, up-to-date intelligence on the enemy’s electronic order of battle is needed, essentially a detailed map of their air defense system with enemy weapons engagement envelopes extrapolated over the top. This data is classically collected by strategic assets, but the F-35 fleet itself may become the most prolific purveyor of this critical information. One of the central features that makes the F-35 survivable even against high-threat enemies is its ability to suck up electronic signals from radars and air defense nodes, and to quickly classify them, geolocation them, and display them for the aircraft’s pilot. This capability makes that traditionally fixed “Blue Line” a flexible one during combat.  With F-35 users’ mission information being loaded into ALIS then downloaded after every sortie, the electronic intelligence the jet soaks up during its time in the air could be mined and exploited by the U.S., as well as partner nations, to some degree. JSF program The F-35 gathers this info via a series of passive antennas embedded in the F-35’s edges that feed signals information to the jet’s computers. Using interferometry , the slight time delay between when a signal hits one antenna compared to another, azimuth and range can be defined and target-quality coordinates on where the threatening radio frequency emission is coming from can be devised. This system is known as the F-35’s Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) suites. These are tied into a broader set of features that also make up the jet’s electronic warfare capabilities. A group of F-35s can share this information seamlessly via their daisy chain-like directional, low-probability of intercept proprietary Multi-Function Data-Link (MADL) . The Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) that the F-35 soaks up allows F-35 pilots to see these “threat rings” in real time and they can choose to avoid, engage, or electronically attack the source of those threat rings depending on where they and their fellow F-35s are located and what their mission is at hand. Lockheed The F-35 is not the only fighter-sized intelligence “sponge” around. Far from it, in fact. When it comes to fighters, the F-22’s ALR-94 Electronic Service Measures (ESM) suite is also capable of collecting and displaying this information, as are aircraft like the Eurofighter Typhoon, or the F-16CG to a certain extent. The difference is that the F-35 represents the latest iteration of this capability and will be operated all over the world by various air forces simultaneously, all dumping huge amounts of data into ALIS. The F-35’s high level of electronic battlefield situational awareness, paired with ALIS, could theoretically build a worldwide battle database organically, one that is god-like in its breadth and timeliness. Although this may be a latent capability now, reconnaissance has always been a mission element of the F-35 program, and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) collection could rapidly become much more of a primary mission for the F-35 as the program, and ALIS, evolves. F-35s around the globe could be employed as mini- RC-135 Rivet Joints during peace time, prowling near (or perhaps in) enemy territory and classifying, recording, and geolocating all types of radar and integrated air defense communications signals and positions. All this information can then be uploaded into ALIS’s master memory bank. Think of it as “distributed” electronic surveillance, whereby individual nations can use their F-35s to fly reconnaissance missions regularly, adding to the electronic order of battle “picture” worldwide in near real time. Such a strategy would disperse the ELINT capture mission from a traditional platform specific strategy — where lumbering aircraft like RC-135 Rivet Joints, EP-3E Aeries RQ-4 Global Hawk, U-2 Dragon Lady and P-8 Poseidons are heavily tasked with trying to keep tabs on potential enemy defenses — to one that leverages the F-35’s wide distribution around the globe. One that can alleviate demand on these strategic assets via the constant regional collection of tactical intelligence of a similar nature. RC-135 Rivet Joint, USAF Taking pressure off these low-density/high-demand strategic electronic intelligence collecting assets, only owned by a handful of nations, will allow them to focus on key hotspots, some of which are only easily accessed by long-range aircraft. They can also continue to provide unique and very high-end surveillance that the F-35 cannot. This functionality also lends merit to ship-borne F-35 operating concepts, especially the F-35B, deployable on smaller amphibious aircraft carriers which are accessible financially to F-35 customer nations. The massive leap in capabilities the F-35B offers America’s “Gator Navy” is already known. Being able to position the F-35B off the coast of a potential foe allows the jet to collect ELINT without being heavily restricted by its tactical fighter-sized endurance or relying on expensive and complex tanker support. Additionally, forward deploying the F-35B to small islands with runways adapted for F-35B operations advances the jet’s ELINT reach without the need for a carrier. Even the F-35’s stealth capabilities are enticing for the ELINT mission. In stealth mode, it can provide surveillance on the enemy’s electronic order of battle when their integrated air defense system is at rest. It can fly that same mission again with radar reflectors attached, stimulating a working air defense network and tracking how it reacts to a “visitor,” noting weak spots and vulnerabilities in coverage. An RC-135 or RQ-4 cannot do this. F-35B operations. , Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images The ELINT data F-35s collect could be processed centrally and parts of it made available to certain users, either regionally or nationally. This is adventageous because having an up-to-date electronic order of battle on a wide array of potential threats over vast geographical distances has always been an expensive and challenging task. A worldwide F-35 force could change this reality and give the F-35 a more prominent peacetime reconnaissance mission. It would allow far greater coverage capacity than what dedicated SIGINT/ELINT aircraft can provide today.  In particular, it would vastly expand the Pentagon’s Signals Intelligence and Electronic Intelligence spying umbrella in an organic nature, at little cost. https://youtube.com/watch?v=WU30FmfyfIw It’s still unknown exactly how ALIS will process all this data, and who will have access to it, but it’s possible to envision alliances like NATO countries having access to their own ALIS backend of air defense threats in their region. Missions could be flown by F-35s for just the purposes of keeping the database current. The transfer of the F-35 data post-mission, th uploading to the ALIS cloud, and exactly who gets to exploit which parts of that data is already an issue . On the very topic of that conundrum, USAF Colonel Max Marosko, deputy director of air and cyberspace operations for Pacific Air Forces, told Flightglobal.com: “Given an example of Brit F-35s in one lane and US F35s in another lane, if our databases aren’t synchronized, you’re going to end up with conflicting identification using, which could delay employment and put the force at more risk… We can ensure we’re all on the same playing field and we don’t have any identification problems that could most likely lead to a lack of shooting and putting the pilots at more risk. That’s an important thing to consider.” Yet using ALIS to capture intelligence during times of peace, to prepare for possible times of war seems also highly relevant. This is especially true for potential peer-state conflicts that could encompass large portions of continents, not just those involving small third-world countries. USMC It’ll be interesting to see ALIS evolve and the myriad of ways its heaps of data can be leveraged in the future. The biggest question is whether it will be done transparently or clandestinely? Yes, enemy air defense capabilities could be monitored on a grand scale, but so could the tactics and capabilities of actual F-35 operators and anyone they train with. Theoretically, that information will all be dumped into ALIS’s big brain after every mission. Israel, for example, has opted to employ their F-35s without a high-degree of dependence on ALIS . Time will tell if this will be standard operating procedure or merely a fallback should ALIS’s security be breached, something that is a real possibility . Israel, who holds its air combat playbook very close to its chest, may see using ALIS as risking to much to foreign eyes, even if those eyes are friendly. Israel’s F-35s themselves will be loaded with Israeli specific combat systems that will diverge from the F-35A’s baseline configuration and capabilities. Showing the capabilities of these indigenous modifications, what they can detect and how they can neutralize electronic threats, may expose more than the IAF wants. Even data detailing how Israel operates existing fighters alongside the F-35 could be a liability. As such, ALIS may either run in a tailored nature for the IAF, or none at all. And therein lies the double-edged sword that is ALIS. While it can greatly enhance F-35 operations, the information it collects could be processed into a potent weapon of its own. On the flip side, the more a force relies on it, the less operational sovereignty and confidentiality they will have. Still, the F-35 acting as a conduit for a global ELINT and other air combat-related intelligence network is incredibly enticing. For individuals with access to that information, it would make the F-35 program, and the jet itself, more valuable than what’s offered at face value. That is not to say a similar system could not be applied (or may already be applied) to high-end unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) and a common operating system that controls and supports them. The primary “eyes” of these autonomous unmanned aircraft are the electronic environment around them, and their ability to act as a collective swarm hinges on the quality of this real-time ELINT data. When not waging war, they would be more inclined to provide reconnaissance using their innate abilities to detect the enemy’s electronic order of battle and their superior endurance when compared to manned fighters. Lockheed’s Sea Ghost UCAV concept derived from the RQ-170 Sentinel., Lockheed For better or worse, while the U.S. is not selling a multinational, UCAV program, they are selling the F-35. That is not to say that one day ALIS’s potentially panoptic electronic order of battle data collection capabilities could not be leveraged by a UCAV swarm’s hive mind. It is also possible that the reverse could be true and the F-35 could benefit from the UCAV’s dynamic threat picture. Lockheed could very well adapt ALIS, or at least portions of it, for the unmanned realm of aerial warfare. In fact, such a plan is likely already be in the works now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",The Revolutionary War Gave Birth To The Age Of Naval Mine Warfare,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sea mines are among the most widespread, deadliest and strategically effective anti-access/area-denial weapons available today. A huge selection of sea mine types can be deployed by submarines, ships or aircraft—from simple floating contact mines to smart “influence mines” that lay in wait until a target’s pre-programmed signature triggers their attack. Yet 239 years ago, it was a group of break-away colonists fighting for their independence from the British Crown who put the modern idea of a sea mine to work for the first time. David Bushnell, the same Yale graduate and secretive naval weapons inventor who built the first attack submarine, the Turtle, also designed and built the first modern naval mines for a not-quite-yet United States. Very crude naval mine-like devices were designed by Chinese warlords hundreds of years before the Revolutionary War. They used ox bladders as dry bags and pig intestines as snorkels, as well as very crude timed or manual cable fuses, each with questionable success. Centuries past before Bushnell used his naval explosives knowledge to come up with a totally different trigger mechanism, one that was fired when the mine struck an object, making the naval mine concept much more relevant and deadly. Bushnell’s contact-triggering “keg” mine was made up of a fairly simple watertight wooden keg filled with gunpowder and attached to a float. The idea was to float the mines, also called torpedoes at the time, with the prevailing current towards enemy warships docked or anchored in a channel. Once the mine came in contact with something solid the flintlock fuse would be punched, then the keg would detonate. On August 13, 1777, Bushnell and his team attempted to use his contact-trigger mines for the first time, deploying two of them in an attempt to sink the sixth-rate British frigate the HMS Cerberus anchored in Black Point Bay, just west of New London. Bushnell guided a small whaling boat in the darkness up toward the frigate and released two mines in tow far apart in hopes one would ride the current accurately to the hull of the Cerberus . One of the two mines floated right on course toward the Cerberus when it was snared by a schooner that was anchored between Bushnell’s release point and the targeted frigate. The curious British sailors aboard the schooner hoisted the weapon aboard when it detonated, killing three sailors, severely injuring another and sinking the schooner. The HMS Cerberus remained unharmed. Although the mission was not a total success, it was the first time a ship had been sunk by a modern contact mine and the event caused the HMS Cerberus , which had been prowling the waters off of Connecticut, to redeploy immediately to Newport so the Captain could warn his Royal Navy superiors of the new weapon he’d encountered. Bushnell tried again four months later, this time unleashing 20 slightly improved mines on the Delaware River, near Bordentown, New Jersey. The plan was to float the mines down the river and sink British ships anchored in Philadelphia harbor. Although none of the keg mines hit a large British vessel, a small boat was struck, killing a couple of young boys. Still, the massive blast freaked out British naval commanders so much that they ordered pretty much anything floating in the water to be shot from a distance. For over a day the British waged a full-out war on Bushnell’s mines and everything else floating on the Delaware River. An engraving depicting an artist’s impression of the Battle of the Kegs., Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images The event was immortalized a month later in the rousing propaganda ballad, “The Battle of the Kegs.” Although George Washington had been very supportive of Bushnell’s secret maritime super-weapons, this was the last time mines were used during the revolutionary war. Yet the technology would become a staple of warfare in the decades and centuries that followed . In fact, when Admiral David Farragut coined the phrase “damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!” at the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War , he was actually referring to naval mines—many of which were very similar to Bushnell’s Keg invented nearly a century earlier during America’s fight for independence.

After giving us an amazing inside look at flying the F-15E Strike Eagle and how its presence in Saudi Arabia has evolved, Richard Crandall is back. This time he paints an awesomely in-depth picture of what it was like strapping into the cockpit of the legendary F-111 Aardvark during the tumultuous final decade of the Cold War. Joining the F-111 family I asked for F-15s, F-16s, F-4s, F-111s, or A-10s on my dream sheet. I then called to change the order to put A-10s over F-111s. The assignment guy at Randolph told me not to worry about it, as a classmate had put F-111s first. In fact, his father had died flying the F-111 in Vietnam. Took off and was never heard from again. He got the F-111. Well, we both got F-111s and I got the second. I was not thrilled but I sucked it up and got to it. I went to Holloman AFB for Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) in the T-38B Talon. I loved the training! I loved the air-to-air sorties and did okay at it. Sadly, the F-111 was lousy at air-to-air. It had way too high a wing loading, poor visibility, and huge energy bleed-off when turning. It was almost impossible to get above 5 g’s in it, and when you did you had just lost about 200-plus knots in the break turn. Oh well. From Holloman I went to Cannon AFB to fly the F-111D model. The F-111A model first went to Vietnam in 1968 but was withdrawn quickly after three crashes. It returned in 1972 and was very successful. It was named “Whispering Death” by the North Vietnamese. Most of the U.S. pilots called it the “Vark,” short for its name, “Aardvark.” The Aussies called it “Pig,” which was fitting, as its air-to-air maneuverability was that of a fat pig. F-111 over the desert., USAF The A model had an all-analog cockpit. The Weapon System Officer (WSO) had to twist dials to change the latitude and longitude to the next coordinate. The pilot would turn to the next heading and hack a watch (or use a running time) while the WSO would change the inertial navigation system (INS) coordinates and then make sure the computed heading/time agreed with the dead reckoning time. All F-111 pilots lived by their stopwatch. You could not fly without it, as the INS died young. The F-111B model for the Navy was cancelled. Too big, too heavy, and not maneuverable. They got the Tomcat instead. Face it: Tom Cruise in an F-111 just wouldn’t have hacked it for a movie. The Tomcat was a good choice on their part. The F-111C was for the Aussies. It was an F-111A with three-foot longer wings on each side for better range. Strategic Air Command used the same long wings in the FB-111. It had slightly less allowed g loading, but that wasn’t a big deal as we didn’t pull a lot of g’s very often. The F-111D model was radical. It had a glass cockpit . This included a multi-function monochrome TV for the pilot and a much bigger one for the WSO. It also had digital computers with a tape to pre-load a planned route. It was a paper tape with holes in it, on a reel—no kidding—but it worked, eventually. The D model had two terrain following radars (TFRs) built by Texas Instruments, just like all the other F-111’s, but it could use the transmitter/receiver from one TFR to power the attack radar up to a range of 20nm. We used that feature a lot and it was a great benefit, as the attack radar often failed. It also had a great Doppler navigation system tied into the INS. This was awesome for overwater flight to keep the INS on track. This was a very difficult system to maintain, and eventually it was canned. It also had a moving map, which was great, but of course that, too, was difficult to maintain, and eventually canned in the ’80s. The truth is that the D model didn’t work. They parked every single one of them in Fort Worth for several years as they worked to fix the bugs. Meanwhile, they built the F-111E, which was basically an F-111A with bigger air inlets. It was all analog, just like the A model, but It worked. They then built the F model, which was the Cadillac of the F-111 force. It had huge engines and could even go slightly better than one-to-one thrust-to-weight ratio when almost dry and without stores. It was fast and digital, but not as integrated and as fancy as the D model. No multi-function displays, but it did have digital computers. Eventually, they put the Pave Tack laser targeting system into the F-111F and it carried it internally, which was much better and had less drag than on the F-4, where it was called “Pave Drag.” The F model was most famous for the raid on Gaddafi. An F-111 cockpit at night., USAF Really low and really fast The F-111 worked in Vietnam because it flew really low and was really fast. It could fly down to 200 feet AGL (above ground level) using terrain following radar in all but the heaviest rain. As long as the TFR could see the difference between the weather and the ground, it could fly safely. The Vietnamese would barely hear it coming as it was pushing the mach and was really low, hence the nickname. That tactic, low and fast, became THE doctrine until the third night of Desert Storm. The phrases “speed is life,” “one pass, haul ass,” and “you do more than one pass in a target area you die” all came from Vietnam. The radar was the best in the fighter world at the time. An F-111 WSO would use the great real beam map from the radar to update the INS and navigate, but also clear the terrain ahead of the jet. If an aircraft is below a mountain peak the shadow behind the peak diverges; if an airplane is above a peak the shadow converges. Thus, the WSO would clear out to much farther range than the pilot could see on his display. The pilot had a logarithmic presentation of the ground that was weird: level ground would start high on the far right at the greatest range displayed, and then curve down and left in a sort of parabolic curve. The first half of the scope, from left to the center, was one mile. The next half of the scope, from the center to three quarters, was another mile. Then, from three quarters to seven eighths of the display was another mile, from seven eighths to fifteen sixteenths was another mile, until finally hitting ten miles at the far right edge of the display. Thus, the pilot could see terrain fairly clearly from the nose to about three miles or so. After that it all tended to blend in. The terrain following radar was tied into the autopilot, or you could get a manual steering bar and hand-fly it. We used the auto pilot most often, as when chasing the needles (steering cues) we would tend to get focused only on the needles and would not be cross-checking our other instruments as well as when we monitored the system with the autopilot flying it. It was just safer to use the autopilot, as I was able to have a lot more situational awareness of what was going on. I learned to do manual TFR without the TFR computer working, which is called raw data TFR. I was comfortable going down to around 500 feet doing that, although I only practiced the technique during the day in Visual Flight Rules conditions, as it was truly a no-kidding, combat-emergency-only technique During normal operations the WSO would call the terrain down until the pilot called he had the terrain and then the WSO would listen as the pilot would verbalize the climb for the terrain, when they were clear of it, and then “painting out to xxxx miles.” The WSO would then call the next terrain in. So you always had two people cross-checking terrain using two independent systems. It was pretty safe, actually. The lights in the cockpit were pretty bright. We had no forward-looking infrared picture at all. The F model did have the Pave Tack pod for the WSO to target with, but that wasn’t used to see the terrain normally. The pilot had no way to see the Pave Tack video in the F model. Sometimes we would be flying low through the mountains of New Mexico or southwest Texas and the jet’s external rotating beacon would flash off the terrain that we were flying by and it would seem to be right next to the wingtip. Some aircrew would turn it off as it unnerved them. The F-111D’s APQ-130 main radar and terrain following radar suite. , USAF In the D model, the pilot could get distracted and see the radar, since it was a flat screen with no hood around it. That was not good to do though. The pilot needed to stay focused on the TFR and not sight-see on the radar scope. A quick story about distractions in the cockpit, especially in the two-man side-by-side cockpit of the F-111: When I went through training at Cannon AFB my instructor pilot was Fernando Ribas, the pilot who died during Operation Eldorado Canyon (the raid on Libya) along with Paul Lawrence, a great WSO I flew with several times at RAF Lakenheath in the F model. On one instruction flight, our aircraft had a failure on the multi-Function Display. Fernando—remember, he was a pilot, so think dog-watching-TV here—had to press four buttons and hold them in to get a radar sweep in Narrow Sector Expand. This was the best mode to use for air-to-ground targeting. He had to use both hands to do this. We were at 1,000 feet and were cleared hot at the Melrose Bomb Range located about 25 miles West of Cannon AFB as the crow flies. When he tried to move the cursor using the goat turd (the cursor control looked like a goat turd and worked on pressure) there was no physical motion and he would lose the radar picture. He wasn’t going to give up. It was fascinating to watch: he would get a picture holding the buttons in, then release it and move the cursor, then push the buttons again. Amazingly, he found the target and had it nailed! Time ran down and we get a “no spot” call from the Range Control Officer. Yep, I forgot to pickle (hit the trigger to release the weapon)—I was having so much fun watching him that I didn’t do my job. Fernando was from Puerto Rico and had a strong accent. I had taken Spanish in high school and I grew up in a town that was at least 30 percent Mexican-American and had lots of friends and coworkers who spoke Spanish. That night I heard words that I never before heard in my life. If we would not have been on auto pilot we would have died as I shrunk down to about two inches high in shame. This taught me a lesson, though. Keep your mind on the job and don’t sight-see. F-111 carrying laser guided bombs with the Pave Tack systems seen along the jet’s belly., USAF Bombs, bombs, and more bombs. The WSO was far more important for mission accomplishment in the F-111 than in any other aircraft. We were the night fighter for the USAF. When everyone else was grounded for weather, we flew. No illumination flares needed, just get the radar working and away we go. TFR breaks? Who cares. We had minimum en route altitudes planned for each leg and routinely flew nighttime low levels in the mountains, using them as our TFRs broke a lot. As long as the Attack Radar had a picture, we would find the target. Our inertial navigation system was nice, but we trained to use dead reckoning and basic radar scope interpretation to get to the target even without the INS. We had backups to the backups to the backup. INS dead? Build a wind model and use the computers without the INS. That doesn’t work? Use a radar timed release based on a fixed angle offset. We practiced them all and got good at them all. We also carried a ton of bombs. My favorite was laser guided bombs (LGBs), of course, but those were only in the F model. The D model could do them and I practiced a couple of times with an F-4 buddy-lasing the target, and did a bunch with troops using ground-based lasers. Still, my favorite was really the ballutes . USAF F-111 dropping 500lb Mk82 bombs with ballute retard kits. , USAF The MK-82 snake eyes used in Vietnam tended to fail if released above 450 knots. We didn’t like to be below 480 knots. Remember, speed is life. I preferred 540 knots. Slick bombs have a huge blast radius and we had to climb pretty aggressively to avoid fragging ourselves when releasing them down low. The solution was the BSU-49 and BSU-50. They basically had a parachute-like balloon that would inflate even at supersonic speeds and retard (slow via drag) the bomb safely behind us. Of course, if they didn’t inflate you had problems. If I remember right, we would still do a safe escape maneuver in case they went “slick” and failed to open. If you watch the footage of the aircrew that hit the IL-76s on the ground in Libya, only one crew out of six succeeded. You will see two of the bombs flash through the targeting video slick. Thankfully, the crew made it back fine and destroyed two and damaged two of the transports. Fast forward to 4:52 to see the Pave Tack footage of the strike: https://youtube.com/watch?v=N-AnclKjCWk%3Ft%3D4m52s During daytime I had backups, too. For dropping LGBs, if the INS failed, I would use dead reckoning to get to the target, climb to 2,000 feet or so, and have the WSO put the Pave Tack Pod to “snow plow” (looking straight ahead). I would pickle on the target and the WSO would then track the target, designate it and guide the bomb in. For a loft attack I would have visual timer reference points to the pull-up and then to a manual release. Some of the more elaborate toss and loft release profiles wouldn’t work that well during wartime, unless you were releasing a nuke. Even with 24,500 pounds of bombs you are not likely to hit a target, but for an exercise by golly I would get my bombs off the airplane and at least scare the gophers somewhere near the target area! The F-111 was a very good bombing platform. It was extremely stable. We had a pilot that was a year ahead of me who became a Weapons School grad, he won the Gunsmoke gunnery and bombing competition and beat out the new F-16s using manual bombing in an F-111E. I was not that good. However, I got really good at killing the drift and calculating the offset. We would then be releasing a string of bombs, a minimum of four and often up to 20 or 24 (20 let us sweep the wings back farther than 24 did). I could almost always put the string right through the target. Maybe not the middle bomb, but the target would be hit. Some of the F-111 guys I flew with had been F-100 pilots in Vietnam. They would get down into the weeds dropping Mk-82 snake eyes, pickling them off while in a ten degree dive while really, really low. They said they could pick the window they wanted the bomb to fly through. When I was at RAF Lakenheath we deployed to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey for a Weapons and Tactics training. It was great flying and a fun time. On the flightline were tons of F-100s. When I walked down it with our Ops Officer he would say “flew than one, and that one, and….” One of our guys went to Konya Range on the ground as a range control officer and got to know the Turkish F-100 pilots there. One of them showed him his Martin Baker coin that he got for successfully ejecting from an F-100. The F-111 pilot said “wow, that’s really unique!” The Turkish pilot turned to the bar and shouted out “hey guys, show him your coins!” Almost every single one of them had one. Ouch! F-111 with other US tactical aircraft of the day. , USAF Nukes and the one-way plane ticket to Armageddon F-111 and nukes. We all trained for it. We all were willing and ready for it. I feel—personal opinion, not based on a poll—that most of us expected it to occur in our lifetime. We all got good at it and there was always a group of F-111s loaded out and in the alert facility in the middle of RAF Lakenheath ready to do the deed if called upon. We knew we had about 15 minutes, max, to get airborne—and possibly less, as that was the flight time for Russian submarine-launched nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles that would target the base. All of the families living near the airfields in East Anglia would be toast. To get airborne we had to respond fast. When I first got to RAF Lakenheath as a young Lieutenant we had four door Dodge pickups with the HUGE V8s. Massive horsepower and four-wheel-drive as well as lights and sirens. When the klaxon sounded, that thing would scream. We would go flying down the taxiway using fingers as the password. If the number of the day was seven and the military police held up three fingers you would respond with four and keep flying by. Once at the aircraft you would jump out, climb in, and fire the cart. The cart was basically a solid-rocket fuel motor that put out a ton of smoke and pressure and was used to spin up the number one engine. You then cross bled the air to the number two engine and fired it up. This all happened very fast. By this point in the process the WSO had the INS on a fast alignment and we would copy the message. If it was valid, then out onto the taxiway, high speed up to the end of the runway, and then off in full afterburner to end the world. We all practiced this over and over and over again. Every alert you would at least scramble once, but we would never taxi out of the alert area. Once the wall fell it all came to a stop. Even with terrorism, the world is a far safe place today than it was during the Cold War. F-111 refuels from a KC-135 tanker., USAF One of the stories told to us by a visiting general was of a volatile time in the Cold War when it was so tense at one of the bases, I think in Spain, that they weren’t supposed to run any exercises. This might have been Torrejon Air Base, which had B-47s in the early ‘60s. They made a mistake and launched to an airborne hold (where jets are armed and waiting in the air for the order to execute nuclear strikes). Evidently, every single pilot thought it was the real thing. They knew they wouldn’t launch unless it was real. They got to the hold point and found out it was an exercise. The point the general made was that every single aircrew executed—not one balked. They launched while convinced their families were dead, as every base was targeted, but they launched nonetheless. I was absolutely convinced I would have to nuke a Warsaw Pact nation, as that was about all we could hit with the F-111. We had a couple of targets in Russia where we would have had to recover with emergency fuel at one of the far northern bases in Norway. But really, we all knew the base would be gone and we would have to punch out. We also knew that we would not be the first nuke on the target. Every single target I ever saw had ICBMs and then SLBMs and then us on it, and then hours and hours later, the stateside B-52s and B-1s. We always practiced World War III as starting conventional, usually with the Russians punching through the Fulda Gap . I remember looking at the plans and seeing that we had a handful of tanks to stop them, compared to thousands of Russian and East German tanks lined up just waiting to punch through. We would fall back, and back, and then stand down, load up the nukes, and then sortie. Exercise over. The Russians, however, planned to fight through the nuclear war and win. I don’t know how it would have really turned out. Every single one of us was absolutely shocked when the wall suddenly fell and the USSR was no more. In hindsight, it was inevitable. You go back and read the stories, though, and I don’t think anyone saw it coming. What a relief it was when Germany reunited and we found out Ivan wasn’t ten feet tall after all. Yeah, we knew our stuff was better, but face it—they had a gazillion of their stuff. F-111 pilots ready for a flight., Via globalsecurity.org Aardvark’s effectiveness Most of my fellow F-111 aircrews and I were good, and we really felt we would take the target out. But let’s look at the raid on Libya: 24 aircraft launch, several break and return, one crashes. Out of the three targets targeted by the aircraft that made it to the target area, only three aircraft hit the target—one on each target. All the others missed. It was terrible when I look back on it, but hats off to the crew who flew it! This was even with the Pave Tack pod on the aircraft and with two of the targets being attacked with LGBs, the airport used MK-82s but had the Pave Tack pod to find and designate the target. The aircrew that hit the airport, hats off to them! I knew the WSO extremely well, a good friend and fellow instructor for several years. In watching his tape, he nailed the radar offset for the airport. The radar was not good at burning out flat concrete but did much better on targets with more radar reflectivity. He went to narrow sector expand mode on the offset and then switched back to the Pave Tack infrared video, and nothing appeared. He went back and checked the offset again, and still dead on. The he switched back to the Pave Tack. Every other aircraft let the bombs fly using the radar offset. Their bombs hit the airfield between the taxiway and the runway. The coordinates on the offset were evidently bad. F-111F loaded with GBU-10s before heading to Libya during Operation Eldorado Canyon., USAF My friend went from narrow sector to wide sector in the Pave Tack and in the right side edge of the field of view he caught sight of the IL-76s. You hear him shout “come right come right” to the Pilot who is seeing nothing except tons of anti-aircraft artillery exploding and his TFR screen. The pilot made a hard turn. As he rolls out, his WSO has fired the lasers and the bombs immediately flew off. You see in the video the Pave Tack’s video rotate to upside down due to the mechanics of the pod rotating to see the target behind the aircraft. The WSOs had to learn how to track upside down when guiding LGBs. You then see a huge explosion rip through the airplanes. That was incredible teamwork in the cockpit. Good on the WSO to switch to wide field of view—it went from a really narrow straw to a slightly fatter straw to look through, but got him onto the target. Mission success. Fast forward to Desert Storm five years later. Most aircraft on the first night hit their targets successfully. In fact, I think all but the few who turned back due to bad Mode 4 IFF or other maintenance issues hit their targets. F-111s over Giza. , Via globalsecurity.org Keeping skills sharp in the F-111 community I trained for five and a half years in the F-111. I had a little over 900 hours. We just didn’t fly as much as other aircraft did. Our short missions were two and a half hours long. I was getting around 200 hours a year and I had moves, deployments, vacation etc. that cut that down some. Some of our missions would be three and a half-plus hours long, all on internal fuel, no bags (external fuel tanks). The plane had legs, and boy was it fast. It all worked out to about 90 flights a year. How about that F-16 guy, a bunch of .9 hour or less air-to-air hops, I’m guessing. Let’s be generous and say every sortie was 1.3 hours on average. If they flew the same 200 hours, then they flew many more flights, as the F-16 just didn’t break the way the Vark did. If you do the math, that would equal over 150 sorties a year for the F-16 guy. Guess what? They dropped the same number of bombs, on average, every mission—six from the trusty old SUU-20 practice bomb rack . In the F-111, we would use two of these practice bombs per mission to keep our radar laydown and toss tactics up to snuff, and the remaining four for visual dive bombing. The F-16 driver, even counting their air-to-air training flights, got way more bombs per year than us. The A-10 guys, it was no comparison. All they did was bomb and strafe, bomb and strafe. Love the A-10. Aussie F-111 doing the dump and burn during an air show., PAUL CROCK/AFP/Getty Images The F-111’s infamous “dump and burn” maneuver We had an F-111D from Cannon AFB head out to Canada for Maple Flag in the ‘80s. Everybody did an unofficial “arrival show.” Upon arrival in the overhead pattern the F-16s would pull 9 gs, the F-15s would pull 9 gs, the F-4s would pull 7 gs, the A-10s would pull however many they could. Then again, for the Warthog it didn’t really matter how many gs, as it could turn on a dime. And then there was the F-111. If really light and pushing .95 mach or so while over-speeding the wings (if wings were swept forward, the jet was mach-limited) you might get 5 gs for a nano-second or so, and then you would be doing about .001 mach. Your awesome break turn would have taken half the state of Texas, too. The pilot at the center of this story was a great guy. He was a high-time flyer with many thousands of hours under his belt. What was he to do? Sneak in and go hide in the corner of the bar while everyone else bragged? Nope. He came around and leveled off about ten feet above the runway and hit the dump switch, paused, then stroked the burners. A RAAF F-111 executing an extremely low dump and burn before retirement., Jeff Gilbert/wikicommons Momentary pause for style points. Dumping and Torching needed to be in that order. If you torched first and then dumped you ended up with more fizzle and far less flame. For Olympic-class style points, even from the Russian judge, you needed to let the fuel fully aerosolize and then light the cans. The result? A massive stream of fire double the length of the jet pouring out of its tail. There was Dick, streaking all the way down the runway trailing a wall of flame behind him. Best thing ever next to Napalm! The crowd went wild, but no buying beers for him and his WSO that night. When he pulled up in a closed pattern to land and threw the gear down, he looked at the runway. It was still burning. His fire had lit up all the rubber from the skid marks from aircraft landing! He really thought he was going to get in trouble but the Canadians loved it. They said it was the best show they had ever seen! USAF The Vark’s weaknesses and strengths in retrospect The F-111 was great at low altitude. It did good in Desert Storm, too. Great legs, lots of bombs, and really, really fast! It couldn’t turn worth a darn. That’s okay, and for most of Desert Storm it was fine. It was rightly retired because it was nine percent of Tactical Air Command’s fleet but ate up a whopping 25 percent of the maintenance budget. Too often I would lose the radar because its mean-time between failure (MTBF) was less than 20 hours or so. Other systems like INS had a MTBF that was far less than 20 hours. When the TFR went out I would end up with a twin engine F-100 and would have to bomb using “iron sights.” Still, it could haul lots of bombs and was stable as all get out. Weakness? They took the gun out. General Creech, a TAC commander during the F-111 development, was quoted saying he wasn’t going to have a $20 million dollar airplane strafing $20,000 trucks. We could only carry the AIM-9P Sidewinder with no radar cueing, and that was the mid ‘80s before it became routine to have the Aim-9 loaded up at all. The AIM-9P is only going to hit if launched from the rear against someone running hot, and we had no maneuverability to get to the rear of the bad guy. At least the smoke trail coming off my wing after launching the thing might make the other guy flinch, so I could get low and run like a scalded ape. The capsule ejection system was both a weakness and a strength. We had a lot of guys mess up their backs with ejections. A squadron commander at Mountain Home was a paraplegic after ejecting, when the air bag failed to work. We never had anyone die from wind-blast, though. We had several supersonic ejections, no big deal. Plus, when ejecting into the cold ocean, you don’t get wet until they show up to rescue you. A used F-111 escape module, basically the whole cockpit and upper forward portion of the jet. , Public Domain It did take too long to get the chute deployment during ejection, though. It was something like 10 seconds from pulling the handle to the chute deploying. I had an instructor pilot who was my cadet squadron commander when I was a sophomore at the Academy who ejected at Mountain Home when he had a compressor stall doing a break turn at 500 feet above the field. The A model did not have the mod at that time to keep it from departing in yaw when exceeding the max angle of attack. With the loss of thrust he had less than a second to go full forward on the stick to avoid a high speed stall/departure. They punched out too low and both crew died. The amount of bombs the F-111 could carry was definitely a strength. I have a picture of the F-111C dropping 48 Mk-82s. I think he had to be in full burner to barely get to 10,000 feet. They used fixed pylons on the outboard stations to carry six 500-pounders on each pylon. You can’t sweep the wings unless you punch the pylons off. Totally impractical, but also really cool! Range was a huge plus for the F-111. I did a four-hour low-level using internal fuel and two weapons bay tanks with no wing tanks. Try to do that in a Strike Eagle or a Viper. Of course, who on Earth in their right mind wants to sit in an ejection seat for 4 hours while flying continuously at low-level? The Vark’s big strength was that it was fast as hell. I routinely cruised at .95 mach in military power (full throttle with no afterburner augmentation) while on the deck. The F model was nearly super cruise-capable. I saw 1.1 mach on the deck in a D model, and I knew guys who had the F model up to 1.4 mach on the deck! It held enough gas to do it for a while, too. Not many planes could keep up. A loaded up F-111D., USAF Living the swing-wing dream My favorite memory while flying the Vark remains as vivid in my mind today as the day after it happened. I was flying right at sunset, dropping bombs in the North Sea off of Eastern Scotland. We had a Pave Tack pod but no way to really measure miss distance, but at least we could see the smoke from the practice bombs and if it was close to the target, we could tell. It was kind of like plinking cans with a .22—not really doing much damage but fun nonetheless. It was completely overcast and very dark under the clouds with marginal visibility. In other words, standard English weather! We were grounded from night flying on the TFR at the time due to maintenance problems. We had several instances, including a fatal crash at night, where the TFR failed in ways the engineers had no idea it could, even though the system was nearly 20 years old by then. Since we had to knock off at sunset I was watching my clock. By then it was getting really dark under the clouds, especially since we were out over the ocean with no lights anywhere. I waited until the last second and then lit both burners. 54,000 pounds of thrust awoke behind us and I pulled back on the stick to punch up through the clouds. We weren’t allowed to do any over-the-top maneuvers. No loops, Cuban 8s , Immelmanns, etc. To be legal, I therefore went to 89 degrees of pull instead of 90 degrees. We hit the clouds on our back and punched through very quickly as the layer wasn’t very thick. It surprised me when I saw, upside down, the most beautiful sight I had seen yet while flying: The sun was suspended, half-buried in a field of solid white with a fiery display in the cirrus high altitude clouds still above me. I froze the climb while inverted, still with my nose 45 degrees above the horizon, still in full afterburner, and said to my WSO: “And we get paid for doing this?!” Via globalsecurity.org A huge thanks to Richard Crandall for sharing his incredible experiences in the F-111 with us.

Although F-15C/D Eagles were already a staple in the Royal Saudi Air Force by the time Desert Storm kicked off, the Strike Eagle would eventually find its way into the Kingdom’s aerial arsenal in the form of the F-15S. Today, Saudi Arabia flies around 70 of these jets, and soon they will receive 84 F-15SAs, the most advanced Strike Eagle derivative ever produced. Now Crandall serves as a contractor with the Royal Saudi Air Force, where he puts his experiences flying and fighting in the F-15E “Mud Hen” to use. Below, read Crandall’s perspective detailing how the Strike Eagle first arrived in Saudi Arabia, how they were baptized by fire during Desert Storm, and how they differed from the Strike Eagles flown today. Cockpit view of a division of Strike Eagles., USAF Strike Eagles arrive in the Kingdom Saudi Arabia has flown the F-15 Eagle for a very long time. The Kingdom bought the Eagle and started flying them long before Desert Storm in 1991. Royal Saudi Air Force pilots flying the F-15Cs even shot down two Iraqi fighters during the war. Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. In that same month, the USAF’s newest and most potent strike fighter, F-15E Strike Eagle, landed in Saudi Arabia for the first time, but its stay was brief. The jets were only on the ground for a few hours at King Abdulaziz Air Base in Dharan. They were refueled and immediately departed for Thumrait, Oman. At the time, their presence in the Kingdom was considered too offensive, and some worried it might result in Iraq immediately crossing the border into Saudi Arabia. The only way to stop them was deploying the Saudi Army and the 82nd Airborne. The 82nd Airborne would have fought valiantly, but its anti-armor capability wasn’t there, and it would have been a speed bump under Saddam Hussein’s armored forces. For the next six months, the USAF’s first operational F-15E unit, the 336th Fighter Squadron “Rocketeers,” flew from Oman, while the great military buildup leading up to Desert Storm—called Desert Shield—went on in Saudi Arabia and around the region. Finally, in December, the word came down that the “World Famous Fighting Rocketeers” and their mighty F-15Es would deploy to Al Kharj Air Base (which we called Al’s Garage). There we would join up there with the 335th Fighter Squadron “Chiefs” which also hailed from Seymour Johnson AFB. The Chiefs proudly claimed to be “The World’s Largest Distributor of MiG Parts” from back when they flew the F-86 during the Korean War, and they had an impressive kill record. F-15E Eagle fighter aircraft of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C., are parked on an air field during Operation Desert Shield., DoD The Genesis of the Strike Eagle The Strike Eagle was an adaptation of an incredible Air-to-Air machine, the F-15A/B/C/D, and it still has the best kill-to-loss ratio of any fighter aircraft ever (debatably, 98 to 1). It was designed and first flew in the early 1970s. It thrives at medium-altitude, with a complex airfoil that gave it outstanding maneuverability unmatched by any other aircraft. It was so big that many classes at Luke AFB had their class photos shot with the entire class standing on top of the airplane in tennis outfits—it became known as the “flying tennis court.” As for its large visual signature, real fighter pilots aren’t afraid of being seen: We kill you as we spit in your face. During the late 70s and early 80s, the F-111 was getting old, although I almost laugh at that now, since the oldest flying F-15s are approaching 40. In 1980’s, when the USAF started to pursue what became the Strike Eagle, the oldest F-111 was only about 20 years old. The F-111 was a great penetration low-level day/night bomber but it had almost no air-to-air capability. I loved flying it, but it could be out-turned by everything . Low and fast it excelled marvelously. It was, however, an absolute maintenance nightmare. I think from my days on the staff at Air Combat Command at Langley AFB (if a judge told me to choose to serve on the staff in a non-flying job or go to prison—not sure what I’d do…) that the F-111 was 9% of the Tactical Air Force, but took up 25% of the budget. With this in mind, the USAF held a competition between a really cool looking delta-winged F-16XL and a heavily modified F-15D. The air-to-ground optimized Eagle was chosen. (Author’s note: Israel was actually the first to put the concept of an air-to-ground F-15 to use operationally. Read all about it here .) The first production F-15E., USAF What made the “Mud Hen” special The multi-role F-15E retained 100% of the capabilities of the “not a pound for air-to-ground” F-15C, sort of. They added two conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) on the sides of the fuselage that gave it a lot more gas, about an extra 8,500lbs of go-juice to be exact, but they also added weight and drag. The CFTs could also carry up to 6,000lbs of weapons per side, or two 2,000lb weapons per side. Thus, a clean F-15E with CFTs up against an F-15C with two wing tanks would be hard pressed to win, especially as all that the F-15C driver did was live, eat, breathe air-to-air. We in the Strike Eagle community did 90% air-to-Ground and about 10% air-to-air. That ratio has varied over the years, but for us who went to Saudi Arabia so long ago, we were focused on bombs. The light grey guys (the F-15C wears a lighter paint scheme) can’t even say the word bombs, they call it “the B word” they hate it so much. They may be able to kill them one by one, but we can do that too plus we take the bad guys out by the hundreds with our payloads. The best thing about the F-15E? It worked. You turned the radar on and it stayed on. You didn’t lose the INS ( Inertial Navigation System ) if you hiccupped. The TFR (Terrain Following Radar) always worked. Plus we had an IR (infrared) picture in our wide-screen HUDs that the light grey types lusted after, the massive HUD not the IR. Their’s was tiny and shriveled in comparison. We had a WSO (Weapons Systems Officer). The light grey guys hate the idea of having company in the cockpit. That was life for us. Personally I found that when I worked with a good WSO I could fight better than by myself. I think I would have been a better pilot if forced to do it all by myself but when you put me with a WSO, we as a crew were better than I ever could have been with me by myself. Plus a huge advantage here, when I screwed up and was called into the boss’s office to be screamed at it hurt less as he was screaming at two of us instead of me alone. Misery loves company. Ground crews prepare to attach a CFT to an F-15E., USAF The F-15E had a fantastic advance know as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Basically a bunch of nerdy skinny guys with coke bottle eyeglasses and pocket protectors found that if they had the radar sweep back and forth a couple of times and then analyzed all of the pictures, checked them twice to see if we were naughty or nice, and then took the cube root of the square of the phase of the moon, that they could give us a picture of the ground that looked like it was taken from a satellite. It was incredible. Fences looked like fences. Buildings were square instead of blobs. Radar scope interpretation became much-much easier and bombing accuracy became much better. To use the Synthetic Aperture Radar we had to move sideways to the target for a couple of sweeps. The greater the angle off the nose the area was we wanted to look at the faster the picture and the more accurate the radar picture was. This totally changed our target area behavior. In the F-111 you flew straight at the target as the WSO used the radar to find it. In the Strike Eagle we would fly at an angle to the target and turn direct only after the WSO found and designated it. This was not that big of a deal really. We had to maneuver anyway to get minimum safe distance between each striking aircraft so we just integrated the need to map the target into our plan to attack from different directions at different times. We would run in low. The F-15E could fly TFR down to 100 feet though I only used 200 feet to my eternal regret. Woulda-coulda-shoulda gone down to 100 feet at night just to say I did it. The lowest I ever flew at night in the F-111 was 500 feet, though I flew at 200 feet when flying under visual flight rules (VFR) conditions all the time. Anyway, run in low then turn off when inside around 20 miles or so. This gave us our best resolution on the radar and I think the numbers were something like we could see objects as separate if they were a bit less than 10 feet apart. So, if you have two cars five feet apart they show up as one blob. If they were 15 feet apart they would show up as two blobs. If the radar did not have enough grazing angle to see the target the WSO would direct us to climb. Once he had the picture we would turn target direct and drop back down to our attack altitude that was dictated by the bomb fuse combination that we were carrying. F-15E’s massive holographic HUD with LANTIRN nav pod FLIR imagery projected onto it at night., USAF Putting the Strike Eagle’s arsenal to work during Desert Storm The standard for the start of the war was the MK-20 Rockeye cluster bomb which if I remember right had a timer fuse on it. A certain time after being dropped the MK-339 timer fuse would fire. The bomb would spin after release from the fins popping out at the back at an angle. When the fuse fired, the case split open, and the bomblets inside spread out due to centripetal acceleration. If you released too high the pattern was wider and if too low the pattern was narrower. The bombs were dual purpose. If they hit something hard they would form a shape charge of plasma and burn through armor. If they hit something soft they would go off like a hand grenade and generate shrapnel. I loved Rockeye, great stuff, carried it the first few nights of the war and took out several Scud missiles with it. By the end of the war we were primarily dropping CBU-87s, bigger at 1,000lbs than the 750lb Rockeye. That was nice because it had more bomblets. It was not nice because we could not carry 12 of them on the CFT’s, 6 per side, and carry wing-tanks as well, the top three bombs on each side were too close to the tanks. Thus we either carried less, six to be exact, or we carried less gas, a center line tank instead of up to 3 tanks, 2 on the wing plus the centerline tank. The CBU-87 had a radar proximity fuse. As a result if I released it on or above the minimum altitude I got the exact same dispersion of the bomblets. This came into play after the second night of the war when we started dropping from what we used to consider the stratosphere, the mid-teens to high twenties (thousands of feet). We could still cover a huge area on the desert with a carpet of white fire. These were the best dumb bombs we used for the vast majority of targets we attacked during Desert Storm. Laser Guided Bombs (LGBs) are visual flight rules only weapons. The laser is attenuated by visible moisture. Sometime you could use a ground laser beneath a cloud deck, the aircraft could drop the bomb ballistically and the guy on the ground would guide it in by illuminating the target with his laser. At the start of the war we had Paveway II LGBs in 500lb (GBU-12) and 2000lb (GBU-10) configurations. It didn’t matter to the aircrew which he carried as they were identical in employment. We did not start using them until a bit into Desert Storm as we only had nine LANTIRN targeting pods for 48 aircraft. We were up to 24 pods by the end of the war. Because of this, we always used them from medium altitude in one of two ways. If the aircraft was lasing (painting a target with a laser) for itself, it would drop the bomb and immediately crank off about 45 to 60 degrees while continuing to lase the target. I think usually we would use a “delay-lase” tactic though, where we would not turn the laser back on after release until 15 seconds or so to impact. This was to keep the bomb falling ballistically. If you had the laser on full time then as soon as the laser was seen by the seeker it would point straight at the target and cause the bomb to come in at a slightly shallower angle than it would with a delayed laser operation. Steeper meant faster and more energy to maneuver to steer to the laser spot. I have actually seen slow motion footage of bombs hitting short with the bomb at a very nose-high angle of attack as the seeker struggled to keep on target and the bomb got too slow. By cranking sideways the laser spot would remain on the same side of the target as the bomb, usually. Even when you are lasing the target at almost 90 degrees you would usually have enough laser “splattering” for the bomb to see it. Round oil storage tanks could be tough though. Also, you could end up lasing the side of a building the bomb couldn’t see so it took a bit of artistry to know the right run-in angle and crank-off angle. The other advantage of cranking-off was avoiding the very disorienting roll of the seeker head as it passes through the vertical. Not only that, but since the LANTIRN targeting pod had the seeker head on the front of the pod’s body, the ability to see to the rear was extremely limited. I have seen a lot of targeting pod video from the war and several times you can see where the laser stops prior to bomb impact due to this. With good crew coordination the pilot could quickly turn back toward the target and roll back out allowing the pod’s laser to stay on target. Another tactic we used was buddy lasing. In this case the poor wingman (always me as I was a wingman the entire war) who had no targeting pod would drop the bomb ballistically so that his flight lead could have all the fun and be the hero in taking the target out. I kind of felt like the sparring partner for the heavyweight fighter. I did a lot of work with little satisfaction. I know, yes I would like some crackers and cheese to go with my whine. The flight lead would fly several miles behind the wingman and be able to fly straight towards the target the entire time. This actually gives the bomb the absolute best laser spot as it is more in line with the flight path of the bomb the entire time. So how big is the laser spot? We had some footage taken out at the Utah test range that actually filmed our LANTIRN targeting laser on the target as we dropped bombs. If I remember right it was a 2 story target building. The laser spot covered most of the entire building when the bombs hit! We were several miles away and it showed how even lasers diverge over distance. The seeker on the bomb tracks the center of the spot so even though it was a big spot we still got good guidance with it. We also carried the standard MK-82 500lb bombs and another favorite of mine, the MK-84 2,000 pounder. I had one mission against a cloverleaf in the desert of Kuwait with five 2,000lb bombs. We could see the shock-wave as they blew up, even on the darkest night. Strike Eagles pushing it up at dusk., USAF We own the night We used the FLIR (forward-looking Infrared) in the LANTIRN Navigation pod to fly formation at night. Thus in a two ship or more we would fly a train with each wingman being two to four miles behind the aircraft in front. This allowed the radars to be in scan mode rather than remaining locked on to the aircraft in front of it. I think most flight leads preferred to fly in black-hot on their HUD. I preferred white hot as it was easier to see the aircraft as a white dot than a black dot for me. Our leads tended to criticize us but most of us just shrugged and continued to do what we wanted to as it was our choice and we were the ones who would be embarrassed if we didn’t stay in position. Remember the wingman’s creed – “ two, joker, bingo, mayday, and Lead you’re on Fire.” Other than that shut up and color. Be in position and do what you’re trained to do. That way the formation is strong. A weak wingman is worthless. At that time we had no data-link. Big weakness. All targets passed to the Strike Eagle after takeoff were done verbally. We worked with E-8 JSTARS a lot. They had a SAR radar like ours but theirs could take detailed pictures from much greater ranges. They would then try to talk us onto targets. They would give us the coordinates, oh yeah also no GPS in the F-15E back then, so coordinates could be up to a half mile or more off. They would then verbally describe the targets they were seeing. “A group of six tanks in a crescent moon oriented towards the northwest.” Sadly many times we would just find some returns near the coordinates they gave and drop our bombs on them. This was really a problem when we were buddy lasing. Making sure we were on the same target took a lot of time. Of the few buddy lase missions I flew I would usually bring back several of the LGBs. We just ran out of gas before lead dropped all of his and then started to talk us onto a target to drop ours. I don’t remember if the original LANTIRN targeting pod had the ability to see another laser. This is a huge benefit now. The A-10 had this way back when it first flew with the Pave Penny system . Another aircraft or a ground controller could put a laser out on a target and a pilot would get an indication on his HUD showing where the laser-spot is and thus would be able to find the target immediately. This didn’t matter much for us during Desert Storm as I don’t think we flew with more than one targeting pod in a formation for the entire war. Modernized Saudi F-15S., Tyler Rogoway The Strike Eagle ages beautifully Starting in 1996 Saudi Arabia bought their version of the F-15E, the F-15S. It was downgraded slightly from the USAF’s version. I think originally they weren’t going to get the weapons stations on the CFTs and were going to use BRUs (bomb racks) and MERs (multiple ejector racks) on the wing. They have the weapons stations on the CFTs now, although I just do not know if they had them originally. I will talk though about the F-15S today – the F-15 I wish I would have had 25 years ago. GPS. Enough said. Hard to imagine living without it. With GPS comes JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition),  a dumb bomb made smart with a GPS guidance kit. Wow. That bomb alone is the difference between fighting in the Stone Age and now. All weather accuracy without the need for post target lasing. True launch-and-leave capability. JDAM offers a much larger effects footprint. One pass, multiple Desired Mean Point of Impacts (DMPIs). I only attacked one target per pass in Desert Storm. Now, with JDAM, I could attack 12 or more targets on one pass. That is a game changer. F-15E’s dropping bunker busting BLU-109s with JDAM kits., USAF Data-link. I never ever had it but always wanted it. No more “bogey, Manny, 090 for 65 Westbound.” Okay, now I have to know where Manny is, then where am I in relation to Manny. Then take that information I just heard and mentally plot it out and do a fix-to-fix in my head to figure out where he is relative to me. Hmmm. Angle of the something or other squared times… Remember the movie Mars Attacks when the Country Western music is played and the Martians’ heads explode? Now with the data-link you look down at your display and see exactly where Manny and pretty much everything else is, in color, and relative to your own position. Remember when your teacher told you how nice it was to share? Now you get to share all sorts of stuff, radar, pictures, home movies, the list goes on. Data-link is as much a game changer as GPS. Targeting Pod mechanized for air-to-air combat. My neighbor back in the 90s at Seymour Johnson was Ziggy Dahl, an instructor WSO in the Chiefs. He used the targeting pod to do air-to-air back before it was optimized to do it. As like most modern fighters of the day we had pulse doppler radar and everyone knows that if you fly perfectly perpendicular to the air-to-air radar locked onto you then you will disappear. Klingon cloaking device on! Our radar could only look to 60 degrees back then, later a bit more, but still way less than 90 degrees. Solution, use the targeting pod which gave you +/- 1 degree accuracy. It worked like a champ but was hard to do. I understand now that the targeting pod cues to expected position of the target without a ton of work on the WSO’s part (Author’s note: this technology is now being fully integrated also on American ANG F-15Cs equipped with SNIPER targeting pods). Do a hard turn and blank out the targeting pod and it will track where the bogey should be and return to that point in space when you un-blank the pod. Back when I flew it the pod would go stupid if it broke-lock and was blanked out. AIM-120 AMRAAMs on the wing rails above the fuel tanks. All we had during Desert Storm was the AIM-9L Sidewinder. Great missile but it is a pistol in a rifle fight with the Mig-29s we were facing. To carry the AIM-7 Sparrow we would have to give up bombs on the conformal fuel tanks. In hindsight we would have killed five or more MIGs during the first night if we would have had the flight leads go in with one conformal carrying six MK-20 Rockeyes and one conformal carrying two Aim-7Ms. Oh well. Now the Strike Eagle always has claws on every flight. Long-range claws. Approach at your own risk claws. F-15E with AIM-9 Sidewinder, USAF Then and now Perspective time. Last year I returned to that small government school in central Colorado for delinquent boys and girls called the United States Air Force Academy for my 35th reunion. This was the first reunion I attended. It was a great time with great friends. 35 years prior to my graduation in 1980 was 1945. Jets were rare then with the Lockheed P-80 shooting star designed in 1943 and that was it, and it was not used in WWII. The Germans had a couple, the British had the Glouster Meteor, etc. Still, the piston engine was king. The Spitfire, the Mustang, the B-29 and so on. In 1980, 35 years later, the USAF was flying the A-10, the F-16, the F-15C, and the B-52. Now in 2016, 36 years after 1980, the USAF is flying the A-10, the F-16, the F-15C, and the B-52. Hmmmm. The difference? GPS and data-link, as well as persistent ISR (Information, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) for the combatant commander and individual warriors. We now have constant ISR on the battlefield. The only ISR we had in Desert Storm was JSTARS and Compass Cal l, and maybe Rivet Joint , but that was classified way above my head. U-2 and SR-71 too but not for us at the operational level. Today the coverage of the MQ-1 and MQ-9 and other UAVs on the battlefield gives incredible situational awareness available to the average pogue that was not available 25 years ago. We could destroy every single target hit during the entire Desert Storm with one squadron of F-15Es or F-15Ss today. Precision attacks on multiple targets per aircraft per pass, day, night and in any weather. Would we? Doubtful. We have more capability today but are hitting far less targets due to the fear of collateral damage – but that is another discussion for another day.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 13, 2020",All Aboard! The Amazing History Of Presidential Trains,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We’ve done some in-depth reporting on the anatomy of a Presidential motorcade , as well as on the inner sanctum of Marine One , the special MV-22 Ospreys that accompany it , and the other VVIP helicopters on alert to evacuate key decision-makers from Washington DC. Now, we venture into the wonderful history of Presidential trains. Trains have long been a fixture on Presidential campaigns, and for nearly a century, they were how sitting Presidents canvassed the country. But the first five Presidents never even rode on a train, let alone had one dedicated to their use. The first Presidential candidate to use a train for campaigning was William Henry Harrison, who ran for President, unsuccessfully, in 1836. Then, in 1841, as President-elect, Harrison became the first to use a train to ride to his inauguration. Two decades later, President Lincoln set a new standard for the White House’s utilization of the rails. From the time he was voted into office, Lincoln put trains to use for the purpose of consolidating support for his policies and to reach Americans and Union soldiers directly. Lincoln even signed legislation that initiated the transcontinental railroad. During Lincoln’s time in office, a special executive coach dubbed United States was ordered to be built just for the President, although he supposedly detested the project. Lincoln was averse to luxury and what it signaled to his constituents during a time when the country was ravaged by internal warfare. The specially-built Presidential coach dubbed United States. , The only time he rode in it was after his assassination, as the car was the centerpiece of the “Lincoln Special” funeral train that brought his body back to his hometown of Springfield, Illinois. It was a time of national mourning, and the train acted as a tangible nexus between the devastating headlines and the American people who were so affected by the loss. The car was not preserved after acting as Lincoln’s rail-bound hearse, and it was supposedly was lost in a fire years after its melancholy debut. The construction of this custom train car marked the first custom mechanized vehicle specifically built for the POTUS, which began a trend that has broadened remarkably in the last 150 years since. In some ways, it’s the great granddaddy of the Presidential limousine, Marine One, and Air Force One. A map showing the route Lincoln’s funeral train took back to Springfield. , The Presidents and Presidential candidates that followed used trains constantly for transportation and promotion; some even died right before getting on a train (James Garfield). Yet Franklin Delano Roosevelet, who used trains extensively on his way to being elected in 1933, and his beloved U.S. Car No. 1 rose to prominence during World War II. U.S. Car No. 1 was actually built in 1928 by the Pullman Company, and was originally named Ferdinand Magellan . It was one of six similar custom cars, all named after the world’s great explorers. The historic Ferdinand Magellan, aka U.S. Car No.1, on display in Florida., Ebyabe/wikicommons The car was acquired by the government and refitted in 1941 for the wartime President’s use, after which it became the heaviest railcar ever built in the entire United States, weighing in at 285,000 lbs. During its refitting, it was armored with 5/8-inch steel plating on its roof, sides, and floor, and three-inch bulletproof glass windows were installed where the standard windows had been. Two escape hatches were also installed. It was a rolling fortress that reflected the extreme security considerations of the time. Inside the dining air of U.S. Car No.1., Alexf/wikicommons The interior of the remodeled U.S. Car No. 1 had a presidential suite, two guest rooms, a dining room that also served as a conference room, and an observation lounge that Roosevelt and his staff could utilize during long trips. It was also extremely luxurious and had telephones in most rooms, which was unheard of at that time. The rear platform of U.S. Car No. 1 that Roosevelt famously used for public addresses. , Alexf/wikicommons Communications were facilitated by a converted hospital car that had incredibly high-tech radio gear installed so the President could stay connected at all times. A second converted hospital car was also part of the train. It was used by the President’s Secret Service protection detail and included bunks, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a lounge area. The code name for these two cars was “Crate.” An oversize baggage car would often carry two sedans and two convertibles for motorcades, and other cars could be added, like ones carrying the press and other aids for high-profile rail missions. The outside of U.S. Railcar No. 1 had the word “Pullman” simply painted on its side, allowing it to blend in with other train traffic during secretive travels. The Presidential train used the callsign “POTUS,” with the Secret Service calling it “City Hall,” during operations, and had the right-of-way whenever and wherever it traveled, just as Air Force One and the Presidential Motorcade have today. FDR giving a speech from the rear of U.S. Car No. 1, AP Many famous people rode in the President’s car, including Winston Churchill, and key war planning was done in its conference room. FDR used the car extensively for his 1944 campaign, setting up shop right on the car’s elevated rear platform. Loudspeakers were installed on its roofline for this purpose, a signature feature on previous campaign cars used by Roosevelt. The train allowed FDR, who suffered from polio, to make public appearances under controlled circumstances, as health concerns had loomed heavily over his candidacy. A special wheelchair was also constructed for FDR to use while on the U.S. Car No.1. Moving the President on the rails was an intricate affair, with one railroad expert stating : “Special instructions were issued so that no passenger, freight or switching moves would interfere with the movement of the special. Freights had to clear 30 minutes in advance and be at a standstill while the special passed. This was regardless of direction or track. If passing on adjoining tracks, conductors were instructed to insure against loose doors and other possible projections. Division engineers had to arrange for inspection of tracks, interlockings and drawbridges. Drawbridges could not be opened within 30 minutes of arrival of the train. In addition, car inspectors rode the train, state police monitored grade crossings and platform access was limited. It must have been a nightmare for the operating personnel who still had to move all the regularly scheduled trains.” Like Lincoln, the Presidential railcar also was part of the rail procession that delivered Roosevelt’s body back to his home town after his sudden death in 1945. In all, FDR had traveled nearly 250,000 miles on the rails during his presidency. President Harry S. Truman and the First Lady aboard U.S. Car No.1, Following FDR’s death, Harry Truman continued to utilize U.S. Car No. 1. This included using it for a 31,000-mile whistle-stop tour of the US during the 1948 Presidential Campaign (although he bemoaned its slow speed). He demanded the train be run at 80 mph whenever possible, double the speed of Roosevelt’s liking. The heavy train car and its moderate pace helped to further solidify air travel as the future of medium-range presidential transport, with Truman increasingly opting to use the C-118 Liftmaster dubbed Independence instead of going by rail. The massive increase in the number of large airfields after WWII also helped facilitate this transition. Still, U.S. Car No. 1 kept on chugging down the tracks right into the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration. But by the mid-1950s, rail travel was increasingly becoming a regional commodity, with the White House putting the first aircraft to use the callsign Air Force One into service, a Lockheed Constellation named Columbine II , for most Presidential travels. Columbine II sitting behind armed guards., US archives The last use of U.S. Car No. 1 by the White House was by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower, who took it to christen the world’s first operational nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus . Eventually, the historic car was retired to the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in Florida, where it remains on display today. Crate was kept on hand longer, although by the end of the 1960s its days as an operational tool had ceased. Although the retirement of U.S. Car No. 1 marked the end of Presidential train usage as a primary form of transportation, it remained a secondary one for special occasions. Trains allow Presidents and those running for president to not only get closer to voters and constituents compared to arriving on Air Force One, or a campaign plane, at some locked-down airport, but they also bring a heavy dose of nostalgia to a campaign. This has not been lost on Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush (41), Clinton, Bush (43), and Obama, all of whom have leveraged rail travel for political purposes. Ronald Reagan seen taking to the rails in 1980., AP Presidents Jimmy Carter, H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barak Obama all used the same historic train car, the gorgeous, deep-blue Georgia 300 , for high-publicity trips. Obama has actually used it multiple times, most famously to retrace Lincoln’s inaugural route as a major source of symbolism for his own inauguration in 2009. Barak Obama peering out the rear door of Georgia 300. , AP In recent years, the Secret Service has also used trains as novel escape vehicles during high-risk Presidential visits. During the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, two separate “escape trains” were staged by the Secret Service to whisk the President away to New Jersey via rail in the case of a terrorist attack or other catastrophe. One of the trains was placed under Madison Square Garden, and the other under the Waldorf Astoria hotel where the President stays. In fact, the same scheme was used multiple times—one in particular during the UN General Assembly. The Waldorf Astoria’s secretive railway platform and track that connects it with Grand Central Station and Penn Station has been something of an oddity for some time, and it has been used by the President before. FDR used it to easily come and go from New York, and in spectacular fashion. He would literally be staged in his armored Pierce Arrow limousine inside the modified baggage car that carried it, and would be driven right onto the platform, into a massive elevator , through a garage, and out onto the New York streets. This was just one more measure that helped hide from the public the debilitating effects of polio on Roosevelt’s body. A mysterious car, thought to be the very same one that carried FDR’s motorcade, remains abandoned near the platform to this very day. Although Donald Trump is known to have a serious affinity for air travel of all types, owning his own mini-fleet of S-76 helicopters to move him from point to point when his 757 or Citation X won’t do , candidate Hillary Clinton has used trains while campaigning in the past. In 2008 she used a converted Amtrak train for a five day whistle-stop tour of the Midwest and Northeast. So, who knows, maybe she will put the rails to use in the last 90 days before the election—or even after that, should she be voted in as the 45th President of the United States of America.

Naval Special Warfare Command spends big bucks leveraging emerging technologies and testing for real operations. Occassionally, the tech is deployed to the now legendary Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), more popularly known as SEAL Team Six. Much of the time these technologies live in a semi-classified state, wherein they obviously exist but are not disclosed or publicized as being operational kit for particular combat units . The quad-tube panoramic night vision goggles used during the Osama Bin Laden raid is one of many examples of such a technology. Eventually, these capabilities can make their way down to mainline SEAL teams. That seems to be the case for Patriot3’s Jetboots. Frogmen wearing jetboots hit the beach., Patriot3 The idea is very straightforward: attach thrusters to a frogman’s legs, allowing him to move quickly through the water with little effort, change direction in an instant just by moving his head and torso. For decades, the main obstacle to this sort of gear was the battery technology and material science really wasn’t there. That is, until Patriot3 attacked the problem. The result of their hard work? The Jetboots Diver Propulsion System. The coolest thing about Jetboots is they allow the diver to go about their underwater business leaving their hands free to navigate, prep weapons, manipulate underwater objects, plant explosives and just be more prepared for the unexpected. https://youtube.com/watch?v=S8W13ReBWKk Jetboots have the ability to fulfil an intermediate gap between riding in a mini-sub/swimmer delivery vehicle and swimming to a target under a swimmer’s own power, all without the need for a cumbersome diver propulsion vehicle . Because the diver doesn’t have to swim for miles to the target area unaided they can save their energy for critical tasks performed once at their destination. Special operators wearing Jetboots on land. , Patriot3 To extend the system’s underwater range, lithium-ion battery packs can be switched out while underway.

The thing is that these things have many potential applications outside of the special operations community, including for ship repair, construction and salvage divers, for environmental research and for search and rescue operations to name a few.

The civilian market would likely have a demand for these although the price tag of $33,900 puts them outside of economical reach for the vast majority of sport divers.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 22, 2019",Is the European Meteor Air-To-Air Missile Really the Best in the World?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For years now there has been a ton of hype about MBDA’s Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, but now that it has reached operational status , blanket claims are being tossed around in the media as to its capabilities: headlines like “the best in the world“ and “the most deadly” are commonplace. But is it really that simple? Is the Meteor the dream missile every western fighter needs under its wings or in its weapons bays or is it a niche capability? Rising Meteor The truth is that the Meteor isn’t that new at all as it has been in development for nearly two decades. Still there is no doubt that the missile is extremely impressive, but it is not necessarily the best solution for the beyond-visual-range (BVR) job for all fighters and for all scenarios. The Meteor’s roots can be traced back to the mid-1990st grew out of a common European need for a next generation BVR missile. This new missile had to have superior range and overall kinematic performance than the American AIM-120 AMRAAM. The UK, France, Sweden, Germany, Italy and Spain all participated in the program and although European aerospace and defense consortiums are nothing new, some aspects of what the Meteor brings to the fight is. Meteor’s most impressive feature is its propulsion concept. Think of the Meteor more as an air-to-air cruise missile than as a traditional guided air-to-air rocket. For propulsion, it uses a solid fuel, variable flow, ducted rocket—also referred to as a ramjet—instead of a traditional rocket motor. What this means is that Meteor can throttle its engine during different phases of flight whereas a rocket delivers all of its potential energy in one continuous unmodulated burn cycle. This capability may not sound like a huge deal, but it is. A Meteor is fired during testing., Dassault Nowhere to run to When a standard air-to-air missile is fired at a target it delivers the same amount of thrust over a certain period regardless of the tactical scenario. If the target can be reached without the rocket motor burning out, or shortly after it does so, the missile will have a high-energy state during its terminal attack phase. This will allow it to maneuver very hard, easily countering a target aircraft trying to evade the incoming missile. If the target is farther away, the missile will usually climb to a high altitude while its rocket motor is burning and then coast on its built-up energy with gravity on its side until it reaches the terminal phase of its flight (its final attack run). If the target isn’t too far away, and the missile is still above it, it will dive down on the target in an attempt to maximize its ability to make hard maneuvers. The longer the shot, the less energy the missile will have for its critical terminal phase of flight, and that is not a good thing. Enter the ramjet powered Meteor. Instead of burning off all its fuel right after launch it can throttle its engine back during cruise, thus saving fuel. As it approaches its target it can throttle up, eventually making its terminal attack while at its highest possible energy state, around mach 4.5, even when fired over long ranges. Not only does this mean the Meteor will have more energy to maneuver during the endgame of the engagement, but this capability also drastically increases the size of the missile’s “no escape zone.” Basically, the Meteor has a far greater ability to “chase” and catch enemy aircraft over long ranges. So more than just being a better beyond-visual-range (BVR) missile via high-end sensors and a larger rocket motor, Meteor has a totally different—and much smarter—propulsion concept, that not only increases range but also increases its effectiveness of the missile over that range. A missile that listens and talks to its master The Meteor competes in other ways than just propulsion. It packs an active X-band radar seeker for locking onto targets during the terminal phase of its flight. In fighter pilot parlance this is when the missile goes “ pitbull ” and becomes a true fire-and-forget weapon. In other words, the firing aircraft does not need to guide it any farther toward its target in order to ensure that it gets a lock and can make its final attack on its own. There is a common misconception about most modern BVR missiles, especially the AIM-120 AMRAAM. It is regarded as a fire-and-forget weapon, and it does have a mode to do just that. Basically it takes the targeting data from the aircraft’s radar and calculates where the target “should be” when it arrives in the target area. It then flies out to that area using its own inertial navigation system. Once there, the missile’s small radar seeker, which has far less range and scanning capability than the radar on the fighter that fired it, starts to look for the bad guy. If said bad guy is within the AMRAAM radar’s cone of detection it can lock on and attack. The problem is that at intermediate and medium ranges, fire-and-forget performance is abysmal. If the target is not where the missile thought it would be, within a limited cone of the sky, it’s a miss. As such, this mode is more effective for defensive shots as anything else or for shots taken at close ranges where there is less flight time in which the enemy can change course, altitude and tactics. The way the AIM-120 missile is usually employed at range is by the fighter aircraft that launched it sending it mid-course updates as it flies out to the target. As it goes along its way, and as the range between the missile and the target decreases, its ability to predict where the target will be improves as it has much more recent telemetry to rely on. Ideally the fighter will provide updates to the missile until it locks its own radar on the enemy target. There is a tradeoff between risk and reward for the pilot firing the missile. He can keep his radar pointing towards the bad guy and continue sending radar data to the missile to improve its chances of a kill, but that may expose him to the enemy as range between him and the target decreases. Once the missile goes “pitbull” and has locked its own radar on the target at close range the pilot can perform the “forget” part of fire and forget concept and can break its lock. An F-16CJ is seen packing an AIM-120, AIM-9M, and an AGM-88 HARM. The little housing above the Sidewinder is where towed decoys deploy from. , USAF Like the AIM-120, the Meteor probably has a fire-and-forget mode, but mid-course updates are not only key to the missile’s success. Because the missile can modulate its throttle, the autopilot can provide the most efficient flight profile to the target in long-range shots. Greater range means less certainty of where the target will be by the time the missile is close enough to detect it itself. The Meteor will be able to get those crucial mid-course guidance updates not just from the jet that fired it, but from “third party” sources as well. These can include other fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, and land and sea-based radar and electronic surveillance systems that provide their own “sensor pictures” to the missile-firing aircraft via data-link. With many assets contributing to a common tactical network “picture” via common data-link waveform and language it provides information that anyone, including the Meteor-armed fighter and the Meteor itself, can exploit. In fact, the launching jet’s pilot may never have to use his own radar at all to engage a target. Instead he simply assigns the missile a target on his situational display. The missile then gets continuous updates from third party sources—rather than the fighter that fired it—right up to its final attack sequence. Even if the data-link does not provide high-fidelity “target tracks” that does not mean they are not engagement quality as the missile only has to have the target within its own radar’s cone of detection in order to initiate the terminal attack phase of its flight. This means getting the Meteor close to the target is good enough. The Meteor’s data-link also has two-way capability, so the pilot could re-target the missile while it is already on its way. The pilot can also see the missile’s fuel, energy and tracking state in real-time. This is essential for making quick decisions as to whether or not to fire another missile at the target or to run away if it is properly tracking toward the target or has obtained its own lock. The thing is that modern data-links on missiles are not exclusive to Meteor, or to modern air-to-air missiles for that matter , but let’s keep it to that scope for this piece. Reaching peak AMRAAM Enter the AIM-120D Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), the latest incarnation of the 25 year old Raytheon-built AMRAAM which has even been adapted for surface-to-air use. The D model, which is just coming online right now, also has a two-way data-link with third party targeting capabilities like the Meteor. Additionally, it sports 50% more range than the previous version of the ARMAAM, the AIM-120C7, which itself had increased range over its predecessor variant the AIM-120C5. Some basic stats on the 25 year old AMRAAM., Raytheon Other improvements found in the AIM-120D include an enhanced seeker with a better ability to detect targets off-boresight (off the missile’s centerline axis). This is a big deal for the critical terminal phase of flight, since it can scan a larger area while trying to acquire the target on its own. This upgrade also makes it harder for the enemy to shake the missile of its trail. The AIM-120D’s capability to engage targets at short range will also be enhanced by this feature, which is a boon for the F-35, which does not carry a short-range air-to-air missile while in stealth configuration. The EA-18G Growler, which is also limited to the AIM-120 alone, will also gain uniquely from this improvement. This new AMRAAM will also feature a better navigation system with its inertial navigation system (INS) augmented with embedded GPS. Also like the Meteor, the AIM-120D has the latest electronic-countermeasure-countermeasures, making it very hard for the enemy to jam or confuse it. Overall, these improvements elevate what has already been the “gold standard” of BVR air-to-air missiles for decades. What this new AMRAAM doesn’t have is the Meteor’s ramjet engine and all the benefits that go along with it. More range over the current AIM-120 is in many ways needed to match the great leaps in fighter radar technology and networked warfare that have become a reality in the last decade and a half. Active Electronically Scanned Array radar sets can see much farther and in much higher fidelity than their mechanically scanned predecessors. This has left pilots who fly fighters equipped with them in a strange predicament where they can see the enemy from much farther away than their missiles are capable of engaging. The F-15C’s APG-63V3 AESA can reach out much farther (on an order of multiples depending on the target and scenario) than the radar it is replacing. Being able to see bad guys at well over 100 miles away, but only being able to kill that bad guy at say 40 miles is an issue for the very unstealthy Eagle, but not so much for a low-observable fighter. In fact, the F-22 Raptor (and the F-35 eventually) really don’t need larger, longer-ranged missiles, they need more missiles. F-22 firing an AIM-120 AMRAAM, USAF More missiles, please If you ask a F-22 pilot what they want more than anything else, you are very likely to hear “more missiles.” The aircraft, with its stealthiness, supercruise capability and superior situational awareness can get far closer to the bad guys without detection than their 4th generation counterparts like the F-15C. The problem is that the F-22 only has six AIM-120 AMRAAMs at its disposal, and the F-35 will only have four. Finally, adding the AIM-9X to the F-22’s quiver will actually help with this deficiency as the missile has a limited intermediate range capability, but employing it against certain targets may be too close to comfort. A solution for this conundrum is quietly in the works in the form of a smaller BVR missile like Lockheed’s conceptual Cuda air-to-air missile , also nicknamed the “Halfaraam.” This thing is like the Small Diameter Bomb of air-to-air weapons and will theoretically increase the F-22’s beyond-visual-range missile load by at least double. The F-35 will also greatly benefit from it or a weapon like it. Parallel initiatives to develop such a weapon have been recently dubbed by the USAF the Small Advanced Capability Missile (SACM) and Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM) . These are two separate research and development programs that have been awarded to Raytheon and seem to have similar goals. Lockheed’s Cuda could also evolve into a competitor for such a requirement if it were to formally move outside of the exploratory phase or even as a self-funded weapon option. Although details still remain sketchy, the Cuda’s compact size comes at the sacrifice of two things. The first is the deletion of a warhead. Instead of a 30lb-50lb shrapnel-encased charge and proximity fuse system like what most air-to-air missiles use, the Cuda will slam into its victims like a bullet. This hit-to-kill capability, which has evolved greatly in recent years via ballistic missile defense research, should cause more than enough trauma to fighters to take them down and would probably result in at least a mission kill against larger airframes. Rendering of what the hit-to-kill Cuda would look like. , Lockheed The Cuda will also sacrifice range in comparison to its more long and slender BVR missile cousins. Instead of being able to engage targets at 50 miles (or in the AIM-120D’s case likely much farther), it should be able to do so at ranges of half that distance depending on the scenario. Using such a weapon offensively may be somewhat suicidal for 4th generation fighter, but for 5th generation jets it’s a day’s work. Cuda, or a missile like it, will also likely feature extreme agility as it has to impact its target directly, not detonate its warhead nearby. This will also make it a capable short-range dogfight missile. This means aircraft like the F-35, that lack a short-range air-to-air missile during stealthy operations, would now have a good option for closer-range situations. In many ways such a weapon will complement the AMRAAM, or even the Meteor, wonderfully. Instead of carrying a pair of AMRAAMs and a full air-to-ground internal load, an F-35 could carry an AMRAAM and two Cudas. This gives F-35 pilots more options and a greater ability to defend themselves as they make their way in and out of the target area. These missiles would also likely be able to have the ability to engage surface and ground targets as well, like the AIM-9X, but at much greater ranges. For stealth aircraft, these smaller intermediate-range air-to-air missiles could be a viable weapon for suppression of enemy air defenses if adapted to that mission. With all this in mind, when it comes to the Meteor and the F-22 and F-35, there simply is far less of a need for its extreme range, and its more bulky structure would just take up more precious real estate within the jets’ weapons bays than the AIM-120 currently does. America’s air arms and the Meteor So where does the Meteor and potential future missiles like it fit in with America’s air arms? The US will operate a 4th generation fighter fleet for many decades to come, including F-15s, F-16s and F/A-18 Super Hornets. At face value the Meteor may seem like a relevant weapon for these aircraft to have in high-threat, peer-state warfare scenarios, especially if they are upgraded with AESA radar sets and the latest data-link modems, but even this is on a case-by-case basis Let’s take the US Navy for instance. With a resurgent threat from major peer-state competitors like Russia and China, the Meteor is the missile to have. It would match well with the Navy’s Super Hornet fleet which is almost entirely equipped with APG-79 AESA radars. It would also finally replace the AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile that was retired with the F-14 Tomcat. Basically it would bring back a real “fleet defender” capability to the Navy’s Carrier Air Wings, and the Super Hornet could carry a lot of Meteor’s at one time if need be and bring them back to the ship. This is something the Tomcat could not do with the Phoenix. A test flight saw the Legacy Hornet loaded up with no less than 10 AMRAAMs. , US Navy The F-15C could use the Meteor as a longer-range alternative to the AIM-120D but fitment may be an issue. Carrying four on the F-15C’s belly stations should be possible, but the feasibility of mounting them under the Eagle’s wings above drop tanks is questionable. Still, the idea of an F-15C with a pair of AIM-9Xs, a pair of AIM-120Ds, and four Meteors is very enticing as it would make the best of the F-15C’s massive AESA radar. But really the jet could get by with AIM-120D just fine for its mission, which largely includes domestic air defense tasking, and in a major conflict it would not fight alone. And this is precisely where the Meteor’s value comes into play vis-à-vis the F-15C and the F-22, but that will have to wait for a moment. As much as beyond-visual-range combat is hyped these days, and technology is certainly caught up with the concept, the operational realities that most 4th generation fighters will find themselves in the future doesn’t really support the idea that dog-fighting is dead. Rules of engagement and fear of friendly fire incidents make very long-range missile shots unpalattable during coalition operations like those we have seen time and time again against non-peer state foes over the last few decades. The cold hard reality is that visual identification of the target is still where the bar sits for weapons release during many operations. Using targeting pods slaved to a 4th generation fighter’s radar (like the F-15C has today via the Sniper pod), or using the F-35’s Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) for long-range examination of aerial targets, can help greatly with this hurdle. The only issue is that using these systems for visual identification of a potential enemy still puts such an engagement deep within the range of any AIM-120 variant. As such, the benefits the Meteor offers would are nullified. A Florida F-15C takes off with a Sniper targeting pod attached to its centerline stores pylon. The National Guard is fielding the Sniper pods to its F-15C/D units as an off-the-shelf solution for providing long-range visual identification of targets during day and night., USAF In other words, if you look at history, for the vast majority of operations the Meteor’s extreme range will be unnecessary. That does not make it irrelevant, far from it, but it all depends on what fighters an air arm has at its disposal. For instance, a country that is not buying the F-35 should invest in Meteor to get the best standoff range for their advanced 4th generation fighters. This is especially so if they feel like their fighter aircraft would be used outside of coalition operations with the US at the helm. A Super Hornet equipped Royal Canadian Air Force for instance that has to protect its great norther expanse could really use the Meteor. Meteor and the USAF’s F-22A/F-15C air dominance team Remember how we just discussed that the F-22 and the F-35 could use more missiles, lots more, especially to counter-balance against a capable home-team foe with a quantitative advantage? Well when we step outside the platform “vacuum” and look at the F-22 and F-15 as a team, you can see how the Meteor could be a huge force multiplier. F-15C and F-22 battle doctrine is still taking shape, with small but critical initiatives underway to drastically improve their interoperability. Case in point the podded Talon Hate system which you can and should read all about in one of my past features linked here . This big fuel-tank shaped pod hangs underneath an F-15C and works as a mobile information gateway data fusion center. It takes information shared among F-22s via their own proprietary and stealthy data-link, including sensor info and communications, and translates it, fuses it, and re-broadcasts it in a data-link waveform and language that F-15s can understand and display to their pilots. Most likely it also is capable of piping this information out to any Link 16 data-link user in the area. Nellis based F-15s and F-22s work to develop innovative new tactics that allow the two totally different generations of aircraft to work as a team., USAF In other words, it takes the F-22’s high-fidelity sensor picture from beyond the front lines and simulcasts it to Eagles and potentially all other allied platforms in the battlespace to see and exploit. The F-22 can receive Link 16 information but it cannot broadcast in that same form as it could give away their location. By using the Talon Hate as a translator, the F-15s and F-22s can share a common “tactical picture.” This opens up the possibility to employ a whole host of tactics that combined equal more than the sum of their parts. Boeing has unveiled concepts that have as many as 16 BVR missiles loaded onto an F-15 at one time. This loadout turns the Eagle into a small arsenal ship more than anything else. The missile laden F-15s, operating behind F-22s and even F-35s, who themselves are operating at the forward edge of the battlespace, can provide a steady supply of missiles for the stealth fighters even after their magazines run dry. Think of them as flying artillery batteries. Working as forward air controllers of sorts, stealthy fighters, and especially the F-22, can use their forward position and advanced sensors to request and direct missiles shots from F-15s operating many dozens of miles behind them. All the while the unstealthy F-15s remain outside the range of the same enemy aircraft they are sending missiles towards to kill. This is where the Meteor’s extreme range and dynamic flight profile could be extremely useful. It keeps the stealth fighters in the fight long after they have expended their own missile stocks and keeps the more vulnerable F-15s at a safe distance from threat aircraft. The opposite tactic can also be used, albeit at a decrease sensor horizon. The F-15C’s can use their massively powerful radars to scan the skies for enemy aircraft, and deliver that sensor picture to the forward operating F-22s and F-35s. With that information the stealth fighters can operate in their most deadly mode, electromagnetically silent with no radar emissions at all. Loaded with Cuda type missiles and with a full picture of the battlespace ahead, they can maraud enemy formations in great numbers. So yes, the Meteor’s range could benefit the F-15C and F-22, but not necessarily that much when you put both aircraft in a vacuum. But when you put them together and enlist the F-15C into arsenal ship operations, having the longest-range missile available with strong “end game” kinematics really enhances the capability of the F-15/F-22, and even the F-35, air dominance team. What’s new today is old tomorrow Although the Meteor is just entering service, there are new technologies around the corner that may see the missile age far faster than the AIM-120 has over the last 25 years. Then again, if MBDA can react swiftly enough to changing capabilities, the Meteor could be upgraded and reconfigured to stay at the forefront of air-to-air missile technology, albeit this proposition takes a steady stream of cash to realize. Multi-mode seekers, which primarily include both Imaging Infrared and active radar on a single missile, could benefit the AIM-120D and the Meteor, and will likely be commonplace on future BVR missiles. Such a setup means that during the terminal phase of flight the targeted aircraft will have to try and break the lock of both radar and a high-end imaging infrared seekers, the latter of which is impervious to electromagnetic jamming. Israel already has this technology working on their Arrow and Stunner interceptors and is looking to migrate the concept to the air-to-air realm. Israel’s Stunner interceptor and its “dolphin” seeker head that allows it to house both infrared and active radar sensors., Rafael Even tri-mode seekers, where BVR air-to-air missiles incorporate a anti-radiation homing function for suppression of enemy air defenses would be an ideal capability for stealthy aircraft with tight weapons bays and limited stores. This is exactly what was in the works to replace the AMRAAM in the late 2000s. The program was dubbed the Next Generation Missile (NGM) and later the Dual Role Air Dominance Missile (DRADM ) before being cancelled by the Obama Administration 2013. Since then other risk-reduction exploratory programs have emerged, like the Triple Target Terminator (T3) program led by DARPA, although not much has been heard about it for the last couple of years and it seems to have concluded after a limited flight test program was executed. It is quite likely that any next generation BVR missile will also have a robust secondary ground-attack capability using GPS, radar and even infrared homing. It is even possible that versions of Cuda-like missiles may be adapted to facilitate laser targeting capability for striking small targets with minimal collateral damage. It’s all about flexibility and an extrapolation of the hot concept of “distributed lethality,” being able to use one weapon for multiple types of engagements, thus putting the enemy at greater risk over a larger area and in more ways. The bottom line is that the AIM-120D signals the end of the AMRAAM’s design life cycle. This does not mean the final AMRAAM is not an incredibly capable missile, but there is only so much that can be pulled from a 25 year old high-performance missile design. The US will move to begin developing a new medium to long-range air-to-air missile very soon. In fact it seems pretty clear that a good chunk of this development has already happened with exploratory research and development programs, some of which were likely semi-clandestine in nature. Then again, the Pentagon could just invest in and procure the Meteor and concentrate funding on developing smaller intermediate range missiles like the Cuda that are more tailored to its burgeoning 5th generation fighter force. This way the Meteor program would get a huge influx of money and would realize much larger production numbers, thus dropping the unit cost. It would also allow for quicker upgrades to the current design to be made to suit the DoD’s needs. Sounds like a pretty slick idea right? Well it won’t happen. The problem is that doing so would have poor support from the defense lobby and no general will get another star on their collar or a big defense industry gig after retiring by importing a missile from Europe. There simply isn’t enough money in it for defense contractors and the US will have nothing to sell to customers overseas in the same class. In fact, we have laws against that sort of thing and the Meteor would likely have to be built under license here in the US if the Pentagon wanted to buy it en masse. Even then there won’t be lucrative development dollars to be had. Instead the DoD will likely independently develop a similar missile at great cost and will end up with just an upgraded Meteor. A Dassault Rafle is seen brislting with weapons, including the MBDA Meteor, Dassault Is the Meteor a must-have masterpiece? In the end the Meteor may have the longest range and largest no escape zone of any air-to-air missile in service today, but it is not necessarily the best solution for every fighter and every Air Force out there. For 5th generation stealth fighters, who can operate far closer to threats than their 4th generation progenitors, quantity is more of an advantage than range alone for most combat situations. For 4th generation fighters with modern AESA radars and a quality networked fighting force backing them up, the Meteor can be very useful in limited situations and not really relevant in many others. But when you pair 5th generation fighters with 4th generation fighters and empower them with network connectivity, the equation changes and the Meteor can elevate both via a whole set of exciting new tactics. The AIM-120D can also do this, although to a lesser degree. The thing is air combat is changing rapidly. With advanced unmanned combat air vehicles and automated swarm warfare that comes with them likely already a reality , as well as innovative ideas like the Cuda in development and airborne laser weapons on the horizon, both the AIM-120D and the Meteor are feel far less revolutionary than what seems to be right around the corner. In the end calling the Meteor the best air-to-air missile in the world is a simplification of a very complicated proposition, although it certainly seems to have the best long-range engagement capabilities. The reality is that the title of best air-to-air missile in the world depends on what aircraft it is being deployed on and what aircraft it is being deployed against, as well as the combat scenario at hand. For a Swedish JAS-39E Gripen NG, French Rafale or a Saudi Typhoon upgraded with an AESA radar the Meteor may be a dream weapon. If you are a country flying F-16s, Mirage 2000s or a similar 4th generation fighter without an AESA radar upgrade, limited networking capabilities, and especially if your country’s borders are not measured in the many hundreds or thousands of miles, the Meteor offers little benefit. Quite literally it can engage targets much farther than these jets’ radars can even see and for the air sovereignty/homeland defense mission its advantages are muffled. A Swedish Gripen is seen packing Meteor training rounds., KALM Finally, the reality is that the real performance data and the raw capabilities of these missiles are closely guarded secrets. You can find range estimates for the AIM-120D from about 40 miles to nearly 100 miles. Info on the Meteor is just as inconsistent, with range claims form from around 60 to 130 miles. How these missiles actually perform in various real-world scenarios is more important than their basic “brochure” fly-out ranges and features. The AMRAAM has been test fired nearly 4,000 times and used in combat with multiple kills, the Meteor has a long way to go to catch up to figures like that. Still, it is clear that the Meteor is a seriously capable weapon and it represents a leap in some aspects of BVR missile technology. Does that warrant the title as the best air-to-air missile in the world? Well that is up to you to decide. But as we have discussed, other leaps in air-to-air combat tech are right around the corner and there are strong indications that in this post operational 5th generation fighter reality extreme-range is no longer the Holy Grail air-to-air missile technology.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “Star Trek” celebrates its 50th anniversary this week. You probably won’t be surprised to hear that Gene Roddenberry’s wonderful creation has had a massive impact on my life. I’ve seen every minute ever produced—roughly 600 hours—and many of those minutes many times over. Although the franchise is best known for its brilliant use of science and technology, social reflection, and study of the human condition, parts of it have also been about military topics. Not only does this include tactics and strategy, but also the human toll that goes along with warfare. Phasers on stun!, CBS Every Star Trek series, and some of the films ( Undiscovered Country , First Contact ) have had fantastic takes on topics related to warfare and foreign relations. The original series started this trend ( Taste of Armageddon, A Private Little War, The Ultimate Computer, Balance Of Terror ) and The Next Generation built on it with some real gems of its own which dealt with the subject in incredibly thoughtful ways ( The Wounded, Chain of Command, Darmok, Pegasus, The High Ground, The First Duty ). Even Voyager had some winning episodes ( Year In Hell, Scorpion ) when it came to approaching the concept of war. But to this very day I remain in awe of what Deep Space Nine accomplished—and when it accomplished it. The series ran from 1993 to 1999, ending years before the terror attacks on 9/11 and the massive changes at home and abroad that followed. Yet somehow, the show explored the issues of terrorism, occupation, torture, religious persecution, the terrible burdens of command, duty, extreme surveillance, and even PTSD long before these issues were catapulted into America’s collective consciousness. What makes this even more amazing is that, by approaching these subjects outside the emotion surrounding 9/11 or the wars that followed, a far more authentic commentary could be put forward, one that was unfettered by writing that simply tried to emulate the headlines. The crew of Deep Space Nine., Youtube Screencap What made DS9 even better is that it allowed serial storytelling to take precedence over the procedural-dominated style of the first two series in the Star Trek franchise. This allowed for far deeper character development, as well as an overarching plot that saw Starfleet march into a horrific war. Some called it “darker” Trek, but really it was just more realistic, and relatable. The same core values were there, but the struggle to uphold those values, or the reasoning for abandoning them, was far more evident. The show picks up after a long and ugly occupation of an allied planet by a militaristic alien race. The Federation is a fish out of water, trying to bring their high values to a war-torn planet and an alien space station located on edge of the Alpha Quadrant. What follows is a seven year saga, the last half of which was dominated by a brutal war in space that was awesomely depicted at a time when digital effects were still largely the realm of the silver screen. DS9’s war with the Dominion brought CGI to a Star Trek television series like never before. , Screencap It was if the writers had a crystal ball showing what was to come, and the acting was exceptionally strong. Bolstered by solid talent, DS9 featured some of the most complex characters to grace the small screen (Garak, Gul Dukat, or Quark anyone?). The show thrived when it explored the gray areas of morality, the burdens of command, and the stark realities of war in which the heroes don’t always come out on top. Gul Dukot was one of the greatest villians to grace the small screen., Startrek.com The show really is greater than the sum of its parts when watched as a whole, and there is a lot going on in every episode, but at least the episodes below that address topics related to war will get you hooked.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",M80 Stiletto Is The Pentagon’s Stealthy Little Experimental Ship That Could,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Although it looks like something from another world, the M80 Stiletto is ship designed for littoral, or “brown water,” operations. The unique craft was ordered in the mid 2000s by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s now defunct Office For Transformation (OFT). The vessel was originally envisioned as the centerpiece of an initiative called Project WolfPAC which aimed to revolutionize “netcentric” command and control capabilities and combat effectiveness of small ships operating cooperatively with other vessels, special warfare units and drones in the challenging littoral environment. Think of it as a stealthy floating supercomputer, mothership and command and control station that is capable of rocketing through the water at high-speeds in very shallow waters. The Stiletto program was also an element of a larger push by Admiral Arthur Cebrowski, who ran the OFT, to get the Navy to rely less on a relatively small number of vulnerable capital ships in favor of smaller, cheaper and more numerous vessels outfitted with cutting-edge technology. The DoD described WolfPAC as such: “In the 21st Century, warfare will require agility and the application of tailored forces against more diffuse threats. These threats will retreat to the most complex terrain and will take advantage of both local and global seams in modern society. As part of an overall Joint Force, SOF and SOF-like forces must be prepared to support multiple simultaneous, distributed, decentralized battles and campaigns against both conventional and unconventional adaptive enemies. The threat has been watching intently and has designed denial and deception strategies, which may blunt or negate our technological superiority or may inhibit a force that is over-reliant on strike and single lines of advance. Therefore it is incumbent upon tomorrow’s joint forces to be interdependently networked and coherent to “conduct simultaneous, distributed and parallel operations synergistically across the levels of warfare, in depth. rr WolfPAC is an Office of Force Transformation (OFT) operational experiment designed to explore command and control of geographically dispersed, networked, autonomous and semi-autonomous assets. rr Forces are increasingly burdened by the lack of a coherent strategy to “control” large numbers of dispersed assets. Distributing those assets geographically, loosely federated by networks, only serves to increase the complexity of these controlling challenges. As an experimental venue, WolfPAC will serve to resolve some of the most stressing tactical and operational networked command and control challenges. As an operational experiment, WolfPAC will use a wide variety of assets and will investigate whether or not a new approach to command and control can be engineered practically and advanced operationally. The co-evolution of emerging technology with experimentation will serve to generate operationally relevant lessons for commanders and provide them with the means to command and control distributed, adaptive operations in the riverine and littoral environment.” What is really being described here are the computers and communications suite intended for Stilleto, as well design requirements for a ship defined by the smaller craft it is slated to carry and operate. But the M80’s unique shape, which is more spatula than stilleto-like, also comes from a pressing need to find a solution for the pounding that crews and SEALs take while traveling at high-speed through rough water on traditional v-hulled boats. The Pentagon describes the M80’s M-shaped hull and their reason for procuring it for tests: “Stiletto is designed to channel the energy that normally is produced as wake in a conventional V-Hull craft up under the craft into tunnels created by the M-shaped hull form. The energy normally lost to an inverted V-shaped wake is now channeled into the tunnels under the craft producing a hydrodynamic lift as Stiletto makes way through the water… The craft passively lifts itself out of the water about a foot as it speeds along reducing drag. The relatively light weight of the all carbon fiber structure compared to a steel or aluminum craft and the inherent strength of the carbon fiber itself makes for a very favorable payload fraction and of course, lends to its high-speed characteristics. rr Stiletto was designed with the needs of our special forces in mind. SEALS belonging to the Navy have traditionally rode a V-Hull craft from miles offshore to insert their teams on potentially hostile shores. The wave action and resulting rough ride of the V-Hull has, over the years, taken their toll on these SEALs such that nearly a third of them are medically discharged within just 10 years of service due to the pounding G-forces applied to their bodies. The M-Hull was designed to reduce the wakes of commercial ferries in Venice to help minimize the effects of wake damage to their aging buildings. Applying the concept of a high-speed, wave-piercing assault craft to the M-Hull technology, OFT partnered with the US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to build a mother craft to help insert their personnel so an internal boat well that can accommodate their 11-meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) was designed into the craft.” The M80’s unique hull design looks like something from another planet., M-Ship Stiletto’s hullform drastically reduces the ship’s drag, wake and acoustic signature, and also reduces the continuous smacking of the hull against the water while operating at high speeds. It also provides a far more stable platform than a traditional monohull designs – great for launching and recovering smaller vehicles, manned and unmanned alike. So really, Stiletto started out as a technology demonstrator with complimentary goals in mind. One had more to do with the unique physical form of the vessel itself, and the other had to do more with what went inside the vessel. The idea was that the M80’s design, including its M-shaped hull, could be drastically scaled up or down, that is, if they ever wanted to put a vessel based on the design into production at all. Stiletto at the end of her construction in San Diego., M-Ship The M-Ship Company designed Stiletto and it was built by the Knight & Carver, a commercial and private ship builder out of San Diego, utilizing advanced composites and a slew of then cutting-edge technologies with an emphasis on adaptability. This included an open architecture computer network concept – dubbed an electronic keel – that was originally made up of a 1-gigabit local area network, with four server racks housing Kontron blade servers. Flat screen tactical displays dispersed throughout the ship, including on a series of sci-fi looking, shock absorbing mission stations located in the ship’s mission compartments, are capable of presenting a “fused picture” of Stiletto’s combat environment by marrying information from radars, electronic service measures, unmanned air, surface and underwater craft, data-links, infrared systems and other sensors. The idea was that new technology could be added on a plug-and-play basis by just plugging the hardware in via a USB interface and having software loaded onto the ship’s computer system for quick integration. This easily reconfigurable “electronic keel” concept is now becoming a common feature on many American combat vessels, from high-tech patrol boats to stealth destroyers . The ship went from concept to a reality in just 18 months, incredibly fast considering how unique it was at the time, and frankly, how unique it still is today. The cost to build the M80 was a relatively scant $10 million (some reports put it as $6 million). Naval Special Warfare Center Carderock’s Combat Craft Division, known for having some of the strangest and most shadowy special operations craft on the planet in their stable, would serve as technical and operational overseers of the program. Although Stilleto was born in San Diego, the vessel would eventually would be based in Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek where it remains today. Being nearly half as wide as it is long (88.60 X 40 feet), with its unique M-shaped hull design that offers a relatively tiny draft, Stilleto can operate in as little as two and a half feet of water. This could put beaches and even the well decks of amphibious combat ships theoretically within its operational purview. The M80 features a unique prop placement configuration that works well in shallow environments but jet drives could take their place for extremely shallow water operations. Stiletto’s extremely shallow draft design does not come at the sacrifice of speed or stability.  The ship is powered by a quartet of Caterpillar C32 1652hp engines and can hit velocities of nearly 70 miles per hour, or 60 knots. While fully outfitted, a high-speed in the 50-55 knot range is more common. At full speed it has a range of 500 miles, but that can be extended with auxiliary fuel tanks, and its range greatly expands while ‘cruising’ at around 40 knots. The M80 is capable of operating in sea state five (13 foot waves), and has been tested at 51 knots in sea state four conditions (8 foot waves). Its pancake-like design offers a large internal volume not constrained by the normal linear configuration of standard vessels. This results in a very spacious mission and cargo bay area and flight-deck on top that covers the majority of the ship’s planform. A rear ramp for launching and recovering rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) and unmanned surface and undersurface vehicles is also included in the baseline design. Navy SEALs approach the M80’s rear boat ramp in a RHIB., DoD The M80 is light enough to be craned aboard larger vessels acting as a mothership, or for very long-range repositioning transits. Its maximum gross weight is 67 tons, with nearly 45% of that being dedicated to payload. So there is plenty of capacity for fitting new systems and carrying additional cargo beyond the three crew, 12 SEALs, a 11 meter RHIB, and some small unmanned aircraft and its innovative control stations and computer gear as defined by the baseline configuration. These features result in a small littoral combat ship with a special knack for supporting special operations and interdiction missions. Yet the adaptability that was an original hallmark of the M80 design has allowed it to survive and keep working over a decade after it was introduced into service. After being handed over to the Navy in 2006 and run through tests related to the WolfPAC initiative, it was thrown into a long list of complex multi-ship exercises. During these exercises the stealthy ship transported special operations personnel, was used as a command and control ship, operated as part of mine clearing operations, and worked as a drug interdiction platform. Eventually it was sent to the Caribbean spent time in Columbia where it ran down drug runners with some success, following them where other vessels could not, namely over shallow reefs at high-speed. In 2012, the M80 even worked for NASA, snatching up the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) test article that had been launched from Wallops Island and splashed down off the North Carolina coast. The M80 was also used in one of the first proof of concept missions for launching light unmanned aircraft from small vessels in support of special operations. The aircraft were used for beyond-line-of-sight communications relays and providing real-time overhead surveillance for SEALs during operations. Today, deploying small UAVs from tactical fast boats has become commonplace, especially in the special operations community. https://youtube.com/watch?v=XUpi8iarTj4 Fast forward to today and Stiletto’s mission has morphed dramatically. Many of the technological concepts and capabilities it originally featured and tested have since matured and have migrated to frontline forces and weapons platforms. Its open architecture command and control and communications suite in particular, and the “distributed” combat operations model it was built to help evolve, certainly have become a mainstay of modern American warfare. But just because these accomplishments are behind Stiletto doesn’t mean the boat has become irrelevant. The M80 during UAV recovery operations., USN Today the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO) facilitates the use of M80 for quickly testing and fielding new and potentially disruptive maritime technologies such as cutting-edge sensors and unmanned craft by the Pentagon, the defense industry, foreign governments and academic institutions. By leveraging Stiletto’s ease of adaptability, all types of cutting-edge capabilities can be rushed into trials, after which they can be quickly evaluated, and either sent back for more development, sent to operational units or passed over entirely. Which might leave you wondering why Stiletto never made it into production. Well, first off, it was never really a prototype, it was a technology demonstrator. Additionally, some sources state that the ship’s commercial grade manufacturing and carbon-fiber composite construction were simply too foreign and unproven for the Navy to bet on it in a big way. Today M-Ship is working to alleviate this issue with its “Tough Ship” initiative . Stiletto’s M shaped hull was also thought to have been more ideally suited for littoral environments than open water, where it could encounter heavy sea states for long periods of time. Finally, the Navy became deeply invested in the troubled Littoral Combat Ship program . This vessel was far larger and more expensive than even a vastly enlarged M80 would likely have been, and it relied on aluminum hull construction instead of composites. Its mission set was also different, having to take on some roles of the “blue water” Perry class frigate it would partially replace. A “mission module” concept also dictated the LCS design, something that in has proven to be a developmental disaster. Stiletto operating at night., DoD The LCS has struggled since its birth, and having another littoral combat ship of sorts, and a smaller and far cheaper one, would have been a big threat to the more lucrative program. Additionally, the LCS program has long been touted as a solution for increasing the Navy’s declining mainline hull inventory number, not just creating adaptable, cheap and effective “boats” for fighting in the littoral environment. Still, M-Ship continues to evolve the theoretical M80 design, and has come up with a drone mothership offering known as the Stiletto Maritime Operations Center, an inexpensive brown water mothership of sorts for unmanned capabilities. The Navy doesn’t seem to interested in it at this time, and Special Operations Command has angled for a far larger mothership of their own. Often times, proof of concept and technology demonstrator vehicles get discarded after their intended test program has concluded. Some survive and even thrive in private hands , but normally their unique configuration and experimental components make continued operations unaffordable and sustainability troublesome. As such, that fact that the sub $10 million M80 is still creating value for the Pentagon, even if only intermittently, is downright amazing. Although neither the M80 or its M-shaped hull made it into active service, this “Millennium Falcon” of Navy vessels’ influence on other designs and subsystems that did is undeniable. And Stiletto appears to be set to continue work as a facilitator for emerging maritime combat technologies for years to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 14, 2019",Leaving Nuclear Weapons In Turkey Is Just Poor Strategy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dating back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the US agreed to Russia’s demand to withdraw its Jupiter nuclear-tipped missiles from Turkish soil, American nuclear weapons in Turkey has been a hot-button issue. Today, around 50 tactical nuclear weapons are thought to remain at a highly guarded facility inside the perimeter of Incirlik Air Base located in southwest Turkey. Considering the recent headlines , continuing to forward deploy them at the base may not be the brightest idea. An F-15C on temporary duty from RAK Lakenheath blasts out of Incirlik Air Base., AP Incirlik Air Base has long been a remote operating location for the United States’ air arms, but the Turkish Government has been increasingly more aggressive in dictating how the US uses it. The base was barred from use during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, and it took the US nearly a year to persuade Turkey to allow anti-ISIS strike missions . Yet all the while, the base held a pocket force of America’s most destructive weapons, even though no aircraft are permanently stationed there to deploy them. The truth is, the nuclear weapons at Incirlik Air Base are largely symbolic. America currently has 180-200 tactical nukes deployed among four European host countries: Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Yet this number represents just a tiny fraction of the warheads deployed to Europe during the height of the Cold War —around 7,300 in total. American nukes’ continuous deployment to the continent is one that supposedly anchors America’s commitment to NATO and deters Russian aggression. Their presence, at least at one time, was also meant to keep host countries from developing their own nuclear arsenals. Yet following the violent coup attempt on the sitting Turkish government in July, and President Erdogan’s extreme response to it, ousting 82,000 government workers and arresting 23,000 supposed coup supporters , along with Turkey’s sudden cozying up to Moscow , this strategy now looks murky and convoluted at best. President Erdogan has even blamed his NATO allies, including the US, at least partially, for instigating the coup, adding to an increasing rift between the US, NATO and Turkey. Dramatic footage of Turkish aircraft being used to attack their own countrymen during the coup on July 15th, 2016: https://youtube.com/watch?v=https%3A What’s most alarming is that Icirlik Air Base had power cut to it for nearly a week following the events of July 15th, the airspace around the base was also closed, halting anti-ISIS missions and curtailing any potential air-bridge access from the base to the outside world. Meanwhile, large anti-US protests were building along the base’s front gate and perimeter fencing. Not only that, but Turkish aircraft and personnel based at Incirlik took part in the coup, including flying sorties in support of it. Even the base’s commander was arrested for taking part in the operation , after he crossed the ramp to beg for asylum from the US. Does this seem like a foreign base that should be safeguarding nuclear arms? The fact that there is a civil war and an established terror state operating within a country located just 70 miles from Incirlik Air Base should also be factored into America’s nuclear weapons risk equation. B61 tactical nuclear gravity bombs., USAF Still, it is unlikely that the 700-pound B61 nuclear bombs would be stolen from the facility. The storage area is made up of underground vaults, and its perimeter is ringed with two security fences and loads of surveillance, not to mention the compliment of soldiers there to protect the weapons. The facility has also received recent upgrades to make it more hardened against intrusion. However, if Turkey’s increasingly totalitarian political leadership were to take a vehemently anti-American stance, the security that protects the nukes would amount to a speed-bump for Turkey’s armed forces. Even a very well-orchestrated and large-scale terrorist attack on the compound could lead to a disastrous situation, even if only geopolitically. On the other hand, you can’t simply steal a B61 nuclear bomb and use it as you wish. The fusing system is protected by a code mechanism called a Permissive Action Link (PAL). The codes needed to authorize their activation have to be provided by the National Command Authority. The weapons also must be continuously maintained to be combat effective. An airman showing off the B61’s PAL system., USAF These nuclear gravity bombs also feature a command disable mode which allows handlers to disable the weapon in fairly quick order. This is done by entering the right code to activate the bomb’s thermal battery, which also detaches the bomb’s control handle in the process. The battery overheats and fries the weapons electronics, thus making the weapon incapable of triggering its nuclear warhead. The parts that make up a B61 tactical nuke., DOE Supposedly, the B-61 must be sent back to depot for a complete overhaul in order for it to be capable of functioning normally once again after a command disable action, although there are differing theories as to just how hard it would be for a very dedicated entity, especially a state actor, to get the weapon in working order once again. Some say it is quite possible. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qj4xIR8tYyQ If under an imminent threat of seizure, the facility’s security teams and the vaults that the bombs are held in could give technicians time to attempt to disable the weapons via the command disable function. If executed, and all the weapons were rendered useless, at least temporarily, even threatening the technicians directly to bring them back online would be a useless exercise. The value of the actual warhead’s nuclear material is also debatable, as designing a weapon around it would require great know-how and testing would likely be required. Regardless, the weapons could be fashioned into crude but potentially very deadly dirty bombs. Security forces train at Incirlik Air Base., USAF The truth is, that if the base were seized, the US would likely attempt to flatten it before the weapons were able to be dispersed, but doing so would be unprecedented on a massive scale and it would take time to accomplish. A mission would likely have to originate out of the Middle East, the continental US, or using tactical aircraft out of Europe, although they would have to be able to carry sufficient “bunker busters” (BLU-109 equipped JDAMs, GBU-24/27) to strike all 21 storage vaults located at Incirlik. As we saw in Benghazi, tactical aircraft are not held at a high-readiness for strike operations in the region, and especially not equipped at the ready with bunker busters. The idea of a country stealing nuclear weapons from the US has long been a staple of pop culture fascination, but the reality is far less sensational. Still, an incident where American nuclear weapons security was directly threatened could be a massive geopolitical failure for the United States, and if they were to fall into someone else’s hands, even those of a close former ally, it would be devastating to American credibility abroad, regardless of if they can actually be used or not. On the other hand, if their withdrawal were made public, some say it would set a bad precedent and offer disturbing symbolism for NATO. Then again, if the alliance is that weak, than we have much bigger problems, especially considering that there would still be around 150 American nuclear bombs deployed to four other NATO countries. Will 50 less make that big of a difference? No it won’t. That is unless the US plans to leave a standing contingent of fighters at Incirlik Air Base with crews trained and ready to fly these weapons into combat at a moment’s notice, which it doesn’t. C-17 takes off from Incirlik Air Base., AP There is actually fairly recent precedent for a similar withdrawal. In 2001, the US quietly removed its forward deployed nuclear weapons from Turkey’s neighbor across the Aegean Sea, Greece. Multiple factors played into the decision, but security was one of the prominent ones. There is also nothing to say that the US cannot redeploy these weapons if the security situation improves in Turkey. But really, this may be the perfect time for the US to reevaluate its nuclear arsenal and the strategy that defines it as a whole. This is already happening to some degree due to a much needed upgrade of many of the weapons and delivery systems that remain outdated technological relics of the Cold War. Even the B61 is getting a smart-bomb makeover. These measures, along with a new nuclear-capable stealth bomber, new nuclear ballistic missile submarines, possibly a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, and at least a major overhaul of land-based Minutemen ICBMs, are one hell of a lot of ways to destroy the planet many times over.  It also comes at one massive price tag — $348 billion over the next decade alone alone. Minuteman III launching. , USAF Could at least a portion of this money be spent on conventional defense capabilities? Is the nuclear triad as relevant as it once was? Could America enhance certain aspects of its nuclear capabilities and save money by converting to a two-prong nuclear strategy? These are all larger questions that need to be addressed, but in the meantime, 50 tactical nuclear weapons sit at an air base that took part in a military coup, and whose leader is increasingly looking like a paranoid dictator with morphing geopolitical priorities. A Turkish F-4 Phantom recovering at Incirlik Air Base., USAF With all this in mind, and weighing the potentially great costs against the scant benefits, it is time to pull these weapons out of Turkey, even if it is done clandestinely. Right now the perception of a nuclear capability is more what America’s nuclear weapons deployment to Incirlik Air Base is all about, and they don’t actually have to be there in full operational form to provide that. This can even be a temporary decision, and the strategy can be reevaluated once things have stabilized and Erdogan’s agenda is better defined. Although, the whole idea of having nuclear bombs forward deployed without aircraft on alert and crews trained to deliver them seems absurd in the first place. When it comes to America’s nuclear arsenal, the old rule “better safe than sorry” should apply.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 19, 2020","The Navy’s New Stealth Destroyer Has Watered Down Capabilities, Questionable Future","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Next month the first DDG-1000 Zumwalt class stealth destroyer will be commissioned into US Navy service. The program has been through three name changes since it began two decades ago and the design’s planned production run has been slashed dramatically from nearly three dozen hulls to a measly three. The truth is that the assault on the Zumwalts started long before production was cut. The ship you see today, even in all its exotic glory, is the sad result of a long series of illogical cost-cutting initiatives and spastic fiscal re-prioritizations by the Navy. These misguided measures left the final Zumwalt class design a truncated and far less capable mutation of how it was originally envisioned, and degradation to the class’ capabilities continue to this day. The story of how the Zumwalt class came to be is long, complicated and meandering, but the ship’s core concept was spurned in the 1990s under the Surface Combatant For The 21st Century (SC21) initiative . Both a cruiser and a destroyer were to evolve from a similar SC21 design. The cruiser could replace the Navy’s aging Ticonderoga class cruisers and the slightly smaller SC21 destroyer would eventually augment, then replace the young rleigh Burke class . By 2002 the SC21 cruiser had been cut, and a new cruiser program dubbed the CG-X was started alongside the DD-X, which would eventually become the Zumwalt class. The ship to be commissioned USS Zumwalt on a shakedown cruise., USN Different by design: The DDG-1000 is about one-third larger in displacement than the latest Flight IIA Arleigh Burke destroyers, clocking in at around 14,500 tons, and it’s is innovative in a number of ways. Its low observable (stealthy design, which includes  multiple spectrum signature reduction, including electromagnetic emissions, radar, acoustic and infrared, is unprecedented on such a large scale. The ship’s power plant is absolutely cutting-edge, as is its electric distribution system. Dubbed the Integrated Power System, the system uses the ship’s gas turbines and generators to produce massive amounts of electricity that can be distributed in a “smart” manner throughout the ship. Gone are the mechanical linkages between the ship’s turbines and its shafts, instead the screws are turned by electric motors. Although this “hybrid” propulsion concept is not new, the totality of the system and the amount of power the DDG-1000 can produce is. In total a Zumwalt class ship can generate a ridiculous 78 megawatts of electricity, which is enough to power nearly 10,000 average american homes. Even while cruising at 20 knots the ship has a whopping 58 megawatts of reserve power. The Zumwalt’s Integrated Power System keeps that power in reserve for new technologies to be fitted in the future, like lasers and especially electricity-chugging electromagnetic railguns . An EM Railgun is not just a land or surface attack weapon. Its super-high velocity and flat-shooting projectiles should be capable of blasting aircraft out of the sky at long-range, and it may even have the ability to engage fast-approaching ballistic missiles. The Zumwalts will also mark the return of naval gunfire support to the Pentagon’s active weapons portfolio, a capability that has been lost since the retirement of the Iowa class battleships in the early 1990s. Although the ships will not pack anywhere near the heavy-hitting punch of the Iowa’s 16 inch guns, they will be able to sling 155mm rounds much further and much more accurately. A slew of versatile munitions can be fired from DDG-1000’s Automatic Gun Systems (AGS), including GPS guided and rocket-assisted rounds, giving the Zumwalt’s high-volume and extremely accurate precision fire-support capability over a range of 75 miles (100 miles according to some sources). Defense News Daily writes: “The Zumwalt Class’ 2 Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) are each expected to fire up to 10 rounds per minute, using an automated magazine. The 304 round magazine has to organize and process ammunition and propellant changes from up to 38 pallets. Each pallet weighs about 6,000-pounds, holding 8 propelling charges, and 8 of the 230-pound, GPS-guided 155mm Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) shells. The gun can take and fire up to 10 rounds per minute, which BAE explains as “140 to 160 projectiles in the air at once [with] multiple round simultaneous impact effects against single or multiple targets.” On the other hand, actually doing that would quickly exhaust this ship’s 2 magazines.” Impressive to say the least. The AGS allows the Zumwalt to support ground forces, including special operations teams which can be deployed on small boats through the ship’s stealthy rear ramp, without the need for close air support assets. The DDG-1000 will have those as well. The ship can support MH-60R Seahawk helicopters that can sling AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and laser-guided rockets, as well as by MQ-8B and MQ-8C Firescout unmanned helicopters carrying a similarly deadly payload and providing reconnaissance and network relay functions over long distances. Emerging capabilities like the tail-sitting TERN will only increase the Zumwalt’s punch and aerial data-collection capabilities. Zumwalt also has 80 Mark 57 vertical launch cells that line her gunnels, each capable of carrying up to four Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles, a single RGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile or an ASROC rocket-assisted torpedo . In the future, stealthy and far more capable missiles, like LRASM , could be fitted. In addition, the Zumwalt class has some very high-end sonar gear, including hull-mounted high-frequency and mid-frequency sonar systems that are optimized to detect submarines and mines in the challenging littoral (near-shore) environment. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pEa-WwEgXiE The Zumwalt will go to sea with a crew of about 150 people – less than half that of the smaller Arleigh Burke class. It is supposed to accomplish this feat primarily through automation, and a completely new, open-architecture “electronic keel” has been designed into the ship. Dubbed the Total Shipboard Computing Environment, this network and computing system, will take advantage in leaps in automation while its massive coffin-like hardened servers fuse the ship’s sensor information, weapons capabilities, communications, navigation, engineering and even the ship’s predicted radar, acoustic and emissions signature at any given time into an integrated command and control interface. This information will be piped around the ship on common computing stations, so with the proper access, someone could control the ship’s navigation from engineering, or its weapons from the bridge. It is all very Star Trek: The Next Generation . The nerve-center of the ship is also new. Gone is the classic low-ceilinged and vault-like Combat Information Center (CIC) of AEGIS equipped destroyers and cruisers. In its place is the SMC, the Ship’s Mission Center, which looks more like a starship command center than something found on a surface combatant. Taken together, you get a ship that is intended to be able to fight far forward of any other major surface combatant in the Navy’s inventory. At least, that’s the idea. That capability could have wide implications for when fighting in an anti-access, area-denial scenario . In effect, Zumwalt is supposed to be able to bring its weapons, sensors and even special operations personnel to bear earlier in a conflict than its predecessors, all while ingesting information that it can feed back to less survivable weapons systems operating hundreds of miles further away from the enemy. This all sounds well and good, but the Zumwalt also has its fair share of controversies, and not just those related to its $4B plus price tag, or its whopping $10 billion in development costs. The stability of its unique tumblehome hull form , the size of the crew in relation to the size of the ship, their ability to handle battle damage in combat, and the durability of the ship’s composite superstructure are among other serious “nuts and bolts” issues raising questions about the DDG-1000. We will have to wait and see whether these concerns prove credible. Old Mistakes Die Hard- The Zumwalt class lacks a close-in air defense weapon system: The DDG-1000 does not have a close-in weapon system (CIWS) , used as a last line of defense against incoming anti-ship missiles. Today the US Navy uses variations of the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile , now in its second block form, and updated versions of the venerable Mk15 Phalanx gun system for this role. So why would the Navy omit such a critical system on such a valuable ship that will be fighting in the most inhospitable of combat environments? https://youtube.com/watch?v=7ahU2tN-efo One possibility is that the cost to integrate such a system into the ship’s stealthy slab-sided design was deemed too great by decision-makers in the Pentagon. The second possibility, one I find even more troubling, is that a dedicated CIWS was not included in the final Zumwalt configuration because the ship’s proposed “stealthiness” gave it greater survivability than its unstealthy counterparts, allowing for the omission of a CIWS as an acceptable risk. Wouldn’t such a statement do wonders when selling the program on Capitol Hill? Either way, the decision was incredibly near-sighted and potentially deadly. The reality is that the Zumwalts , like all low-observable (stealthy) weapon systems, are NOT invisible. They are simply detectable at shorter ranges by certain sensors when compared with their more conventional predecessors. Low observability, especially for a ship, is a fantastic capability largely proven by Lockheed’s Sea Shadow technology demonstrator in the 1980s and 1990s. But for a capable and well-networked foe, there are ways to detect and prosecute a missile attack on a ship at standoff distances that do not necessarily include radars–or at least the ones whose operating bands the Zumwalt class is designed to evade. For instance, long-range over-the-horizon radar systems that use low frequencies have the ability to detect stealth ships and aircraft under some conditions, and their fidelity is only increasing as more capable computer processing power becomes available. So unless these arrays are destroyed before Zumwalt moves into their detection range, assuming there is political will to do so, then detection and possible low-fidelity targeting of the stealthy ship is possible even over great distances. Technology aside, an enemy may just get lucky, or use non-traditional forms of searching and tracking even the stealthiest of ships. Even with the Zumwalt’s low-observable features, engagement by anti-ship missiles– some of which travel at very high-speed and can be launched in large salvos–is possible. Additionally, if the ship were struck in another fashion, by a torpedo, mine, aircraft dropped munition or anti-ship ballistic missile, it is doubtful that its radar signature would stay highly masked and the Zumwalt’s visual and infrared signature would certainly blossom exponentially from the damage. In those circumstances, damage control with the Zumwalt’s small crew would be bad enough. Not having a CIWS capable of rapid engagements, one that would work automatically as sea-skimming missiles homed in on a now unmasked and crippled ship, is a very empty-headed call. In war the unexpected or unlikely is bound to happen, and vulnerabilities in any technology–no matter how advanced–can be exploited by the enemy without warning. It’s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to a critical last line of defense against increasingly prevalent air-breathing anti-ship missiles. Especially since these munitions are increasingly networked and able to search an area for targets of opportunity, and engage those targets all on their own, even without the use of any kind of radar. Anti-ship missiles are also increasingly “dual-mode” capable when it comes to their terminal homing abilities. This means that they have both radar and imaging infrared sensors to detect their target and prosecute their final attack. Even though the DDG-1000’s infrared signature is supposedly reduced, it’s not eliminated. The Zumwalt’s hot gun barrels and vertical launch system cells won’t help keep the DDG-1000 undetectable to infrared sensors during combat. Some may say that cutting edge “soft kill” defensive capabilities have enough merit to omit a CIWS. These include utilizing the ship’s powerful AESA radar to shoot pencil thin beams of energy that fry a missile’s sensitive sensor components, lasers that dazzle electro-optical or infrared sensors, flares and smoke screens that misdirect missile seekers or obscure the ship’s infrared signature, and high-end electronic warfare systems that can confuse or blind the radars of incoming missiles. While countermeasure technologies are advancing more rapidly than ever, It’s doubtful that they are good enough to rely on them solely, especially when 150 sailor’s lives are at risk aboard America’s most expensive and supposedly capable surface combatant. The enemy can adapt their weapons with hardened missile components and dual mode seekers, or even tri-mode seekers (adding electromagnetic homing capabilities) for terminal guidance. This is just the never ending saga of measure and countermeasure. And in a conflict with a peer-state, the enemy would be unlikely to fire a single missile. Instead, the Zumwalt should be prepared for multiple missiles of multiple types, flying diverse flight profiles and from multiple vectors, in an attempt to overwhelm a ship’s defenses. And since DDG-1000 will often be working alone, far ahead of the fleet, closer to shores where its weapons and sensors are optimized to perform, an overwhelming and multi-layered attack that comes at short notice with little time to react is very real possibility. You would think that fixed versions of the Rolling Airframe Missile launcher that sit flush behind sliding doors on each side of DDG-1000s deckhouse could have been feasible, but as of now nothing like this has been described as existing on the design. One day Rolling Airframe Missiles may be adapted to be fired from the ship’s Mk57 vertical launch system, but this would put the missile at an energy disadvantage after launch and only four missiles per cell have been rumored to have been proposed. Seeing that the ship only has 80 VLS cells in total, that’s a lot of precious real estate to take up for just a handful of missiles. Still, there is no indication that this capability is being seriously looked at for DDG-1000. Even the mounting of a Oerlikon Millennium Naval Revolver Gun in its stealthy housing would be an off-the-shelf CIWS solution for the Zumwalt class, and one that would make far more sense while being much less expensive than integrating a whole new missile concept with the ship. As designed, the DDG-1000s were intended to pack a pair of 57mm Mk110 cannons which have limited aerial CIWS capabilities. Generally, this gun is capable, especially with P3 programmable ammo loaded in it, but it does not offer the reliability, maneuverability and rapid engagement capability of the RIM-116 RAM or even the independent operation and volume of fire of the 20mm Vulcan cannon equipped Phalanx. The Mk110 gun system in its stealthy enclosure. Two of these would have been mounted above the rear corners of DDG-1000’s hangar. , Poxnar/wikicommons Even the diminutive Littoral Combat Ship , w h i c h packs the same 57mm gun system, is equipped with a CIWS in the form of the Mk 15 Phalanx or SeaRAM–a self-contained version of the Rolling Airframe Missile system that merges a RAM magazine with the Phalanx’s mount and radar system. It seems more than just a little odd that an LCS will have better close-in protection against incoming air-breathing threats than the world’s most advanced and expensive surface combatant in a last line of defense scenario. Especially considering the DDG-1000 is meant to penetrate further into high-threat environments than any other surface vessel, while the LCS can’t even fight in medium threat environments without an AEGIS equipped destroyer or cruiser protecting it nearby. But the omissions didn’t stop there. Even the limited CIWS capability offered by the Mk110 57mm cannons were eliminated from the Zumwalt class baseline design in 2014. This late revision was justified by the Navy as a move that would save money and weight. Now the ships will get two cheaper and much smaller Mk46 30mm Bushmaster cannons w i t h m i n i m a l a i r d e f e n s e c a p a b i l i t y that are largely curtailed to use defending the ship against swarming small boat attacks at very close ranges (about two miles or less) and have no real air defense capability. Even the 30mm’s effectiveness against swarming small boats is being questioned when compared with the much longer-ranged 57mm guns that were intended for the ship. The Zumwalt will also carry RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs ), four of which can be packed into a single vertical launch system tube. These maneuverable missile have close-in engagement capabilities, but the Navy has already come to terms with the fact that they cannot replace a CIWS. Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers were originally to be equipped without a CIWS, and many initially sailed without one installed, relying totally on VLS launched ESSMs for close-in to medium-range protection. This proved to be short sighted, and the ships have since been retrofitted with a proper CIWS system. And the Navy’s commitment to dedicated CIWS systems has since accelerated. The Navy destroyers that are forward deployed to Spain, ones that often sail into the super anti-ship missile engagement zone that is the Black Sea , are getting SeaRAM systems installed in addition to the Phalanx CIWS they already carry. Moral of the story? American destroyers are getting up-gunned with more CIWS capability, not the other way around. The Zumwalt’s area air defense and ballistic missile defense capabilities were thrown overboard long ago: It is logical to think that the Navy’s new stealth super destroyer would be well stocked with a variety of the latest surface-to-air missile technologies, creating a “layered air defense” ranging hundreds of miles from the ship. Every American Navy cruiser and destroyer built in the last 30 years has had this feature set at the heart of their multi-mission capabilities. Yet once again, when it comes to the stripped down Zumwalts, this is not the case. These destroyers ended up being focused on the land bombardment and littoral dominance missions, not on air defense–even though these mission requires robust air defense capabilities to be successful. Area air defense and anti-ballistic missile patrol duty will instead be provided by the upcoming Flight III Arleigh Burke class ships and existing Aegis equipped surface combatants. In fact, while the DDG-1000 has most of the physical hardware needed for wide-area air defense missions, and even anti-ballistic missile defense, it runs non-Aegis software that does not have the capability to fire and use the SM-2/3/6 “Standard” series of missiles . Making things worse, half its intended radar system, one that would have made it the most capable air defense asset ever sent to sea, was gutted as a cost saving measure. https://youtube.com/watch?v=evDMRR5gqpA As a result, the DDG-1000 will only be stocked with Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs) for self defense against aerial threats, vastly restricting the range and breadth of the ship’s counter-air potential. The RIM-162 ESSM has the ability to fly out to around 30 miles, which pales in comparison to the long-range and heavy hitting Standard missile series carried by the Navy’s existing AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. Additionally, the large S-band SPY-4 radar array, originally designed to be 22 feet high and to work in concert with the smaller X-band SPY-3 radar array as part of the integrated Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) system, was removed from DDG-1000. The reasoning behind this was to save on cost, but it also promoted the upcoming Flight III Arleigh Burke ships into the area air defense and anti-ballistic missile defense role exclusively. This system would have allowed the Zumwalts to utilize SPY-4 for volume search, long-range tracking, ballistic missile discrimination and some missile communications and SPY-3 for horizon search, high-fidelity tracking, target illumination and missile communications simultaneously in an unprecedented, fused, “dual band” manner. Instead, the smaller SPY-3 radar was installed without its counterpart SPY-4, and the SPY-3 system was given software to perform both roles, although with severely degraded overall capabilities. https://youtube.com/watch?v=K1-_4tfWR4c So between the undeveloped software, inability to fire Standard Missiles, and the omission of the originally intended radar suite, a ship that could have set a new standard in surface-based air warfare capability was drastically degraded to save a few bucks and to cement the Arleigh Burke Flight III’s future. The strangest thing about this decision is that the full Dual Band AMDR system, with both arrays, will be installed on the USS Gerald R. Ford supercarrier, so it is not like the system is no longer in development. Considering super carriers operate while cocooned inside a thickly layered air defense net, provided by an armada of Arleigh Burke and Ticonderoga class guided missile picket ships, all with magazines bristling with Standard missiles as well as ESSMs, and these floating air bases also pack around their own air force as well, this does not make a good case for the adequacy of the Zumwalt’s truncated anti-air sensor suite. The Ford’s dual band radar apertures are clearly visible on the ship’s island super structure., Huntington Ingalls In reality, DDG-1000’s anti-air capability is defensive in nature, with only a limited capability for highly localized air defense within a couple dozen miles of the ship. This is a travesty, a missed opportunity that makes no sense, fiscally or tactically. A string of SM-2/3/6 and SPY-4 radar equipped DDG-1000s could create an “invisible sanitized corridor” stretching over many hundreds of miles, deep into denied territory. In this corridor ships and aircraft could transit in relative safety, deeply piercing the enemy’s anti-access/area denial bubble. In addition, having missiles such as the SM-6 onboard DDG-1000 could offer stealthy fighter and bomber aircraft like the F-35, F-22 and the upcoming B-21 an extended magazine once their own limited weapons stocks run dry. Cooperative Engagement Capability and similar concepts could see stealthy allied aircraft targeting enemy aircraft deep in their own airspace and cueing DDG-1000-based missiles onto those targets. In fact, remote pairing between the F-35 and the SM-6 was just tested successfully . The SM-6, with its secondary surface and ground attack capabilities, could even allow stealthy aircraft to remotely target boats and ground targets far from shore for these missiles to strike after they were ordered to be launched from a DDG-1000. This hunter-killer concept would dramatically increase the tactical options for low observable aircraft already at risk over enemy territory, and it’s a capability only the Zumwalts could provide. Artist rendering of a F-35 providing targeting information for a remotely fired SM-6., Lockheed Martin Although the idea of using the DDG-1000 as an “arsenal ship” is promising, and although the DDG-1000 is perfectly suited for providing this capability to stealthy combat aircraft as both will operate closer to threats than their conventional, non-stealthy counterparts, there is one problem. Filling the Zumwalt’s limited VLS “real estate” (80 VLS cells vs 96 on the Arleigh Burke class and 122 on the Ticonderoga class) with missiles that the ship cannot provide targeting and guidance for organically is unlikely to happen. If the ship had its full radar and software suite available, it would be able to employ these missiles on its own. Making them available for remote targeting by another player on the battlefield would be no big deal. Stocking them just for this purpose is highly unlikely. In the not so distant future, ballistic missile defense will not just be about protecting a region from a rogue attack, it will also be about protecting the anti-ballistic missile ship, and its floating companions, themselves. In a world where anti-ship ballistic missiles are becoming a reality, ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities will become more of a defensive necessity for flotillas than a “regional defense mission” of its own. The full SPY-3/SPY-4 radar suite, with SM-2/3/6 capabilities would have allowed the Zumwalt class to simultaneously watch for incoming ballistic missiles as well as air breathing threats (aircraft, cruise missiles etc), and engage those threats over long distances if need be. Today, Aegis ballistic missile defense equipped cruisers and destroyers largely are unable to execute both the air defense and anti-ballistic missile defense function at the same time, although the Flight III Arleigh Burke class, which will feature a full and updated version of the AMDR radar known as the SPY-6, will be able to. But seeing as DDG-1000 will often operate independently from larger flotillas, it will have to go about its business without an anti-ballistic missile “umbrella” overhead, even while operating deep into denied territory. Bad decisions neutered the Zumwalt class, but a study with questionable conclusions doomed it: The DDG-1000’s area air defense and anti-ballistic missile capabilities were abandoned slowly over time. Originally the DG(X), which became the Zumwalt class, was supposed to have a larger air defense focused sister class, the CG(X). The designs were very similar between the two types but the cruiser was to be larger with a greater focus on air defense, but the CG(X) was cancelled in 2010, leaving just the Zumwalt class to fend for itself. Artist rendition of the DDG-1000., US Navy Yet even the Zumwalt class was truncated in size from its original concept under the DG(X) initiative. Magazine size in particular was slashed from between 116 and 128 VLS cells down to just 80. What’s most troubling about this move is that the Mk57 VLS cells on the Zumwalt class are larger than the Mk41 cells found on today’s AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. This means that larger and even longer-range surface-to-air weaponry and ballistic missile interceptors could have filled many of these cells, giving the ship a unique long-range air defense capability to match the abilities of its SPY-3 and SPY-4 radar systems. As mentioned earlier, this radar suite didn’t pan out either. The cancellation of the CG(X), and the limiting of the Zumwalt class’ production numbers to just three ships while curtailing their baseline capabilities was spurred by a 2009 radar/hull study initiated by the Navy. The study pushed for an outgrowth of the already fairly over-built Arleigh Burke class destroyer to accommodate a larger radar suite, a more advanced combat system, and much more electrical power generation, among other upgrades. The study concluded that the Navy should ditch the Zumwalt’s potentially revolutionary design and unique capabilities and stick with a 30 year design that would offer lower risk and would be more cost effective, stating that each new Flight III Arleigh Burke class would cost less than $2B each. Rendering of what a AMDR equipped Flight III Arleigh Burke class may look like., … This report for which the Navy hung its future surface combatant capability upon, has since proven to have been less than accurate or truthful. In 2012 the GAO concluded that: “The Navy relied on its 2009 Radar/Hull Study as the basis to select DDG 51 over DDG 1000 to carry the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) as its preferred future surface combatant—a decision that may result in a procurement of up to 43 destroyers and cost up to $80 billion over the next several decades. The Radar/Hull Study may not provide a sufficient analytical basis for a decision of this magnitude. Specifically, the Radar/Hull Study: focuses on the capability of the radars it evaluated, but does not fully evaluate the capabilities of different shipboard combat systems and ship options under consideration, does not include a thorough trade-off analysis that would compare the relative costs and benefits of different solutions under consideration or provide robust insight into all cost alternatives, and assumes a significantly reduced threat environment from other Navy analyses, which allowed radar performance to seem more effective than it may actually be against more sophisticated threats. The Navy’s planned production schedules of the restart DDG 51 ships are comparable with past performance and officials told us that hull and mechanical systems changes are modest, but these ships will cost more than previous DDG 51s. A major upgrade to the ship’s combat system software also brings several challenges that could affect the restart ships, due in part to a key component of this upgrade that has already faced delays. Further delays could postpone delivery to the shipyard for the first restart ship, and could also jeopardize the Navy’s plan to install and test the upgrade on an older DDG 51 prior to installation on the restart ships. This first installation would serve to mitigate risk, and if it does not occur on time the Navy will be identifying, analyzing, and resolving any combat system problems on the first restart ship. Further, the Navy does not plan to fully test new capabilities until after certifying the upgrade as combat-ready, and has not planned for realistic operational testing necessary to fully demonstrate its integrated cruise and ballistic missile defense performance. The Navy faces significant technical risks with its new Flight III DDG 51 ships, and the current level of oversight may not be sufficient given these risks. The Navy is pursuing a reasonable risk mitigation approach to AMDR development, but it will be technically challenging. According to Navy analysis, selecting the DDG 51 hullform to carry AMDR requires significant redesign and reduces the ability of these ships to accommodate future systems. This decision also limits the radar size to one that will be at best marginally effective and incapable of meeting the Navy’s desired capabilities. The Navy may have underestimated the cost of Flight III, and its plan to include the lead ship in a multiyear procurement contract given the limited knowledge about the configuration and the design of the ship creates potential cost risk. Finally, the current level of oversight may not be commensurate with a program of this size, cost, and risk and could result in less information being available to decision makers.” Zumwalt class compared to Arleigh Burke Flight IIA. , USN Since the GAO published its counter to the Navy’s 2009 radar-hull study, the cost of Flight III Arleigh Burke class has remained a key uncertainty, and much of the risk that the Navy was trying to avoid by going with an existing design over DDG-1000 will become less relevant as the Zumwalt class rapidly matures. Not only that, but under the current plan, the Arleigh Burke class is supposed to remain relevant through 2072 , at which time the basic design will be more than 80 years old. Considering how quickly potential peer-state competitors’ military capabilities are advancing around the world, this seems like an absurd proposition. These new Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers, of which at least 22 are slated to be built (likely many more), will have very limited room for growth and may not be able to accommodate disruptive technologies like railguns in the future. So what the Navy gets with this restart and revamping of an old class is a fully maxed-out design on day one–a ship that will struggle to adapt to new threats and that is not nearly as survivable as the much larger, more adaptable and stealthy DDG-1000. The worst part of this blunder it is that these two designs should not have to be pitted against each other. They are much more effective working cooperatively as part of a larger high-low capability mix of naval strategy. Producing a smaller number of Zumwalt class destroyers while also producing new Arleigh Burke class destroyers seems like a fairly equitable trade off, especially since the DDG-1000’s development costs are already sunk, even if such a plan results in a slight overall active hull number decrease. If the Navy had procured a proper frigate instead of the Littoral Combat Ship, one that is armed with Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile and can defend itself in medium threat environments, a plan to procure both the Zumwalt class and more Arleigh Burke class destroyers would be much more acceptable. Although it may mean slightly fewer hulls in the water overall, a new frigate could pick up many of the lower-end roles currently performed by Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This would free the Navy’s cruisers and destroyers to concentrate on higher-end tasking. Ongoing design sacrifices: Although the DDG-1000s will be tougher to detect by enemy sensors than their less stealthy progenitors (about 50 times less visible on radar according to the Navy, although this figure is clearly anecdotal), they will also be operating much closer to enemy sensors. As a result, these ships will have to pay close attention to the electromagnetic spectrum around them and will have to use their incredible processing power to best predict the edges of the enemy’s detection capabilities. Many variables go into this, including the configuration the ship is in at any given time, the environment around it, what type of emissions it is putting out, what type of electronic countermeasures are being used, and even at which aspect of the ship is being presented to each known enemy sensor. Passive sensors are far more problematic, and it is nearly impossible for Zumwalt to know where they are and if they are tracking her. These include electromagnetic sensors that can detect radar and communications emissions, and in some cases triangulate them to a geographical position. DDG-1000 surely has the ability to actively mask its radar and communications transmissions using low-probability of intercept tactics, but these tactics are not perfect. This is especially true considering how slow the ship moves compared to, say, a stealthy aircraft; exposure time is just far greater. These passive sensors can also include infrared scanning and electro-optical devices, and maybe most importantly, acoustic sensors. The Zumwalt is known to have a chilled exhaust and a very quiet audible signature, some have even posited it is akin to an Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarine, though such a claim is doubtful. While details about the specific nature of Zumwalt’s various signatures are classified, it’s clear that when it comes to radar visibility, the ship has devolved considerably over the years. What was once a very stealthy design has been the victim of a never ending list of compromises. In recent years these compromises have become almost comically absurd, and now it seems that the Navy is willing to bolt anything onto the the class in order to save money. First off, USS Lyndon B Johnson (DDG-1002), the final ship in the tiny class, will not feature the stealthy composite deckhouse that is such a key feature on the baseline DDG-1000 design. Instead it will be made out of steel . This not only has the potential to drastically increase the ship’s radar signature , it will also greatly increase weight exactly where you don’t want it on a ship (high up) that already faces questions about its stability. The Navy says that, even with these design changes, the ship’s weight distribution and radar signature is “acceptable.” Exactly what that means is unclear. DDG-1000s massive composite deckhouse is lowered onto its hull., USN Enjoy the Zumwalt’s clean lines now because they are about to change significantly. In a race to save money, the Navy has decided not to embed a bunch of sensors and communications infrastructure into the ship’s slab-sided deckhouse. Instead they will be bolted on as if they were an afterthought, making a $4B+ stealth ship, well, less stealthy to say the least. The Navy told USNI News last march the following: “The current DDG-1000 topside configuration is a performance and weight improvement and cost-avoidance initiative. This configuration adds a mast to the forward part of the deckhouse and relocates several communications systems including Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF), data link and the wind sensor from the deckhouse to the mast. This configuration will be present on all three ships and provides improved performance redundancy, cost avoidance and weight reduction, while still meeting Key Performance Parameters (KPP) requirements for Radar Cross Section (RCS).” The Zumwalt’s new configuration. Gone are its stealthy lines and added are many small sensors and comm systems bolted onto her deckhouse and she even has sensor mast now. , USN The bottom line is that DDG-1000 is still stealthy, but not nearly as stealthy as it could be, or as it was envisioned to be. Just because a 600 foot warship has the radar signature of a fishing trawler, it doesn’t mean that it can’t be seen or attacked. Taiwan did just that by accident just months ago. It’s disheartening that the Navy has bet so much on the Zumwalt’s low observable design, and paid huge dollars developing it, but then has not done everything it can do maintain and or improve upon it. In fact, they have done the exact opposite. A mismatched mash-up of capabilities: The various omissions in the Zumwalt’s capability have resulted in a ship that is focused on chucking cruise missiles and sending GPS guided cannon shells dozens of miles inland. But if the Navy wants a stealth Tomahawk chucker, guess what? They already have four of them with far more vertical launch cells than the DDG-1000 has. These are the converted Ohio class nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs). In the coming years, Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarines with extended payload modules will take up this role as the four converted Ohio class SSGNs are retired. Minus its 155mm guns, has the stripped-down, anti-air mission-less Zumwalt become a far more vulnerable above-water guided missile submarine? A stealthy anti-submarine, special operations, and land attack arsenal ship? If so, why not build more submarines instead? They would be far more survivable and can stay on station much longer than the Zumwalt . Ohio class SSGN with its special operations capabilities and 154 TLAMs. The boat also retains its outstanding anti-submarine capability as well. , … Even with the Zumwalt’s more limited set of missions, the ships are supposed to do something a submarine cannot, they have the ability to deliver special operations forces via helicopter deep into enemy territory and support them directly with long-range gunfire… Theoretically at least. Yet, even this mission set is problematic. While the destroyer may be stealthy, the manned helicopters it carries (MH-60R/S) certainly aren’t. This mismatch in capabilities limits the vessel’s ability to differentiate itself from what a submarine could offer in anything but a low-threat environment without major external third-party support (jamming, SEAD, escort etc). Pairing the DDG-1000 with a stealthy helicopter would allow it to operate much more independently, especially in the “over the beach” special operations support role. Independence of operation may not be a choice, considering the ship’s capabilities are unlike any other in the fleet and it is designed to go where other surface combatants cannot. We do know that stealthy Black Hawk variants exist. Procuring a number of these aircraft for use with the Zumwalt class would at least offer a differentiation between what the ship can provide, compared with submarines, when it comes to special operations support missions. The idea of the Navy fielding such a unique capability is unlikely as the service’s two special warfare helicopter squadrons have already been cut down to just one to save money, and they can’t even get their aging HH-60Hs replaced with new Seahawks. There is a chance that this mission could be provided by the Army’s 160th Special Operations Air Regiment who are known to already operate these rare aircraft. Their pilots are often deck qualified as well, but there has been no mention of a serious plan to match these two stealthy assets up together even on a case-by-case basis. Doing so would at least lend more credibility as to the utility of certain aspects of the Zumwalt’s final, albeit far less than optimal configuration. One also has to ask themselves the value of just three stripped down and shrunken DDG-1000s when it is pretty clear that proper investment will not be made into technologies uniquely suited for the tiny class. Instead the Navy will likely procure weapons tailored to the much more plentiful Flight III Arleigh Burke class and its progenitor cousins. The Tomahawk cruise missile for instance, even in its most advanced form , is dated and less than ideal to be used against a capable foe with a high-grade integrated air defense system and strong shoreline, airborne and shipborne defenses. A new stealthy cruise missile would be much more appropriate for the Navy’s new stealth destroyer. Lockheed’s aforementioned LRASM and a land attack version of that missile, would be a good candidate for this capability, although it would not take full advantage of the ship’s larger VLS cells. A very high-speed prompt strike missile would also be very useful for a ship that can operate closer to enemy shores, and such a system would likely take advantage of the DDG-1000’s high adaptable VLS system which can manage as much as 45% more rocket flow compared to the Mark41 VLS. But once again, with only three ships in the fleet, the Zumwalt’s will likely be relegated to using the Arleigh Burke’s hand-me-downs. DDG-1000 under construction. You can see one of her 155mm AGS barrel sticking up., USN In other words, because the Navy pulled anchor on the Zumwalt class so early, it’s doubtful that the proper investment will be made to their ongoing evolution. This situation is not only relevant in the way of updated radars and subsystems, but also in terms of game-changing and “synergistic” peripheral technologies tailored to the Zumwalts unique attributes. With all this in mind, as the years go by will the Navy really continue to use the Zumwalt class as a front-line weapon system, or more as a testbed for new technologies? Will a fleet of just three ships, which feature a slew of unique systems all in need of continued support, be deemed too expensive to operate as they age and require maintenance and upgrades to remain relevant? This question is especially valid considering that the DDG-1000 lacks the ability to execute the area air defense mission by decree, making it more of “niche capability.” Considering that all three ships will be based on America’s west coast, will having maybe a single DDG-1000 deployed in the Pacific at any given time really offer enough capability to justify their running and sustainment costs for decades to come? Time will tell, but the Pentagon has a nasty history of losing interest in these types of programs when funding gets tight and the overall size of a force, whether it be in aircraft or ships, is threatened. A more logical solution to this whole destroyer procurement controversy would have been to build a single full-up DDG-1000 as a technology demonstrator. Once the Navy has actually evaluated the real ship and what it can do, then it could have made its decision on how to procure it and/or the Flight III Arleigh Burke class. Instead key decisions were made to curtail and eventually cut the Zumwalt class program based on questionable studies even though the actual ship would still be constructed and available for testing just a handful of years later. Once again, the Pentagon is making long-term, high-impact procurement decisions without even testing the options it has already paid to develop before making those critical choices. It is another form of the concurrency that has done massive damage to America’s weapons inventories in recent decades. The F-22 of the high seas: In the end the Navy is betting a lot on the idea that this huge ship, one that moves in two dimensions at moped speeds, will never be detected and thus engaged by a large aerial threat. The ship has just one limited-range air defense missile to defend itself and the omission of any sort of traditional CIWS capability is a repeat of a lesson the Navy has already learned. In all, this lack of area air defense capability is a mismatch when considering the ship’s “tip of the spear” mission. The application of stealth technology is very helpful when it comes to survivability but it does not make something invisible or invincible, especially not a ship this large, or one that has had its radar signature increasingly compromised in the name of relatively modest cost savings. These issues combined with the massive reduction in production numbers leave comparisons between the Zumwalt class and the F-22 Raptor all but intuitive. Both had their production cut incredibly short under the purview of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the Obama Administration even before the weapon system could really prove its value. Both had decades long development cycles that cost many billions of dollars, and both are now being called too expensive although their unit price was predicted to drop drastically if they were procured in reasonable quantities. Both also had their demise justified by prioritizing supposedly lower-risk, lower-cost, jack-of-all-trades alternatives that are now proving more troublesome and costly than originally envisioned. And both had key capabilities withheld under the false guise of  “savings.” The F-22 Raptor, of which just 187 operational examples were ever built, has much in common with the Zumwalt class., USAF Not giving the Zumwalts the proper hardware and software to execute area air defense and eventually the ballistic missile defense mission is just like how the USAF fielded the F-22 without a helmet mounted display or the latest AIM-9X sidewinder missile: Spend tens of billions of dollars, then draw the budgetary line arbitrarily around relatively low-cost but key survivability and defensive design features. Shameful. Now the question is, will the Navy lament the decision to deep-six the Zumwalt class prematurely just as the USAF does for shuttering F-22 production after just 187 operational examples were built. The saddest part of this story is that the ship had the potential to be an absolute disrupter in the surface warfare realm. One that could help enable so many others, in the air, on the sea and on the ground, to do their job against the most advanced peer-state competitors. Instead, the Pentagon’s chronic attention deficit disorder, near-sighted cost cutting measures and shipbuilding politics resulted in a ship that although still impressive on some levels, when you go just below its awesome sci-fi exterior, questions about squandered potential and contemplations on what could have been become unavoidable. The Zumwalt is one visually imposing ship., USN Portions of this piece were adapted from prior work by the author.

Chris Cantle,"Updated on Dec 23, 2020",The 10 Best Military Arcade Games of the 80s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The graphics and the soundtracks of 1980s arcade games were crude. The storylines? Spartan. Yet, duking it out in the 1980s was just brilliant: Somehow even more stressful than the very best of our modern shooters. It was a wonderful time. For this list, only military games make the cut. That rules out space games like “Asteroids,” “Defender,” “Galaga” and “Star Wars,” and favorites like “Major Havoc” and “Moon Patrol.” Even Spyhunter, a classic with lots of weapons and dodging and shooting has to sit this one out. But no sweat. The arcades of the 1980s had almost an almost boundless number of fantastic military games. And the best of them, the games that hold up all these years later? They’re right here: “Twin Eagle: Revenge Joe’s Brother” (1988) Known almost as much for its awesome mistranslation as for its scrolling gameplay, Seta’s 1988 helicopter attack game was both a graphics juggernaut and bit of a gameplay jumble—especially in two-player mode, where the second player’s virtually identical chopper can easily be mistaken for yours. Which inevitably leads to augering in because, while the warbird in Twin Eagle can dish a ton of damage, it’s a fragile little thing and can only take one hit before it’s finished. “Armor Attack” (1980) It never had the popularity of its contemporaries from 1980, Missile Command and Battlezone, but Armor Attack was a brilliant arcade game. A monitor overlay added depth to the bitmap graphics, and ever-increasing game speed kept things challenging. The best Armor Attack cabinets were of the flat, table-like, PacMan variety; great for straining your neck and even better for holding a drink and a slice of pizza. “Commando” (1985) Dropped off in the tropics by a helicopter, Super Joe battles his way through palm trees and enemy soldiers, attacking ever upward on “Commando”’s scrolling screen. An eight-way controller means Super Joe had to unleash a somewhat unscientific barrage of gunfire and grenades to get it done. The bullets? Those were unlimited, but the grenade supply had a knack for running thin real quick. Combined, it was a test of hand-eye coordination for sure, but “Commando” was good fun, and more than enough to land the number eight spot. “Missile Command” (1980) Who knew something so simple could be so infuriatingly challenging? Or so ominous. The player defended cities from the rain of nuclear missiles with an ever-dwindling supply of surface to air missiles. They started slow of course, and turned into an interminable rain of MIRVs. Or, you know, tiny pixelated streaks across the screen that would reduce your tiny pixelated cities to tiny pixelated rubble. “Choplifter” (1985) An unusual port from console to the arcade makes “Choplifter” a bit of a curiosity. And the funky controls? Well, those made “Choplifter” a sonofabitch. But the game was as addictive as they come. Fighting through tanks and jets was all well and good, but “Choplifter” was all about a daring rescue mission. That’s what made the game so delightful–dancing along that precarious edge between shooting up the baddies, and hard maneuvering just above the ground that might make for a better rescue attempt. “Airwolf” (1987) It was a match made in heaven: The very best of 1980s television mixed with the very best of side-scrolling 1980’s helicopter-based gameplay. Elements of “Choplifter,” “1942,” and “Twin Eagle,” all came together with “Airwolf”’s badass theme song. It’s very nearly a perfect blend. One that would, if not for the cruel hand of history, have landed “Airwolf” much higher up the list. “1942” (1984) Capcom’s first saw an American aviator flying a twin-tailed P-38 through the fearsome air forces of the Japanese Imperial Navy. Mastering machine guns and the vertical loop, fearless flyers would battle through swarm after swarm of swooping and attacking Zero and Hein fighters, then duke it out with a big boss Nakajima bomber, all the way to Tokyo. “1942” was the first in a series of vertically scrolling shooters from Capcom. While sequels upped the ante for graphics and weapons payloads, the original gets the nod here for its originality and quality of game play. “Battlezone” (1980) Like “Missile Command,” “Battlezone”’s simplistic wireframe graphics didn’t boast much detail. But it didn’t matter, the depth and action that Atari was able to create within those pencil-thin lines is brilliant to this day. While the occasional alien saucer means “Battlezone” treads a thin line with the space game rule, the tank-on-tank and guided-missile dueling is enough to secure it a place on our list; and the delightfully frustrating first-person gameplay boosts it even higher. But most compelling? It’s “Battlezone”’s hard-earned legitimacy. Slightly modified, stripped of its UFO’s and equipped with a yoke from the tank itself, the game was adapted to train American Bradley Fighting Vehicle crews. The shooting action clearly carries with it some nostalgia as well, as “Battlezone” has recently been rebooted for virtual reality and the PlayStation 4. “Contra” (1987) Lance and Bill strafe their way across the screen, somersaulting their way through the jungles of the future. “Contra” set the standard for run-and-gun gameplay. Its graphics were bold, and perhaps the best of the era. But the best part of “Contra”? The teamwork: fighting, heads-up, against a busy and challenging enemy with a capable partner only improves an already fantastic game. “After Burner” (1987) A classic third-person air-to-air shooter framed around the legendary F-14 Tomcat. From takeoff to your inevitable fiery demise, “After Burner”’s action was bright and colorful and just relentless. Every version of “After Burner” had kickass fighter-style controls, and would-be pilots fired its weapons from the joystick, just like the real deal. The best of the arcade versions had moving cockpits with stereo sound, and even the plain-Jane iterations of the game were good enough to totally ruin your quarter supply come laundry day.

Chris Cantle,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",This Nuclear-Capable 1950s Missile Once Delivered the U.S. Mail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Regulus I missile had pretty lines. In profile they were cigar-shaped, with the purposeful, flat intake nose of early 1950s fighter planes like the F-86 Sabre that widened amidships over an Allison turbojet engine, then tapered again at the exhaust. A rakish mid-mounted wing provided the lift needed to soar gracefully over the ocean, then over Russian beaches, cities, airfields, or factories, where its 3,000-pound thermonuclear payload would detonate, incinerating whatever lay beneath. And as a nuclear strike weapon, the United States Navy’s Regulus I was an appropriately terrifying thing . It had its conceptual roots in the Nazi V1 buzz bomb, but instead of launching from solid ground, the Regulus was flown from the deck of ships, or submarines. In an era before ballistic missiles , it was the Navy’s first nuclear deterrent—514 of them were made, and for the better part of a decade, submarines with hangars for the Regulus built onto their decks quietly cruised the seas. Pretty though it may have been, the Regulus I was a purposeful bird. It was cumbersome to launch, requiring its host to point it toward its distant target, and it required the combined guidance systems from two different vessels to guide it there. And while a modern cruise missile is so accurate that the distance between target and impact is measured in feet, at its extreme range, the Navy measured a Regulus I’s accuracy in miles. But, armed with a 1- or 2-kiloton W27 warhead, that was good enough. WIKIMEDIA CREATIVE COMMONS So the Regulus I was an odd choice to play postman on a balmy Florida morning in 1959. But, with the blessing and encouragement of the Postmaster General, that’s exactly what it did. The flight would have looked like any other missile test. Aimed at Naval Station Mayport, near Jacksonville, Florida, the bright orange Regulus I was fired from the deck of the submarine USS Barbero. It was a 100-mile shot—a range within which the missile was good and accurate—and instead of a 3,000-pound nuclear payload, the landing gear-equipped training missile was loaded with 3,000 letters addressed to senators and dignitaries, even the president. Examples of the missile’s unusual cargo, and even the boxes fitted into the payload compartment, have been preserved by the National Postal Museum . While the letters inside were jocular and enthusiastic about the accomplishment, the underlying message was about as subtle as the typical payload of the Regulus: If the Navy can deliver the mail, the Navy can deliver the bomb. Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield was on hand for the unloading of the precious payload. It would be the first—and last—U.S. Mail to be delivered by missile. Before taking the reins of the Postal Service, Summerfield was a politician, and a General Motors dealer in Michigan. He had a vision for a modern postal service, all conveyor belts and machine sorting, and as visionaries are wont to do, he had a few words to say at the successful delivery of the mail by the Regulus: “This peacetime employment of a guided missile for the important and practical purpose of carrying mail, is the first known official use of missiles by any Post Office Department of any nation. Before man reaches the moon, mail will be delivered within hours from New York to California, to Britain, to India or Australia by guided missiles.” Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago/Getty Images In hindsight, his enthusiastic endorsement of the weapons system’s use for a peaceful purpose would be as incorrect as the idea was short-lived. And the Regulus itself didn’t fare much better. It was swiftly replaced by the Polaris, the latest in a new generation of ICBMs. Left jobless, the big, handsome missiles were assigned to duties as target drones. Even the USS Barbero, survivor of the Second World War and stalwart patroller of the deep, wouldn’t last: Just five years after participating in the first mail delivery by missile, she was outdated in the eyes of the Navy, then used as a target and sunk by another submarine off Pearl Harbor. Sixty years later, the Regulus is considered the predecessor of today’s Tomahawk cruise missile, and the world’s navies still patrols the depths with fleets of nuclear-armed submarines . But the idea of mail delivery by missile? That one never quite took off. Chris Cantle West Coast Editor Naval History Naval Munitions Nuclear Nuclear History Sea"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 2, 2020",The Pentagon Envisions a Horrible and Dystopian Metropolis of the Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After spending nearly a decade fighting in urban terrain in Iraq and clandestine counter-terror operations around the globe under the auspices of the Global War on Terror, the Pentagon seems to view our urban combat of the future as very ominous indeed. The details of these challenges–and this gloomy vision of the future–are featured in a downright depressing video named  “Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity” that has been shown at the Joint Special Operations University. The video was obtained via a FOIA request by The Intercept . In it, visuals of crowded urban sprawl, riots, poverty and military operations are splashed across the screen as a narrator somberly describes a hugely complex and tactically bankrupt combat environment of the future. The Intercepts describes the video and its intended use: The video was used as part of an “Advanced Special Operations Combating Terrorism” course offered at JSOU earlier this year, for a lesson on “The Emerging Terrorism Threat.” JSOU is operated by U.S. Special Operations Command, the umbrella organization for America’s most elite troops. JSOU describes itself as geared toward preparing special operations forces “to shape the future strategic environment by providing specialized joint professional military education, developing SOF specific undergraduate and graduate level academic programs and by fostering special operations research.” Megacities are, by definition, urban areas with a population of 10 million or more, and they have been a recent source of worry and research for the U.S. military. A 2014 Army report, titled “Megacities and the United States Army,” warned that “the Army is currently unprepared. Although the Army has a long history of urban fighting, it has never dealt with an environment so complex and beyond the scope of its resources.” A separate Army study published this year bemoans the fact that the “U.S. Army is incapable of operating within the megacity.” Here is the video in its entirety: The piece goes on to describe megacities in great detail, including the unique and complex social structures that will propagate from high-rise penthouse dwellers all the way down to “subterranean labyrinths” governed by their own laws and social norms. Above all else, the video makes it clear that future cities will be breeding grounds for organized crime, cyber crime and terrorism. And apparently Special Operations Command doesn’t think it’s ready to do battle in the megacities of the future, with the narrator stating: “Even our counterinsurgency doctrine, honed in the cities of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, is inadequate to address the sheer scale of population in the future urban reality… We are facing environments that the masters of war never foresaw… We are facing a threat that requires us to redefine doctrine and the force in radically new and different ways.” The whole affair is reminiscent of the opening sequence of the latest Judge Dredd movie, where the main character narrates over sweeping views of the concrete jungle of dystopic Megacity One–with flashes of social unrest and extreme urban decay woven in: So what’s the deal here? Is this just the military industrial complex looking for another paper threat to cash in on, or is fighting in “megacities” something the Pentagon needs to start preparing for in a big way? I think the real answer is a mix of both. As population increases and urban areas become both more dense and sprawling, certain tactical problems will become more pronounced than they already are during current MOUT (military operations in urban terrain). But this is not a whole new medium of combat operations as the video implies. There’s nothing wrong with getting our best military minds thinking about how to negate tactical deficiencies of the future, the video seems to call for more than just that. The US military spends billions a year on training its forces for MOUT. Countless fake villages and mock cities have been constructed at US military and allied bases around the globe, just for this purpose. Many of these installations even have role playing actors trained to fill out the civilian population. Some special operations units even get their very own elaborate MOUT training complexes tailored to specific mission sets. Not just that, but Special Operations Command regularly conducts elaborate drills in real metropolises around the US, often drawing fascination and ire of the local populous in the process. Should America’s special operations forces do more of this type of near-real world training? It would make some sense, but some may argue that the US military should build its own metropolis for extreme MOUT training–high-rises and underground labyrinths included. This is where the line between fantasy and necessity blurs. Building such a training complex would require a massive investment, and there are only so many resources to go around. The same training needs hold true for the missions and combat environments our soldiers are facing on the battlefields of today, not just those that may exist tomorrow. As an alternative, the Pentagon could probably find some city blocks that are all but abandoned and adapt them for its training requirements. And besides, by the time there are megacities that really represent the threat the video plays them out to be, (if that ever truly occurs) virtual training will probably be up to the task of preparing our soldiers to do battle there successfully.

Chris Cantle,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Pour Out an Iced Tea for Bob Hoover,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a special kind of sand that makes a guy like Bob Hoover stand out among a generation of heroes. Born in 1922, Hoover was a fighter pilot in the Second World War. He flew in North Africa before pulling a primo assignment piloting a Spitfire out of Sicily. After getting shot down over the Mediterranean, Hoover spent more than a year as a German prisoner in Stalag Luft 1 before making a run for it as the Russians advanced on the camp. Not content to spend the remainder of the war learning Russian, or hiding in a German barn, Hoover stole a German Focke Wulf 190 and flew like mad to get behind the Western front. In his appropriated German plane, Hoover had to avoid allied aircraft (lest he get shot down by unwitting friendly fire) all the way to Holland, where he landed in a field and was promptly surrounded by pitchfork-wielding locals convinced he was a Nazi flyer. His incredible exploits during the war alone are enough to qualify a guy as pretty damned impressive in my eyes. But Hoover was just getting started. Unlike so many of his peers, Hoover didn’t leave the cockpit after the war. He stayed on with the Air Corps as it became the Air Force, serving as a test pilot, and eventually as both Chuck Yeager’s wingman and the backup pilot for his famous Mach 1 flight in the Bell X-1. Even after leaving the service, Hoover continued to fly and test military aircraft as a civilian test pilot. While Hoover had a remarkable gift for flying the wings off high-performance military aircraft ( sometimes literally ), it was in civilian aviation where Hoover cemented his legend. After a stint flying for aircraft manufacturers, Hoover made for the air racing and air show circuit, where he performed in everything from P-51 Mustangs to cumbersome, twin-engine Commander utility planes. As it turned out, Hoover’s great talent wasn’t making high-performance planes scream for mercy, it was making crowds scream for more after watching Hoover’s impossibly graceful flights in totally pedestrian aircraft. Engine-out aerobatic flights and perfect one-wheel touch-and-go landings aside, Hoover might be most famous for executing a perfect roll in his twin-engine commander while pouring a glass of iced tea . YouTube is packed to the gills with videos of his antics. Like this one . And this one . And this one . He was many things, but most of all, Hoover was a hell of a pilot—and with his air shows, he inspired a great many more to try to fill his shoes. Bob Hoover died this morning, at the age of 94. My Facebook feed—usually a spattering of politics and off-road trucks and friendly idiocy—was instead filled with kind words and videos of Hoover, modestly and warmly being his own quiet kind of hero. The last thing we need is fewer heroes, but seeing friends from a dozen countries and hobbies and political outlooks come together early in the morning to give this good man a tip of the hat on his passing is one last act of inspiration from a guy who seemed to have an endless well of the stuff.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Russia’s Carrier Was Designed To Be Heavily Armed Even Without Its Air Wing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During the Cold War, Russia’s navy prioritized moving huge numbers of cruise missiles around the globe, threatening the power-projection capabilities of American Carrier Battle Groups. In the 1950s and 1960s, aircraft carriers were seen by Soviet military elites as imperialist tools of aggression, and any initiative by the USSR to build one of their own was shot down by the powers that be. Eventually this began to change, but only gradually. The Kiev class that was launched in the 1970s was a puzzling cross-breed compromise between a heavy missile cruiser and a helicopter and VTOL (Yak-38) tactical jet carrier. Eventually Russian ship designers were allowed to develop the Soviet Union’s first dedicated fixed-wing aircraft carrier out of the Kiev class design, but it couldn’t stray too far from its predecessor’s missile carrying philosophy. The ship that resulted was something unlike anything contrived in the west–a fixed-wing aircraft carrier that also packed a massive punch of its own, regardless of whether its air wing was deployed on its deck or not. This would ship would eventually be known as the Kuznetsov class, with the first example being launched in the early 1980s. A Kiev class heavy aviation cruiser. , DoD People always seem to be a little confused by Admiral Kuznetsov’s unique designation as a “heavy aircraft-carrying missile cruiser” instead of as a conventional aircraft carrier. At first glance, the ship does seem to pack a lot more missile punch than an American supercarrier, and way more than an American Midway class carrier of the 1980s , which is of similar size and displacement. The Admiral Kuznetsov. , Russian Navy The Admiral Kuznetsov is equipped with no less than 24 rotary-style vertical launch systems, with eight missile cells each. These fire the SA-N-9 “Gauntlet” point air defense missile, and a whopping 192 of these missiles are carried in all. In addition, the ship bristles with a virtual wall off close-in weapon systems (CIWS), including six AK-630 cannons and no less than eight (notoriously formidable) Kashtan missile/cannon CIWS systems . The ship even sports its own anti-submarine defenses with a pair of UDAV-1 anti-submarine/anti-torpedo rocket systems. Although the UDAV-1 system is a less complex concept, American carriers are just beginning to field a capable defense against torpedoes today. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7TAov20r4 All this armament is impressive, but it is defensive in nature. Admiral Kuznetsov’s real offensive punch comes from 12 massive SS-N-19 “Shipwreck”/P-700 “Granit” supersonic anti-ship missiles. Each of these beasts weighs in at 15,500 pounds – about the same as a combat configured F-5E Tiger II fighter. They can be armed with a 1,600-lb conventional warhead, a fuel-air explosive warhead or a nuclear warhead. A rare photo of a P-700 Granit missile. Its air intake is covered here, when uncovered it resembles the one found on a MiG-21., … These missiles were designed in the late 1970s, and intended to allow Russia’s future capital ships to be able to reliably strike American carrier battle groups from outside the range of their surface-based weapon systems. In combat, the missiles would be launched in large salvos, then scream toward their targets as fast as mach 2.5 at altitude, or about mach 1.5 while low over the water. The missiles were very advanced for their time, integrating networking and automated cooperative “swarm” tactics. They were launched at a target (or targets) usually based on third party data, such as coordinates derived by a scout ship, a maritime patrol aircraft, or even a submarine. They would fly toward their targets from over 350 miles away on inertial navigation, then as they approached the suspected target area, one missile out of the swarm would “pop up” to higher altitude to use its own active radar and anti-radiation sensors to obtain updated targeting info. It would then classify these targets and assign them to missiles in the swarm below. If the pop-up missile were destroyed another one would automatically take its place. The missiles could also accept updates from third party sources as well and supposedly had connectivity to the now defunct Soviet-era EORSAT satellite network . Once in the terminal attack phase of their flight, each surviving missile would acquire its own target, and prosecute that target, blazing over the horizon at supersonic speeds and giving (presumably) American close-in weapon systems little time to react. There is no doubt, the P-700 was born to be a high-end carrier killer. Their speed and numbers would overwhelm a Carrier Battle Group’s defenses, and their individual warheads were large enough to register a kill even on America’s largest surface combatants. The Soviet Navy’s aspirations were clear, with dozen of missiles available on Kirov class battlecruisers, Oscar class nuclear guided missile submarines, and the carriers that would eventually be known as the Kuznetsov class, Soviet surface action groups could have filled the air with these deadly missiles. Granit anti-ship missile being loaded onto the doomed Oscar class nuclear guided missile submarine Kursk . , … Even today, with only one Kirov class ( soon to be two ) battlecruiser, five Oscar class submarines and one Kuznetsov class carrier in service, when paired together or even operating alone, they represent a formidable threat. Thankfully American CIWS capabilities, the AEGIS combat system deployed aboard US Navy cruisers and destroyers, and the electronic warfare capabilities on all of these ships, as well as the passage of time time, has likely blunted the danger posed by these missiles to some degree. The thing that is most confusing about the Kuznetsov’s hard-hitting anti-ship missile arsenal is that it seems to be non-existent when you examine the ship. These are big missiles – their launch tubes take up a large portion of the massive nuclear-powered Kirov class battlecruiser’s bow. No such structures are apparent on the Kuznetsov, which looks like, well, just an aircraft carrier. The 12 missile tubes inlayed into the Kuznetsov’s deck. , … But look closer and you’ll see signs that the ship’s 12 P-700s are sitting right below the surface of the forward flight deck. Two parallel rows of eight vertical launch tubes are flush mounted, and covered with the same non-skid surfaces as the rest of the ship’s flight deck. The launch cells “disappear” as soon as their hatches are closed. It seems like an “interesting” design choice to have 30 ton fighters, armed and full of fuel, thundering their way over some of the most powerful anti-ship missiles ever devised, but Soviet designers had their goals to achieve, and they made it work. It is hard not imagine the vigorous “debate” over shoehorning these missiles into the USSR’s only true fixed-wing carrier design, as the space could have been used for aviation related needs. But one way or another the Kuznetsov ended up with this funky feature, one which it has lugged around long after the Soviet Union was no more. Another rare view of the carrier’s P-700 missile hatches open., … Over the last decade there has been talk about having P-700 Granit missile capability stripped from Admiral Kuznetsov . The area below deck where the missile farm is located would be opened up for more hangar space, a feature the ship has always been short on . This was supposed to happen during a major refit that would see the ship redeployed sometime in the 2017-2018 timeframe. It seems the overhaul never happened, and instead a light refit was executed, as the ship was prepared to sail for the Syrian coast once again in late 2016. This time it would be packing new and upgraded aircraft that would actually fly combat missions over the embattled country. Admiral Kuznetsov going through a recent refit., Christopher Michel/wikicommons Whether the P-700 missile tubes are still active and filled with live rounds is unknown. It’s possible, as the ship is slated to go through a much deeper refit when it returns from its Syrian deployment. On its return home, this capability will most likely be removed, once and for all, with new hangar space making room for the Kuznetsov’s modernized air wing that will increasingly be made up of MiG-29KR strike fighters and KA-52K attack helicopters. Su-33s stuffed inside the Kuznetsov’s hangar bay. , … Other improvements slated for the ship during its deep refit are rumored to include new gas turbines,  replacing the dated boiler system that has plagued the ship’s reliability for years. New missile defense systems, including medium-range surface-to-air missiles and a navalized version of the Pantsir point defense system would be added. New communications systems and sensors would also replace long-obsolete ones. Russia’s lone carrier has had a colorful past to say the least. It has had three names, Riga, Leonid Brezhnev and Tbilisi before becoming the Admiral Kuznetsov . Kuznetsov’s sister ship, the Varyag, is now China’s first carrier, the Liaoning . How it got to China is a whole saga unto itself. China’s Liaoning was born out of the rusted hulk of the Kuznetsov’s sister ship., Chinese Internet Admiral Kuznetsov sat for years before being reactivated, and the way the Russians supposedly moved her from the Black Sea to the Severomorsk following the fall of the Soviet Union is interesting to say the least. One Russian wesbite recounts a legend that may be more fiction than fact, but it is entertaining nonetheless: Following the collapse of the USSR, the Admiral Kuznetsov could have been inherited by Ukraine, which claimed ownership of it. In 1991, the ship, then assigned to the Northern Fleet, underwent tests with the Black Sea Fleet in Feodosia, leaving it in Ukrainian territory. However, the first deputy commander of the Northern Fleet flew to Ukraine at once and stepped in. The vice admiral gave the order to raise the anchor immediately and head for Severodvinsk. With its navigation lights off, the ship left its harbor and spent more than three weeks sailing to its permanent base without any aircraft and without two thirds of its crew, who were off-duty at the time. Having saved the aircraft carrier, the vice admiral rightly judged that the sailors would “catch us by train,” and that the aircraft remaining at the onshore airbase would “get there by themselves.” Sadly, in recent years the ship has been more associated with tragedy than triumph, especially in the western press. Its drags around a thick black smoke trail that makes the ship seem like an antique propaganda tool more than a fighting ship. On previous deployments the carrier has suffered chronic mechanical failures, and deadly mishaps. An ocean-going tug follows the ship around as a precaution – not exactly the sign of a first rate naval vessel. Its fixed-wing fighter aircraft, the Su-33 , is visually impressive, but not exactly cutting edge even when it entered service decades ago. Up until a recent light upgrade , its combat capabilities were largely discounted. But things seem to be looking up for Russia’s lonely carrier. New aircraft and investments in the ship appear to be materializing, albeit slowly. Russia plans on keeping Admiral Kuznetsov in service for at least another decade, but it will likely soldier on far past then. In the meantime, the world will be watching the ship and its upgraded contingent of aircraft, and what they will be doing off the shores of Syria. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vnPDhnJy2JY Currently, a multi-national carrier group, with the French nuclear-powered carrier Charles De Gaulle at it center, is also prowling the eastern Mediterranean . Once the Kuznetsov and the largest Russian surface action group assembled since the end of the Cold War arrive on station, the eastern Med will become a crowded patch of sea and sky. That much traffic could make things ‘interesting’ to say the least. As of publishing this piece, Admiral Kuznetsov and its escorts are steaming past Portugal and approaching the Strait of Gibraltar.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the late 1980s, F-14 Tomcat pilot and Topgun instructor Paul Nickell found himself strapping into the cockpit of a brand new Navy jet that would never land on an aircraft carrier. Instead, it was built specifically to challenge the skills of the best fighter crews the Navy had to offer. It was a stripped down, up-engined, exotically painted variant of the already nimble F-16. General Dynamics built only 26 of them, and the fleet served less than a decade before being controversially retired, but the impression the jet made was legendary. For part one of a multi-part, in-depth series on Paul Nickell’s incredible experiences flying fighters during one of the most celebrated eras of naval aviation, here is the F-16N’s story told through the eyes of one of the small cadre of Topgun flyers that pushed it to its limits on a daily basis. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Genesis Of The F-16N I served nine years on active duty, which meant that I never made it to DC for a Pentagon tour, fortunately. As a result, I’m not very familiar with the acquisition process for military aircraft with respect to the Pentagon and Congress. By the early to mid 1980s, it was becoming obvious that potential adversaries were fielding aircraft with greatly improved maneuvering capabilities and advanced air-to-air radars that supporti an increasingly reliable forward-quarter, head-on threat profile. From a training standpoint, we could no longer ignore this improved capability, but it was difficult to train to the latest threat without the supporting hardware needed to emulate it. The Navy’s decision to purchase the F-16N was made in January 1985 while I was still flying Tomcats in the fleet with VF-24. Since I was not there at the time, I was not really aware of how the decision was made, nor was it mentioned much while I was at Topgun. Interestingly, I do recall seeing an F-16 taxiing around at Miramar while I was flying F-14’s that said “F-16/79” on the side. Someone mentioned that it was a jet the Navy was looking at for an adversary aircraft, but I only recall seeing it once or twice. Having done some research myself, and also consulting a number of the Topgun contacts who were around when the decision was made, it’s quite obvious that there were a lot of politics involved, from the macro level to the micro level. USAF That’s not a good thing, nor a bad thing; just a reality for a decision with such far reaching implications. The following were a few of the players ultimately involved: President Jimmy Carter, President Ronald Reagan, Taiwan, China, South Korea, Pakistan, Venezuela, Turkey, Greece, US State Department, US Congress, Secretary of Defense, Northrop, General Dynamics, US Air Force, US Navy, National Guard, Navy Fighter Weapons School, and the Navy’s adversary program. I’ll start by saying that designing and building a fourth generation fighter is an extremely expensive endeavor. The only way to sell them at an affordable price is to sell them in large quantities. There was no way that purchasing 26 aircraft for the Navy would pay for a project such as that, even if the Air Force and Marines had become involved. The only way for the Navy to obtain an affordable fourth generation adversary aircraft was to use something already in production or a variant of the same. To further complicate the issue, you need a dissimilar aircraft to train against effectively. If you put two F-14s against two other F-14s, it works fine until the aircraft merge in mock aerial combat. After the first turn in the visual arena, it’s virtually impossible to keep track of which F-14 is your wingman and which ones are the opponents. With this in mind the Navy needed a relatively small number of dissimilar, fourth generation fighters at a cheap price. To narrow the options, according to the commanding officer of Topgun at the time, they were focused on selecting a US made aircraft. They were aware of the Israel Aircraft Industries F-21 Kfir during the selection process, however it was not a US made aircraft, and they did not believe the Navy would have entertained the idea of purchasing the Kfir for the fourth generation adversary aircraft. It was never seriously considered. To understand the selection process, a short look at history is in order. In the late 70s the Carter administration had placed limitations on the export of front-line US fighters in an attempt to curtail the transfer of technology to the Soviets. At the same time, the US Department of Defense, seeking to make our allies stronger, encouraged the development of fighters that were capable of handling the latest Soviet threat, but without the latest and greatest in technology. Two US companies were looking for revenue in this area. Northrop, maker of the F-5E Tiger II, was looking at building upon that design to provide a viable option for Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Going through several iterations, the F-5E morphed to the F-5G as a participant in the FX program, and finally in 1982 it became the F-20 Tigershark. USAF The F-20 was a very capable fourth generation fighter. At the same time, General Dynamics was looking at a way to obtain business through Foreign Military Sales for its F-16. Unlike Northrop’s problem, General Dynamics had to determine a way of dumbing down its fighter while still keeping it attractive to foreign countries. In 1979 they announced the F-16/79. It would be powered by the venerable General Electric J79 turbojet engine, the same engine that powered the F-4 Phantom and many other military aircraft of the previous couple of decades. It would be heavier and have less thrust than the F100 turbofan powered F-16A/B, and would have downgraded avionics. The selling points were a cheaper price tag and a jet that could be exported to foreign countries. However, by 1980 the Carter administration was already loosening its restrictions on foreign sales, and with the election of Ronald Reagan as president in late 1980, the restrictions would be further reduced. By the early ‘80s the Navy had identified the need for a fourth generation adversary aircraft with a small price tag. The two readily available options were the F-16/79 and the F-20. General Dynamics brought the F-16/79 to Naval Air Station Miramar, and at least five Topgun Instructors including the CO flew the jet. They felt it was acceptable. The CO felt that the F-16N, based upon a proven, capable, and respected airframe, was a new look compared to the vintage F-5 and its follow-on F-20, and he felt that it was the best choice. Unfortunately, although Northrop allowed some instructors to fly the F-20 simulator, they were never allowed to fly the actual aircraft itself. Some thought this was because Northrop did not want to jeopardize their foreign military sales by any type of negative evaluation by the Navy. As the Reagan administration relaxed FMS restrictions, the F-16/79 faded from the Navy’s short list for a new aggressor aircraft and was eventually replaced by the F-16N. During that same period of time the F-20 was able to be enhanced. Unfortunately in October 1984, just prior to the final decision, one of three existing F-20’s crashed and the pilot was killed. Ultimately the Navy chose the F-16N. The decision was announced in January 1985. During the same period, the Air Force was directed to look at the F-20 Tigershark as a dissimilar aggressor aircraft. Additionally the Air National Guard looked at it as an operational aircraft. Then in May 1985 the second of the three prototype F-20s crashed and the pilot was killed. The crash happened as the F-20 team was preparing for the Paris Airshow. Both crashes were eventually attributed to G loss of consciousness (GLOC). Ultimately the decision of both the Air Force and Air National Guard was to maintain commonality by sticking with the F-16. In late 1986 the F-20 Tigershark program was cancelled. Having spent a great deal of time researching how this decision was made, I have an even greater respect for my predecessor instructors at Topgun. As a recipient of their efforts, I was able to fly a magnificent fourth generation adversary aircraft, one that seemingly fell into my lap, yet the true recipients of their efforts were the Navy and Marine Corps aircrews who were able to train against the N. I never realized how much effort had been put forth on our behalf by a group of guys who would never get to personally reap the fruits of their labor. Courtesy of Paul Nickell The Navy’s Hotrod Viper The F-16N looked like an F-16C block 30 airframe, powered by the General Electric F110-GE-100 engine with 25,735 pounds of thrust in full afterburner. It normally weighed less than 25,000 pounds with full internal fuel. Later blocks of F-16s had a larger air intake, because that was apparently a limiting factor for the GE engine. With the bigger intake the engine could develop almost 29,000 pounds of thrust. We normally flew the N with an AIM-9 Sidewinder captive training round on the left wing-tip, and an ACMI (air combat maneuvering instrumentation) pod on the right wing tip if we were going to be operating on a range equipped to support the system. Otherwise the wings were clean with no pylons to add weight and drag. We could carry a fuel tank on the cernterline belly station, but usually didn’t on the single seat models. The two-seater TF-16N Topgun had held about 1200 pounds less fuel than the single seat F-16N models, so they were flown with a centerline fuel tank at times. Department of Defense The F-16N’s radar was the APG-66 from the standard F-16A/B model. My feeling was that this was done to keep the price down. The APG-66 radar was adequate for the missions that we conducted, however I was never exposed to the more advanced APG-68 radar from the C/D model to determine all of the differences. I know that the APG-68 did have a Track While Scan (TWS) capability and the APG-66 did not. The F-16N had no gun. Consequently Topgun gun dets (detachments away from their home base for gunnery practice) came to an end as the F-5 departed the inventory. The lack of the cannon eliminated approximately 250 pounds of weight, plus the weight of the ammunition storage and feed system. It left a fairly large compartment on top of the left side of the fuselage where we could throw a gear bag when going on any type of overnight mission. Because of the removal of the gun, some ballast weight had to be placed in the forward part of the fuselage to keep the aircraft center of gravity within limits. The HUD still displayed a Lead Computing Optical System (LCOS) gun sight, and we could select “GUN” and simulate gun shots, there was just no physical gun in the jet. Additionally there was no Airborne Self Protection Jammer (ASPJ) since the aircraft would not be flown in a true hostile environment. Unlike the F-14, the Viper had no noticeable reduction in acceleration as you approached Mach 1. Bottom line, it was sleek and it was fast. I’ve personally seen it achieve Mach two. Another great training asset that came with the jet was an audio/video recording system for the radar display and HUD. It definitely made recall of engagements much easier and really steepened the learning curve. Finally, the lower wing attach fittings of the jet were manufactured out of titanium, assuming that the aircraft would experience more high-G maneuvering based upon the mission it would be used for by the Navy. One thing that we had to be careful about was the fact that the jet would do supersonic cruise (supercruise) in the configuration that we flew it. Generally slick, at altitude it could go supersonic with no afterburner with the help of its powerful General Electric engine. This was something we had to keep in mind transiting around the country. Unlike the F-14, there was not a noticeable reduction in acceleration as you approached Mach 1. Bottom line, it was sleek and it was fast. I’ve personally seen it achieving Mach two. Department of Defense The “N” Versus Its Predecessors North thirty two fifty two six, west one one seven zero seven six; numbers that are indelibly etched in my brain. Throw them into your “maps” app and you’ll find yourself located on the old Topgun ramp at Naval Air Station Miramar. That’s where I was standing on the 17th of June, 1987 when the Topgun Commanding Officer and Training officer flew the first two Topgun F-16Ns into Miramar. Having programmed those numbers into the inertial navigation system (INS) so many times, after almost thirty years, they’re stuck in my brain. Adding the F-16N to Topgun and the Navy’s adversary inventory was a huge step forward for Navy fighter tactical training. Although the A-4 and F-5 had their limitations, it’s amazing what they had been capable of when employed well. But the times, they were a changin’! If you asked me to pick my favorite of the three, I would be hard pressed to give you a definitive answer. They each had their qualities and quirks. I loved flying all of them, and for a period of about 3 months during the transition, we were able to do just that. Then the F-5’s departed, and it was sad to see it go. From a standpoint of transitioning the squadron pilots over to the F-16N, there were definite challenges. We had about 15 pilots at any time, and we were attempting to transition to the F-16N between Topgun classes, usually about a six week break. A group of six pilots departed near the end of a class and went to Luke Air Force Base for a month of Air Force training which would include ground school, simulators, and two flights in F-16Ds with Pratt and Whitney engines. The plan was that the remainder of us would go to a week of ground school at General Dynamics (at the time the manufacturer of the F-16) and then return and fly our first flight in the N with one of the qualified pilots in a chase aircraft. Once the Topgun class concluded the remaining nine of us headed to Fort Worth for the General Dynamics training. The Navy had purchased 26 F-16s, however the two seaters would be the last four airframes off of the assembly line. That may have made sense from a production standpoint, but it was terrible from a training standpoint. The group that went to Luke AFB returned, and shortly after that, the decision was made that since the Navy had no two-seat aircraft, the nine of us who had gone to General Dynamics would now need to go to Luke AFB for the same training that the first six had gone through. Topgun and other Navy adversary pilots graduating F-16 training at Luke AFB, Courtesy of Paul Nickell As I recall, due to scheduling at Luke AFB, the first six F-16N qualified instructors flew them with the next Topgun class, while the remaining nine of us flew the A-4s and F-5s. Once that class was complete, the remaining nine Topgun instructors, plus a new instructor, departed for Luke and completed our training there. I had my second F-16D ride at Luke on the 26th of August, and after a morning A-4 flight back to Miramar the next day, I flew my first F-16N flight on the afternoon of 27th August. The funniest thing that I remember about that flight was sitting on the runway looking through the HUD, advancing the throttle with my left hand, and swatting around all between my knees with my right hand trying to find the stick. I obviously knew that it was on the right console (the F-16 has a sidestick cockpit layout), but having flown the A-4 that morning, I reverted right back to how I had always flown aircraft! The advantage that our pilots had was that we were all fighter pilots before we got in the F-16. We were also already checked out as adversary pilots. Some had flown the F/A-18 and were very experienced running an air-to-air radar and using the HUD for flying. F-14 pilots, with their Radar Intercept Offers in back, hadn’t. Combining all of these things together, we had a very steep learning curve. We developed a FAM/TAC (familiarization/tactics) syllabus for the F-16N modeled off those already in place for our A-4a and F-5a. For those of us already qualified in the other two aircraft, we abbreviated the syllabus. We obviously still had a great deal to learn about the F-16N, but we were full up and ready to go when the next class arrived. Courtesy of Paul Nickell The N was an amazingly powerful jet with a one-to-one plus thrust-to-weight ratio at takeoff. It could take off, pitch straight up, and maintain its airspeed—to a point. Obviously as it got higher and the air got thinner, it would lose performance. But a burner takeoff roll in the N was the next best thing to a catapult shot off a carrier! In flight it was very responsive in pitch and roll and flew very smoothly. It did have the standard F-16 angle of attack and G limiters set at 30 degrees angle of attack and nine positive Gs. Once you got to one of those limits, it would give you no more. Any aircraft is like that, they can only give you so much. But they’re usually talking to you through things like buffet and wing rock as they approach that point, so you’re more aware that it has no more to give. The F-16 could be flying very smoothly at a slow speed and be at its angle of attack limit and you could pull with all your might, but you weren’t going to move the nose any more as its computerized flight control system limited you from doing so. We actually had a minor mid-air collision between an N and an F-14 during the first year of flying them, and as I recall the F-16s flight control automation was a contributing factor. The F-16’s wingtip rail grazed the F-14’s trailing-edge flap. Also as with the other F-16 variants, it had an aft center of gravity and fly by wire flight controls to keep it under control in pitch. If you pulled back on the stick, initially the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizers would go down to start the nose of the aircraft pitching up. As you got the desired pitch rate and stopped increasing the pull on the stick, the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizers would actually go up to stop the pitch rate from increasing. We did have the ability to override the computer with a switch, but it was only for use in an emergency situation. Thankfully I never had to use it, however I was once fighting another F-16N whose pilot was required to do so. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Tactically, the A-4’s performance was very similar to the MiG-17, although not quite as good. In the mid ‘80s, the MiG-17 was definitely no longer a front line Soviet fighter, but it was still operational in many third world countries that we considered threats. The same things could be said for our F-5s that simulated MiG-21s, although there were large numbers of the ‘21s still operational in the world at that time. The F-5 could also simulate the MiG-23 if it stayed fast and made large arcing turns, and the ‘23 was operational all over the world. However, neither the A-4 or F-5 could properly simulate the fourth generation threats (Mig-29, Su-27 etc). The beauty of the F-16N was that it could simulate all of these threats well if flown properly by the adversary pilot. To simulate the MiG-17 or a similar threat, we simply flew the F-16 full up, except we never used the afterburner. To simulate the MiG-21, we flew it full up, except we would select more than zone two (zone five being the max) afterburner. To simulate the MiG-23 we flew the F-16N at the speed of heat and made no turns greater than about four G. On top of that, we could simulate the fourth generation Soviet fighters, the SU 27 and MIG 29, if we flew it full up, full burner and at any speed. I think that the arrival of the F-16N finally brought Naval Aviation to the reality that we had truly entered into the fourth generation threat arena. Prior to that time, we didn’t train to a large extent to confront forward-quarter capable threats (shooting down an enemy aircraft from front) because it was difficult to simulate shots, and we generally did not kill-remove fighters during exercises for forward quarter shots by bogeys. Now the adversary aircraft had a recordable radar and HUD which could be viewed in the debrief to validate forward quarter shots. The HUD also allowed instructors to make visual contact with opposing fighters much sooner, and the F-16’s bowless bubble canopy allowed us to maintain it more easily. Having flown the F-14 and A-4, both of which had multiple canopy bows and items everywhere blocking your outward vision, the visibility from the cockpit of the F-16 was spectacular! The thirty degree recline of the seat was comfortable, and felt very natural. It was supposed to allow the aircrew to withstand the high G forces better, although it did seem to help some in that regard, since your neck was now bent about thirty degrees between your upright head and your reclined body, turning your head and looking aft in under high G forces seemed more difficult. Another nice thing that we had with the N was a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR). This allowed the bogeys to know that their aircraft had been locked up by a fighter radar. When you added up all of these advances that the F-16N brought to the adversary pilot, they truly allowed us to simulate a very capable fourth generation threat, even in the absence of GCI (ground control intercept) radar control for the bogeys and/or the use of an instrumented range. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Putting The F-16N To Work At Topgun Initially the addition of the fourth generation adversary threat was phased in at the end of each phase of the Topgun class. For example, in the 1 V 1 phase, students would still fight simulators of second and third generation fighters early in the phase. However by the end of the phase, we now had the capability of exposing students to a fourth generation dissimilar threat. Each phase was done in a building block approach, as was the entire course. Normally as students progressed through the class to the latter phases, most flights had some type of scenario as a backdrop, so the students would have an idea of what the threat capabilities might be, and the tactics that they might be likely to use. Early class lectures prepared them in both of these areas. Obviously the further the class progressed, the more likely students would be to see a full up F-16N threat. If we were working with fleet squadrons or the RAG (replacement air group), we could do whatever they needed based upon their training objectives at the time. Department of Defense One problem that a fourth generation threat exposed us to was the inability to analyze the forward quarter battle. Instrumented ranges made this much easier, but attempting to do this on non-instrumented ranges was challenging. In the forward-quarter arena, when shots are taken relative to each other, missile flight times and aircraft maneuvering can all play into the difference between a kill, and being killed. Forward quarter shot kill removal had to become a reality, but it needed to be accurate. Consequently following the 1 V 1 phase, we did as much flying on instrumented ranges at Yuma, Fallon, and occasionally Nellis as possible. These ranges could accurately simulate the forward quarter missile shots. Probably the biggest side benefit for the instructors was that now we no longer simply had to talk the talk, we had to walk the walk. For all but the former F/A-18 and F-15 (exchange) pilots, this was the first time that we had operated an air-to-air radar and practiced tactical intercept communications. With the use of the radar/HUD recorders, we could do a much better job of debriefing ourselves after the fighter debrief was complete. The end result over time, based upon our experiences flying he F-16N, would be changes in what was taught at Topgun and consequently what was put out to the fleet. We had a total of eight F-16Ns at Topgun. With the departure of the F-5s, we had around seven or eight A-4s, plus we eventually got a TA-4. Normally the F-16s would work in sections of two aircraft. In the larger scenarios, we would normally have a section of F-16s as leaders with a section of A-4s hanging on behind them. If the “Dogs” (A-4s) got separated from the F-16s, they would obviously then become more dependant upon ground radar operator control. It all depended upon the scale of the mission, and the scenario that we were using. However, it was a safe bet that virtually any threat country with fourth generation fighters would be using a section of two aircraft together at a minimum, and we did the same. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Parrying The Super Nimble F-16N The F-14’s and F/A-18’s greatest defense against a full-up fourth generation threat was to win the forward quarter battle, and both had the ability to do just that. The F-14, with its two man crew, AWG-9 radar, AIM-54 missile launch-and-leave capability, and AIM- 7 and AIM-9 forward-quarter capable missiles, definitely could excel prior to the merge. Post-merge, short of perfect situational awareness and arriving in a position of advantage over a fourth generation threat, in particular an F-16N, the F-14 did not need to engage in a turning fight. That’s not to say that an F-14 could not win a turning fight with an F-16, but it would require a superior job by the F-14 crew and mistakes by the threat pilot. The F-16N simply enjoyed a significant maneuvering advantage over the Tomcat. The Hornet also enjoyed outstanding capabilities in the forward quarter, and could also win the battle there. Additionally the Hornet could also turn with most fourth generation threats in a turning fight. The scale could be tipped simply by how the Hornet was configured and how the threat aircraft was configured. A slick Hornet (configured with no external stores) taking on an F-16N was a great fight. Probably the biggest advantage that the Hornet had was the lack of an angle of attack limiter, which the F-16 did have. In a very slow knife fight, the Hornet could achieve a higher angle of attack and slow its down-course speed, flushing the F-16 out in front of it. Obviously this was about the last place a Hornet wanted to be in a true hostile all-aspect weapons capability environment, but in a sterile 1 V 1 engagement, this capability might give the Hornet an advantage. To counter this, the F-16N did not want to get into a slow-speed fight with the Hornet. Courtesy of Paul Nickell During my time at Topgun, we simulated a variety of threat weapons starting with the basics, the gun. We demonstrated and emphasized how lethal the gun could be even in high-angle off passes in a close in fight. From an air-to-air missile standpoint, we simulated the AA-2 Atoll, AA-7 Apex, AA-8 Aphid, AA-10 Alamo, and the AA-11 Archer. The Atoll and Aphid missiles were close-in and primarily rear quarter infrared (IR) homing missiles, like older Sidewinder variants. The Apex and Alamo were primarily forward quarter simi-active radar guided missiles loosely similar to our AIM-7 Sparrow. With the arrival of the F-16N, we did start simulating the Archer, an all aspect IR missile with off-boresight capability. Typically this would be part of the loadout when the N was being used to simulate a fourth generation threat. To simulate the Archer, we carried an AIM-9L or M simulator, and used the targeting symbology displayed on the HUD. The seeker could be boresighted or slaved to the radar, for limited off boresight capability. We did not have helmet mounted sights like those Russia had to target their Archer missiles far off their aircraft’s nose during a dogfight. Still, simulating the Archer even without it reinforced the fact that a turning fight with a fourth generation threat could be very deadly. Prior to my arrival at Topgun, the squadron received its first of a number of successive Air Force exchange pilots. Each was an F-15 pilot and a graduate of the Air Force F-15 Fighter Weapons School. Each was hand selected by the F-15 Fighter Weapons School to serve with us for a two to three year tour. They were all great assets to Topgun, and through them we developed a great rapport with the Weapons School at Nellis AFB. Usually once a year as both schools’ schedules allowed, we would meet at Nellis or Miramar for an exchange of the latest information and to do a little 1 V 1 flying. During one of these exchanges I remember going out into the SOCAL restricted airspace area in an F-16N with an F-15C. As I recall, most of the engagements ended up relatively neutral… except for one. Courtesy of Paul Nickell On this particular engagement I, with probably less than 100 hours in the F-16, was rapidly becoming offensive on the F-15, whose FWS instructor pilot probably had 2000 hours in the Eagle. Something was just not adding up, but I accredited it to my superior airmanship, and that was a mistake! He started going vertical and I, slightly in lag, started right up behind him. As we were pointed straight up, I saw this barn door size panel open on the top of his jet (speedbrake) and quickly realized that I had a lot of closure on him. At that point I transitioned to panic and collision avoidance mode. I successfully streaked right past him vertically, and as I did I noticed the barn door closing. Within a few seconds I had gone from a windscreen full of F-15, to looking back over my shoulder, straight down at him, trapped exactly where he wanted me to be; completely in control, at my six o’clock. He had baited me, and I had taken it hook, line, and sinker. We both had a good laugh about it in the debrief and I’ll bet he’s told that story a hundred times since! Although we were close with the F-15 FWS guys, we didn’t work with the F-16 FWS guys, even though we were flying F-16s. In the Air Force, the F-16’s mission was to a large extent air-to-ground, or what we considered “Attack” in Navy terms. Since at the time Topgun’s concentration was exclusively on the air-to-air or “Fighter” mission in Navy terms, we worked more closely with the F-15 guys as their mission was the same. For that reason, I never had the opportunity to fly the F-16N against any other variant of the F-16. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Keeping The F-16N In The Fight During my time flying the F-16N, it was a very reliable jet. Obviously there are some qualifiers that go along with that statement. It was a brand new aircraft, so the parts still had a great deal of life left in them. Additionally at Topgun we had great maintainers, and we had money and parts support priority to keep the jets flying. I don’t recall ever flying an F-16 with a failed radar. That was a far cry from my F-14 experience. Obviously as time went on, other problems would develop. I do recall a couple of things early on with the GE engine. One was a type of alert that we could get indicating that the oil quantity could be depleting. I remember my wingman getting this once in the warning area southwest of San Diego. I flew on his wing and we climbed to about 40,000 feet in case the engine seized as we headed back to Miramar. At that altitude he could have flown a flame out approach either into North Island or Miramar if the engine failed. Fortunately it didn’t and once in range of Miramar, we flew a precautionary flame out approach spiraling down to land on Runway 24 Right. It turned out to be a faulty alert. Another alert dealing with the engine meant that the jet would be down until maintenance could accomplish some type of check. I recall heading east on a Friday afternoon cross country trip and somewhere over New Mexico getting the alert. I was able to get ATC to call our maintenance people and they wanted me to return to Miramar. Fortunately due to the great fuel economy of the jet, I was able to turn around and fly nonstop back to San Diego. After landing I got in a different jet and started the trip again, only about three hours behind schedule. I also recall a problem in the summer of 1988 that downed all of the aircraft for a short period. I can’t remember if it was structural or engine related, but I do remember all of the N’s sitting in the hangar with their GE F110 engines removed. This was something not too uncommon for a new aircraft model, and it did not last for a long period of time. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Obviously over time, structural issues did become a problem. I think a large factor in that was the fact that the aircraft had a G limiter, so we felt we could pull as hard as we wanted without damaging the jet. We had all flown jets with G limits, and we had a sense of feel for G forces, but in those previous jets we had been the G limiters. We could pull as much as the jet could give us, and as much as we could physically take, yet we had to personally limit the G load based upon what we were feeling. Not that we were looking at a G readout in a turn, but we did have an indicator in the cockpit that would tell us what G we were pulling and mark the max G pulled until it was reset. At times we would pull too hard, exceed the G limit, and have to write it up and have Maintenance inspect the aircraft. The bottom line was that we were conscious of the G we were putting on the previous aircraft that we had flown. With the F-16 and its limiter, we weren’t so conscious of the G because we had an element of protection. However, it wasn’t long before we found out that even with the G limiter, we could overstress the jet. With the rapid onset of G, the aircraft could spike up and exceed the 9 G limit, which would be recorded on the HUD video. Maintenance would then have to use our tape to analyze how many frames of tape the exceedance lasted, which equated to the duration of the overstress. This would be used to determine if an inspection was warranted. The last factor was that the G limiter was for a symmetrical pull. If you are rolling and pulling at the same time, the wing on the side you’re rolling toward experiences less G, and the wing on the side you’re rolling from experiences higher G. The G limiter does not take this into account. Kevin L. Patrick There’s no doubt in my mind that over time these overstresses were what led to the demise of the F-16N. The Air Force flew the jet too and I’m sure that they had the same type of overstresses. The difference was in the missions of the Air Force F-16’s verses the Navy F-16’s and the frequency of overstresses on the N. Occasionally someone would refer to the F-16 as the “lawn dart.” That name came from a popular game at that time which used nose weighted plastic darts about a foot and a half long that a player would throw at a round plastic loop lying on a lawn. Because of the heavy point, when thrown at the loop the darts would generally pitch down and stick into the ground, hopefully in or near the ring. Unfortunately the F-16 had experienced several accidents early in its life where aircraft at low altitude suddenly and uncontrollably pitched nose-down and impacted the ground. Fortunately the problem had been fixed long before the N came on the scene, however you still heard reference to that name. We generally referred to them as “Vipers” and I think that was the unofficial name used even by Air Force pilots, due to its resemblance of a viper snake. The official name was the “Fighting Falcon.” Chris Lofting Colorful Opponents The F-16N’s arrived with a factory paint job that was a light grey and blue camo scheme. During my time flying them, that stayed the same, except for one aircraft. I don’t know the origin of the different camo schemes, or who controlled them. Asking some of my old Topgun bros it seems to be somewhat of an unknown, at least in my era at Topgun and the time shortly thereafter. Department of Defense The one aircraft that was painted differently just seems to have appeared that way on the ramp at some point. It was dark green and light green striped, and became known as “The Lizard.” I assume that as time went on and aircraft were due for repainting, various different schemes were used based upon threat country schemes. I don’t know if any of the others ever developed nicknames based upon their paint schemes. US Navy From Vipers Back To Dogs In early 1988 I spoke to the detailer about my future after Topgun. He told me that I could pretty much go anywhere that I wanted. I told him that I was interested in transitioning to F/A-18 and being stationed at NAS Cecil Field in Florida. His response was, “well I really didn’t mean anywhere.” At that time it was not easy for an F-14 pilot to get orders to the Hornet for his department head sea tour. Within a few years, they were forcing Topgun instructors with previous Tomcat experience to go to Hornet, but timing is everything and I had been extremely lucky with my timing up to this point in the Navy. I must say that leaving Topgun was one of the most difficult things that I have ever had to do. We had some amazingly gifted and talented instructors, but I was simply a fleet average pilot attempting to do an above average job. I had been honored to be in their company for almost three years, but now it was time to move on. Leaving active duty late that year, I was very fortunate to stumble upon VFC-885, an augment unit for VFC-13, the Fighting Saints, at Miramar. My last 10-12 months at Topgun were spent as the Training Officer. Even though I had made the decision to pursue a job as an airline pilot, I was so busy with my Topgun responsibilities that I accomplished very little towards securing a job in civilian aviation prior to separating from the Navy. Fortunately a RIO that I knew from VF-24 was very involved with the Reserves at Miramar. He called me a week or two before I left active duty, told me that there was a selection board for Reserve pilots very soon and advised me to fill out the paperwork. I followed his advice, and was fortunate to be selected. I owe him a debt of gratitude! My last day of active duty at Topgun was a Friday, and on Saturday morning I was drilling with the Reserves in VFC-885. For the next seven months I flew exclusively with VFC-885 while I continued working towards securing a job with a commercial carrier. As an augment unit to VFC-13, a fleet adversary support squadron, the two squadrons operated as one. Administratively, some of us were assigned to one squadron, some to the other, but otherwise no one knew the difference. Courtesy of Paul Nickell The pilots’ experience levels ranged anywhere from a previous S-3 Viking pilot who was a full time reservist, to former Blue Angel pilots, Topgun instructors and everything in between. Many were graduates of Topgun as either a fighter pilot, or as an adversary pilot. Some had many years of experience flying the A-4 and were extremely proficient at flying and fighting the jet. We flew the A-4F, otherwise known as the “Super Fox”, and the TA-4J. The Super Fox was more powerful than the A-4Es that I was familiar with from Topgun. It was the only A-4 that I ever flew that required you to pull the power back at times while fighting the aircraft. Prior to that it had always been push the throttle to the stop and leave it there for the duration of the engagement. Fighting the TA-4 was somewhat of a humbling experience. I mentioned previously that we had ended up with a TA-4 at Topgun, but we never flew it in 1 V 1s because we only had one. I still remember my first 1 V 1 between two TA-4s with the Fighting Saints. We were about a mile abeam and 300 knots when we called “Fights On.” I rolled and pulled with about the same amount of force that I was used to from the E/F model Skyhawk variants I had flown previously and was immediately in heavy buffet. I knew better, but it was what came natural after years of fighting the single seaters. The guy in the back was laughing and shouting “easy!!!, easy!!!” over the intercom. I eventually got used to fighting the “T bird.” VFC-885’s mission was very different from Topgun’s mission, and my time there allowed me to gradually transition to civilian life. As opposed to training and guiding the fleet, VFC-885’s job was to support the fleet and RAG in any way those squadrons required. They did so in an extremely professional manner. I arrived qualified in the A-4 and was pretty much dove right into the mission from day one at VFC-885. Walking away from Topgun and the F-16N was extremely difficult, but a part of life. I had become very comfortable with the aircraft and its weapons systems. Although most would think that the sheer power and maneuverability of the jet would be the greatest part of it, I’ll have to say that running the radar and learning to employ the weapons system through the hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls was the most rewarding part of it for me. Courtesy of Paul Nickell Coming from the Tomcat, the ability to operate the radar in every manner, employ all types of weapons, fly the aircraft, and communicate with other aircraft without ever taking your hands off of the throttle and stick was like heaven! On top of that you had the ability to see the radar picture on a multifunction display, and all flight and weapons parameters on the HUD. Thus you had the complete tactical picture displayed directly in front of you. And because you were operating the system, you didn’t have to try to listen to someone else describe the situation. With time, you not only flew tactically as one with the aircraft, but you also operated and employed the weapons system in the same manner. I had never played the piano, but I eventually felt as if I did while operating the F-16N. It was amazing at times in the debrief to watch the tapes and see what you had done during and engagement, realizing that you had done many of these things without ever consciously thinking about them. So as I left the F-16N behind, it was back to the basics in the A-4 full time. Loaded up with simulated rear quarter missiles and a gun, we would use reverse bearing and distance calls that the fighters were making and eyeballs out of the cockpit to run intercepts. Locating the giant F-14s usually wasn’t too difficult. If we survived until the merge, then it was time to try to bait the fighters to turn with us and get slow. That was where the A-4 still had a chance; it was back to groveling. Lockheed Martin/US Navy The Early Death And Eventual Rebirth Of The Navy Viper I know that the F-16N had problems structurally, but its retirement occurred so long after I left Topgun that I don’t have first-hand knowledge of its demise. I do recall that even in its first year and a half of service there was an awareness of structural issues, and we became more conscious of the loads that we were putting on the jet, as opposed to relying on the G limiter. We did start making maintenance write-ups if our G counter on the HUD displayed over nine Gs, and Maintenance would look at our video tapes to determine the appropriate inspection requirements. Topgun had eight of the 26 F-16s the Navy purchased. I’m not sure what was happening at the other squadrons flying the remaining 18 aircraft. In researching the problem, I’ve come to the realization that all F-16s have had problems with hairline cracks on some of the airframe’s bulkheads. This problem is not unique to the F-16, it occurs in virtually all airframes over time. The F-16 was designed to withstand up to a nine G load with a life of 8,000 flying hours. However by the time the F-16 had been operational for 10 years, a program called Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) was in place to complete an extensive modernization and add an additional 5,000 hours to its life. As a precursor to the MLU, the airframe was examined and all cracks were repaired. Possibly when GD sold the N to the Navy at a rock bottom price, they planned to make some of the profit back at the MLU point, but I doubt they would have advertised that detail. It’s similar to buying a new car. The dealers don’t make their money on the sale, they make it on maintenance and repair over the life of the vehicle. From an engineering standpoint, it’s advertised that the lower wing attachment points of the N were made stronger to withstand the higher expected rates of heavy G. Is it possible that by strengthening the weakest link in the structure, a new weakest link was created elsewhere, and one that might be much more difficult and expensive to repair than the previous weak link. I don’t know the answer to that question. I’m sure that the decision to retire the jet was based upon economics. I doubt that anyone wanted to see such a capable dissimilar adversary aircraft disappear, but ultimately someone had to pay the repair bill. Obviously the money that had been saved on the purchase of the aircraft had not been placed in an “F-16N maintenance trust”. The Navy did reacquire the F-16 less than a decade after the N’s retirement, although not buy ordering them new from the factory. These jets came from a lot of embargoed F-16s that were built for Pakistan. The good news is that when the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) received the aircraft in the 2002/03 timeframe, the airframes had virtually zero time on them. Lockheed Martin/Code One In comparison to the N, these aircraft have the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 engine with about 2000 pounds less thrust than the N’s GEs F110 engines. Of the Pratts, it was the more reliable of the early model F-16 engines. The radar should be the same as what we had on the N, the APG-66. For Hornet pilots I’m sure it is a step down, but at least in the mid ‘80s, it was sufficient for our mission. Unless removed, I assume the aircraft have the cannon and ammo feed system, adding around 350 pounds of weight, but eliminating the requirement for ballast weight in the nose. Most likely these aircraft do not have the strengthened wing… and maybe that’s a good thing. Overall, I surely would not pass up these aircraft. I would say that they are very close to what we had with the F-16N, with the biggest difference being 2000 pounds of thrust. Personally, of all of the differences, I would place the thrust difference at the bottom of the priority list. For 1 V 1 scenarios that bit of thrust might be important, but for the vast majority of NSAWC’s missions, I think it’s negligible. It appears that since the embargo has been lifted against Pakistan, they now want the 28 jets delivered that they paid for but never received. Fourteen went to the Air Force, and fourteen went to the Navy at NSAWC. My understanding is that both services were told to return the aircraft for delivery to Pakistan, but so far only the Air Force has begun to do so. The Navy has managed to hang on to theirs and keep them flying. I have to laugh about that. Even though the command or squadron of Topgun no longer exists, the spirit still lives with those running the class and mission at NSAWC. From the beginning of Topgun, it was lie, cheat, and steal; do whatever you had to do to get what you need and make it work for the organization, and ultimately the fleet. My guess is that the Navy will finally surrender the F-16s when they have zero hours left on the airframes, and then bill Pakistan for the cost of maintenance for all of these years! Courtesy of Paul Nickell Memorable Moments In The Hottest F-16 On The Planet We were at Naval Air Station Fallon between Topgun classes, in support of Air Wing training. After the F-16’s arrived, our services were in constant demand because everyone wanted exposure to the fourth generation threat. At times this stretched us very thin, and we often anguished and battled it out in staff meetings as we attempted to prioritize what we could support and what we could not. On one particular night it was another instructor and I each flying F-16Ns. We provided adversary support for several Air Wing night strike missions, and then we were done. We had lots of gas remaining and started heading back to Fallon. There happened to be a restricted target area, R-4804, about 20 miles from the runway and we asked if anyone was using it. No one was, so we meandered into it. It was a beautifully clear night with a full moon. There was a lot of snow on the mountains and it was almost like daytime with so much moonlight reflecting off the snow cliffs. Before you know it, one of us lights the burner and starts turning in, a move which was quickly reciprocated by the other. Rapidly we end up across the circle from each other in somewhat of a lufbery , with neither of us being aggressive, just taking in the beauty of it all. Long light-blue burner plumes were visible against the deep blue night sky with the moon acting almost as the sun above. Then one of us started going more vertical and pretty soon we were across the circle from each other doing loops. At times we were looking at the other against the deep blue heavens above, and at times against the brilliant white snow on the earth below. This lasted for several minutes of time above the earth that night, but the beauty of it is etched in my brain forever. Lockheed Martin/Code One Another time that stands out was one of my last Topgun class graduation exercises. The target was an enemy airfield in R-4804. I was in the lead section of bogeys, two F-16N’s, and we had a section of A-4’s dragging along behind us. Initially we were holding over the enemy airfield, and then we got the call that radar showed fighters inbound. We did another quick circle around over the airfield simulating the reaction and launch time for enemy bogeys from the airfield, and then took a vector for the inbound fighters. We pushed it up to about 450 knots, hoping the Dogs could hang with us. Almost immediately we had the fighters on the radar. Each F-16 pilot called his contacts, with the lead having a flight of two, line abreast, at about 20,000 feet, and the wing having a flight of two about five miles in trail of the lead section, and offset right at about 15,000 feet. I locked one of their lead section jets and my wingman locked one of the jets in the trail section. Our communications were very clear and concise with every call acknowledged. Beyond that there was a good bit of silence during the intercept, with the Dogs in tow behind us silent the entire time. They were simply listening to the comms between the Viper pilots and building their situational awareness from it. Approaching ten miles head-on, I took a simulated Alamo missile shot on the lead section of fighters. Within a few seconds, I was told by the range controller that I was dead. Oh well! That meant my shot went stupid, and that would probably be it for me for the day. I did the standard kill removal procedure for being shot in the forward quarter. I went to full burner, stood the jet on the tail, and started doing aileron rolls going straight up. This would identify me visually to the fighters so that they would not pursue me any longer. During that maneuver I topped out somewhere close to 35,000 feet, then rolled and headed back toward the bogey airfield. To simulate the reality of larger numbers of bogeys, I could come back to life, but I would have to fly back to my home airfield (the target) before I could regenerate. I bolted that way and arrived just after the strike package had exited the target area. By the time the range controllers gave me a vector, the good guys were well out of range and home free. I joined back up with the rest of the bogeys and we did some low-altitude intercepts, raging around in the valleys between the mountain ranges until we got to bingo fuel, and then headed back to Fallon. Chris Lofting Before the class debrief, we did a quick bogey debrief with everyone describing what they had seen during the scenario. My comments were obviously very short. Then the Dog driver that was in trail of me spoke. He picked it up with our initial vector and then talked about listening to the communications of the two F-16 pilots running the intercept. As he flew along simply listening, he felt as if he had perfect situational awareness as to what to expect when the flight merged with the fighters. He then went on to talk about me being shot, and the kill removing maneuver I executed. As I pulled into the vertical and started doing aileron rolls, he flew right under me. He described how he watched as I pulled the F-16N vertical and went straight up, virtually disappearing into the deep blue sky above. He was mesmerized by what he saw. As I sat and listened to his recap, two things came to mind. First, the F-16N had finally allowed our staff to practice what we preached, and to build upon our syllabus based on our experiences flying and fighting this awesome fourth generation jet. Second, it made me realize the amazing power of the F-16N, and how blessed I had been to have the opportunity to fly it. Again, this was probably not the flight that most people would think would be my most memorable. However, as my F-16N time was waning, it was a time of reflection for me on just how far we had come as a staff since the arrival of the F-16N. Some outsiders believed that we were a group of arrogant pilots who lived to win. The reality was that this might be true, but you had to determine what constituted winning. We definitely were arrogant about training the best fighter pilots in the world. If we did our jobs well, we went out and lost to those fleet fighter pilots, dying at their hands on a daily basis. In some ways we couldn’t lose. If the fighters did poorly, we could win an engagement, but if the fighters did well and killed us, we truly won in the sense of the big picture and our mission.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force appears to have passed on the greatest leap in air combat capability since the advent of the jet engine—or at least that’s how it looks. Unmanned military capabilities are all the rage these days, with concepts ranging from insect-sized flying drones , to unmanned sub-hunting patrol boats , to notional pilotless hypersonic aircraft . Yet for some reason, the Air Force seems interested in nearly every application of unmanned warfare but the most relevant one of all, the type that could effectively and efficiently replace budget-busting tactical fighter aircraft while also leapfrogging our potential enemies when it comes to air combat capabilities for decades to come. The concept in question is not nearly as exotic as some may want you to believe. In defense terms, it is a relatively simple proposition: Build a stealthy, flying-wing unmanned aircraft similar in size to current manned fighters and design them to strike fixed targets deep inside highly defended airspace. Beyond this rudimentary but critical capability, these aircraft should also be designed to interact with one another and sense the battlefield around them using existing sensor technology, communications concepts and computing power. This will allow them to react to unplanned threats and even work as a team to avoid or destroy these threats and other targets of opportunity with inhuman efficiency. This package of capabilities is commonly referred to as an Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle, or UCAV. Before we dive in, let’s define a critical set of terms relevant to unmanned military vehicles: Man-in-the-Loop — A person is actively controlling the vehicle via a direct control interface. Examples of this concept are Predator and Reaper unmanned aircraft, which have pilots looking at a screen showing the aircraft’s forward view and flying it in a traditional sense. Navigational and tactical choices are made by the vehicle’s human controllers entirely. Semi-autonomous — The vehicle works on autopilot and follows commands that are pre-programmed or given to the vehicle via a desktop computer-like interface. The vehicle may have a certain amount of artificalintelligence, but it will ask for approval or direction before making key decisions. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a semi-autonomous vehicle. Autonomous — The vehicle goes about its mission without any real-time human direction. Navigational and tactical decisions are made solely by the vehicle based on preprogrammed software and mission parameters. Such a system could find, fix and finish a target without external direction by a human controller. Boeing Chapter 1: The Very Public Birth of the Modern UCAV You may think truly pilotless robotic flying machines—ones that can replace manned fighter and attack aircraft—sound fantastical. You would be wrong. In fact, this basic capability was proven over a decade ago in the guise of a Boeing Phantom Works and DARPA-led program that centered on a pair of technology demonstrator aircraft, designated X-45A. These unmanned aircraft looked alien at the time, but they are actually similar in appearance to the UCAV designs emerging today. The X-45A was a tailless aircraft with cranked stub wings and a trapezoid-shaped fuselage. The aircraft had low observable (stealth) features and weapons bays that would allow them to drop small GPS guided munitions during testing. Overall the X-45s were smaller than what a production model UCAV would look like, but as technology demonstrators used to prove that the networked UCAV concept could work, they were far beyond adequate. Both X-45As, Photo by David McNew/Getty Images The idea behind the program was not just to fly a stealthy drone remotely via a semi-autonomous command and control interface, but to prove these jets could work together with minimal direction, reacting as a team to their combat environment and surviving to fight another day after completing their objectives. Instead of a being flown by a pilot in front of a console, like the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper, the X-45s would run via a point-and-click desktop interface, and in some cases, without any human commands at all. The X-45s would be told to perform various tasks, head to a certain area or enter into certain modes. The vehicles themselves could ask for permission to perform certain critical actions or to respond to a particular situation, and the threshold for the aircraft’s own artificial intelligence level and decision making authority could be set according to each mission’s goals. Boeing’s control software for the X-45s was called DICE, or Decision Mission-Control Software. The software allowed ground operators to guide the X-45’s mission from anywhere in the world, and it allowed both X-45A aircraft to work as a team to accomplish their mission via leveraging a set of algorithms, onboard sensors and communications data links. Boeing’s semi-autonomous UCAV workstation running DICE softwarer , Boeing Chapter 2: Introduc ing Drone Swarms The first X-45 flight took place at Edwards Air Force Base on May 22nd, 2002, and the second example flew six months later. The aircraft themselves were impressive, but the DICE software Boeing built to control them was even more so. Together, they were the first publicly disclosed operational progenitor of the flying UCAV “swarm” concept as we know it today. This is where multiple unmanned aircraft interact together autonomously to accomplish tasks at incredible speeds via a cloud-like “collective” computer mind. The concept has become a common one in defense circles today, but in the early 2000s it was still the realm of science fiction. During testing, the X-45s quickly proved they could not only fly together as a single formation with a high level of autonomy, but that they could strike targets while doing so. By early 2005, the pair were executing mock combat missions as a single integrated unit. As testing progressed, program managers at Boeing and DARPA were sure they were on the precipice of a new era in air combat, one of untold bounds and incredible marketability. The idea was that if the X-45s could prove their mettle in challenging tests, throngs of full-sized UCAVs could be flying operationally by the turn of the decade. A move that would shatter the decades-long development times of much more costly manned fighter and attack aircraft. X-45A with weapons bay door open, DARPA On the program’s 50th test flight, the aircraft were slated to prove just how promising their new capabilities are. The X-45s were flown over a simulated enemy battlefield with autonomous control and decision making largely there own. Suddenly, a simulated threat radar activated. The pair of networked UCAVs immediately classified the threat and executed a plan to destroy it based on the position of each X-45 in relation to the target, what weapons were available, what each drone’s fuel load was and the nature of the target itself. The calculations happened in a blink of an eye. One X-45 immediately changed heading to attack the virtual SAM site while asking for permission to do so from the ground operator monitoring the mission. The attack was approved, and the X-45 obliterated the simulated threat with GPS-guided bombs. Then, another threat—one tougher to detect than the first—popped up and was successfully prosecuted with great prejudice by the flying robotic duo. Both X-45As at Edwards AFB, Boeing The test proved that unmanned semi-autonomous tactical aircraft could not only react successfully to unplanned circumstances, but they could do so in such a manner that was in some ways superior to their manned counterparts. Additionally, this test included just two aircraft. Dozens, or even hundreds, of UCAVs could leverage this same cooperative decision making. The potential implications of this new technology were massive. The crazy thing is that this test happened over a decade ago. Think of what your cell phone looked like in 2005, or your television, and compare that to what they look like now. While the future looked blindingly bright for UCAVs, against all logic, the great UCAV revolution would be buried without explanation, and with it the promise of an operational and devestating unmanned swarm. X-45A, NASA/Dryden Chapter 3: UCAVs Disppear Into Oblivion So what happened to the X-45 program? Having ramped up in the early 2000s, it quickly morphed into a joint initiative called the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System, or J-UCAS for short. The Navy had been running its own, albeit less advanced UCAV technology demonstrator program with the Northrop Grumman X-47A. With J-UCAS, both programs were brought under the same umbrella and would be forced to share some information, although each team was able to go about achieving their own distinct goals. Still, a fly-off between the two defense giants for a single full-scale, joint service UCAV was on the horizon. X-47A Pegasus, DARPA By 2005, two years after the J-UCAS program launched and the same year Boeing proved just what its X-45s could do as a team, DARPA exited the effort. The J-UCAS program was then transferred entirely to the USAF and the Navy. This made some sense, as a supposed fly-off for a full sized UCAV would be administered by the two services jointly, with the hopes that a single operational UCAV design could be procured for both services toward the end of the decade. Then in 2006 this Navy-Air Force consortium suddenly imploded, with the USAF dropping out of the program entirely. This was an incredibly peculiar move as the technology clearly had a wide array of applications that could have huge game-changing impacts on the modern battlefield. The strangest thing about the USAF’s sudden exit is that they did not proceed to start their own UCAV development program afterwards. From this point on it was almost as if the technology did not exist in the Air Force’s eyes. How could the USAF turn its back on such a monumental advance in warfare? It seems nearly unthinkable if not downright reckless. Was this move a result of the success of the X-45 team and the resulting threat that this new capability posed not just to the USAF’s historically insular fighter pilot culture, but also to the service’s massive strike-fighter program that was just spinning up, the F-35? Or was the USAF’s burial of a UCAV initiative the result of the fact that something else very similar already existed in the classified world? It is quite possible that either or even both possibilities were true. X-47B N-UCAS demonstrator, Northrop Grumman Chapter 4: The Navy’s UCAV Initiative Soldiers On The Navy proceeded with its own UCAV program after the demise of J-UCAS, but only as a larger technology demonstration program known as N-UCAS. Boeing would compete with Northrop Grumman for this contract, and eventually Northrop Grumman would win the bid. This gave birth to the now famous full-scale X-47Bs test aircraft. These aircraft would go on to prove themselves as capable of amazing feats, including landing, launching and operating from the deck of an aircraft carrier in 2013 as well as refueling autonomously in mid-air in 2015. These series of hugely successful tests has set the Navy up to field its first operational unmanned aircraft aboard its aircraft carriers in the not so distant future. This aircraft will be known as the MQ-25 Stingray or the Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS ). The Navy’s move to field a less ambitious unmanned aircraft concept, one more focused on aerial refueling and working as a sensor platform than an advanced deep-striking UCAV is a misguided one, but that is a whole other story. Still, at the very least CBARS is a step in the right direction for the Navy. The fact is that the Navy has been more conservative than the USAF when it comes to its tactical aircraft fleet in recent decades. The Navy’s flying branch has taken a “platform” approach to air power, focusing on efficiency, affordability, multi-role utility and commonality for its tactical aircraft fleet over a focus on top-of-the-line capabilities. Hence the F/A-18 Hornet’s nests that are modern American supercarriers. The Super Hornet has become a one-size-fits-all solution for the Navy, who still has not introduced a stealthy airframe to its carrier air wings till this very day. The F-35C is slated to finally provide this capability some 25 years after it was originally promised to the Navy in the form of the long-defunct A-12 Avenger. USN There are also the unique challenges that come with operating unmanned systems from the bustling deck of a supercarrier that large airfield-based unmanned systems don’t have to contend with. Still, in the long run UCAVs are ideally suited for the carrier environment and mission as much, if not more so, than any other. Yet in the nearer-term, the USAF was a much more logical candidate to field advanced UCAVs in large numbers early on than the Navy. Chapter 5: A Skunk Works S urprise A year after the USAF dropped out of J-UCAS, seemingly without a replacement, a strange thing happened. In 2007, a stealthy flying wing unmanned aircraft was spotted operating at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. This mystery aircraft was originally dubbed the “Beast of Kandahar” by the defense press. Public Domain At the time, it wasn’t hard to figure out its overtly logical purpose. There is no need for a stealth drone to operate in uncontested airspace like that above battlefield Afghanistan. No, this shadowy aircraft was built to spy over enemy and even semi-friendly countries alike, such as Iran and Pakistan—and that was exactly what it was doing. Although details were slow were emerge, this aircraft was eventually unmasked as the RQ-170 Sentinel , a Lockheed Martin Skunk Works product used by the CIA and the USAF. Years later, the aircraft would become famous for spying on Iran’s nuclear facilities, helping to locate Osama Bin Laden, secretly watching him from on high as he paced around his prison-like yard at his Abbottabad compound , as well as for falling into Iranian hands almost completely intact. https://youtube.com/watch?v=I0k2qFdiFE4 It was quite peculiar that Lockheed Martin had been seemingly totally absent, at least publicly, from the Pentagon’s UCAV initiatives during the early and mid-2000s. Yet we now know that they not only had flown a UCAV sized, deep penetrating, stealthy flying wing unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, but that it was fully operational and flying over some of the most highly defended places in the world during this same period of time. Additionally, by 2007 it was doing so in broad daylight with little regard for secrecy or operational security. You can read all about the likely origins of the RQ-170 here and here , but its exact history is less important than the fact that it exists at all. While Northrop and Boeing were publicly giving birth to the modern UCAV concept, and battling over high-profile testing contracts in hopes of supplying the Navy and Air Force with hundreds of UCAVs one day, the Skunk Works had not only tested similar systems, but had at least one of them fully operational and doing work in some of the nastiest airspace on the planet. As far as we know, the RQ-170 is only equipped with sensors, and even if it had a weapons bay it would be a very small one. But that doesn’t mean another variant of this design, either the same size or larger, could have also been built and at least tested. In fact, it is pretty absurd to think otherwise. Remember, at its very least, a UCAV’s core mission would be flying to a set of coordinates, dropping a GPS guided bomb or two, and then fly back to its base. This is a far simpler mission than penetrating enemy airspace, persisting there for hours while directing various sensors to spy on specific locales on the earth below, and returning home safely to do it again another day. RQ-170, or a variant of it, apparently made it to Guam in 2011. This aircraft is different in certain ways than the RQ-170 that fell into Iranian hands. It’s exact capabilities remain unclear., DoD via War Is Boring With this in mind, retrofitting basic UCAV capabilities into an existing stealthy flying wing surveillance drone design like that of the RQ-170 seems like a glaringly logical move. In fact, the Skunk Works agrees with this as they have put forward an enlarged Sentinel design called the Sea Ghost in an attempt to fulfill the Navy’s UCAV needs . There has also been rumors of “Super Sentinels” already existing which could be an operational UCAV evolution of the RQ-170, and the missing link between the navalized Sea Ghost concept and its more diminutive spying progenitor. Lockheed’s Sea Ghost naval UCAV concept which is based directly on the smaller RQ-170 Sentinel design., Lockheed Martin Chapter 6: The F-117 Nighthawk retires without a successor Another interesting event that occurred around the same time as the first sightings of the RQ-170 was the somewhat ambiguous retirement of the F-117 Nighthawk, America’s first stealth strike aircraft. Even at the time of its retirement in 2008, no other known stealthy tactical aircraft existed that could drop heavy-hitting 2,000-pound precision guided bombs. Some officials said that the F-22 would take over a piece of the Nighthawk’s mission, but the Raptor is limited to just a pair of the smaller 1,000-pound Mk83/GBU-32 JDAMs. Only the B-2, of which just a handful are available for combat at any given time, can match and exceed the F-117’s destructive power while surviving deep over enemy territory. In that sense, the F-117 program represented a unique and proven capability, one that seems far too important for the USAF to just give up. This is especially considering that the decision was made during the height of the Bush Administration defense spending splurge. Maybe the oddest part about the F-117’s retirement was that the USAF never even complained. USAF The F-117’s mission was deep precision strike. For the vast majority of its career it accomplished this via the use of laser guided bombs. F-117 “Bandits” (pilots) ability to navigate to their targets at night, without radar, and employ the jet’s pair of 2,000-pound laser-guided bombs was an artform prior to the introduction of GPS. During the tail-end of its career, the F-117 force was able to drop GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions. With this new upgrade the F-117s could simply fly to a point and release these weapons with a high degree of accuracy, regardless of the weather conditions. Once again, this is the rudimentary mission of UCAVs, and it begs the question: Was the F-117 replaced by a small fleet of stealthy operational UCAVs that existed in the classified world much like the F-117 did for nearly a decade before its eventual disclosure? The F-117 program would have been an ideal model on which to base a clandestine UCAV program, and since UCAVs don’t require constant training flights like a similar manned system does, they can stay hidden much easier. DoD Since its retirement the F-117 fleet has been maintained in a regenerative state, and even occasionally flown at the shadowy Tonopah Air Force Base , which is also the likely operational home of a pocket UCAV force—if it were to exist. Maybe the F-117s were kept in such a state to hedge against what was still a very new, evolving and untested technology. Now, nearly a decade later, with the largely mummified F-117 force potentially getting scrapped once and for all , will a disclosure of a small UCAV fleet follow? The F-117 was first disclosed along a similar timeline in 1989. Chapter 7: The Ramifications of the Unknown With all this in mind, it is possible that the UCAV revolution happened in the depths of the “black projects” world even before it happened in the unclassified world. If this is true, Lockheed’s Skunk Works were almost certainly the dark shepherds that brought forth this new and devestating technology. On one hand, this would seem like a dramatic example of how isolated the classified weapons development world is from the non-classified one, and of how many billions of dollars are needlessly wasted developing parallel capabilities. On the other, if the USAF had chosen to watch parallel capabilities develop, Lockheed’s classified stealth unmanned aircraft developments could have acted as an independent control variable against UCAV developments occuring in the unclassified world. Once one effort had pulled ahead in its capabilities, a down-select would likely have been made. In this case, that selection would have been whatever was going on outside of the public’s, and to a large degree Washington DC’s eyes. Could this situation have been the catalyst for the USAF’s dropping out of J-UCAS in 2006, just a year before the RQ-170 suddenly emerged? Did the USAF continue to invest in the UCAV space via the Skunk Works, albeit in the realm of deep classification, to a point that would justify the F-117s retirement? USAF The question remains: Why hide the existence of even a pocket force of operational UCAVs, considering that the world has watched the Navy’s X-47B not only fly, but operate from a carrier and even refuel autonomously? Additionally, the X-45s proved the UCAV concept for the entire world to see years prior. With the B-2, the USAF has the ability to strike with 2,000-pound and even heavier-hitting weapons deep into defended territory. so it’s not like hiding a small force of stealthy UCAVs would make the enemy feel as if well defended targets were not already at risk of attack by US forces. Then agian, maybe the USAF wasn’t primarily hiding the UCAVs from the enemy at all, but instead from the government and taxpayers who paid for them in the first place. Classifying such a game-changing and relevant capability doesn’t just distort the important and very expensive weapon system procurement choices being made by Congress, the White House and the Pentagon. It also skews America’s defense strategy as a whole and all the long-term force planning that goes along with it. It doesn’t seem like an uncommon practice for the powers that be to classify programs in order to protect inferior non-classified programs from having direct competition. Some weapons programs are also hidden in the classified world to prevent special interests from trying to cancel them in favor of other non-classified programs—ones that are less capable but more lucrative. Either way, the losers in such practices are America’s ability to get the best force for its money, and the warfighter’s chances of success in a conflict. That is, if you think the primary goal of America’s armed forces is to fight and win wars, not create jobs or to support particular industries. Northrop Grumman Clearly, if UCAVs were flying even in smaller numbers, and their networked hive mind could be proven on a larger and more advanced scale than what the X-45 proved over a decade ago, such a system would hugely threaten the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The F-35’s primary missions include deep strike, surveillance and “destruction of enemy air defenses,” or DEAD. These are the exact same as those of a UCAV. In many ways, the UCAV could execute these missions far more efficiently and ferociously than their costly manned counterparts. Chapter 8: The Potential Advantages of UCAVs The USAF’s fighter aircraft age catastrophe and pilot shortage crisis , as well as the tactical challenges that the force faces on the battlefields of tomorrow, could largely be solved by a UCAV force. Even the USAF’s failing fighter budget could be cured by procuring, at least partially, UCAVs instead of expensive and inflexible manned systems that represent a half century-long financial and strategic commitment. It may be uncannily unpopular to the USAF’s pilot dominant culture, and even to military and aviation aficionados, but UCAVs have a laundry list of potential advantages over manned fighters and attack aircraft. In fact, they could revolutionize the very idea of what an Air Force looks like, how it trains, how it fights, and the money needed to sustain its capabilities. Here are some of the major potential benefits of stealthy UCAVs based on general concepts that have coalesced in recent years: – They have lower acquisition prices than modern fighters: You can build many more UCAVs for the same price of an advanced stealthy manned fighter. A four-to-one or even six-to-one ratio has been floated depending on how advanced the UCAV is. Doing so would break the cycle of ever increasingly expensive fighters eating up the DoD’s budget and add greater end-strength to the rapidly shrinking Air Force’s tactical jet inventory. This issue has morphed into an absolute crisis , with a recent Pentagon report stating that the USAF will not be able to afford its fighter jet fleet by the year 2021, just five years from now. In many ways UCAVs offer both a quantitative and qualitative advantage at the same time. USAF – UCAVs could be rapidly adapted to perform various missions, and a flight of UCAVs can “share” expensive sensors: With UCAV swarms you do not have to equip every UCAV with the same expensive sensors and subsystems as you have to with manned fighters. Using adaptable open architecture and “plug and play” design philosophies, a group of UCAVs can be outfitted for a particular mission or mission set. By adapting a single airframe for various roles via a series of unique configurations, great cost savings can be realized without greatly hampering the effectiveness of the swarm as a whole. In a single swarm “package” of UCAVs, you can have some airframes outfitted with advanced radars, some carrying networking, data-fusion and communications hardware, while others can carry highly sensitive electronic emissions sensing gear. Another set can carry bombs and missiles, while others can be outfitted with directed energy weapons (lasers) or advanced jamming equipment. Additionally, some can carry combinations of these capabilities. Because a package of UCAVs can act as a networked swarm and are constantly linked together via data link, each UCAV can share its sensor information with all the other UCAVs in its swarm and in real-time. When all this data is combined, a high-fidelity picture of the battlefield is rendered for the whole swarm to exploit. In other words, a UCAV that has no radar at all, can benefit from other UCAVs outfitted with such systems as if it were its own. Even working as a small swarm of say six UCAVs, three could be optimized as simple munitions mules, two can operate as sensor craft, and one can be outfitted as an aerial tanker and jamming support platform. Although the munitions mules may not be equipped with a radar or other targeting and situational awareness sensors, they are virtually equipped with them as the swarm’s collecting brain can “see” a fused “picture” of all the UCAV’s sensor information combined. For missions where you need maximum redundancy, the swam could be made up of all fully outfitted UCAVs with all the bells and whistles, similar to how fighters types are equipped equally today. Not only does such a concept save money while lowering the fiscal risks of combat, but it also allows for new systems to be more easily integrated into an ever changing UCAV force. Boeing’s X-45C, a full sized operational test aircraft that flew in the late 2000s. Although it was very promising and built on lessons learned from the X-45A J-UCAS program, the USAF had little interest in it., Boeing – They possess far greater range and loitering time than their manned fighter jet counterparts: UCAV concepts generally have double to quadruple the combat radius of their manned progenitors. This is due in part to their lower kinetic and maneuverability requirements, their flying wing designs, and the fact that they don’t have valuable space and payload taken up by a cockpit and life support systems. Considering the anti-access and area-denial issues we face against potential enemies today , this greatly increased range alone makes procuring UCAV technology on a large scale essential. The F-35A has a combat radius of about 590 miles, which means a vulnerable tanker will have to get within 590 miles of the F-35A’s target to provide gas, or even more of an issue, the jet will have to be based within that distance of its target. In actuality, under real combat conditions the F-35A’s combat radius will likely be further reduced, since the 590-mile figure is a “brochure” metric. Our potential enemies’ large arsenals of ballistic and cruise missiles means that land-basing F-35s within 590 miles of the enemy’s borders is a non-starter in a real shooting war. China’s long-range strike-fighter, the J-20, is designed to fly out long distances to go after America’s vulnerable flying force multipliers, including tankers and AWACS aircraft. This strategy, which I pointed out right after the J-20 was first photographed, makes total sense for the Chinese. Why take on fighters when you can take them out simply by downing the tankers they are so dependent on or blind them partially by blasting their AWACS out of the sky? Even the Russia’s next SAM system, the S-500, will have a supposed range of 375 miles, and follow-on versions will only see its engagement envelope even further extended. Thus the F-35’s 590 mile combat radius has a shrinking margin of success against a well-armed peer-state competitor. Seeing as the F-35 is supposed to serve for many decades to come, with the last examples going out of service in 2070 , the idea that short-ranged fighters will even be tactically relevant in a decade or two is highly debatable. The F-35A’s striking distance can be increased by a couple hundred miles via the use of standoff weaponry, but that also somewhat defeats the point of theF-35’s stealthiness to some degree, especially as a conflict progresses, and there are limited stockpiles of these types of highly expensive weapons on-hand at any given time. Additionally, the more very expensive fighter jets the US buys, the less standoff weaponry it can afford to have lying around. Even America’s stockpiles of much less expensive guided bombs and short-range air-to-ground missiles cannot sustain the ongoing limited air campaign against ISIS! In the end, these factors can put the F-35A, and other fighters for that matter, out of the fight on day one. A UCAV with a range of double or even triple that of the F-35A, while carrying the same payload, does not have this problem. The ability to loiter very near or even over enemy territory for long periods of time, and survive, has become an invaluable intelligence gathering capability. Aerial reconnaissance in now far more focused on capturing a period of time (RQ-170) instead of a moment in time (SR-71). When it comes to striking targets of opportunity, the same trend has emerged. Staying over a place and waiting for the enemy to expose themselves, and punishing them for doing so, has become a more in-demand service than simply striking fixed targets. Flying-wing UCAVs, with their large fuel loads, aerodynamic efficiency and fuel miserly turbofan powerplants allows them to stay on the scene for hours, not minutes, before needing to be refueled. , USN Finally, because UCAVs have much longer range they require less tanker support. Less tanker support means less tankers and a smaller overall USAF tanker program, saving billions. In fact, UCAVs could provide their own tanker support via buddy refueling. Doing so would just mean committing more UCAVs, some configured as tankers, in order to take out a particular target set without external tanker support. -They are more disposable: You don’t have to build a UCAV to fly 8,000 hours as with manned fighter aircraft, a requirement that adds significantly to an aircraft’s unit and development costs. Instead UCAVs can be designed to last a fraction of that flight time. The reason for this is that these aircraft don’t have to fly anywhere near as much as their manned counterparts. Nobody really has to train to fly them at all. Computer simulations and modelling, a strong centralized test and development effort and intermittent large-scale air combat exercises will be essential in proving new UCAV tactics and to certify the systems as effective, but beyond that these things can largely sit in a hangar and wait for combat. The days of putting hundreds of hours on a tactical jet airframe a year would be over. As a result, a UCAV could be designed to last a couple thousands hours of flight time or even far less. X-47B airframe undergoes stress and fatigue testing, Northrop Grumman via Alert5.com -They are expendable: UCAVs can be ordered to fly into the most dangerous airspace in the world without the potential loss of aircrew being a factor, which can have huge political ramifications both abroad and at home. This also means commanders can take greater risks with greater potential rewards during conflicts and can more freely strike at the heart of the enemy’s ability to wage war. For instance, instead of very slowly breaking down the bad guys’ area denial and anti-access capabilities from long-ranges using expensive standoff munitions , massive swarms of UCAVs can execute direct attacks on key anti-air warfare targets. UCAV’s far lower unit cost and simpler manufacturing process, one that can make the most of large composite structures and 3D printing, also means they can be replaced more efficiently than manned aircraft. In other words, UCAVs can speed up an air campaign’s intended results compared to manned systems, while doing so at far lower risk. -They don’t require pilots: Sure, this is the most obvious feature of UCAVs, but there is more to it than just not risking aircrews in combat. Because UCAVs don’t require pilots, the USAF would need to train less of them. This could not only be a solution to the USAF’s increasingly dire shortage of pilots but it could also mean that the service’s entire fleet of fast-jet and primary training aircraft could be significantly downsized. Such a move would equate to enormous savings when it comes to personnel and aircraft procurement, sustainment and operational costs. DoD Look at the USAF’s pending replacement program for the T-38C Talon, dubbed the T-X. If the USAF procured UCAVs aggressively how many billions would be saved on new training aircraft purchases simply because they won’t be needed? In fact, there may be no need for a T-X program at all, at least for a couple more decades, as the T-38 fleet could be consolidated and the its life stretched for many more years. This also underscores how a secret UCAV program, one that could be drastically expanded in the coming years if it were declassified, would make investing into an expensive new jet trainer program a monumental waste of money in the near term. The truth is that a front-line fighter jet will spend the vast majority of its flying life honing pilot skills, not flying combat missions. This takes massive amounts of fuel, maintenance man hours and parts, and a gargantuan backend support infrastructure. The fact that a UCAV requires none of this really is the concept’s biggest savings opportunity. Simply put, flying skills are not required to be a part of a UCAV’s command and control cadre. There are simply no pilots to train. Lockheed’s T-X candidate, the T-50A, which is based on the KAI/Lockheed Golden Eagle, took its first flight on June 6th. You can see video of it here. Whoever wins the contract is slated to produce hundreds of trainers for the USAF., YouTube Screencap Considering that the lowest cost per flight hour estimates for the F-35 are $32,000, with this number likely being far larger in reality, not having to fly a vehicle regularly at all is a very big deal. Beyond maintenance test flights and limited training and tactics certification exercises, UCAVs can remain in storage until they are needed for combat. UCAVs also don’t require combat search and rescue forces. If a UCAV is shot down, dozens of combat search and rescue and support aircraft don’t have to attempt a daring rescue of a downed aircrew. This also means less CSAR assets will be needed in inventory. This is a big deal considering the USAF has struggled for well over a decade to fund a new CSAR helicopter . And of course the potential ramifications of more lives being put in danger to rescue a downed aircrew behind enemy lines become a non-factor with UCAVs. Tyler Rogoway/Author The thing is, the USAF really doesn’t have a good answer when it comes to providing combat search and rescue capability for aircrews that fly aircraft like the F-35, F-22 and B-2. These jets can penetrate hundreds or even thousands of miles (in the B-2’s case) deep into highly contested airspace. Flying CSAR helicopters and their escorts (HH-60s or CV-22s and MC-130s) into such a situation would be ridiculously perilous proposition to say the least. With UCAVs this tactical conundrum vanishes. -UCAV design and procurement can rapidly adapt to changing tactical realities: Since they don’t have to have an 8,000 plus flight hour lifespan that will be spread over many decades, new UCAVs with enhanced design features and better low observable qualities can be bought on a regular basis. Such a concept also has the potential to greatly smooth the USAF’s notoriously disgraceful and unsustainable big-ticket weapons procurement process. Instead of buying an entirely new fighter jet every couple of decades, the service can constantly buy far cheaper UCAV designs in tranches of ever increasing capabilities tailored to match emerging threats in near real-time. This type of procurement concept allows for a far more nimble response to changing tactical challenges, and in doing so it puts America’s potential enemies at a drastically greater disadvantage when it comes to trying to counter our own capabilities. As UCAVs evolve, older units can be re-roled to perform non “tip of the spear” but still essential duties. These include tanking, acting as communication relays, flying data fusion centers, surveillance platforms and acting as arsenal ships for troops on the ground in lower-threat combat environments . In other words, commanders can use their newest, most updated UCAVs for kicking down the enemy’s door while also using older systems to fulfil other critical but less risky missions where a UCAV’s persistence is still a big plus. In the end, a UCAV, no matter how stealthy or advanced it is, is still capable of staying aloft for hours with a relatively large payload. As such, older designs will have many uses even after their “first day of war” utility is degraded by the passage of time. Dassault – In many high-risk combat situations a swarm of UCAVs may be far more effective than a large strike package made up of manned aircraft: A networked swarm of UCAVs has the potential to react to changes on the battlefield at microprocessor speeds. This allows them to totally outpace the enemy’s ability to employ countering tactics and even make decisions. Unlike humans, the swarm has few limits on how much information it can digest at a time and each node (UCAV) within a swarm adds to the quality of its overall situational awareness and effectiveness on the battlefield. Highly advanced tactics can be employed by the swarm to confuse the enemy and disrupt their ability to defend themselves. This can be done without any traditional radio communications. A directional line-of-sight data-link, such as one similar to the F-35’s stealthy “daisy chain” data-link concept known as Multifunction Advanced Data Link, or MADL for short, could facilitate robust and highly-secure data flow throughout a swarm and even back into friendly territory and then to satellites up above. Lockheed Martin Introducing a high-flying connectivity node , an aircraft-based data fusion center and rebroadcasting system, could allow many smaller swarms to be linked together over a vast distance, creating a super-swarm running on what would be akin to a hive mind. Such an increase in communications capability could greatly expand the geographical range, data-exchange capabilities and size of a swarm. Regardless of its networking scheme, the swarm concept takes the X-45’s DICE software and UCAV autonomy to a whole other level, although the basic nuts and bolts remain the same as they were a decade ago. With a swarm of dozens, or even hundreds of networked UCAVs fighting all at 100 percent efficiency at all times, the enemy is faced with the monumental task of defending themselves against such an efficient, agile and persistent foe. Advanced tactics, such as multi-vector attacks replete with decoys and jamming, could be executed by the swarm’s best available assets to solve a tactical problem, even an unplanned one. Based on pre-programmed directives, the swarm can instantly vector the right pairing of assets to take out a particular threat or perform a certain task at hand. If that threat is an advanced surface-to-air missile battery, maybe the swarm assigns a pair of Small-diameter Bomb slinging UCAV strikers, one UCAV equipped with electronic jamming systems, and two more to make a decoy attack from high altitude. If the SAM site is less threatening in nature, maybe the swarm sends a single UCAV nearby to drop a JDAM on it, or the swarm avoids it entirely. Dassault There is no magic behind this capability; the swarm’s software would have pre-loaded responses to various stimuli and situations with a certain amount of AI built in to cope with complex scenarios. In a fully autonomous fashion, the swarm will make the decision of how to deal with the threat based on its programming without a human interrupting its onslaught. If they are running in a semi-autonomous fashion they will ask for permission or even direction from a human operator before executing certain tasks. The filer of what task is worthy of asking permission can be set by mission planners before the mission is executed. For instance, changing a route to avoid an enemy SAM site autonomously may be allowed, while attacking that same site may need permission from a human operator. This method, although maybe politically more accommodating, handicaps the true crushing offensive potential of the swarm. We will talk more about this in a moment. Redundancy is also a major potential feature of UCAV swarms. If one UCAV gets shot down or malfunctions the swarm just continues on using the assets it has available to achieve the maximum possible effects based on the mission at hand. The loss may degrade the overall fidelity of the swarm’s situational awareness and battlefield “picture,” but it will continue on making the best of the existing resources at hand. In other words, the system is constantly trying to achieve the highest possible efficiency based on its programming and the assets it has available at its disposal. And all of this is done automatically, without traditional communications and human-to-human coordination. -Air-To-Air may be the swarm’s greatest trick: For so long UCAVs have been seen as strictly deep strike and surveillance platforms, but when networked together, they could offer an incredible counter-air capability. Even the subsonic and less than highly maneuverable but very stealthy flying-wing UCAV configurations that we know of today could be absolutely devastating when it comes to sanitizing enemy airspace. The same swarm technology applies to the air-to-air realm as it does to attacking pop-up SAM sites. In fact, under certain circumstances enemy fighters may be an easier threat for UCAVs to deal with than those emanating from the ground. Enemy aircraft would have a very hard time remaining undetected in airspace that an operational swarm of UCAVs is operating in. Its cloud-like mind will leverage feeds from the multitude of sensors carried by its individual UCAVs, all spread over a wide area. In essence, the swarm acts as is its own virtual AWACS, although in some cases it is far superior as it is forward deployed, can carry a diverse set of sensors spread over a wide area, and the data it collects can be enacted upon instantaneously. DARPA If a potential enemy aircraft is detected, even just for a brief moment, multiple sensors aboard multiple UCAVs can instantly and seamlessly steer their sensors (radar, infrared etc) from multiple angles onto the single piece of sky where the aircraft was. Anti-stealth detection tactics can then be employed, aimed at collectively detecting an aircraft well enough to build a weapons-grade engagement track of it. Working as a team, the swarm can then engage the target in question. Once a track is established, the best UCAV or UCAVs positioned to deal with it can be assigned the task of doing so, making long-range coordinated missile shots at the bad guy. Instead of using their own radars alone to guide their missile shots, they can use the swarm’s common “picture” to do so. In other words, the UCAV firing on the enemy aircraft does not even have to use its own sensors to do so as it sees all the other UCAV’s sensor pictures fused together and can use that data instead. This means certain UCAVs, such as those closest to the threat aircraft, can operate “silent,” not emanating any electromagnetic energy. Combined with the UCAV’s wide-band stealthy shape, low infrared signature and radar-absorbent coatings, it is unlikely the target will detect the attacking UCAVs at all. Well at least until their missiles go “pitbull” and lock onto the aircraft during the terminal phase of their attacks, which is likely far too late. Possessing an extreme level of stealth, both in the radio and infrared spectrum, and having near perfect situational awareness, the UCAV swarm is really a flying pack of telepathic robotic wolves that are all working together to kill the bad guy in a coordinated manner. Having a UCAV even sacrifice itself for the greater good can be programmed as a viable tactical choice. When it comes to the within-visual-range air combat environment, the current types of UCAVs could never turn successfully with a modern fighter jet. Yet with the latest block of AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles, which are capable of making greater than 180 degree snap turns and locking onto an enemy aircraft after being launched from an internal weapons bay, the UCAV may not have to maneuver aggressively at all. Then again, avoiding marauding fighters or attacking them with so called “non-kinetic” weaponry would also leverage the UCAV’s unique capabilities. Instead of launching missiles, parts of the swarm could jam and change course to keep themselves outside of the detection range of enemy aircraft. Or they could send pinpoint electronic attacks and pencil-sized high-power beams of electromagnetic energy chirped off by their onboard AESA radars directly at the enemy fighters’ radars and radar-guided missile seekers, blinding, disabling, or destroying them in the process. Even the ability to swat incoming missiles out of the sky with directed energy weapons is clearly on the horizon. https://youtube.com/watch?v=v0dHKWjXn-E Finally, a fully air-to-air optimized UCAV design may be the most awe-inspiring of all UCAVs as such an aircraft’s maneuverability would not be limited by the crushing gravitational forces a human pilot can endure. As such, a UCAV designed to absolutely rule the air-to-air realm could be able to sustain unheard of G forces, making shooting it down with missiles, or trying to parry it in the within-visual-range air combat realm, nearly useless. -The ability to leverage common command and control software and human interfaces: Just as UCAVs can evolve over time via open architecture design and more agile construction concepts, so can their human interfaces and operating software. Strictly speaking, although new UCAV designs may change the look of the swarm, its cloud brain (command logic and acritical intelligence) can continue to evolve linearly. Think of it as buying a new desktop computer but running the same operating system on that is constantly upgraded. Some of the most expensive and perilous elements of building a new strike-fighter are software development and “back-end” infrastructure related . The nice thing about UCAVs is that its software and command and control elements can evolve over time and can be applied to multiple unmanned airframes used for a whole array of unique missions. These disparate unmanned systems can also have their capabilities more easily interwoven since they run on a common software and control platform. As a common software suite evolves, the system’s stability, security, and overall capabilities will only increase. This operating system that controls an autonomous swarm can be tweaked and tailored over years, or even over decades, and it can adapt to new threats, tactics and technologies as a whole without having to adapt a series of discreet control systems for separate aircraft designs. DARPA For instance, the same mission software and command and control interface could possibly be used by a large high-flying stealthy surveillance drone made by one manufacturer, while at the same time also used for a swarm of UCAVs made by another. In doing so, these systems could work together seamlessly and flexibly even though their missions and even their manufacturers are different. One scenario may have that high-flying stealthily drone acting as a super-server and communications relay system that will enable and enhance the awareness and interoperability of a swarm of tactical UCAVs fighting below it. In another scenario, that same high-altitude unmanned aircraft may provide many UCAV swarms, say of six UCAVs each, with moving ground targets it sees on radar to attack from hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, the same software and interface system could direct low-end unmanned supply drones toward Special Forces units deep in enemy territory , with UCAVs being instantly assigned to protect them on their way. This “sandbox” like approach could give mission planners and strategists both a mission planning system and a command and control suite for a whole slew of unmanned aircraft all in one neat and ever evolving package. Think of it as a common operating system that can constantly be improved on and used by new and existing hardware alike. Not only is this concept cost effective and developmentally efficient, but it can greatly enhance the combat capability and flexibility of all the hardware it supports. For mission planning purposes and for being able to leverage the super nimble swarm mentality even further by integrating small numbers of dissimilar and specialized force multiplying unmanned aircraft into it, a common software platform, data-link waveform and command interface will add to the lethality of the swarm as a whole exponentially. Boeing Chapter 9: Hacking and Autonomy Misconceptions Now that we have discussed many of the potential advantages of UCAVs, let’s talk about their major downside; at least as some see it. We often hear that hacking and the fear of giving robotic weaponry any level of autonomy is a barrier to widespread UCAV procurement. In some cases these issues are paired together with Terminator like hyperbole that really does sound frightening. The fact is that autonomy will become a reality far sooner than most think it will, regardless of if we like it or not. The simple reason is that autonomy unlocks the UCAVs true potential; being able to act quicker than any human could, especially while working as part of a swarm. America has been spoiled by picking its wars on its own terms since the latter half of the 20th Century. In the future it is highly unlikely we will be so fortunate. If a conflict were to erupt between the US and a near-peer state competitor, the last thing we will be worrying about is if a UCAV hit the wrong target accidently or not. That may sound callous, but the stakes will be far too high for holding back winning capabilities due to fears over not having a human directly approving ever target a UCAV hits. There are also many levels of autonomy. At its most basic level, UCAVs could be used to hit fixed targets deep in enemy territory, with the only decisions made by the aircraft itself being how to evade enemy air defenses on its way to and from the target. This type of capability is on par with the current “smart” cruise missile technology of a medium capability level, the big difference being that you can reuse the UCAV and it can hit multiple targets on a single mission. As such, the fear that a human is not “in the loop” controlling a UCAV on such a basic mission is irrelevant as the same arguments can be made about cruise missiles that have been in used for decades. As you move up the autonomy and mission complexity ladder, you hit the point where the UCAV is not going after fixed targets but is actually deciding to prosecute targets of opportunity on its own. This starts with taking out air defense-related threats that put the vehicle or its swarm in danger. At its most rudimentary level this is initiated by external stimulus, such as a SAM site’s radar, or air defense node’s electromagnetic emissions being detected by UCAV. The UCAV can classify and triangulate these signals just as the F-22 or F-35 can, and a swarm can do it with exceptional ease and precision due to the wide geographic spacing between each node and the swarm’s data-fusion capabilities. Algorithms pre-programmed into the UCAV’s brain (or brains in the swarm’s case) would theoretically allow it or them to decide whether to avoid, deploy electronic attacks to blind or confuse the threat system, or to destroy it using kinetic weaponry. Factors such as the swarm’s primary mission, intended targets, flight path, stores and fuel state of each UCAV, mission timing and the type of threat being detected can all go into the automated decision making process as to how to best deal with the situation. All this happens in an instant of course and with maximum efficiency as we have mentioned before. The next step in UCAV autonomy is to not just respond independently in a reactionary manner to unplanned threats that emit threatening electromagnetic energy, but to pursue targets that may not threaten the UCAV or its swarm at all. Using synthetic aperture radar, multi-spectral optical and infrared sensors, ground moving target indication (GMTI) radar and external sensor feeds from non-swarm aircraft, a UCAV or a UCAV swarm can hunt for targets of opportunity on their own. Image and 3D object matching can be used to identify and classify valid targets that the UCAV or swarm detects. This data is stored in the UCAV itself and/or in the swarm’s cloud-like data library. After it classifies the target as valid, and it exists in an area pre-selected as a free fire zone by mission planners, the UCAV swarm could then select the best munition and asset to destroy it. Imaging and 3D model matching is already used on advanced cruise missiles successfully today , and it will be increasingly a staple of other modern air-to-ground munitions. With this in mind, and regardless of what some may tell you, it is not as if these things (UCAVs) would just being released on their own accord to blast away at any blips on a radar screen, there is much more to it than that. Under the semi-autonomous concept of operations, the UCAV would have to ask a human operator if it can attack the target it found on its own. At the very least, radar, infrared or optical imagery of the target and its location would have to be transmitted to the operator as part of the attack approval process. This may be fine for medium and lower threat environments, but for high-threat ones, where two-way communications could open the UCAV, and the swarm for that manner, up to detection and electronic attacks, such a concept could be problematic. One theoretical solution to this issue would be a daisy chain-like line-of-sight data-link that passes information between UCAVs operating deep in enemy airspace and back over the horizon to less contested territory. Once there, the swarm’s data can be sent to satellites and replies can be sent back down and be passed forward along the same chain of communications. This means the swarm would not be emitting data to anything but its own kind using very hard to intercept or jam directional data-link. By using the daisy chain concept, and the UCAV’s long loitering capabilities, the swarm could still benefit from two-way communications to controllers around the globe without putting themselves at elevated risk of being detected, jammed or even hacked. Another theoretical solution would be to data-link this info up to a high-flying unmanned aircraft that can then use advanced satellite, or long-range direct communications capabilities to send it wherever it needs to go. Still, either method slows down and handicaps the swarm’s ability to rapidly bring devastation on the enemy. Under the fully autonomous concept of UCAV operations, the UCAVs will not ask anyone if they can attack a target or not. They will decide on their own based on the software they are operating with. This allows the swarm to work at blistering speed, overwhelming and shattering the enemy’s decision cycle. It sounds scary, but remember that these craft are built to dismantle the enemy’s ability to fight on the first days of war, and once again, to some degree autonomous targeting is already being used by advanced land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles. Lockheed As far as network security goes, a closed network that only broadcasts directionally to other UCAVs within line-of-sight, once again the daisy chain method is thought to be very secure and has a very low probability of detection or intrusion. This is why it is being used for the F-35’s data-link. It also allows for a higher quality of situational awareness even when satellite communications over enemy territory are denied. If for whatever reason the swarm’s network is shattered or degraded, the individual UCAV components can default to accomplishing their mission by breaking into smaller swarms with more stable, closer-range communications or going it alone with the information they have available. In fact, UCAVs, whether in a swarm or not, will benefit from external third-party targeting and surveillance information just like manned fighters increasingly do. This comes in the form of data-link feeds from standoff surveillance systems including AWACS, JSTARS, and ground-based and sea-based radar systems. In receive only mode, stealthy UCAVs can benefit from this information without opening themselves up to sending out emissions that could be detected. F-22s and F-35s can benefit from this one-way data link concept as well. In fact, the F-22 does today as it can see Link16 information, it just can’t broadcast its own sensor picture without help from an external data-fusion gateway. The truth is that UCAVs don’t have to talk to anyone at all. If need be, and under the simplest concept of operations, they can fly to a certain point outside enemy territory, and shut off two-way communications entirely, crossing into enemy territory emissions silent. They then go about their missions, reacting to threats around them via passive detection systems. Once they have left enemy airspace, they can once again communicate with their human masters via satellite unencumbered. This “go it alone in silence” concept is absurdly secure from am electronic attack and hacking standpoint, and the UCAVs can be programmed to only open up communications during their mission under certain conditions that are programmed internally. These can include reporting loss of engine power or other serious malfunctions. But once again, during their time near enemy territory they can be totally firewalled from the outside world, just as the F-117 had been during its combat operations in the Middle East and Europe. Sure they won’t be able to benefit from being integrated into a swarm, but when maximum network security is warranted, this method of operation is available. The great thing about UCAVs is that a single vehicle could be built to operate semi-autonomously, autonomously, as part of a swarm or all alone depending on their mission and the threat environment they will be operating in. So separate vehicles would not have to be built for these separate modes of operation. For operations over a third world country with a medium quality air defense system and a low chance of network disruption, UCAVs could work as a swarm and/or in semi-autonomous fashion. For the opening strikes on a highly capable foe they can degrade the enemy’s ability to fight by hitting only fixed targets while fully firewalled from the outside world, and then move to autonomous, fully networked swarm operations to wreak maximum havoc on the enemy once their electronic warfare abilities have been degraded. Because they would likely use a similar concept of communications, and are both heavily reliant on automation, a swarm is likely to be just as resilient to cyber attack as the F-35. Chapter 10: Tethering is not a replacement for the swarm There is lots of talk about “tethering” unmanned air combat aircraft with manned aircraft , where a unmanned combat drone basically works as a manned fighter or bomber’s robotic wingman. This just moves the semi-autonomous control of the unmanned component from a ground station halfway around the globe to a cockpit right over the battlefield. This concept has its merits, but it is no replacement for an autonomous swarm, not even close. USN Such an idea, where an aircrew assigns an unmanned combat aircraft that is paired to them to go do this and to fly there, or to attack this target or jam that one, would be very useful for the crew that is directing it. Yet the man-in-the-loop operating concept still limits the UCAVs potential just as it would if the operator were sitting in a ground control station three thousand miles away. The only thing that changes is that the communications could be much harder to detect, jam or attack because a directional line-of-sight data-link could be used instead of satellite communications. Additionally, the drone would be slaved to the aircrew’s needs, not part of a larger coordinated swarm. Simply put, the utility of such a UCAV concept is discreetly different than an all-unmanned concept, and it is a good route to explore. The nice thing is you can built a fully autonomous UCAV that can just as easily be used for a semi-autonomous tethered mission one day and fly as part of an autonomous swarm the next. Surely tethering unmanned systems to manned fighter and attack aircraft is a big force multiplier. It means more tactical flexibility, more weapons at an aircrew’s disposal and less risk to them for certain combat tasks. But it is not a technological game-changer like an autonomous UCAV swarm would be. So no, the ideas are not interchangeable but they are definitely complimentary. But once again, the nice thing is that a UCAV swarm can do its thing on its own for the opening days of an air campaign, and then once manned fighters are introduced into the conflict, UCAVs can join them as dynamic wingmen or just a weapons mule. You only have to buy one UCAV to do both things and the concept will lend itself well when it comes supporting close air support missions after the UCAV swarms have kicked down the enemy’s front door. Boeing Chapter 11: The USAF comes up with another UCAV initiative and quickly drops it with prejudice Following the USAF’s sudden abandonment of the J-UCAS program, years of nothing followed. Eventually an initiative for what seemed to be a very basic UCAV capability was softly launched by the USAF under the moniker of MQ-X. This program never even made it past the requirements stage and was cancelled with prejudice in 2012. During this same timeframe, Boeing, which held onto its UCAV dreams into the current decade, built a full sized UCAV demonstrator, dubbed the X-45C Phantom Ray, to continue on proving the UCAV concept. This was largely an internally funded affair, with the aircraft flying for the first time in 2011. Although the vehicle seemed promising, the USAF seems to have shown no interested in it at all. With Northrop Grumman haven flown the X-47Bs on their high-profile test missions for the Navy, and Lockheed at least having the RQ-170 under its belt and who knows what else, Boeing, whose X-45A demonstrators and DICE software were so promising a decade ago, seems to be left out in the cold when it comes to anything UCAV related, at least for now. At the time the MQ-X cancellation was announced, Lt. General Larry James stated the following : “Given the requirement set, given what’s going on in the world out there with the Reaper fleet, that we can upgrade those as we need to, to meet the demand signals, to meet the requirements that are going to be out there in the future… The Navy is developing some capability in the UAV domain, we want to see how that play out before we make any decisions on any next-generation platform capability… So as I said, in the near term, right now, there is no intent to pursue that MQ-X program.” So what happened here? Was the MQ-X an initiative for the USAF to procure a lower-end, more openly deployable UCAV than a more highly advanced one that already exists in the black program world? Was it a cover of some type? Or even worse, was it an indication of where the USAF actually stands developmentally when it comes to deploying operational UCAVs, which is seemingly nowhere, at least publically. Maybe the strandgest thing is that according to General James, we are supposed to believed that the USAF actually chose to follow the Navy in regard to UCAV development, which is almost a laughable proposition to say the least. Then again, maybe the USAF is in total denial of what this technology represents. Chapter 12: If we don’t dominate this space someone else will, and soon The fact is that if we don’t aggressively field this technology our potential enemies, who give far less consideration when it comes to the morality of robotic warfare, will. In fact, Russia and China both have ongoing UCAV program s, and although they remain in a fairly immature state and their sub-systems and low-observable designs are likely quite far behind American capabilities, they will steadily improve. Additionally, quantity is a quality all its own when it comes to UCAV swarms. Just because a foe can’t build the best UCAV imaginable doesn’t mean a large force of inferior types is not a potentially very deadly threat to say the least. Right now, by all indicators the US is leading in the unmanned aircraft department and especially in the low observable (stealth) one. Yet European consortiums have begun to let the UCAV genie out of the battle , with the highly promising BAE Taranis and the Dassault-led nEURon program rapidly evolving , the US has a grand but limited window of opportunity to pull away fully from the pack when it comes to this technology. And this won’t happen keeping the technology buried in the black world or not pursuing it really at all. BAE Systems Taranis UCAV demonstratorr , YouTube Chapter 13: The truth hurts either way The idea that the USAF has chosen not to procured UCAV technology in any sort of meaningful scale at all, beyond maybe some classified technology demonstrators, even a decade after the UCAV’s potential was so brilliantly demonstrated by the X-45s, sounds so troubling it borders on shameful. Yet the USAF has, to put it far too nicely, struggled greatly when it comes to integrating unmanned programs into its flyboy dominated culture. The idea that an unmanned system could make at least some of the USAF’s manned tactical aircraft totally obsolete, even before they are built, strikes right at the heart of the USAF’s fighter pilot cabal. With this in mind, could the Air Force brass have stubbornly kept UCAVs at bay in order to protect the role of aircrews within the flying service? Especially considering that this new technology could directly threaten not only the biggest weapons program of all time, the F-35, but the last manned fighter the USAF may ever actually buy. Given the evidence, or lack thereof, It seems possible. Such a move would be incredibly near-sighted. Considering America’s dulling combat advantage, especially in the aerial warfare department, not pursuing UCAV technology may have mortgaged national security for the personal and professional biases of key Pentagon power brokers, along with an overwhelming cultural norm that may be incompatible with the idea of fully unpiloted combat aircraft. The fact is that there has never been a more critical time for the US military to leapfrog its potential enemies technologically than right now, and UCAVs could do just that. We continue to stubbornly run the same old fighter development race with our potential foes, which is one expensive game to play. The sad part is that UCAVs offer America a great opportunity to disrupt the strategic paradigm instantly by starting to play an entirely game altogether, one that our potential foes are far less prepared to play, at least for the foreseeable future. The USAF could flex a sizeable portion of its resources into advanced UCAV development and procurement, throwing our peer state competitors down the developmental cliff in the process. To put it simply, if we are no longer enjoying vast superiority in manned tactical aircraft capabilities vis-à-vis our potential foes, than why continue down that path when we have the ability to leap in another direction completely? So there you have it. Either the USAF has a secret UCAV capability, but only in relatively tiny numbers, which handicaps many of the concept’s innate advantages, or the alternative is even worse; the USAF has not pursued the technology to any significant degree at all. Even if the better of these two possible realities is true, the veil of secrecy surrounding such a classified UCAV program has likely resulted in highly skewed procurement and strategic decisions that we may not be able to recover from for many decades. In the end both theories result in a nation that is less well defended than it would be with a large-scale and disclosed UCAV program underway and the longer this game-changing technology remains buried or undeveloped for whatever reason, the worse off America will be.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kayla Bowers loves riding horses and target shooting. That fits nicely with her day job, where she tames the Air Force’s thoroughbred close air support jet, the A-10 Warthog, and executes aerial target practice using the aircraft’s legendarily massive and hideously powerful GAU-8 30mm Avenger cannon . Lieutenant Bowers is better known by her peers in the 74th Fighter Squadron, “The Flying Tigers,” by her callsign, “Banzai.” Being a female fighter pilot is still a rare experience these days, and being one that flies the rugged A-10 Warthog is rarer still: today, only around five women fly the jet, according to Lieutenant Bowers. Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper In what is arguably the most masculine flying machine on the planet, Banzai found her true calling early on. She grew up in the tiny town of Pinckney, Michigan, pop. 2,500. The drive to fly for the military came to her while she was in high school. “I was looking into the military as a possible career field,” Banzai says. “It really intrigued me that I could go into something that could offer such a challenge and adventure on a day-to-day basis. I looked into the types of things that would be the most challenging and adventurous I could do as a woman in the military, and got interested in flying.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “I started researching the different aircraft,” she continues, “and when I learned about what an incredible platform the A-10 is, and looked at its combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission—it intrigued me. I also heard stories about it from high school friends who had enlisted in the Marine Corps and the Army. They had already deployed and told me stories of the A-10 saving their lives. It just really spoke to me that I could potentially do something like that, and make such a difference in somebody’s life. It’s not glamorous. Really, it’s just a very rugged aircraft that has a lot of capabilities. It’s just really incredible.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper She enrolled in ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) after graduating high school and started college in 2008. After completing flight training years later, she ended up exactly where she wanted to be: in the A-10’s cockpit, surrounded by a “bathtub” of titanium armor. Along the way, she was pranked by her instructors. “They played a trick on me on assignment night, which is not very nice,” she says of the evening when aircraft assignments are handed out. “When I first got up, they pretended like I had received a first assignment instructor pilot slot, and they kind of sent me back and let me think that that was what my future was. In the end, I found out I had really gotten the A-10. It was a roller coaster of emotion day, that’s for sure.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper It took a while to move from flying the slick T-38C Talon trainer to strapping into her dream jet. But when the time finally came, it was eye opening. “You obviously have a lot of academics before your first flight and various other training events on the ground,” she says. “Actually flying the A-10 for the first time felt awesome. After six years of just loving that aircraft and wanting the A-10 so bad, the first time I flew in it, I remember thinking it wasn’t even real life. I just could not believe it. You go out and you fly some instrument approaches and you fly advanced handling characteristics, maneuvers, as well as some formation, like close formation fingertip, route, all of that.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper And what about firing the A-10’s notorious gun? “I grew up shooting, so it kind of fits that now I shoot one of the biggest guns around. Shooting in the air is a rush, but it’s still a rush shooting on the ground too. I like doing that.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Banzai has been assigned to Flying Tigers since December of 2014. Her first assignment at a frontline squadron has been an incredibly positive experience according to the young lieutenant that is still mastering the ins and outs of the mighty Warthog. “When I got into the 74th, I remember thinking, Wow, there is not a single person I don’t like in this squadron . I really feel like I fit in and the guys don’t treat me any different just because I’m a girl. As long as you show up and you do your job and you don’t do things to stick out as a female, nobody is going to think anything of it.” Banzai continues, “These guys are my family, for sure. It’s really cool to share experiences and little inside jokes and things like that. Everyone has each other’s backs.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper This high level of camaraderie has come in handy during the squadron’s six month deployment to Eastern Europe as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve . It was on this historic deployment at Graf Ignatievo Air Base, Bulgaria that we met up with Banzai, who had been flying missions with Bulgarian Air Force’s Su-25 Frogfoots, the A-10s Soviet-designed counterpart, and Mi-24 Hind attack helicopters. Banzai and her Bulgarian Su-25 pilot counterpart., Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “Back home in Valdosta, Georgia, I just bought a small farm. I have two horses. My husband is in the military as well. He’s in the Army, so we’re used to being separated. It’s maybe a little bit easier on me than most people who live with their spouse on a daily basis because we’re a little bit more used to the separation. But it’s still hard. Having the same people around you makes it a lot easier. You have so much fun and you’re always laughing and having a good time and making memories.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper The young Hog Driver is racking up the memories on deployment, including working with some unusual assets in unfamiliar places. For instance, her last mission over the Bulgarian bombing ranges. “We had the Rustics out there [callsign for Forward Air Controllers that direct aerial attacks from the ground], and we had a Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter and then two A-10s, so we were working coordinated attacks on the range. It was the first time the Bulgarians have done this. It’s definitely the first time I’ve been able to work coordinated attacks with a Hind.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “Starting off, we worked on timing and deconfliction. The type of attack—the game plan—was a sectored sequential timing based off a time over target (TOT). So the way it would work was that we both held deconflicted in our airspace east and west of the target. Since the ceilings [the space between the ground and the cloud deck] were pretty low, we were holding about fifteen hundred feet AGL [above ground level], and the helicopters were holding at right around three hundred feet AGL.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “We were still laterally deconflicted east and west from the target, and so then we would set a TOT for a hog or boar flight, that was us, and a TOT for the Hinds. We would then ingress into the target area first and do our weapons delivery, egress, and then the Hinds would be in shortly after us to do their weapons delivery and egress as well. It was a target rich environment for sure, something that as a two ship of A-10s there were still additional targets that could be hit, so the Hinds were of good use.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “They also have different ordnance. They were carrying different ordnance than we were, so they were using rockets, and we were using bombs and guns. Different weaponeering considerations as well. They bring a further option to the fight. It went off pretty much without a hitch. Definitely once we got to the second and third attacks it was flowing pretty smoothly.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper It is amazing hearing someone go from talking about their love of horses to describing employing one of the world’s most deadly weapon systems in science-like detail, but that is the nature of any true fighter pilot. Still, it’s not all about flying. Breaking down each mission into learning points is what makes good pilots great. “After the mission we’ll sit down with the forward air controllers and with my flight lead and we’ll discuss our portion of the scenario. I’m not sure if the Bulgarians are planning on meeting us here or not, but we’ll probably do an over the phone debrief or maybe debrief tomorrow after we gather all the data and information from the sortie.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “I learned that each platform has different tactics, techniques, and procedures, and they operate a little bit differently. We are really used to working coordinated attacks with other A-10s. Every platform has something different that they bring to different tactical scenarios or tactical problems that are presented. So for me the biggest thing was learning the timing references of working helicopters into a coordinated attack. They don’t move quite as fast as an A-10, so you have to think differently about what TOTs you would use for them separate from, you know, what you might give an A-10.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “We’ve been focusing a lot on combat search and rescue (CSAR). When we first got here that was our main emphasis item. We’ve been doing a lot of integration with the Cougars (CSAR helicopters) and the MiGs in an air-to-air arena. This was probably the first time we had the opportunity to look into some other training opportunities.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “The more you fly, the more your habit patterns solidify, so it’s easier to fall back on them. When you get more task-saturated, it’s easier to fall back on those already set habit patterns. Still, every single time I fly there’s always something to be thinking forward to, and you’re always trying to stay ten steps ahead of the jet.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “Just getting your general close air support cadence and flow down is something that comes with more experience, and the more scenarios you see and the more problems you’re presented with, the more your toolkit expands. As you either make a mistake or see how somebody else handled something, you can take those experiences and say, Oh, yeah. I remember that time that I was presented with that problem, and this is what worked. Then in the future you can use that.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “I think in every Hog pilot’s life there’s a significant desire to go out and do what you’ve been trained for, and feel like you know your job. You’re paying back what you owe after all the effort and money that’s been invested in you.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper “It’s challenging every single day. There’s never anything that you fully expect each time that you fly, and just knowing that the capability that you bring and the asset that you are to the Air Force is really rewarding. Knowing that if you were to forward deploy to a location that the people on the ground can sleep safer at night knowing that you’re there.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper With the A-10’s highly controversial retirement on the horizon , there’s a good chance Banzai and her fellow Hog pilots will find themselves in a tactical jet like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which couldn’t be more different from the rough and tumble, down and dirty, stick-and-rudder A-10. “That’s a bridge that I’ll cross when I get there. I think that is what it’s looking like, that most A-10 pilots will likely get sent to it (the F-35). But right now I don’t want to think about flying anything besides the A-10. I can’t even imagine flying anything else. I mean obviously whatever I’m called to do after the A-10 I would be happy to do. Bottom line is that you’re still flying really incredible aircraft.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper As for being in the tiny cadre of active female A-10 pilots, Banzai has had the chance to fly with one of her lady Hog pilot counterparts. “She’s deployed with us but part of the 75th Fighter Squadron, her callsign is Sparkles. I have flown with her. It was pretty cool. We call it “unmanned flight” or an “unmanned formation.” We have a good time.” Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Here is a bonus gallery of Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper’s amazing images of Banzai and the A-10 in Bulgaria: … Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper Frank Crebas & Rich Cooper A special thanks to Frank Crebas of Bluelife Aviation & Rich Cooper of the Centre of Aviation Photography for providing the amazing images you saw in this article and for executing the interview with Banzai in Bulgaria.

René Vink,"Posted on Apr 24, 2020","Look At These Stunning Photos From Axalp, Switzerland’s Mountaintop Military Air Show","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Swiss Air Force is small but very versatile, and it showcases its abilities in style: on the Alps! The annual ‘Fliegerschiessen Axalp’ air show is held at the Axalp-Ebenfluh firing range at an altitude of 7,365 feet above sea level, making it pretty special. Helicopters buzz around the sharp mountain peaks, fast jets swoop in and rattle cannons off at orange targets placed on the mountainsides, and the Swiss display teams—the Hornet Display Team, PC-21 Display Team, and the well-known Patrouille Suisse—perform before the most dramatic backdrop imaginable. René Vink Getting to there is easy for the many VIPs and military personnel ferried by helicopter from nearby Meiringen Airbase to the observation station atop the range. Many others go on foot, though, which involves an intense three hour hike. As an aviation photographer for seventeen years, I have scaled the hills to Axalp five times since 2003. The photos in this piece are among the many photos I shot there. René Vink My first trip to Axalp was just awesome. Shooting at air shows and exercises, I often saw the same aircraft again and again—especially at my home base in Twenthe, the Netherlands, where I originally contracted aviation fever. At Twenthe, usually six different F-16s went up daily, and I challenged myself to get the best shots every time. Eventually I started traveling around Europe and exploring as much as I could. Imagine my excitement when a friend asked me along for a road trip to Axalp nearly 13 years ago. René Vink At the time l was still shooting film, and my first climb up to the range proved to be a baptism of—well, snow. Since the Axalp Air Show is intertwined with the training of reserve pilots from the ‘Fliegerstaffel 8,’ or 8 Squadron, based at Meiringen, it’s always held in early October. Fall had set in pretty hard that first year and a heavy blizzard caught us by surprise. Though we were well prepared with mountaineering boots, layered clothes and ski poles, conditions were abyssmal. Luckily the Swiss Air Force brought up Port-A-Potties where we could have a break before tumbling back down the mountain. A few days later, I had more success with glimpses of sunshine and managed to capture the show, which featured the awesome Mirage lllRSs in action before their retirement. Overall it was quite an awesome experience, one that beckoned me back year after year. René Vink The show was cancelled in 2004, but in 2005, it was back, and the conditions were perfect. The first snow had fallen just days before and sunny spells throughout the week maximized flying activities. Now shooting digital and with just a litle more experience, I improved my results and laid down a strategy for the years to come. The official show days were always held on Wednesday and Thursday but regular training and demo exercises where preformed on Monday and Tuesday. Going up the mountain for two days really beats the body down, so I learned to ease into it, spending the first show day at nearby Meiringen airbase. A lot of jets and helicopters fly to Axalp from the base and the area is flat, which is a welcome change. The second show day, I made my final hike up. René Vink Now that the Mirage llls where part of a byegone era, the F-5 Tigers and F/A-18 Hornets were the highlights of the display, and every year brought new photographic conditions. But in 2006 there was a great new feature: two French Air Force Mirage F.1CT’s. Mirages were back! The Swiss and French militaries have a good working partnership, which results in the type of training that brought the French Mirages to Axalp. René Vink During the Mirages’ strafing runs on mountainside targets, I shot some some decent photos, but the best was a flyby at the north side of the range, beneath us. The camouflage on the tops of the F.1’s stood out against the white valley backdrop. René Vink A year later I got the chance to go again, road tripping for some ten hours to arrive in the wonderful setting of the Bernese Oberland. 2007 featured an air-to-air strafing demonstration with an F-5E painted the colors of the Patrouille Suisse, equipped with a towed target. In fact, these operations are the reason why the team’s Tiger lls are allowed to wear the bright red and white paint scheme. The economy is slow and funding is somewhat tight, so an expensive paint job needs a good reason—namely, that pilots have to distinguish the manned jet from the towed target, and the demonstration team in return could have its aircraft painted up all the same way. René Vink In the live-fire air-to-air demo the action was too far away, and lone spectators could be hit by cannon shells that hit the Axalphorn ridge. They used an Alouette lll helicopter to make sure the area was clear before firing commenced, but it was still an issue. René Vink On one particular occasion, the weather created a really cool effect. Scattered clouds formed on the peaks, eventually rolling over the range area. Just then, a quartet of Hornets started strafing runs. The poor visibility meant most pilots had trouble aiming. They were going low, pulling up and away through the very damp atmosphere. This maneuver got me one of my all-time best aviation photographs, the same one seen at the top of this article. I’ve never seen so much vapour coming off a jet in my life. It was just awesome. René Vink The Axalp experience really did something to me. Every time has been different and the effort needed to get those results from up the Alps makes it so special. To me photographing military aircraft doesn’t get any better than being at the heart of the action. And experiencing this amidst the beautiful Alpine scenery is just a magical treat! Perhaps only flying along through the mountains would top it, who knows what the future brings… Check out more of René Vink’s work and follow him on Facebook here and check out his blog here .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 25, 2019",Major Taj “Cabbie” Sareen Is A Hero To Remember On This Memorial Day,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I met Taj years ago while working at NAF El Centro doing photo coverage for their yearly air show. Jets were streaming in to be set up for static display and I would catch them taxiing in and get some great shots of the aircrews if they wanted them, and they always did. I was going about my business, zooming in a golf cart from location to location as yellow shirts “caught” each arriving aircraft , a bright white F/A-18D came screaming into the overhead pattern. Everyone stopped for a second as the gorgeous, angel-like jet executed an eye-watering break over their heads. Moments later the gleaming fighter was on the ground being guided to its parking spot for the upcoming show. The aircraft turned out to be the USMC F/A-18 training squadron’s (VMFAT-101 “Sharpshooters”) most cherished bird, the “Medal of Honor” painted theme Hornet. Taj “Cabbie” Sareen, an instructor with the squadron at the time, just so happened to have been flying it. As Taj taxied the jet in he spotted me and gave me a big point and then gestured for me to go over to where he was parking. The canopy popped open and Taj actually greeted me, not the other way around, and as the Hornet’s twin GE-F404 turbofans wound down he yelled “hopefully you got some great shots, we saw you and tried to take it as slow as possible! Wait let me pop the speed brake for you, you will love it!” From that point on I knew that this guy understood how awesome his job and the jet he was flying was, and that he wanted to do whatever he could to share it with others. Tyler Rogoway Afterwards we chatted for a while, and got some awesome shots him and his co-pilot friend in front of and on top of the special Hornet. We also talked about getting some great departure pics that he could share with his commander who had wanted some really high-quality images of the specially painted white and green Hornet with a huge Medal of Honor on its speed-brake. Later that evening Taj waved me over at the informal pre-party to the next day’s airshow and we had a beer or two and talked a bit. He asked all about photography and my work and I learned a bit about him and his love of very fast and exotic cars and what he did for a living. Taj was clearly unique to say the least. Sort of like a really humble Bruce Wayne. He flew Hornets by day and blasted around on exotic motorcycles and in Italian sports cars by night. After the show, we executed our departure plan exactly as we discussed. They towed the jet into the light. Taj cranked it up, and pirouetted all around, giving me a big wave before he blasted off back to MCAS Miramar. Tyler Rogoway Days later I got an email from him to exchange contact info and to thank me once again for taking the photos as his commander loved them. We communicated back and forth after and he offered multiple times to give me the “the best tour ever” of his squadron’s operation at MCAS Miramar and to support any article or project of mine he could, after which we would go out for drinks. Sadly and stupidly I never took Taj up on his incessant hospitality. A move I greatly regret now. Popular culture casts fighter pilots in the Top Gun “Maverick” mold, which is ridiculous. The truth is they are all over the board personality-wise, from introverted to grinning wise-crackers. Taj was sort of his own thing though. He was professional and confident but he was highly interested in you, not himself. Really he seemed to not only love what he did, but felt fortunate to have been able to do it above all else. Since meeting Taj I learned that my experience was not uncommon. Other aviation photographers, journalists and even just aviation enthusiasts had interactions with Major Sareen, many of them actually, and all were similar. He was an absolutely outstanding ambassador of the Marine Corps and made a very positive impression on all who met him. … In the years that had passed I knew that Taj had been assigned to VMFA-232, the Red Devils, a land-based Marine fighter-attack squadron, and last summer I had knowledge that they were on deployment to the Middle East. Then, on October 21st, 2015, as I was jamming away on the keyboard with the news playing in the background, a usual setup for what I do on a daily basis, a report came on saying an F/A-18 had crashed in England. The civilian military aviation enthusiast community has pretty much eyes everywhere, all the time. I had seen photos in the previous days from various photographers of Red Devil Hornets passing through RAF Lakenheath on their way back from deployment. Seeing that there are no Hornets based in the UK, it was very likely it was a VMFA-232 jet that went down. Whenever these things happen, you think of who you know in the squadron, and Taj immediately came to mind. My heart sank. Soon photos and reports from the scene began to pour in and they were not promising when it came to the survival of the jet’s pilot . Within hours, an idea of what happened began to coalesce: Early in the morning a gaggle of Red Devil F/A-18Cs departed from Lakenheath for the trans-Atlantic leg of their journey back to MCAS Miramar in San Diego. The jets were returning from a months-long tour fighting ISIS over Iraq and Syria. These ferry flights, or “tanker drags” as they are called, involve external tanker support and are complex affairs logistically. Getting the jets in working order for the trip and doing so on schedule is always a big effort, especially war-weary and many decades old Marine F/A-18s. During departure, Taj’s Hornet had a serious problem at seemingly the worst time, low and slow while weighed down with gas shortly after leaving the ground. The F/A-18C ended up careening into the ground with an ejection attempt occurring too late in the chain of events to have been successful. Taj “Cabbie” Sareen had perished in the incident. Multiple reports have stated that Taj changed course and stayed with the aircraft to avoid homes that were in the stricken jet’s destructive path . One local farmer even stated that he knew Taj saved his life . Knowing what I do about Taj, especially after his death, I can fully believe that he would have stayed with the aircraft as long as he thought possible to avoid hurting innocent people on the ground. It appears he did just that. Think about this deeper for one moment. Taj could have pulled the ejection handle during the emergency and would have likely walked away from the incident, but knowing that the thing he loved so much, flying jets for the USMC, could hurt, or even kill an innocent person on the ground changed his priorities. Taj put his own safety last and that of people he had never even met first. In the end, Taj gave his life so that others may live, and did so not on the battlefield that he had just left, but over the serene English countryside. Hero is a grossly overused word in our culture, one that is drunk on celebrity and sports star sensationalism. That is unfair to people like Taj Sareen. The guy was not just a hero the day he died, but he lived a hero’s way of life, enriching others with his accomplishments and opportunities and treating seemingly everyone he knew with respect and kindness. It was Taj’s hero lifestyle that allowed him to be a hero in his last moments of his life when it mattered most. This is a code of honor that is so rare these days that it is hard to even comprehend. For me, it is eerily fitting that the guy I first met getting out of a jet painted to honor those who made the biggest sacrifices and executed the most courageous acts, died doing exactly that. Taj left behind a little daughter. In fact, he had bought her a gift right before his last flight that was lost in the crash, but amazingly fulfilled anyway by a local shop owner and Taj’s friends and family, a touching story unto itself you should read about here . Taj also left behind a loving family and an army of friends, including his beloved Marine Corps family and Red Devil squadron-mates. One of these fellow brothers in arms was Brad Danforth who was in officer training alongside Taj very early on in his military career. Brad describes his friend in wonderful detail: “While Taj Sareen’s passing is a horrible tragedy, it’s tough to think about this loss without remembering what an incredible person he was and the joy he brought to everyone he encountered.  Many will remember Taj as a Marine Corps fighter pilot, a man who loved speed, motorcycles and beautiful fast cars.  While this is an accurate description of Taj, it just barely scratches the surface of what an amazing person he was. Taj is the type of guy that would go the extra mile to help out a stranger and would repay any kindness tenfold. With an infectious smile that could light up a room, Taj was hands down the life of every party he ever attended. The Dos Equis “Most Interesting Man in the World” had nothing on Taj Sareen. Every person who ever met Taj has a Taj story. There are many unbelievable tales of Taj offering to loan his Ferrari to people he just met and yes, Taj really did do that. Taj always instructed me not to get a rental car when coming to San Diego as he always had “something” I could borrow. Regrettably, I was always too scared to drive one of his amazing cars. Given Taj’s determination, intelligence and outgoing spirit, he could have done anything he chose to do after graduating from college.  With this in mind, Taj chose to be a United States Marine during a time of war. Image courtesy Brad Danforth During his time in the Marine Corps, Taj was known as an incredible pilot and a consummate professional. Being a Marine Corps pilot is a great honor, but being a leader of Marines is one of the greatest honors and responsibilities this nation can grant its young officers. This is an honor Taj cherished, and a responsibility he never took for granted. Above all, Taj was a family man. In the year and some change that I lived with him as a roommate and neighbor, I cannot recall a day when he hadn’t spoken to his family and friends back home in San Francisco. Taj’s love and closeness with his family will always be what I admired most about him.  Despite being a continent or a half a world apart, Taj always knew what his family was up to back home and vice versa. At the same time, it breaks my heart that his one-year-old daughter will never get to remember what a loving, caring person her father was. Trying to sum up Taj in a few paragraphs and do him justice is one of the toughest tasks I’ve had in a while. Taj isn’t someone you can just explain to people who have never met him and fully paint an accurate picture of who he really is.  Taj was just someone or something you had to experience… almost like driving a new sports car, or flying a fighter jet.” Brad’s words are not uncommon in the least. “Beautiful person,” “most generous man I have ever met,” “one of the best pilots I have ever flown with,” are just a few short descriptors from other people who knew Taj Sareen far better than I did. Taj had a quote he loved, you can still see it on his Instagram account : “Speed is life, altitude is life insurance.” Eerily true words from a man that truly loved what he did and all that life had to offer. Taj “Cabbie” Sareen, a one of a kind hero that earned that status not just in the way he died, but in the way he chose to live, remembered on this Memorial Day.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 23, 2020",King Tut’s Mysterious Black Dagger Was Truly out of This World,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The pharaoh Tutankhamun’s (aka King Tut) tomb has been one of archelogy’s greatest treasure troves. Howard Carter and his team discovered the tomb nearly a century ago, but it’s still revealing secrets. One of the most mysterious objects discovered inside the burial chamber was a black iron dagger encased within the young ruler’s linen burial wrappings . The placement of dagger right at the mummified Tutankhamun’s side, as well as its ornateness, were key indicators that it was among the pharaoh’s most prized possessions. The thing is, 3,300 years ago smelted iron was almost unheard of in Egypt. That means that well-crafted, rust-free daggers from that era are rare, to say the least. Theories posited the blade’s origin was extraterrestrial—from meteorites, to be exact. Yet there was no conclusive evidence to back it up. Then a group of Egyptian and Italian scientists used a process known as “X-ray fluorescence spectrometry” to define the artifact’s metallurgy more definitively. The results of their scans confirmed that the blade’s material did indeed originate from the heavens. Steve Evans/wikicommons The blade’s composition is a mix of nickel, iron and cobalt, which matches the building-blocks of meteorites found around northeastern Africa. This, along with the existence of far less complex but seemingly highly valued meteorite jewelry from the same time period indicates that Egyptians knew these rocks were not terrestrial, and valued them extraordinarily. We know that ancient Egyptians had an eerily accurate understanding of the heavens . Even the Great Pyramid of Giza and how its construction and unique features are possibly tied to astronomy continues to be debated. During Tutankhamun’s rule, the sun god Ra was primarily worshipped . So it’s no surprise that possessing a dagger—a preeminent weapon and ceremonial tool at the time—made from material dropped out of the sky would be highly prized. It is literally a weapon sent from God. Sun God Ra hieroglyphic, Public Domain Of course, building pieces of jewelry out of meteor fragments and creating a gorgeous, functional dagger out of the material are two entirely different things. At the very least the dagger proves that the ability to work iron to an exacting degree existed during Tutankhamun’s reign. The scientific report on the subject , which was published in Meteoritics and Planetary Science, concludes: “As the only two valuable iron artifacts from ancient Egypt so far accurately analyzed are of meteoritic origin, we suggest that ancient Egyptian attributed great value to meteoritic iron for the production of fine ornamental or ceremonial objects up until the 14th C. BCE. Smelting of iron, if any, has likely produced low-quality iron to be forged into precious objects. In this context, the high manufacturing quality of Tutankhamun’s dagger blade is evidence of early successful iron smithing in the 14th C. BCE. Indeed, only further in situ, nondestructive compositional analysis of other time-constrained ancient iron artifacts present in world collections, which include the other iron objects discovered in Tutankhamun’s tomb, will provide significant insights into the use of meteoritic iron and into the reconstruction of the evolution of the metal working technologies in the Mediterranean.” So yeah, King Tut had a space knife made out of a material that likely seemed totally magical at the time. We shudder to think what he did with this thing while he was alive. It was a customary in Egyptian culture to be buried with your most prized possessions so that you could take them to the afterlife. But if I had a meteorite dagger I would want be buried with it, too.

LCDR Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",How To Land A Fighter On An Aircraft Carrier On A Stormy Night,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s dark— scary dark. Like when you are five years old hiding under the covers to avoid monsters dark. There might be a few stars in the sky and maybe a partial moon above a thick layer of clouds near the ocean floor. But below the cloud deck is just a vast expanse of black ocean; every once in a while a large tanker might break up the darkness with its running lights. While it’s nice to see someone else out there with you, that distant tanker really can’t do anything to help you. “Alone and unafraid”—that’s the term Naval Aviators use in jest. Flying at night over the open ocean as a naval aviator has a certain haunting loneliness to it that only a few people have experienced. The critical task of landing a multi-million dollar aircraft onto a moving vessel belongs only to you. It is a lonely task that becomes even more difficult when the weather is uncooperative. This is where the soul of a naval aviator is forged: at night, alone, and directly behind 90,000 tons of floating steel. Editor’s Note: Our good friend Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka has taken us inside the cockpit during an F-14 flight demonstration , explained tthe five prohibited maneuvers you just don’t do in a Tomcat , described in great detail what it was like to go to war in the F-14 , taught us some “unique” naval aviation terminology , and painted an incredibly complex picture of what exactly it takes to get launched off a carrier at night . Now he is back, this time to take us through the heart-pounding process of boarding the 4.5 acre floating airport in the dark, while Mother Nature fights you the whole way. USN A few things to note about carrier aviation before we take you “down the chute:” At the end of a mission, planes return to the ship one of two ways: The standard Case I approach during the day in good weather, or a Case III, at night or during poor weather. (Case II is a mix of the other two types and used when the weather is “so-so”). Both I and III have standard procedures, routes, and altitudes that all aircraft in the Air Wing obey to ensure a safe and effective recovery of all aircraft involved. Additionally, aircraft returning to the carrier are under the watchful radar scopes of air traffic controllers located in what is known as CATTC (Carrier Air Traffic Control Center). These controllers are some of the most competent sailors on the ship and their job is easily transferable to the civilian equivalent of air traffic controllers. I always liked to tell them they were the only people on the ship that could give an officer an order without reprisal—and the officer had to do it. Under normal flight operations, the ship has 10 to 12 aircraft airborne during what is known as a “cycle.” Each cycle lasts about an hour and a half. The ship launches airplanes at the start of each cycle to clear the flight deck, giving the deck crew enough space to reposition remaining aircraft for the next recovery. Space is a premium item aboard the carrier, and anything you can do to acquire more of it—like launching aircraft—is done quickly and efficiently. USN There are four arresting wires on Nimitz class ships. An arresting hook from the respective aircraft catches one of the four wires, bringing the plane from 150 mph to a complete stop in about 1.5 seconds. Naval Aviators call it a “controlled crash.” Most civilians would agree. The Air Force has no clue. The most aft wire on the ship is #1 wire. The most forward wire is #4. The target wire is #3. You always try to avoid #1 because it is uncomfortably close the back end of the ship. Truthfully, catching any of them is considered a success. While each pilot is graded on each pass at the ship, this business is difficult enough that pretty much any arrested landing is a welcome return. USN When an aircraft hits the landing area of the deck, the pilot sets the throttles to full military power (full power without afterburner). We do this so that, should the aircraft misses the wires, it will still have enough power to get airborne again. Failing to catch a wire and subsequently getting airborne again is referred to as a bolter . Failing to catch a wire and not getting airborne again results in an ejection. Taxpayers get tired of paying for jets with severe saltwater damage, therefore it is in a pilot’s best interest to touch down at full military power. The bolter pattern is a level oval racetrack pattern above the ship that aircraft enter after an attempted landing. If an aircraft needs to get gas, the pilot elevates to the tanker pattern, which is located above the bolter pattern. When an aircraft is low on fuel, Air Operations—or “AIROPS”—designates an airborne tanker to “hawk” (monitor the situation and be in position to provide aerial refueling) for the low fuel-state aircraft. USN The complex holding pattern aircraft initially enter during nighttime and adverse weather conditions is called the “Marshall Stack.” The best way to visualize this pattern is to think of a stack of pancakes above the ship, with each pancake being a separate pattern. Altitude between patterns is the primary method of separation. To keep track of all this, the departure and recovery status boards, along with a graphic depiction of the pattern called “Mr. Hands,” reflect in real-time the location of every aircraft that is airborne. When an aircraft checks in with the marshal controller in CATCC, it provides a fuel state and side number. “State” is the term used to define how much gas you have left. Instead of saying your tank is half full, pilots express their fuel remaining in pounds, which is shortened to two numbers. For example, if a Hornet with aircraft side number 301 has 6,500 lbs of gas remaining, the pilot would say “301, State 6.5.” Initial check-in with the marshal controller goes something like this: Aircrew:  “Marshal, 101 checking in state 6.5” Controller:  “101, expect CV-1 recovery Case III approach, altimeter 29.92, marshal on the 240 radial, 21, angels six, expected push time 22” Aircrew:  “101, marshal on the 240, 21, angels six, 29.92, state 6.4” In just a few seconds, the pilot has instructions on where to hold position behind the boat (240 radial at 21 miles at 6000 feet), what recovery pattern to use, and when he will have to hit the “push point” (22 minutes after the hour). Note that each plane’s fuel state is added on at the end of a radio transmission because aircraft fuel state is one of the most critical pieces of information. Fuel states are tracked excruciatingly close by AIROPS and pilots are normally asked to “update state” every ten minutes. Many times a carrier may not be within range of a suitable divert airfield, meaning the only place to land is the ship—this is referred to as “blue water ops.”  Fuel is expressed in pounds because aircraft weight (basic aircraft weight plus fuel on board) determines the tension setting for the arresting gear. Prior to each aircraft landing, the tension for the arresting gear is adjusted to the maximum weight for that aircraft. Additionally, distances to divert airfields are referenced by the amount of gas required to fly there. If a pilot needed to divert, or “bingo”, he would depart the aircraft carrier pattern at the fuel state required to fly to that field. Example: Aircraft 301’s fuel state is 2.6, fuel required to Navy North Island is 2.4. Since it takes more than 200lbs of fuel to make it around the pattern to attempt another landing, Aircraft 301 cannot make another attempt with their current amount of gas. He or she will likely be told, “your signal divert” from the Air Boss. USN AIROPS is the carrier’s hub for all night flying activity. There are two status boards in AIROPS: one that tracks every plane launched and one that tracks every plane about to recover. Fuel states, aircraft mission, pilot names, aircraft side numbers, landing attempts and any miscellaneous information is displayed on these status boards, which is then piped through the ship’s internal TV system for everyone to see. On the ship’s internal TV, there’s also a platform camera that shows a view from the landing area looking back to the stern of the ship. This channel is always on throughout the ship, including the bridge, AIROPS, and Primary Flight Control, where the Air Boss sits. It is also shown in all the ready rooms. Pilots routinely watch their buddies coming down for a trap or use it as a debriefing tool to see how their pass went. https://youtube.com/watch?v=BjX1Qa22AqA%3Ft%3D2m9s Hanging out in marshal can be boring—except when you’re waiting for an impending night trap. More often than not, you would rather just get the approach over with than wait for your push time. Think of the Marshall Stack as looking like a staircase from the side, with the lowest plane on the lowest step and each corresponding aircraft owning a step as you go up. Within their step (i.e. a specific altitude and distance from the ship), each plane holds in a pattern to effectively hit their push point—on altitude, on distance, on time. In poor weather, it is imperative to watch out for everyone else while also making sure you remain within your step. The main concern is to not push late, as this will cause interference with everyone behind you. There is a song by the Foo Fighters called “Learning To Fly” that always reminds me of sitting in marshal. Dave Grohl sings a line that sounds something like “…sat around laughing in marshal at the last one down.” While those aren’t the exact words, I always felt sorry for the poor person who got the last push time given out by marshal. They had to know the other planes were laughing at their bad luck (many times this is the E-2 Hawkeye). When our squadron’s last plane had landed, our ready room duty officer would play Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire” over the loud speakers. USN So if you are still with us in marshal, get ready, because your push time is coming up and this is going to be a tough night. There is a broken layer of clouds at about 2,000 feet above the water with scattered layers all the way up to 15,000 feet, along with some thunderstorms nearby. The closest divert is about 400 miles away, so your only real option tonight is the ship. The sea state has begun to pick up and the ship is pitching considerably. If you were to switch the auxiliary radio momentarily over to the final control frequency, you would hear the Landing Signal Officers (LSO’s) give a few screaming “POWER!” calls to those planes currently trying to land. You don’t do this. Best to “stay in your box”; you have your own problems. Crosscheck your watch with the clock in the jet as you cross the push point right on time at 22+00 after the hour. You calmly key the microphone, “101, commencing, state 6.0”. You sound in control, but everyone in the Air Wing knows voices can be deceiving on the radio. You push the aircraft nose over and begin your descent to 5000 feet, what is referred to as “platform” altitude, headed towards the ship. At night, below platform is always a dangerous place to be. The “platform” call is a safety reminder of where you are. On a clear night you can spot the conga-line of aircraft out in front of you, their night lights blinking softly against a backdrop of darkness. Not so tonight. Layers of clouds obscure any real vision you might have. This is a full instrument approach to a landing that will need all of your skill and attention. At ten miles from the ship you stop your descent at 1,200 feet above sea level and report your position to CATCC, which says to “stay clean thru 10.” They are trying to help with the spacing of multiple aircraft in front of you. You hold off on changing to the landing configuration until just before 8 miles. Once your TACAN displays 8 miles from “mother” (aka the carrier), you quickly run through the landing checklist. Landing gear and flaps come down along with the arresting hook. You double check all of those settings and note your fuel state. You are still 6 miles away from the ship, but it is less than 2 minutes until you make your first pass. USN Back on the ship, AIROPS has become a tense place. There are currently three aircraft that have “boltered” because of the ship pitching up and down in the rough seas. All three are still airborne. Two are in the bolter pattern and the other has been sent to rendezvous on the primary airborne tanker to receive gas. His state was too low to make another pass and the decision was made by AIROPS in consultation with a squadron representative to send him to the tanker. A senior member of each squadron in the air wing stands watch in AIROPS for the recovery period.  They are there to help monitor their respective aircraft and relay information back to the individual squadrons. The Captain of the ship calls down to inform AIROPS that he has to turn the ship slightly to find the relative wind. This could cause more of a train wreck than what is already happening. The ship cannot be in a turn while aircraft are attempting to land.  However, finding the appropriate amount of relative wind is a crucial factor in carrier operations.  Without an appropriate amount of wind over the deck, Landing Signal Officers will wave off aircraft for safety reasons and force them to go around again. On some nights, the ship will chase the wind incessantly. USN Just prior to 3 miles from the ship, your aircraft picks up the ILS, or Instrument Landing System, or the “Bullseye.” This is an aircraft system that receives glideslope, azimuth, and elevation signals that are converted into “fly-to” indications (needles) on the pilot’s Heads-Up Display (HUD). Then an additional system called the Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) locks onto the aircraft and provides similar information. The main difference between the two systems is ACLS is a two-way communication handshake from the ship to the aircraft and back, while ILS is only a one-way communication—ship to the aircraft. Both provide azimuth and glideslope information, but the ACLS is more accurate. ACLS and ILS are used in conjunction to lower you to a good “start” position—meaning on centerline, intercepting the glideslope at approximately ¾ mile behind the ship at 360 feet above the water with a 650 to 750 feet-per-minute rate of descent, and a controlled on-speed (not too fast, not too slow). The optimum rate of descent will vary with glideslope angle, approach speed, and headwind component, and timely corrections to the rate of descent will be critical to your success. Remember, the runway in front of you is a moving target, so getting to a good start is a must. There is very little time to make corrections once you get closer to the ship. You carefully position your aircraft, using slight stick and throttle modifications with information from the HUD to get to a good start. At ¾ of a mile from the ship, CATCC hands control of your aircraft to the Landing Signal Officers perched alongside the landing area. The communication goes something like this: CATCC: “101, on course, on glide path, ¾ mile, call the ball.” Aircraft: “101, Tomcat ball, 5.0.” LSOs: “Roger, ball, deck’s moving, you’re a little high.” At first glance, you think to yourself how amazing it is that something over a 1000 feet long can look pretty small in the dark, but you quickly focus back to the glideslope indicator on the port side of the ship, referred to as the “meatball.” With the rough seas and the subsequent pitching deck, it is difficult to discern your glideslope position using the meatball. You have to listen to the LSOsm, who will verify your position via radio calls. The aircraft carrier is big, so big that most waves don’t affect the ship at all. But tonight is a little different. As large swells pass the ship, the stern falls slowly, pitching the bow up above the horizon. Your brain has been trained to look at a fixed object, but with such a dramatic change of the landing area, it gets confused. Another swell passes behind the ship, and the stern begins to slowly pitch up. Frighteningly, the stern is now staring at you instead of the landing area. The stern stays up at its highest point for 1 to 2 seconds. This slow cycle repeats itself over and over, like one of the horses on a carousel ride. As you descend down toward the landing area, your heart is racing. At touchdown, you hear a slight “ping, ping” sound, but feel no arrestment. You immediately double-check that you are at military power, hold your aircraft attitude and begin to climb away. The LSO’s call over the radio: “ Bolter, bolter, bolter. Hook skip bolter!” You mutter under your breath: “Dammit!” USN/Getty Images The LSOs have noted that your hook bounced over the arresting wires.  Below in AIROPS, the Air Wing representatives who have gathered shout a collective “Aarrgghhhh!” around the room.  The carrier is having difficulty finding a calm sea state and that has resulted in missed arrestments. The tension on board the ship increases. Yet another bolter. The train is beginning to wreck—ever so slowly. Your low fuel state has now put you in a tanking situation. At the upwind position from the ship, you call departure control and tell them your fuel state. You continue to fly the wave off/bolter pattern until departure gives you vectors (steering directions) to the tanker. With tonight’s weather an issue, the tankers have flown above the cloud decks to find clear air. This makes them more difficult to spot and more difficult to reach. In a moment of frustration, you think to yourself:  “Why can’t the ship move to a clear weather area? This is a floating runway, for God’s sake!”  You think the ship has the innate ability to find the worst weather—most aviators will attest to this.  But you can’t worry about that now. You must “compartmentalize,” or concentrate only on the most important factor: plugging into the tanker for a squirt of much needed gas. You spot the flashing lights of the tanker above and to the right. Switching to the “tanker common” frequency you slowly join on him from the inside. The drogue’s hose and basket unravel out while you extend your aircraft’s refueling probe. A flash of lightning off in the distance reminds you there is a storm hauntingly close. It is imperative to make this a quick evolution and get back to the boat. The basket is now just 5 feet from the nose of your jet, but the strong winds are creating turbulence that is bouncing both the basket and your aircraft all around. The basket darts about jokingly while you advance the throttles in an effort to plug into the refueling probe. Your first attempt is a horrific miss. The probe catches the side of the basket and flips it carelessly away. Methodically, you put the aircraft back into position for a second attempt. Success. You see the green light illuminated on the drogue are now “plugged and receiving.” The tanker pilot radios =the amount of fuel he will be giving you. It won’t be much—enough for one or two more passes. The tanking evolution lasts only two or three minutes, time to catch your breath. Departure control gives you vectors back into the pattern. You put on your game face. There was nothing you could have done about the hook skip, and you put it out your mind. As the tanker shuts off fuel flow, you disengage from the basket and retract your refueling probe. You are now vectored downwind from the ship for a second attempt. There is little time and no fuel to waste. CATTC hooks you back into the direction of the ship with a steering vector. It is time to repeat the process. Methodically, you go through the same procedures, configuring your aircraft properly to land, carefully flying what your HUD is telling you to do, and praying that the ship finds a moment of a calm when you get there. You arrive at ¾ of a mile behind the ship a pick up the meatball. You are confident and cautiously optimistic. The optical landing system aka “The Meatball.”, USN From this position there is only about 20 seconds to touchdown. The ship has very few lights on it, just a small outline of a box in the landing area and a few lights off to the starboard side near the tower. Darkness is the theme. You continue to focus on the meatball, listening to the LSO’s give you a soft “ little power ” call. You adjust your throttles ever so slightly and find an angle of attack to keep the aircraft just above glideslope. You don’t want to get overpowered in close and cause a bolter. Precision is the master key to success during the most critical part of the boarding process. As you get closer, your peripheral vision picks up more of the ship. Things start to move faster in your brain and a feeling of ground rush (or in this case “ship” rush) begins to overtake your senses. The plane descends over the stern of the ship and down into the landing area. The few ship lights whiz past. At the moment of touchdown, you can feel the landing gear thud into the carrier deck. You already have the throttles at full military power. There is a split-second where you are waiting for that feeling of deceleration, knowing the hook has grabbed a wire. , USN This is the moment that separates carrier aviators from all others. You feel the deceleration first in your shoulder harness straps, then your head, and finally your whole body as you violently move forward in the ejection seat. The aircraft tugs on the wire and pulls it out like a rubber band, bringing you to a violent—but very welcome—stop. The initial feeling is a sense of relief, followed by a recognition of just how difficult that entire evolution was. You notice your knees shaking as you retract the arresting hook and flaps, and then taxi out of the landing area. USN Congratulations on a successful landing. You have added a thick layer to your aviator soul.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 23, 2018",Those Old OV-10 Broncos Sent To Fight ISIS Were Laser Rocket-Slinging Manhunters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The news that the Pentagon was sending a pair of refurbished and highly-upgraded Vietnam-era OV-10 Broncos to Iraq to take on ISIS raised a lot of eyebrows. It was a new twist in a decade and a half of counter-insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the United States has never used a light air support and surveillance aircraft. For many, the OV-10’s appearance in Iraq had been very long overdue . Now, The War Zone reveals details of what the pair of OV-10G+ Broncos were doing in Iraq, and how they went about it with impeccable results. The Broncos were used to find, fix and finish the enemy. In the past, this process was largely accomplished by at least two very different aircraft and platform communities , both of which usually had their own unique command and control structures. By condensing all the required capabilities into a single platform—the OV-10— the kill chain could be drastically compressed and save gobs of money in the process. The truth is, OV-10s weren’t really close air support aircraft in the traditional sense at all—they were manhunters. Nick Thomas The Bronco’s weapon of choice for this unique mission set was the relatively new but highly promising Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System , or the APKWS, a 70 mm rocket with a laser seeker and control section attached. Just like standard unguided 70 mm “Hydra” rockets, APKWS’s can be carried in bulk on various US and allied aircraft, with 7- and 19-count rocket pods commonly used. This bulk capability means a dramatic increase in precision firepower on everything from light helicopters to A-10 warthogs. The Bronco is far from a one trick pony. Laser-guided rockets can be fired either very close or miles away from their target, and at different angles, so aircrews can use creative tactics to achieve “unique” effects on the battlefield. In the right hands, these smart rockets can take out enemy personnel and destroy lightly armored vehicles under circumstances that no other guided munition could touch—at least not without causing significant collateral damage. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPXh0SpQU6w Not only was APKWS adequate, but when paired with the upgraded OV-10 Broncos it seems to have been a match made in heaven, or hell depending on which side you’re on. In some ways the Broncos wrote a new book on APKWS tactics during their tour in Iraq. When key officials were briefed on what the Broncos did during their time there, and hours of footage of the APKWS slinging OV-10s in action was shown, those officials were flabbergasted with what they saw. The Bronco’s “match grade” MX-15HD FLIR turret and big high-def display in the cockpit make the aircraft among the most accurate precision strike platforms on the planet. Night after night, the OV-10s put this capability to work. Instead of blowing up buildings or convoys, Bronco crews were killing ISIS fighters standing in dark windows, or in a single truck surrounded by others. As far as just how precise the OV-10 crews could be with their laser-guided rockets and high-end targeting sensors, the Bronco’s prowess in this department was almost freakish. It wasn’t just taking out bad guys in windows—they were doing the same with fighters hiding under eaves, overhangs, dense cover and in doorways. Essentially, the Broncos were flying snipers for special operations forces hunting ISIS in Iraq. They could observe with great clarity from on high, collect intelligence and stalk the enemy. They could also kill that enemy with incredible accuracy. Instead of using a sniper’s bullet, the Broncos used the Pentagon’s guided munition equivalent, laser-guided rockets. One shot, one kill, even under the most demanding of combat conditions. The OV-10s were packed with intelligence gathering electronics, an armada of communications systems and data-links (including multiple sat-com systems), defensive countermeasures, Scorpion helmet-mounted displays for both crew, and a centerline fuel tank. This extra gas helped the Broncos complete an average mission time between three and four hours—a sweet-spot duration for the types of special operations sorties they were regularly tasked with supporting. The human element that took the Broncos back to war was equally as impressive. The small cadre of Navy pilots were handpicked and were among the very best the service had to offer. All were weapons school instructors. The Weapon System Officers were from the Tomcat and Super Hornet communities, and had been embedded as special operations Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (forward air controllers) with SEAL units operating on the ground in the world’s most notorious hellholes. These senior-ranking and highly experienced officers had incredible insight into how SEALs operated on the ground and how to properly apply air power where necessary to achieve very specific effects on the battlefield. The experience and dedication of the Broncos aircrews were huge factors in making its experimental tour in Iraq so successful. The OV-10’s maintenance needs were also unique. The souped-up Broncos required just a single maintainer per aircraft, with the aircrews assisting in maintenance and support. It was an almost laughably affordable support footprint for an aircraft capable of identifying, hunting and killing the enemy entirely on its own. This barebones infrastructure also meant that the twin-turboprop powered aircraft were highly flexible when it came to basing. Crews could just load their gear in the OV-10’s cargo hold along with the maintainers, if needed, and self-deploy basically anywhere including austere and improvised airfields. Nick Thomas Central Command has been the driving force behind the OV-10 program and is pushing for it to evolve. Now that there is a load of data pointing to cost-effective success in Iraq, the hope is that Special Operations Command will invest into expanding the program significantly. Such a move is long overdue but better late than never. Why were the Broncos picked for this proof-of-concept deployment in the first place? In the mid to late 2000s, the Navy tested a similar special operations air support and counter-insurgency light aircraft concept stateside under the Imminent Fury and Combat Dragon programs . During Imminent Fury, the Brazilian-built Embraer Super Tucano was successfully proven to be a flexible special operations close air support and surveillance platform, but it was clear that moving that aircraft into an operational role would be a major hurdle. The Combat Dragon II package was originally developed for the Super Tucano, and this Navy Special Warfare program led to USAF interest. Yet the fact that the Super Tucano was a foreign import raised flags for established US aircraft manufacturers—namely Hawker-Beechcraft, which was developing the smaller AT-6. That aircraft was an armed light attack and surveillance version of the T-6 Texan II primary trainer that the Pentagon already owned hundreds of. The nimble team leading the program was able to bypass big defense procurement politics by taking advantage of a pair of available OV-10 Broncos, which had been used by Department of State Air Wing in Colombia. This same small and enterprising team remains at the helm of the current OV-10G+ program today. Interestingly, the Pentagon ended up procuring the A-29 Super Tucano, though only after a long procurement battle between Embraer-Sierra Nevada Corp and Hawker-Beechcraft. The USAF is currently flying the type today in small numbers to train and equip Afghani aircrews. These aircrews are now putting the type to use over Afghanistan to provide precision close air support and surveillance . Think of them as a manned, more dynamic, but shorter-ranged MQ-9 Reaper—on the cheap. With the A-29 now in the Pentagon’s inventory, and its capacity to be upgraded with similar gear as the OV-10G+s have that are flying with today, it’s possible the Bronco could pass the torch to a modified A-29 if the program is allowed to expand. Will the OV-10 go back into production? If the recent past is any indication, not unless SOCOM decides to go big and fund large fleet of Combat Dragon II derived aircraft. The idea was floated in the late 2000s and Boeing supposedly wanted a commitment of at least 100 aircraft to make it happen. Then again, in the world of special operations, anything is seemingly possible I guess. I mean the fact that OV-10s were put to use fighting ISIS decades after their official retirement is just proof of that.

Dave “Bio” Baranek and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 16, 2020","On Top Gun‘s 30th Anniversary, We Talk to a Topgun Instructor Who Worked on the ’80s Masterpiece","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone recently talked with good friend Dave “Bio” Baranek, who was a F-14 Radar Intercept Officer and a real Topgun instructor during the filming of Top Gun . He actually flew on several flights to film scenes for the movie’s aerial jousts and spent days at Paramount Studios helping to write the jargon-filled dialogue and edit the flying scenes. He recounted all this and more in his must-read memoir, Topgun Days , and offers an insider’s take of the blockbuster Tony Scott film that blasted onto the big screen 30 years ago today: I think producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer immediately saw the makings of a hit movie. The Tomcat’s pilot and RIO crew was a natural set-up for a “buddy movie.” The naval aviation setting and Topgun class would provide action, danger, and stunning visuals, along with personal challenges. The producers also planned a love interest for the star, and that took an interesting turn. Paramount This goes back to the origin of the Top Gun movie. The producers saw an article in California magazine about an F-14 crew going through the Topgun class. They had already made several flashy hits, like Flashdance and Beverly Hills Cop , so that was their style: fast pace, rock music, and the striking visuals. The guy who really made them aware of the eye-catching power of Navy fighters (the F-14 in particular) was Chuck “Heater” Heatley, himself an F-14 pilot, former Topgun instructor, and very talented photographer [see the game-changing coffee table book, The Cutting Edge, from the same era]. His photos in that magazine article deserve much of the credit for inspiring the movie. Simpson and Bruckheimer did their homework, sketched out a contemporary story line, and got to work. I have to say that just coming up with the idea was genius, but it took a lot of talent to actually make a great movie. When they came to Naval Air Station Miramar to prepare for filming, they met real-life analyst Christine Fox. Christine is an attractive woman who was known around Miramar for her insightful and relevant work for the Center for Naval Analyses, and while she wasn’t a Topgun instructor, she often worked with aircrews. She inspired the Kelly McGillis character in the movie. National Archives Let’s start with the opening, where Tomcats intercept enemy fighters. This happened in the real world often, and continues today. In the 1980s, a lot of intercepts were off the coast of Libya, where Navy fighters parried with Libyan MiGs—and whatever else came up. Pacific Fleet Tomcats intercepted fighters from the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and other countries. We all intercepted bombers and patrol planes from a variety of countries around the world. Really, these events were welcome breaks from the routine flying of a Cold War carrier deployment. They usually incited some apprehension until the situation stabilized. US Navy fighters occasionally encountered aggressive aircrews, and most people remember the two Libyan shoot-down incidents involving Tomcats . Most of the time, the intercepts led to benign escorts and even humorous “cultural exchanges,” like Soviet bomber crews showing us bottles of Pepsi through the windows of their aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rR6IS2uqtNo The movie also captured the stress and danger associated with landing on a carrier—although I should add that we weren’t dripping sweat every minute of every flight. It takes a lot of training and skill for pilots to put the jet down in that small area, and for the Naval Flight Officer (NFO) to function as an effective crew member. I’ve got about 650 carrier landings and one of them ended in a split-second ejection when the arresting gear machinery broke. It was just a few months after joining my first squadron and it happened with no warning: Suddenly, we had to make a life-or-death decision. Check out the video. As for the Topgun class, the movie captured many of the essentials. Students are challenged and evaluated by instructors, and when Goose says, “Viper’s up here? Great,” that shows the students’ competitiveness, looking for any intel on their opponents. When I went through the class we listened for any instructor on the radio and we could tell who was flying. In most cases we only heard one voice out of four or more opponents, but it was some insight. Later, when I went back as an instructor, I realized that the exceptional flight discipline resulted in few transmissions on frequencies the students used, which made it hard for the students to put together a picture of who they were facing, including names and numbers of adversaries. There is also some mentoring of students by Topgun instructors, which is shown throughout the movie. The instructors realize they have an important responsibility not only to teach friendly and threat weapons and tactics, but in many cases to mentor the young aircrews. Paramount The makers of Top Gun spent a lot of time at Miramar asking for stories. At least one RIO actually used to say, “Do some pilot shit!” When I heard about it, it was said by Tom “Sobs” Sobieck, one of the more colorful and talented RIOs, who was also a Topgun instructor and later commanded an F-14 squadron. One of my contributions to the movie was, “Watch the mountains!” Maybe not as memorable as Sobs’ quote but something I actually said on a low-altitude bugout (exiting the fight, usually at high-speed). Paramount The producers got a lot of help—check the credits and you’ll see many Navy people—and they actually listened when we made suggestions. Lots of people point out all the flaws or unrealistic elements in the movie. They’re there, and I’m not going to list them all, but let’s be candid— Top Gun is not a documentary. Regardless, a few that stick out: “Never leave your wingman.” Actually, we used a concept called “mutual support,” where one aircraft should be able to come to the assistance of the other if required during an engagement. This would be difficult if the two friendly fighters are outnumbered and engaged—as often happened in the old days—but it was one of the tactical concepts. Mutual support, however, didn’t mean that the aircraft should maneuver in formation. In fact, if a section of fighters were engaged, both fighters should not be in the same piece of sky in order to complicate the enemy’s targeting problem. The way it was shown in Top Gun was more dramatic, and it looked better on screen. DoD In basically every scene, we had to fly closer to each other for the cameras than we would in real life. When we were filming the head-on passes, it took quite a few passes to get it right [detailed in awesome fashion in Topgun Days ]. In our dogfight training, when we had a head-on pass we were required to stay 500 feet away from the other jet for safety. That was a distance we were all comfortable with, even if we were closing at Mach 1! But when we tried it for the movie the other jets looked too small, so the director wanted us to get closer than 500 feet. We talked about it and reasoned that under the controlled filming conditions we could close the distance. It still took several passes to refine the formations and other things, and we eventually passed close enough to hear the other jets—a rarity. That got the shot we were looking for. A trio of Topgun F-5E’s painted black for their role as the enemy MiG-28. Clay Lacy’s modified Learjet cameraship was used to shoot some of the movie’s most exciting aerial scenes.r , Dave “Bio” Baranek The flight leads and all the aircrew kept it professional, in the briefings and during the flights. The main flight lead for the F-14s was Lloyd “Bozo” Abel, while Bob “Rat” Willard and Ray “Secks” Seckinger took turns leading the Topgun jets. From the Navy’s safety-conscious culture, we knew that unusual flights such as air shows present high risk because it’s not the way we normally fly.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is buying an unspecified number of General Electric F110-GE-129 jet engines to power at least some of its future F-15EX Eagle fighter jets . The service says this is an “unusual and compelling urgency acquisition” and comes ahead of a formal competition to decide on the F-15EX’s powerplant, with Pratt & Whitney expected to submit their F100-PW-229 engine as an alternative. The Pentagon first announced the deal for the F110-GE-129s, which also “including installs and spares and modernized engine monitoring system computers,” in its daily contracting notice on June 30, 2020. The award is valued at $101,345,500 and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center expects to have all the engines and associated items and services delivered by Nov. 30, 2022. The Air Force decided to acquire a fleet of F-15EX fighters, a variant of Boeing’s F-15 Advanced Eagle family, in 2018, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The service subsequently received funding to buy an initial lot of eight jets in the 2020 Fiscal Year budget and is now asking for money to acquire an additional 12 in the upcoming 2021 Fiscal Year. The plan is to ultimately buy 144 of these aircraft, primarily to replace existing aging F-15C/D Eagles . An artist’s conception of a pair of the Air Force’s future F-15EXs., Boeing This initial buy of F110-GE-129s is specifically tied to the Lot 1 aircraft, according to the Pentagon announcement. If it meant to cover all eight of those aircraft, each of which will need two engines, then the contract should include at least 16 of these 29,400-pound thrust class afterburning turbofans. In January, the Air Force had announced plans to acquire the F-15EXs, along with F110-GE-129s to power them, through sole-source contracts to Boeing and General Electric, respectively. This particular engine is the only one that Boeing has already certified to work with Advanced Eagle models, including Saudi Arabia’s F-15SA variant and the newest F-15QA for Qatar. The F-15EX is derived from the F-15QA, which is presently the most advanced F-15 variant in production . The F110-GE-129 also powers South Korea’s F-15K Slam Eagles and Singapore’s F-15SGs . However, the Air Force subsequently changed course after it became apparent that Pratt & Whitney planned to protest the sole-source contract award and it will now hold an open competition. Pratt & Whitney is expected to pitch the afterburning version of its F100-PW-229, which is in the 29,160-pound thrust class, and is also already found on late-model Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles and the Israeli Air Force’s F-15Is. It’s also worth noting that the Air Force also flies Block 50 and 52 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets that use the F110-GE-129 and F100-PW-229, respectively. The most immediate issue, of course, is that the competition for the F-15EX’s engine, as well as the time it might take to certify the F100-PW-229 on those jets, something the Air Force says Pratt & Whitney would have to pay to do itself, could easily push back these jets’ entry into service. Mitigating delays in the development of the F-15EX variant itself over the engine issue is very likely the “unusual and compelling urgency” that Air Force officials cited when seeking approval to buy at least some F110-GE-129s now. The Air Force could eventually buy as many as 480 of whatever engine type it picks in the end making this a very lucrative competition. Winning could be especially important for Pratt & Whitney, which is facing the prospect of losing other engine business with the Air Force in the coming years, including with respect to the service’s B-52 bombers and its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . Pratt & Whitney remains the prime contractor supporting the sustainment of the TF-33 engines for the B-52s, but the Air Force now has a re-engining effort underway. The Connecticut-headquartered engine-maker had initially lobbied for simply continuing to use the aging TF-33s, but now plans to submit the PW815 , which is Canadian subsidiary produces, to the competition. General Electric and Rolls-Royce are also vying for that contract , which is set to be extremely profitable for whoever wins given that each of the 76 bombers will need eight new engines. The F-35 Joint Program Office is also set to release an F-35 Propulsion Road Map for 2035 , which might include an option to re-engine F-35As, as well as B and C models, as well as supply new engines for future Joint Strike Fighters. This could apply to Air Force F-35As, as well as U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs and U.S. Navy F-35Cs, along with variants in service or on order elsewhere around the world. Pratt & Whitney presently supplies the F135 engines that power all three variants, but General Electric and Rolls-Royce would be sure to compete to build a new engine. The latter two companies had previously won a deal as a team to produce an alternate F136 engine for the F-35 family, work on which was canceled in 2011. The jet engine industry, worldwide, is facing a seriously uncertain future in general amid the global economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The air travel industry has been particularly hard hit , which has had second-order impacts on the aviation industry, as a whole. It remains to be seen how all of this may or may not impact the decision on what engine will ultimately power the bulk of the F-15EX fleet, as well as the schedule for the program as a whole. What is clear is that the Air Force believes it is an urgent necessity to buy some F110-GE-129s now to keep everything on track.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 2, 2020",Here’s What Those Mysterious Helicopters That Woke Up The Oregon Coast Were Doing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier today, a contact of mine asked if I knew anything about the somewhat alarming helicopter activity that occurred in the wee morning hours of July 1st, 2020 around Northwest Oregon, near Astoria and Seaside. The Pacific Northwest is my backyard, so if anything weird happens in the air up here I usually hear about it, but this was new to me and the report I got was quite strange. Ryan McDonnough, a contact of mine, messaged me about his friend Nicholas McKenzie’s experience. Nicholas was kind enough to provide the following statement: It was between 1:15am and 1:30am they came from the south heading north northwest flying super low, like lower than any training exercises I’ve ever seen maybe 150ft to 100ft or less. It was hard to tell being how late it was and dark with cloud cover. But they were low enough to be able to see the underside of the aircraft with some detail. It was what appeared to be an Osprey with two other helicopters flanking it from the underside… They may have been Apaches or Blackhawks. They were going somewhere in a hurry and flying a tight formation… Only the Osprey had one small red light on its tail on. It was wild enough that most of the town is talking about it. When it was coming in I thought it was a Chinook it was so loud. It freaked a lot of people out. It turns out he wasn’t alone. I have seen a number of other social media posts about the helicopters’ surprise flight. People that lived in the area noted how they shook their house like nothing else and how they have never seen helicopters flying that low and fast before. First off, there are no V-22 Ospreys based in the Northwest. The closest Ospreys we have are at MCAS Miramar in Southern California, but once and while they will venture up here for cross-country flights, air shows, a domestic transport mission, or even when operating on an amphibious assault ship somewhere far off the Oregon Coast. When it comes to Black Hawks, the Oregon Army National Guard has them, but they are UH-60M medivac types and its CH-47 Chinooks are standard variants. Helicopters, generally, don’t like flying very low and fast in inclement weather at night, especially in tight formation. The Coast Guard is based in Astoria with MH-60J Jayhawks, which have the ability to fly into inclement weather even at lower altitudes, but they do that mainly over water and not in formations with numerous other types. Also, they wouldn’t be flying blacked-out aside from the lead aircraft, but one unit does fly just that way—the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), aka the Night Stalkers. MH-60M in front of Washington State’s Mt. Rainier., US Army They are the most elite helicopter unit in the U.S. military and the constant source of surprise and concern of local citizens in the areas where they show up for their very unique and extreme flavor of training. The 160th SOAR has the most heavily modified helicopters in the world, with both their MH-60s and MH-47s equipped with advanced terrain-following radar systems, making them capable of flying nap-of-the-earth into contested areas regardless of the atmospheric conditions. One of the battalions of the 160th SOAR calls Joint Base Lewis McChord, located just south of Tacoma, Washington, home. As for Ospreys, the only types that can execute similar feats are the Air Force’s special operations-configured CV-22s , which are very similarly equipped with terrain-following radars and other advanced navigation and sensor systems, but the closest any of them are based is in New Mexico. Air Force Special Operations CV-22B Osprey., USAF With all that being said, I reached out to the Oregon Military Department to see if they knew anything. They didn’t, but noted that all their aircraft are down by 11pm as a rule, unless they have to go out on an operational sortie. So, they weren’t theirs, but they told me I should reach out to Joint Base Lewi- McChord, which was already my next stop. The base’s Apaches and other ‘big Army’ helicopters have been known to fly down to the area around Astoria and Seaside to do training, especially low-level work, but during the day or at least not in the middle of the night and not bad weather. Camp Rilea, a relatively small, but beautiful local training center that is nestled along the coast near Warrenton is also used occasionally by military helicopters when they are working on insertion and extraction tactics and other skills with land units. The 160th SOAR is also known to venture down into these parts from time to time, but not at 1AM, en masse, and over populated areas like what happened in the early morning hours on July 1st. Specially modified MH-60M of the Night Stalkers. , US Army The Joint Base Lewis-McChord public affairs folks were right on the ball when I described what I was told people saw. It turns out that a major exercise involving the Night Stalkers, U.S. Army Rangers, as well as fixed-wing assets and CV-22 Ospreys, is underway. The statement from the base reads: Rangers from 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord will conduct a military exercise June 22-July 1 at JBLM and Satsop Nuclear Power Plant in Elma, Washington. The Ranger battalion will use training ammunition and other training devises [sic; devices] to make the exercise as real as possible. There will be periods of increased air traffic to include low-flying helicopters, tilt-rotor aircraft (CV-22 Osprey) and airplanes during hours of darkness around JBLM and around the Satsop Nuclear Power Plant. There will also be noticeable air traffic between JBLM and Satsop as helicopters and Ospreys transport the Rangers to and from the two locations. During the evenings this week, there will be air traffic and noise associated with a large airborne operation on base involving the Rangers. The 75th Ranger Regiment is a lethal, agile and versatile special operations force that conducts forcible entry operations and special operations raids across the entire spectrum of combat. Tough realistic military exercises conducted regularly provide the Rangers a unique edge for real-world missions. This is routine training conducted periodically to maintain a high level of readiness for the military personnel involved. Every measure to reduce the amount of noise associated with the training will be taken. We appreciate the support of the residents and community in the surrounding areas during this training. Satsop Nuclear Power Plant , which sits between Olympia and Aberdeen in Western Washington, was never completed and has been left in a semi-abandoned state for decades. This makes it one hell of a great setting for U.S. special operators to hone their skills at assaulting a complex target , such as a nuclear powerplant. They could be called upon to do just that in a conflict or anti-terror operation, with North Korea coming to mind, in particular. In fact, the terrain and locale, in general, may be a good analog for what they could find in North Korea. Satsop Nuclear Power Plant., Fgt56d/wikicommons Satsop Nuclear Power Plant, Google Earth The abandoned nuclear plant is shown in relation to Seaside and the Astoria area, where the helicopters appeared on the morning of July 1st, 2020., Google Maps The 160th SOAR and the operators they support are constantly doing elaborate training exercises, often in highly populated urban areas. This can include flying under the bridges of New York City and literally buzzing down streets in Downtown Los Angeles . It can be bizarre and outright intimidating to some folks who don’t understand what they are seeing, but the reality is that they can’t get this training on a synthetic range. The real deal is absolutely key to keeping their skills razor-sharp should the call come to do something similar operationally. Fighting future asymmetric battles in ‘megacities’ or deep underground complexes all require extremely realistic training, and nuclear powerplants are no different. Special operators fast rope down from an MH-60M of the 160th SOAR. , US Army Why they ended up further south, over the Northwest Oregon coast isn’t exactly clear, but they have to practice complex infiltrations flying over undulating terrain at night and in poor weather for hundreds of miles, as they could be called upon to do it for a time-sensitive operational mission. So, taking a circuitous route through the mountains of Northwest Oregon before hooking along the coast and into Western Washington and simulating a real-world assault on the nuke plant, makes a lot of sense. Or it could have been a separate training mission that is part of the same multi-day exercise, but didn’t include the nuclear plant. We just don’t know. What we do know is that working together with their Air Force CV-22 counterparts and other assets, possibly even refueling via an MC-130 flying blacked-out and low off the coast, elevates the training to another level. So, there you have it! Not to worry Oregonians, it’s just the Night Stalkers raising hell once again, along with their Air Force friends.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 4, 2020",Navy Will Mothball Its First Four Littoral Combat Ships In Nine Months If Congress Lets It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy expects the first four of its perpetually underperforming Littoral Combat Ships , a pair of ships from each of the two subclasses, to be out of service within the next nine months. Some members of Congress, however, are now seeking to block the mothballing of two of these vessels until all of the tests of the various and continually delayed mission modules for each variant are complete, which is still years away from happening. The Navy provided the update on its plans to inactivate these Littoral Combat Ships in an official internal message dated June 20, 2020, which Defense News was first to report . The missive says that USS Freedom and USS Independence , both of which are the first ships in their subclasses, along with the Freedom class USS Fort Worth and Independence class USS Coronado , are set to be “Out of Commission, In Reserve,” or OCIR, by March 2021. The first-in-class USS Freedom , in the background, sails alongside the first-in-class USS Independence , in the foreground., USN The Navy first revealed its plans to retire these four LCSs , also known by their hull numbers, LCS 1 through LCS 4, in its budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, which it released in February 2020. The service had previously planned to assign these ships to a new surface warfare development unit, Surface Development Squadron One , where they would have joined the three Zumwalt class stealth destroyers , the last of which is still under construction, and the Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessel. It was an unprecedented admission that the Navy did not feel that these vessels were even worth keeping around in a primarily test and evaluation role and as the seagoing force continues to struggle to find a pathway to reaching its long-standing goal of a total fleet size of 355 ships . These first four littoral combat ships were commissioned between 2008 and 2014, making them all relatively young vessels. However, the reflected early iterations of their respective designs and had already been relegated to test and training roles for years. “Those four test ships were instrumental to wringing out the crewing, the maintenance and all the other things we needed to learn from them,” Navy Rear Admiral Randy Crites, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Budget, said a press briefing for the 2021 Fiscal Year budget request in February. “But they’re not configured like the other LCS in the fleet, and they need significant upgrades. Everything from combat [systems], to structural, you name it. They’re expensive to upgrade.” It’s worth noting that the Navy does not appear to have ever publicly disclosed what it would cost to fully upgrade these four LCSs. The fact that these initial examples differ so significantly from later models is also a product of a process called concurrency , wherein the production of the ships began with the understanding that modifications and fixes would get inserted throughout the process. This was supposed to help reduce costs by allowing for construction to ramp up quicker than normal, but the amount of reworking necessary proved to be more extensive than initially expected. The Navy is still continuing to take deliveries of new LCSs . Just this week, it accepted the delivery of the future USS Oakland , an Independence class vessel, which the service touted as being on track to bring its total fleet to 300 ships. It’s not clear how long that milestone might last amid the planned retirements of the first four LCSs and other ships . The Navy is also working to make the three different mission modules fully operational. There are presently three different packages, a mine countermeasures one , one focused on anti-submarine warfare , and another that provides additional anti-surface warfare capabilities . The original plan had been that these modular packages would allow for the relatively rapid reconfiguration of individual LCSs from one mission set to another, making the multi-mission capable without having to lug around all of the different weapons and other relevant systems at once. This was a core component of the LCS program. The Navy has since decided that this is not necessarily a viable operational model and it plans to effectively permanently mount certain modules on various ships in both subclasses, which will make them significantly less flexible. The service has begun creating new dedicated Mine Divisions within Littoral Combat Ship Squadrons in recent years, reflecting this change in the concept of operations. Still, the capabilities the LCSs offer, even with the various mission modules installed, have long been underwhelming. There is an effort underway now to add launchers for the RGM-148A Naval Strike Missile (NSM) to at least some of the ships , giving them a sorely needed boost in firepower. At the same time, the Navy effectively admitted the limitations of the two LCS classes in 2017, when it announced plans to acquire a new class of frigates with more robust multi-mission capabilities. In April, the service selected Marinette Marine , a U.S.-subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, to build at least the first of these ships, which are known presently as FFG(X)s. The design will be based on the Franco-Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. U.S. President Donald Trump courted some controversy last week by saying that Marinette Marine had won the lucrative contract in no small part for political reasons based on the shipyard’s location. “I hear the maneuverability is one of the big factors that you were chosen for the contract,” Trump told workers at the company’s yard in Wisconsin on June 25, 2020. “The other is your location in Wisconsin, if you want to know the truth.” The Navy also recently had to defend its cost estimate for the initial 10 FFG(X)s to members of Congress. The House and the Senate are both in the process of finalizing their respective versions of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year and some legislators are looking for an independent evaluation of the projected costs of the frigate program. With regards to the LCS program, lawmakers in the House also want to block the retirement of the Fort Worth and the Coronado “until the Secretary [of the Navy] has submitted a certification that all operational tests have been completed on all mission modules.” Based on the language in the Senate’s draft NDAA , this could be years away. Testing of the mine countermeasures module is slated to wrap up in 2022, while initial operational test and evaluation of the anti-submarine warfare package isn’t even supposed to start until next year. Tests of the surface warfare mission module are also still ongoing . An infographic showing the components of the three different mission modules for the LCS., USN Members of the House and the Senate still need to finish up work on their respective NDAAs and reconcile them before putting to them a vote, after which the bill could make its way to President Trump’s desk for him to sign. It remains to be seen if the House’s LCS provisions will make their way into a final NDAA that becomes law . No matter how many of the first four LCSs ultimately get retired, their future is still uncertain. The Navy defines the “Out of Commission, In Reserve” status as “status of a decommissioned Navy ship being held in reserve for future mobilization purposes,” leaving open the possibility it could reactive these ships in the future. Other ships listed in the June 20 message are slated for complete dismantlement . Regardless, the Navy clearly wants to at least send all of these ships into mothballs by early next year, if Congress will let them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 23, 2020",The Air Force Almost Got A Near Hypersonic Radar Plane Killing Cruise Missile Decades Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. Air Force continually faced questions about whether its strategic bombers could make it past Soviet defenses to drop their nuclear payloads if World War III were to break out. The service experimented with and fielded a variety of different weapons and adopted different tactics over the years, all with the aim of ensuring these aircraft were as protected as possible from enemy aircraft and anti-aircraft threats as they flew to their targets. In the 1970s, the Air Force began work on a new nuclear-tipped stand-off missile, a design in many ways far ahead of its time and capable of near hypersonic speeds. Its purpose was to nuke enemy air defenses as the bombers snaked their ways to their targets, but it also had a relatively exotic secondary role—shooting down Soviet airborne early warning and control aircraft. The Air Force awarded the initial design study contract for this new weapon concept, eventually known as the Advanced Strategic Air-Launched Missile (ASALM), in 1971, according to an official history . At that time, the AGM-69A Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM), which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , was in the final stages of development. The SRAMs, each of which had a W69 thermonuclear warhead with a yield of around 200 kilotons, gave the Air Force’s B-52 bombers and FB-111 Aardvark combat jets an immediate means of engaging Soviet surface-to-air missile sites along their flight paths when they entered service the following year. Coupled with low-level flight profiles, the SRAMs would hopefully make sure the B-52s and FB-111s successfully penetrated through Soviet defenses. The SRAMs themselves could also be used to conduct more general strikes if any were left over by the time the planes reached their designated target areas. A pair of inert AGM-69A SRAMs., USAF However, even as work on the AGM-69A progressed, the Air Force was already looking ahead to successors. The Nuclear Weapons Databook, Volume 1 , published in 1994, says that ASALM, at least in concept, dated back to at least 1968, a year before the first powered flight of a SRAM prototype. It was an outgrowth of earlier projects referred to as the Bomber Defense Missile (BDM) and Multi-Purpose Missile (MPM), according to that book. After awarding the initial design contract for the missile in 1971, the Air Force further hired contractors to explore ramjet propulsion options that would give the missile at least near-hypersonic speed, according to The Evolution of the Cruise Missile , which the Air Force itself published in 1985. Hypersonic speed is defined as anything above Mach 5. The ASALM concept, also sometimes referred to as the Advanced Supersonic Air-Launched Missile, promised a missile with a higher top speed and greater range than the SRAM. This, in turn, would allow bombers and strike aircraft to engage threats from further away and faster, making it more difficult for the enemy to react and expanding the decision-making time and survivability of the launching aircraft’s crew. The Air Force ultimately settled on some form of rocket ramjet as the desired propulsion method. ASALM used a rocket ramjet configuration in which a rocket booster propels the overall system to an optimal speed for a air-breathing ramjet engine to takeover. The empty rocket motor casing serves as the combustion chamber for the ramjet. A graphic from later in the ASALM program’s history showing how the propulsion system would function in sequence, from top to bottom. The first image shows the rocket motor igniting, while the second shows the fairing covering the air intake for the ramjet engine breaking away as the rocket burns out. The third image shows the tail section falling away, while the fourth shows ramjet functioning by using the now-empty rocket motor casing as its combustion chamber., Public Domain The eventual goal was for the ASALM to be able to cruise at around Mach 4.5 and have a maximum range of up to 300 miles. The SRAM had a top speed of Mach 3 and a range of 100 miles. In 1972, the Air Force issued more contracts for studies of the propellants that the ASALM would use, as well as to explore guidance system options. Two years later, the service held a competition to select a defense contractor to put all of the system’s components together into an actual missile. A key requirement was for the final design to have the same general form factor as the SRAM and be able to use the same launchers without any modification, including a rotary launcher that fits inside the B-52’s bomb bay. The B-1A bomber , then in development, was also expected to be able to carry this same internal launcher. Eight SRAMs on the internal rotary launcher for the B-52 bomber., Boeing Martin Marietta ultimately beat out a competing proposal from McDonnell Douglas. Both companies had previously run their own internal competitions to select a subcontractor to build the rocket ramjet propulsion system, with both settling on Marquardt, an established name in ramjet development, according to a 1976 Aviation Week article on the project. Between 1976 and 1977, the Air Force also restructured the program in order to try to accelerate it. A comparative look the Martin Marietta ASALM design, at bottom left, and the McDonnell Douglas proposal, at top right, from the front aspect., Public Domain Despite not being selected as the prime contractor, McDonnell Douglas joined Martin Marietta’s division in Orlando, Florida, along with Boeing, in the development of the missile’s airframe and other associated technology, according to the 1979-1980 edition of Jane’s Weapon Systems . Raytheon and Rockwell International also contributed to the development of the guidance systems. It’s not clear exactly when this occurred, or if it had been the case from the very beginning, but by that time the program had also gained the requirement for the missile to be able to perform a secondary air-to-air mission. However, the available sources, primary and secondary, do generally agree that the ASALM was primarily intended to be a direct replacement or follow-on to the SRAM. In 1977, the Senate Armed Services Committee even reportedly asked the Air Force if it might be a viable successor to the subsonic AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), which was also in development at the time, according to an article that year in Aviation Week . It’s hard to see how this would’ve been possible given that the ALCM’s maximum range was significantly greater. The Soviet Union’s development of a more capable airborne early warning and control aircraft in the 1970s as a replacement for the Tupolev Tu-126 Moss , a derivative of the Tu-114 airliner that had first entered service in 1965, seems to have been an important driver behind the additional air-to-air requirement. The new Beriev A-50 Mainstay , based on the Ilyushin Il-76 Candid airlifter , flew for the first time in 1978. The Vega radar on the A-50 notably had a look-down capability, unlike the Tu-126’s Liana radar, which NATO also referred to as Flat Jack. This meant the Mainstays would be able to spot and track bombers and other strike aircraft flying at low levels among the ground clutter, the established U.S. Air Force infiltration tactic at the time, and vector fighters to intercept them and otherwise alert the rest of the Soviet air defense network. Knocking out or otherwise negating enemy early warning capabilities in the air, as well as those on the ground and in space, early in a major conflict was, and remains, an important task, in general, to ensure that the initial waves of strikes are as successful as possible. A low-quality image of one of the approximately 12 Tu-126 Moss airborne warning and control aircraft that the Soviet Union built., amon goeths via Wikimedia A Beriev A-50 Mainstay, the replacement for the Tu-126, seen in 1995., Rob Schleiffert via Wikimedia “One of the purposes of this missile would be to destroy the projected SUAWACS [Soviet Union Airborne Warning And Control System Aircraft], thereby degrading the Soviet Union’s potentially effective forward defense against both bombers and cruise missile carriers,” then-Secretary of Defense Harold Brown told members of Congress in a report in January 1980. “In addition, the ASALM would provide an air-to-ground capability to be used in the primary strike mission as a possible replacement or follow-on to the currently deployed short-range attack missile (SRAM).” The ASALM’s multi-role capability would come from a guidance system capable of either homing in on a target’s electronic emissions or using an active radar seeker to zero in on the threat. The former functionality would be the primary means of engaging hostile air defense radars on the ground, similar to more traditional anti-radiation missiles , while the latter capability would be used in part with the radiation homing seeker as a way of engaging an airborne early warning and control aircraft over great distances and it would be essential if a conventionally-armed ASALM was ever introduced in the air-to-air role. As we understand it, a thermonuclear warhead, possibly the same W69 used on the SRAM, was the missile’s primary payload. This would have meant accuracy would not necessarily have been paramount in either an air-to-ground or air-to-air engagement. It isn’t clear just how far the idea of a conventionally armed ASALM got. It is possible that a nuclear-armed ASALM with just an anti-radiation seeker would have been able to get close enough to a SUAWACS to take it down without the need for an active radar seeker. Also, a built-in inertial navigation system could also help guide the missile to the general target area.

Starting in October 1979 and running through May 1980, the service conducted a Propulsion Technology Validation (PTV) effort consisting of seven launches of test articles with no warhead or guidance system, all of which were deemed successful.

In at least one of the launches, an A-7 Corsair II combat jet was used as the launch platform, indicating the Air Force may have considered expanding the number of aircraft certified to carry the weapon. Mockups of the ASALM missiles were also shown mounted on the rotary launcher for the B-52.

There has been some suggestion that budget constraints played a role in declining interest in the weapon. As of April 1980, the Air Force estimated the program would cost at least $140 million, more than $435.5 million in 2020 dollars, and it was looking to get $25.7 million, or nearly $80 million today, in the upcoming 1981 Fiscal Year budget. However, the defense budget for that fiscal year was substantially larger than it had been in the preceding three years, a sign of the further defense buildup to come under President Ronald Reagan. The more likely explanation seems to be that the ASALM fell victim to a mix of technical difficulties and competing priorities. Jane’s Weapon Systems says that General Alton Slay, then head of Air Force Systems Command, had told members of Congress back in 1978 that this missile was, in part, a hedge against the failure of the AGM-86, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . It’s possible that Slay might’ve been referring to a larger derivative of the ASALM, as well. Regardless, production of the AGM-86 started in 1980 and it began to enter service in 1982. By the early 1980s, the service was also well in the process of developing a dedicated SRAM successor, the AGM-131A SRAM II , which was itself canceled in 1991. There were also a number of stealthy cruise missile projects at around the same time, which culminated with the AGM-129A Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM), which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . An inert SRAM II now on display the National Museum of the US Air Force., USAF In addition, while the PTV flight tests were successful, there were concerns about the rocket ramjet’s ability to perform consistently at low altitudes, where the air is thicker and there is more drag on any flying object. The missile could have had difficulty reaching an optimal speed and altitude for its air-breathing engine to function properly when launched from a bomber or other aircraft flying at a very low level to otherwise reduce the threat from enemy air defenses. However, Martin Marietta said that it felt it had solved those low altitude launch problems by 1980. Questions about potential targeting difficulties when using the missile against aerial threats also appear to have been a contributing factor. “If the threat is sophisticated, we’re looking for extremely long-range launches at maximum range, and we’ll have to shrink down the package and subsystems,” a U.S. government official told Aviation Week in 1980 . “It would be at the very extreme of the radar horizon.” The complete concept of operation that the Air Force envisioned for the ASALM isn’t clear. Soviet AWACSs would not have been static targets, unlike air defense sites on the ground, and Air Force bombers and other strike aircraft would not have had had the kind of sensors, such as long-range radars , necessary to spot and track them themselves at extended ranges. This issue also cropped up during tests regarding the potential use of the F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jet in the air-to-air role, which you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . Having some other platform locate the AWACS first would have been one method, but stand-off targeting of threats deep inside heavily defended Soviet areas, in the air and on the ground, was definitely a general issue at the time due to limited networking capabilities and other factors. The difficulty of finding targets in denied areas remains an issue today, as you can read about more here . Another option would have been to fire the missile into an area where an AWACS would likely be operating and let the missile either find its target by using the passive homing capabilities it would employ to find radars on the ground or its active radar seeker. With only a limited number of ALASMs on board, it’s not clear how willing the crew of a bomber or other strike aircraft might have actually been to fire them without knowing for sure they’d find a target, rather than saving them for engaging positively identified threats. There also seemed to be questions about whether the new Soviet AWACS would actually enter service and, even if it did, whether it might not be possible to employ a mixture of other capabilities and tactics, including the improved SRAM II and electronic warfare systems, to otherwise ensure bombers and other strike aircraft made it to their targets. Advanced stand-off weapons, such as the stealthy AGM-129, would have also offered alternative options. “The SUAWAC is projected but is not actually in being. … Even if the threat develops as projected, [the Office of the Secretary of Defense] is not convinced ASALM is the only solution,” one contemporary position paper reportedly stated . The first Beriev A-50 ultimately entered service in 1984. It’s not clear exactly when it occurred, but the ASLAM project was finally scrapped for good sometime in the 1980s. Martin Marietta did pitch derivatives for other roles and McDonnell Douglas did the same with its losing design. This included a version that Martin Marietta presented to the U.S. Navy as a supersonic aerial target in 1983. The Navy did hire the company the following year to develop what subsequently became known as the YAQM-127A Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (SLAT). That design fared poorly in testing, with only one of eight launches between 1987 and 1991 being deemed successes. The Navy canceled this program, too, eventually buying a derivative of an actual Soviet-designed surface-to-air missile for use as an aerial target. You can read more about the MA-31, a cooperative effort between McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing, and Russia’s Zveda-Strela, in this recent War Zone piece . A comparative look at the ASALM design used for the PTV effort, also seen here described as the Multi-Purpose Missile (MPM) versus the longer derivative of the ASALM that Martin Marietta developed for the Navy’s Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (SLAT) program., Public Domain Martin Marietta did propose ship-launched derivatives to the Navy, as well. These designs were referred to variously as the Outer Air Battle Missile and Outer Perimeter Defense Missile. It’s not clear whether the naval versions would have had nuclear or conventional warheads, but they were described as being intended for use as high-speed surface-to-air missiles that could shoot down incoming Soviet aircraft before they got close enough to launch anti-ship missiles. McDonnell Douglas also proposed a submarine-launched missile based on its proposed ASALM design that would carry a torpedo as payload and release it over the suspected location of an enemy sub. This was similar in some general respects to the submarine-launched UUM-44 Submarine Rocket (SUBROC) and the ship-launched RUR-5 Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) that were in service at the time, but would have had massively longer range. Artwork depicting a McDonnell Douglas proposal for a submarine-launched derivative of its ASALM proposal armed with a torpedo for use as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) standoff weapon., McDonnell Douglas The general requirements that led to the development of the ASALM, especially the desire for a long-range “AWACS killer” missile, certainly didn’t go away. The United States, as well as its potential competitors, have continued to explore air-to-air weapons to fill this role in the decades since. Russia and China, in particular, have developed various missiles for this mission and continue to do so. In the mid-2000s, there were reports that Russia, in cooperation with India had started work on a derivative of the 1990s-era KS-172 , which eventually became known as the K-100 , a very long-range air-to-air missile intended, at least in part, for the AWACS hunting role. In 2016, images emerged of a Chinese J-16 fighter jet carrying a large air-to-air missile , now sometimes referred to as the PL-21, which could have a similar intended mission set. A mockup of the Russian K-100 very-long-range air-to-air missile, previously also known as the R-172S-1., KnAAPO The U.S. military itself is now in the process of developing the AIM-260 , its own very long-range air-to-air missile , as well as the separate Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW), another air-to-air weapon that could have a counter-AWACS role. There has also been steady progress in the development of an improved supersonic anti-radiation missile, the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER). The AGM-88G will also have more general-purpose air-to-ground capabilities and it’s improved capabilities might even leave the door open for employing it against aerial targets, such as enemy AWACS. In addition, in the early 2010s, Lockheed Martin, a company that had come into being as the result of a merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta in 1995, began work on two different anti-ship cruise missiles for the Navy. One of these was the subsonic AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), which began life as the LRASM-A. There was, however, a separate effort to develop a supersonic companion to that weapon, called the LRASM-B, the design of which bears more than a passing resemblance, at least visually, to that of the ASALM. It seems hard to believe the LRASM-B was not at least a spiritual successor to the earlier Cold War missile. Officially, work on the LRASM-B ended in 2013, but there is the possibility that it or a further derivative of it might have evolved into the top-secret Sea Dragon supersonic submarine-launched anti-ship cruise missile, which you can read about more in this past War Zone story . A model of Lockheed Martin’s LRASM-B, which shares distinct visual similarities with the Martin Marietta ASALM., Americanmilitaryforum.com Beyond all this, there has also been a more general surge of interest in ramjet-powered air-breathing cruise missiles around the world in recent years. These include, among others, multiple development efforts the U.S. military has in progress and Russia’s work on the 3M22 Zircon , designs that are all expected to boast hypersonic speeds. China is in the process of developing a ground-launched hypersonic cruise missile and is already working on supersonic ramjet-powered weapons in this same category. All told, the ASALM seems to have been ahead of its time in many respects. With all the developments going on now that we know about, in addition to ones that are almost certainly happening in the classified realm, it seems very possible that we may now see the return of this concept in some form, if it doesn’t exist already.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as other similar incidents, which are still ongoing in many parts of the country, have reinvigorated discussions about when and how law enforcement officers’ use force. The responses to those demonstrations have similarly sparked renewed debate about crowd-control tactics, some of which are now under formal investigation , including the use of less-than-lethal weapons, such as rubber bullets and tear gas. This reminded us here at The War Zone of the unusual case of a sheriff’s office in Arizona buying Russian-designed “traumatic pistols,” capable of firing rubber bullets or other less-lethal projectiles. As it turns out, the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office (PSCO) has gotten rid of nearly three-quarters of the 60 Defenzia D09s it originally bought in 2016 and has yet to use them outside training exercises and demonstrations. Pinal County is situated between Phoenix and Tuscon and its southern boundary is less than 60 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border in places, which adds concerns about contending with drug and human traffickers to normal policing duties. “When Sheriff [Mark] Lamb took office in January of 2017, we immediately discontinued their use and began the process of trying to return them to Defenzia,” PSCO’s Chief Deputy Matthew Thomas told The War Zone . “We eliminated the majority of our inventory with trading in 44 of the weapons and keeping 16. The 16 that we kept, we kept specifically for specialty unit use, i.e. our Search and Rescue, SWAT, and inside our jail.” The D09 is a stubby, four-barrel pistol with a pepperbox-like configuration that weighs under a pound. Unlike in a traditional pepperbox, the 18.5mm diameter barrels – 12 gauge to most Americans – remain fixed in place and do not rotate like the cylinders in a revolver. The gun’s electronic firing mechanism can determine whether or not a live round in loaded into any of the barrels and will fire it first when the user pulls the trigger, rather than having to cycle through any empty chambers first. Despite its 12 gauge barrels, shooters cannot load traditional shotgun shells into the pistol. Defenzia instead supplies a variety of proprietary ammunition types. These include rubber impact rounds, flashbang cartridges, ones loaded with pepper spray gel, and distress flares. The D09 has an integrated laser sight nestled in the center between the barrels, as well as rudimentary iron sights on top. It has a generally accepted effective range of between around three and 33 feet, though Defenzia says it can hit targets out to 90 feet, depending on the type of ammunition employed. This pistol is an evolution of the PB-4, which Russia’s state-owned Research Institute for Applied Chemistry first brought to market in 1999. Also sold as the Osa , or “wasp,” the gun is described as a “traumatic pistol” in Russia. A PB-4 Osa “traumatic pistol” with a rubber bullet cartridge and black projectile seen below., via Modern Firearms “PB-4 pistols were quite popular about 5-10 years ago,” Maxim Popenker, a Russian firearms expert who also runs a website now called Modern Firearms , told the author back in 2015. “Now people in Russia often prefer less-lethal pistols firing smaller caliber bullets due to their ‘real gun’ appearance and larger ammo capacities.” However, the PB-4 remains in production and on sale in Russia and the international market. Just last month, Rosoboronexport, the Russian state arms broker, announced that a new version with longer chambers for larger rounds, called the PB-4SP, was available for export. Brazil-based Defenzia developed its D09, as well as its smaller caliber D11 model , from the PB-4 and markets it in the United States via a U.S. subsidiary, Defenzia USA . This separation from the original manufacturer certainly helps get around U.S. government sanctions and other restrictions on the importing of weapons and ammunition from Russia. Defenzia also says its particular versions are in service with security forces in Brazil, Germany, and Israel. “We returned the bulk because we knew that we did not want to deploy them as an impact weapon for use on patrol by Deputies,” Chief Deputy Thomas explained when asked about PCSO’s decision to get rid of the bulk of their D09s. “We felt that a better use of the weapon system was with the illumination rounds for our search and rescue, noise flash rounds for SWAT and the impact rounds for riot situations in our jail.” “While the weapons were officially ‘deployed’ to patrol prior to our administration calling them back in, we did not have any uses of the weapons while deployed and we still do not,” he continued. “They have only been used thus far in training scenarios or demonstrations.” It’s worth noting, of course, that less-than-lethal weapons, especially those that use blunt trauma to neutralize their targets, such as those that fire rubber bullets, can cause serious injury or death if used improperly. There have been a number of instances where individuals protesting after the George Floyd killing, including journalists, suffered major injuries after getting hit with less-lethal projectiles. Infamously, in 2004, a Boston police officer killed Victoria Snelgrove , who had been out celebrating with the rest of the city after the Red Sox World Series win that year, after shooting her in the eye with an F.N. Model 303 , which uses compressed air to fire riot control projectiles. An investigation later determined that the officer was not properly trained to use that weapon. PSCO continues to deploy tasers and pepper spray as less-than-lethal options for its deputies. Critics have raised questions about possible risks to suspects from employing these weapons , as well as whether they lower the threshold for the use for force, to begin with. The ostensible goal, of course, of all of these less-lethal options, is to offer law enforcement personnel a practical alternative to using lethal force. These debates are unlikely to be settled soon, though various law enforcement agencies are now reviewing their use of less-than-lethal weapons. But at least when it comes to the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office and its relatively exotic “traumatic pistols,” it had already been decided that it didn’t want its deputies carrying them on routine patrols.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As tensions in the Pacific Theater continue to increase, the U.S. military is flexing its muscles and reminding its potential enemies that it can reach out over vast distances and put boots on the ground on an island within a very short amount of time. Case in point, an emergency deployment readiness exercise that just saw paratroopers from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division out of Alaska descend onto Guam via airdrop from C-17 Globemaster III transports. The airborne assault mission covered nearly 5,000 miles on its inbound leg from Elmendorf Air Force Base outside of Anchorage to Andersen Air Force Base on the northern tip of the island of Guam. According to an Air Force release , 400 paratroopers were included in the mission, which made it the “largest airborne operation here in recent history.” USAF At least five C-17s were used in the operation, with the paratroopers gearing-up with their parachutes and combat gear while en route to the highly remote drop site. Arriving over their target in the early morning hours on June 30th, 2020, the paratroopers jumped from the C-17s and went about securing the massive airfield at Andersen Air Force Base in a mock raid. The members of the 4th Brigade’s 3rd Battalion, 509th Infantry only had a couple of days warning before the mission went down, which gave the training evolution a very real-world spin. After the assault was successful, those involved prepared to return back to Alaska. Colonel Christopher Landers, the commander of the 4th Brigade’s commander who led the mission who let the mission stated the following about its utility: “This scenario tested our ability to execute real-world missions and demonstrated that we are capable of deploying anywhere in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area at a moment’s notice.” USAF While seizing airfields and other contested locales to create a bridgehead for follow-on forces is a historic staple of airborne forces, this unique training event serves as a clear warning to a number of potential foes, but mainly China . That country’s increasingly militarized man-made island outposts scattered throughout the South China Sea remain a sore point of contention between its neighbors and the United States. The idea that the U.S. military can range-out many thousands of miles across the Pacific to insert troops onto an island has a far wider application though. The Pentagon is remodeling parts of its fighting doctrine for austere expeditionary warfare throughout the Pacific. This can include taking small, unimproved landmasses and staging operations from them, which can involve building or rehabilitating airfields , installing defenses, and setting-up facilities to sustain personnel, even if it is just used for a short time before moving on. The security that airborne troops could rapidly provide, at least before other defenses are put in place, could be critical to those operations. The fact that they can be deployed very quickly, without the use of a ship, is even more attractive. USAF In other words, this capability could be essential in just getting to be able to eventually move U.S. forces into a position where they can begin to think about reaching out and dealing with fixed Chinese installations closer to their own shores. This is just the reality of the anti-access, area-denial (A2AD) bubble that China continues to assemble, with the idea of keeping U.S. forces hundreds, if not thousands of miles from Chinese shores, at least during the early stages of a conflict, being its main objective. With all this in mind, it’s very likely that we will be seeing a lot more of American paratroopers showing up over remote Pacific islands in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 23, 2021",Air Force Hits Major Snags With Fighter And Missile Defense Airborne Laser Initiatives,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it has pushed back the schedule for beginning flight testing of a podded laser directed energy weapon intended to protect fighter jets and other aircraft from incoming missiles by two years to 2023. The delay is the result of technical difficulties combined with general slowdowns in work due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It also follows the disclosure of issues with a separate airborne laser weapon system program intended for missile defense. Defense News was first to publish the latest details on the Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) program, following an interview with the project’s manager, Jeff Heggemeier, on June 10, 2020. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has been working on SHiELD since at least 2013. It awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin the following year to develop the solid-state laser itself, while Northrop Grumman and Boeing subsequently got deals to work on the beam control system and the pod, respectively. The Air Force had originally planned to begin flight testing of a complete prototype system on a fighter jet in 2021. “This is a really complex technology to try to integrate into that flight environment, and that’s ultimately what we’re trying to do with this program, is demonstrate that laser technology is mature enough to be able to integrate onto that airborne platform,” Heggemeier explained to Defense News . “But even things like COVID, and COVID shutting down the economy. That has impacts.” Heggemeier did not go into great detail about the technical issues that the program is apparently experiencing. Last year, the Air Force, in cooperation with Lockheed Martin, successfully used a ground-based solid-state laser known as the Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS) as a surrogate for SHiELD to shoot down a number of air-launched missiles over White Sands Missile Range in News Mexico. The Demonstrator Laser Weapon System., USAF The exact power class of the DLWS’ laser is unknown, but Heggemeier told Defense News it was in the “tens of kilowatts,” adding that “it turns out the DLWS system, when you take everything into account, is a really good surrogate for the laser power on SHiELD.” By the time of the White Sands tests, Lockheed Martin had already delivered a 60-kilowatt-class laser weapon system to the U.S. Army. In 2019, the Air Force also flight-tested a pod with the same shape as the one Boeing is developing for SHiELD to gather basic data on how the stresses of flight impact it and the aircraft carrying it. Heggemeier did not say what type of aircraft carried the pod during those tests, but Air Force Magazine had previously reported that a variant of the F-15 family had been slated to carry the complete prototype system. A briefing slide showing the projected schedule for airborne laser directed energy weapon development as of 2014., USAF Heggemeier offered no specific updates on the beam control system or any other components that might be the source of the technical delays. However, “a lot of the challenge is trying to get all of this stuff into this small pod,” he said. “If you look at other lasers that are fairly mature, we have other laser systems that some other contractors have built that are ready to be deployed ,” he continued. “But these are ground-based systems , and they are much, much more mature.” It is worth noting, however, that the Army flight-tested a podded solid-state laser from Raytheon on an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter in 2017. AFRL, together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Lockheed Martin, also tested a turreted laser on a modified Dassault Falcon 10 business jet as part of the Aero-Adaptive, Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program, which focused on advanced adaptive focusing and stabilization capabilities, in 2014. “I think it’s important for us to first remember what the whole point of SHiELD is. The whole point of SHiELD is not an acquisition program where we’re turning out hundreds or tens of these laser systems for operational use,” Heggemeier said. “What we’re trying to do with SHiELD is exactly answer those questions of: ‘Is laser technology mature enough to go on an airborne platform? Have we solved enough of those technical challenges that this is now a feasible thing?’ Because there is that concern.” The delays for the SHiELD program also comes amid concerns about another effort to develop a solid-state airborne laser weapon system capable of shooting down ballistic missiles during the initial boost phase of flight. That is when those missiles are at their slowest and their rocket motors are burning brightly, meaning they’re more vulnerable to attack and easier to track. The plan had been to put this directed energy weapon on a drone to reduce the risks associated with getting close enough to a launch site, which could be deep inside heavily defended enemy territory, to actually carry out such an attack. “As a weapon system to equip an airplane with the lasers we think necessary in terms of their power level …and get them to altitudes where atmospheric turbulence can be mitigated appropriately, that combination of things can’t go on one platform,” Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin said in May . “I’m extremely skeptical that we can put a large laser on an aircraft and use it to shoot down an adversary missile even from very close.” The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) had been running a Low Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) program as a risk reduction effort for this concept, which is set to end this year. Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and friend of the War Zone Steve Trimble reported on June 30 that MDA now plans to transition that project to the High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative. That effort “appears focused on surface-based systems but includes options for airborne tech,” he explained on Twitter. “State-of-the-art power to weight ratio for HEL tech now is 1:30. So 1kW requires 30lb to product [sic; produce],” Trimble wrote in another Tweet. “Airborne systems need to be around 1:2-3. And scaled-up to 500kW-1MW. And capable of 60,000ft altitude.” All told, there has definitely been a noticeable shift in the U.S. military’s tone with regards to airborne laser weapon systems, in general, from upbeat to more reserved in recent months, even from historically outspoken advocates for the technology, such as Griffin. This skepticism doesn’t seem to apply to work on sea and land-based laser weapons . The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, along with his deputy, Lisa Porter, tendered their resignations last week for unclear reasons, but which might be tied to Congressional complaints about the handling of other missile defense programs . “You’re not talking about these really, really long ranges. You’re talking about a shorter range and different targets just to protect yourself or your wingman,” Heggemeier said, referring to projects such as the LPLD versus SHiELD. “Missile defense can mean a lot of things. Some of those missile defense missions are very, very hard, and some of them aren’t quite so hard.” It remains to be seen what category SHiELD will ultimately fall into as work continues on the prototype podded system in the next few years.

Three general mission sets define the fleet and the experience of the crews that man it. As such, the experience of serving on a boat that services one mission set can vary drastically from doing so on one that services another. There is a unique culture, esprit de corps, and tempo to each that isn’t often referenced or explained, but it is visceral to anyone who has been part of America’s modern ‘silent service.’ In a follow-up to our recent look into the eccentric characters you will find aboard a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine and the culture that permeates such a unique profession, here are the cultural differences between serving aboard SSNs, SSBNs, and the rare and elite SSGN. The Nuclear Fast Attack Submarine (SSN): Chaotic Readiness The fast-paced world of the nuclear attack submarine is the most rewarding for a sailor who wants to travel the world and likes a rush. If something needs to happen quietly, the U.S. Navy sends in the ‘attack’ nuclear submarine, the SSN, a force that is currently made up of Virginia , Seawolf , and Los Angeles class boats. A Los Angeles attack class submarine pulls into port. , USN For instance, during the collapse of the Soviet Union, the White House needed real-time reports on the deployments of Russian ballistic missile submarines . It was too provocative to send a destroyer squadron into the Barents Sea or park a carrier group off the Kamchatka Peninsula . Beneath the waves, American nuclear submarines watched their adversary transit in and out of port, counting ship movements and reporting daily activity back to the Pentagon, who briefed the president every morning. This kind of rapid response platform has a culture centered around readiness. The SSN is always on the firing line in port, at sea, and on the station. It can receive mission tasking at any time and it must respond. On the attack boats I was on, mission tasking kicked up the adrenaline level a little and an extra bit of excitement moved throughout the officers and enlisted crew when time-sensitive orders came. Loading torpedoes on the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Albany ., USN The SSN schedule is dynamic. Long term milestones, such as drydock refit and nuclear refueling, are planned out years in advance and generally are not changed. Mid-term goals, like nuclear safety inspections and tactical readiness evaluations, are on an annual rotation, but they are a little flexible as to when they begin. Short term events, such as weapons loading and diesel maintenance, are crammed into availability slots during brief in-port periods. As an example, in 1992, we had pulled into port on a Friday afternoon and had a Monday morning underway planned. The submarine’s diesel engine needed critical maintenance that required ripping it apart. A nuclear submarine cannot go to sea without a backup mode of power, the diesel engine. With the Captain’s blessing, the A-gangers began tearing down the Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine shortly after we secured the mooring lines. They worked around the clock all weekend. By the time I returned with a fresh sea bag over my shoulder that Monday, from the parking lot I could see the thick white exhaust of a diesel engine running. That is the level of hard work and service I witnessed in the American fast attack submarine community. The crew sacrificed what little time they had in port to ensure we could go to sea if called upon to do so. A Los Angeles class attack submarine crewman surveys a carrier strike group with binoculars. , USN This forces division leaders to communicate both up and down the chain of command to ensure maintenance and evolutions don’t conflict. The young petty officer in sonar needs to test the sonar . The weapons officer needs torpedoes loaded . The engineering officer needs a pure water truck on the pier. The radio room needs a communication mast pulled and taken to the shop. Meanwhile, divers are working over the side. This is just another day in port for the SSN crew. Understanding what evolutions have priority and supporting the goal of getting the boat ready for sea as a crew instead of just as an individual who needs to complete his or her maintenance tasks adds to the comradery of the unit. When all the evolutions are complete and department heads can report to the Captain their sub is mission-ready, there is a great sense of pride and accomplishment because that doesn’t just happen on its own. The crew worked together to make it happen. Within the SSN community, there are special operations boats . These commands are specially trained and outfitted with unique equipment to conduct high-risk missions. Their deployments are highly sensitive and important to America’s senior military leaders. Diplomatic and military actions are determined by the success of special operation submarine commands. The highly secretive and extensively modified USS Jimmy Carter , the last of the Seawolf class, flying a jolly roger after completing a high-stakes mission., USN When the SSN sailor does get some time off, they tend to get a little wild in liberty ports. Most sailors will spend the day visiting whatever tourist trap and restaurant is near the pier. But after hours, it’s game on. Nightclub hopping and drinking with your watch section is common in a port where you don’t speak the language. I have shared many an evening with the Fire Control Technician from my watch section. Underway, we were steely-eyed hunters of the deep. In port, we generously over tipped the dancing girls and drained pitchers of beer to German-techno music. Most important, we made sure we both made it back to the boat for underway the next morning. In the control room of the Virginia class attack submarine USS Colorado. , USN SSN sailors take great pride in what they do. They have a ‘work hard, play hard’ culture . With long times away from homeport and always being pushed to the front of the firing line, attack boat sailors have an elevated sense of self-worth. With mottos like, ”ain’t no slack in a fast attack” and “fast attack, don’t come back (to homeport),” and “ain’t no pride in a Trident (SSBN) ride,” the sense of being part of something elite is certainly there. Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN): A Routine Lifestyle Schedule and routine are the order of the day in the nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) world. We don’t like surprises when dealing with nuclear weapons. This makes SSBN culture the polar opposite of SSN culture. It is very top-down coordinated from the squadron level. When a sailor reports to their first SSBN command, they know every underway, refit, dry dock, nuclear, and tactical inspection scheduled for the next four years. Divisions can work much more autonomously in regards to routine maintenance because everyone knows the days and times when they can’t do something. So, it’s just a matter of filling in the blanks with evolutions you can do. USS Pennsylvania pulls into her home port. , USN A typical SSN deployment will last six or seven months and visit a port every few weeks, but the underway time between port visits are usually longer on the SSBN, 70 to 80 days. However, the in-port time is much higher for SSN crews because you share the SSBN submarine with a second crew! Each United States Navy SSBN has a Blue and a Gold crew. While one crew is underway for 70 or more days, the other crew is shore-based, training. This kind of rotation gives the sailor a more routine lifestyle that is better for a family than any other command in the U.S. Navy. An SSBN sailor has more opportunity to spend time with loved ones and attend college. In fact, many SSBN commands have extracurricular events only seen in commands ashore, like softball and bowling teams. While the benefits are great, they come at a cost. An SSBN patrol is about three months of mundane routine and order. A typical day for a sailor on an SSBN is to wake up, shower, and eat whatever meal is served. They spend the next six hours standing their watch. For some, that is watching the missile tubes, checking temperatures, and pressures. For others, it’s making sure the reactor power is the same as it was the last watch because you’ve been going five knots to nowhere for weeks and you lost track of what month it is. “Sherwood Forest,” the space containing the Ohio class’s 24 Trident SLBMs. , DoD After your watch, you eat again. Then there is usually one hour of cleaning in the spaces that you are responsible for and general areas like passageways. Sometimes there is formal training, but there is always a qualification to work on and studying to do during this time. After the watch, cleaning, drills, a shower, and training, it is time for a workout, burn a flick (watch a movie), and sleep. That routine is repeated every 18 hours for months on end. The SSBN is endlessly punching holes in the ocean day after day in some of the most remote places on earth, away from all prying eyes, satellites, shipping lanes, and most importantly, far from other submarines. The SSBN crew is tactically passive by nature. They have an enormous responsibility in shepherding potentially hundreds of nuclear warheads away from detection while maintaining a high state of readiness. Their retaliatory nuclear strike mission is a mental burden. Trident D5 missile launch from an Ohio class SSBN. , USN Every SSBN sailor is aware of the awesome responsibility they have but it is rarely discussed. Having the nation’s nuclear trigger within arm’s reach is a surreal experience and it will change your perspective on war forever. SSBN crews train very hard to do a mission they hope to never have to execute. They simply prowl the quiet corners of the ocean receiving continuous communications to be ready to launch. Nuclear Guided Missile Submarine (SSGN): The Admiral’s New Toy After 1994’s Nuclear Posture Review and the years of experimentation and testing that followed, four Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines began conversion to nuclear guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) . These multi-role boats could sling 154 tomahawk missiles, carry 66 SEAL team members, and have enough communications equipment for a command ship. They became the hottest boats to be on in the submarine service. The guided-missile submarine USS Florida (SSGN 728) departs Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Greece, May 24, 2013, following a routine port visit. The Florida was underway in the U.S. 6th Fleet area of responsibility conducting maritime security operations and theater security cooperation efforts., USN The American SSGN boats stay forward-deployed in Guam and Diego Garcia, but have as much underway time as the SSBNs. The SSGN combines the stealth capability of a ballistic missile submarine, because that is what they were originally, with the capacity for a massive tactical weapons strike, covert SEAL team insertion and extraction, and signals intelligence gathering. These versatile submarines receive a lot of attention from above the squadron level and their presence in a theatre impacts both diplomatic and military maneuvers. A single SSGN will typically have about half the tactical missile strike capability of the entire naval task force. She is like being the queen of the naval chessboard. She is rare, precious, and powerful. The SSGN’s top-down, action-oriented command style breeds a strong sense of self-worth in the crew. Her complement of sailors and officers have an immense amount of pride in the mission and the ability to complete the most challenging tasks that come out of the Pentagon. Because the staffing orders to an SSGN are in high demand, they are filled with some of the best graduates out of the naval academy, nuclear power school, and other enlisted training pipelines. Even the new junior sailors have already proven themselves to the best among their peers before stepping on board. USS Ohio during her conversion from SSBN to SSGN in the mid-2000s., USN The rewards are two-fold: exciting tactical missions like launching 100 Tomahawk missiles into Libya in 2011 during Operation Odyssey Dawn , intelligence gathering near the coast of unsuspecting nations like an SSN, delivering and extracting special forces teams. They also have two crews, Blue and Gold, each with an off-crew training period like the SSBN. The SSGN crew makes an attack boat sailor look humble. SSGNs have the spotlight on them all time from senior Navy staff because of their mission and capability. They are expected to perform and succeed in critical areas around the globe. This leads to aggressive confidence bordering on hubris, but that is exactly the mentality required to execute the mission. All said, the SSGNs enjoy the best of all other submarine benefits in one command. At the conn aboard the SSGN USS Florida . , USN The United States submarine force has something for anyone wanting to serve. If you are looking to do some of the most exciting things you will ever do in your life, but never talk about, volunteer for SSGN or SSN duty. If you want to go to college for free and start a family, SSBN life is your ticket. No matter what style of submarine service you prefer, being a submariner will be the most challenging and rewarding thing you will ever do. Aaron Amick is a retired U.S. Navy submarine sonarman.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 25, 2021",Here’s Who’s In The Running To Build The Royal Air Force’s First Loyal Wingman Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense plans to pick at least one of three competing designs in the next few months to proceed to the flight test phase of its program to develop loyal wingman-type drone prototypes. The goal of this effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost unmanned aircraft that could potentially work together with the country’s Eurofighter Typhoons and F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , as well as a future stealth fighter jet in the works now under the separate Tempest project . FlightGlobal was first to report on the latest developments with regards to Project Mosquito, a technology demonstration effort within the larger Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) program, on June 30, 2020. The U.K.’s Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), an executive agency of the country’s Ministry of Defense, is leading both of these projects. “We anticipate being able to announce the results of the phase 2 evaluation later in the summer,” Peter Stockel, the lead official for Dstl’s Autonomous Systems and Innovation Autonomy Challenge, told FlightGlobal . Stockel added that all three entrants in the first phase – Boeing, a Blue Bear Systems Research-led team, and another partnership called Black Dawn, which includes the Belfast division of Bombardier Aerospace and Northrop Grumman U.K. – had submitted proposals for the second phase of the project. Dstl has left open the possibility that it could award new contracts to more than one of these contenders. None of the firms have revealed details about their prospective drone concepts, which they were contracted to be refined during the first phase of the program, which began last year. In July 2019, the U.K. Royal Air Force’s (RAF) Rapid Capabilities Office, together with Dstl, displayed models representing a notional design at that year’s Royal International Air Tattoo. Models of notional LANCA drones seen on display at the 2019 Royal International Air Tattoo., Dstl The models featured a relatively narrow fuselage with swept wings and a v-tail. It appeared to have some low-observable (stealthy) features, including a top-mounted air intake with an angled front edge, chine line that bisects the upper and low fuselage, and a shrouded exhaust. This was a somewhat more simplistic design than the ones previously featured in concept art that the U.K. Ministry of Defense had previously released for the LANCA program, which first emerged publicly in 2017. Earlier LANCA concept art., Dstl It’s worth noting that Boeing’s Australian division is already well into the prototype stage of development of a loyal wingman-type drone for the Royal Australian Air Force as part of that country’s Airpower Teaming System program, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . It is very possible, if not probable, that that work has informed the company’s proposal for the second phase of Project Mosquito. In addition, American drone-maker Kratos is curiously absent from the competition. This is the company behind the U.S. Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, which that service is already experimenting with as a possible loyal wingman , as well as an unmanned platform to take on other roles, such as communications relay . Kratos has already sold target drones to the U.K. military, as well. The LANCA program’s primary overarching goal is to develop and acquire a fleet of “attritable” drones that would operate primarily together with manned aircraft, such as the Typhoon , the F-35B or future Tempest , but could ultimately operate individually or in autonomous swarms. Attritable means that the unmanned aircraft would be reusable, but low-cost enough that commanders would still be comfortable using them for higher-risk missions where there might be a greater chance that they would not survive. An infographic about the still very early in development Tempest fighter jet, which indicates that this aircraft could potentially be pilot-optional itself., BAE Systems The LANCA drones are also expected to have modular designs allowing them to be readily configured to perform various roles, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and strike missions. The use of open-architecture systems would also allow for the rapid integration of new and improved capabilities and functionality in the future. The core idea is that these unmanned aircraft would give the RAF significant additional aerial combat capacity at a relatively low cost, a principle that Project Mosquito is meant to demonstrate. This program is one of a number of advanced unmanned aircraft efforts the U.K. Ministry of Defense is pursuing, which also include a project focused on developing swarms of smaller drones. The RAF is also working to stand up a dedicated drone development unit , 216 Squadron, but this has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s possible that LANCA, and the fielding of any loyal wingman-type drones it produces, could serve as a stepping stone in the broader integration of increasingly more capable unmanned aircraft in the RAF and other elements of the U.K. armed forces. U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems has already spent some 15 years working on Taranis , a testbed for a much more advanced fully-autonomous and very low observable unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). In the past, the plan for Taranis-derived UCAV to enter service sometime after 2030. This sort of tiered development process is very similar to drone efforts that a number of other countries, especially the United States , are also pursuing. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, has a number of major unmanned aircraft and autonomous flight system programs in the works now, including its Skyborg project , which is looking to develop a suite of artificial intelligence-driven flight systems to fly semi-autonomous loyal wingman-type drones and possibly even full-size UCAVs. The European Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program, which is focused primarily on the development of a manned stealth fighter, is also set to include work on “ remote carriers ,” another term for loyal wingman-type drones. France, a member of the FCAS program, also continues to test the nEUROn UCAV demonstrator , which is similar in form and function to the BAE Taranis. An FCAS infographic that includes mention of the development of associated “remote carrier” drones., Airbus By comparison, Dstl hopes to have the Project Mosquito demonstrators flying by 2022. “We have asked that demonstration system flights are delivered using full-scale vehicles,” Dstl’s Stockel told FlightGlobal , though he did say that companies would be free to use sub-scale test articles for risk-reduction purposes. This has been common in similar efforts . Phase 2 of this project is supposed to be completed entirely by 2023. It’s possible that, depending on the outcome, the effort could then transition to the development of a more robust, production-ready design for actual operational use. Whatever the case, hopefully after the U.K. Ministry of Defense picks the design or designs it wants to move to the flight test phase, we will get a look at what could be the basis for the RAF’s first loyal wingman drones.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 20, 2020",Check Out The Blue Angels’ New Fat Albert C-130J In All Its Glory,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels have finally given us our first full look at the ex-Royal Air Force C-130J Hercules that will take on the role of Fat Albert . The flight demonstration team teased the arrival of this aircraft and its new paint scheme, which will replace the already retired C-130T that they had previously used as their squadron transport and in their performances, earlier this year. The Blue Angels released the picture of their latest Fat Albert on their Facebook page on June 30, 2020. The aircraft is presently at Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group’s facility at Cambridge City Airport in the United Kingdom, where it is undergoing final fit checks. “Over the next few weeks, team members will conduct a series of maintenance tests, which include an aircraft systems operational check out and a functional check flight, prior to completing the transatlantic flight to the United States,” the accompanying Facebook post says. “#BAFans you will notice a couple changes to the paint scheme. The flight surfaces now have yellow tips, similar to our F/A-18s, 2 stripes run down the side of the aircraft and the iconic white top has been changed to a tear drop design.” Some of those changes had already been visible in the images that the Blue Angels had released of the aircraft back in March . In contrast to the scheme used on the previous C-130T, this aircraft’s aircraft’s paint scheme also has the name of the team written in gold lettering rather than blue and a pair of gold stripes in place of a single thicker one. The Blue Angels’ previous C-130T-based Fat Albert., Cory W. Watts via Wikimedia “This C-130J model will provide improved logistics support and eventually join the Blue Angels demonstration!” the Facebook post also notes. The team has been without a Fat Albert, which also serves as their dedicated transport from show to show, for more than a year now . Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic has also, unfortunately, severely curtailed their show season for this year, though they did take part in flyovers across the country in support of first responders, healthcare workers, and other individuals on the front lines that crisis. The Navy formally acquired this ex-U.K. Royal Air Force C-130J as the Blue Angels next Fat Albert in 2019 at the cost of around $29.7 million. The U.K. Ministry of Defense had previously decided to retire all of the RAF’s short-fuselage J models, which that service had designated Hercules C5s, based on the recommendations of the country’s 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review. It has now revised that plan to retain one of the Hercules C5s through at least 2021. The RAF will also continue to fly 14 long-fuselage C-130J-30s, which it calls Hercules C4s. It remains uncertain, especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when the Blue Angels’ latest Fat Albert will make its public debut. “Please note that our team is practicing social distancing and taking every precaution to maintain mission readiness. Stay safe!” the team’s Facebook posted said. Regardless, it’s exciting to finally get a glimpse of the aircraft in its new paint scheme and hopefully it won’t be too long before people get to see it up close.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2020",Mysterious Wave Glider Spotted Off Florida Keys Had Electronic Intel Gathering System (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week, boaters sailing off the Florida Keys caught sight of an unusual small unmanned surface vessel festooned with antennas. By every indication, the craft appears to be Wave Glider from Liquid Robotics, which is now a division of Boeing. Its configuration, including a prominent antenna array associated with electronic intelligence-gathering systems, points to its involvement in one of a number of persistent maritime surveillance projects, which have been a growing area of interest for the U.S. military, and for the U.S. Navy in particular , in recent years. FishMonster Magazine , which is “all about the fishing, diving and boating lifestyle in the Florida Keys, Cuba and the Bahamas,” posted the video on its Facebook page on June 24, 2020. Captain Marlin Scott narrates the video from his boat, the Premium Time , which operates as part of FishMonster Charters . “I have no idea what it is,” Scott says in the video. “Its got transponders on it. It looks like its got antennas.” Our friend H.I. Sutton, an expert on all things that sail under the waves, was first to identify the underlying craft as most likely a Liquid Robotics Wave Glider. The “float” seen bobbing the surface is just one part of the complete system and is linked via a 26-foot-long cable to another one underwater. The momentum of the currents propels the underwater float, pulling the entire system along. In the case of Liquid Robotics’ design, the float on the surface also has solar panels that can provide power to a small motor to provide auxiliary propulsion, if necessary. The video below shows how the basic design works. The example that Captain Scott and his passengers spotted off the Keys has a number of features that do not appear on any of the Wave Gliders in any of Liquid Robotics promotional materials. Most notably, it has an antenna array mounted on an x-shaped frame fitted to the top of the float on the surface. A closer look at the Wave Glider spotted off Key West., via H.I. Sutton This type of antenna is most commonly associated with relatively compact electronic support measures and signals intelligence systems with direction-finding capabilities. The U.S. military employs a number of systems that use these types of antennas, including the U.S. Army’s man-portable Wolfhound signals intelligence system . Members of the US Army hold antennas associated with the Wolfhound system during a training event in Afghanistan., US Army There is also a circular, dome-shaped antenna toward the rear of the float, which could house a satellite communications system or some form of tracking transponder . A satellite communication system would allow the craft to transmit whatever data it is collecting to other locations for additional processing and to simply allow for remote monitoring. A transponder would also allow personnel elsewhere to keep tabs on the status of the Wave Glider. Other thin whip antennas and protrusions, which might also hold antennas, are visible, as is what appears to be the float’s solar panel. There are no features that clearly identify the craft’s owner, its specific purpose, or whether or not this is part of a test or experiment. However, the configuration very likely point’s a military operator and mission. Forbes noted that at least as early as 2011, the U.S. Navy had announced plans to use Liquid Robotics’ Wave Glider as part of its Sensor Hosting Autonomous Research Craft (SHARC) program together with a Towed Integrated “L” (TAIL) acoustic sensor array. The manufacturer has also highlighted how the unmanned craft can carry and deploy small towed sonar arrays, as well. The goal of the SHARC effort is to “provide the fleet with a low cost, asymmetric advantage in support of multiple classified missions,” according to the Navy’s most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, the relevant portions of which are seen below. “This includes persistent, autonomous situational awareness and early warning of submarines or related submarine activity in potential support of TASWO/TRAPS as well as broad area, clandestine implementation of capabilities that enhance Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) and strike missions.” USN USN USN “TASWO/TRAPS” is “Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations/Transformational Reliable Acoustic Path System. TRAPS is a network of fixed passive sonar nodes that lie on the seabed, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The Navy also uses underwater gliders to support the TRAPS network, as well as perform other missions, such as oceanographic surveys. China notably briefly seized one of those undersea drones, which it might have believed was conducting intelligence-gathering or surveillance operations, in the South China Sea in 2016. “Obtain six (6) SHARC platforms, payload systems, and associated subsystems for priority IPB Prototype,” is one of the SHARC program goals for the current 2020 Fiscal Year, according to those same budget documents. “Complete payload adaptation design for classified Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) mission” and “Conduct integration on SHARC, with functional lab and at-sea testing followed by mission equivalent demonstration.” are also listed on the agenda for this fiscal cycle. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield typically involves collecting various types of information about the disposition and capabilities of expected enemy forces in the area of interest. This would include using electronic support measures and signals intelligence systems to spot, classify, and geolocate hostile emitters to help build an “ electronic order of battle ” of hostile units. It’s also worth noting that Liquid Robotics proposed using its Wave Gliders configured with various sensors and communications systems to support the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Ocean of Things program . DARPA first unveiled this project in 2017. “DARPA’s Oceans of Things program seeks to enable persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas by deploying thousands of small, low-cost floats that form a distributed sensor network,” according to the official project page. “Each smart float contains a suite of commercially available sensors to collect environmental data – such as sea surface temperature, sea state, and location – as well as activity data about commercial vessels, aircraft, and even maritime mammals moving through the area. The floats transmit data periodically via satellite to a cloud network for storage and real-time analysis.” Liquid Robotics has dubbed its particular concept for providing this persistent surveillance and situational awareness capability as The Digital Ocean . However, the Wave Gliders it depicts as supporting this effort in concept art and videos, or the ones that it has actually tested in environmental surveillance roles, are not configured in the same way as the one seen off the Florida Keys. Whatever the exact intended use of this particular Wave Glider is and what project it is a part of, the value of using networked groups of craft like this as low-cost distributed sensor and communications relay nodes is clear. One of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. military today is how to realistically maintain even basic situational awareness of what is going on above and below the waves across broad swathes of ocean, especially in the Pacific region, as well as in congested and complex littoral areas . SHARC and the Ocean of Things are just some of the projects aimed at finding solutions to these and adjacent problems. Other known programs in the works along similar lines include rapidly-deployable, but powerful containerized sonar arrays – a test of which led Croatian fisherman to recover another mysterious maritime object earlier this year that turned out to be Navy property – and a tangential DARPA effort to explore using changes in the behavior of fish and other marine life to identify the presence of enemy submarines. The Navy is also testing its Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessel a larger persistent maritime surveillance platform with a particular focus on anti-submarine warfare. Sea Hunter started as a DARPA project known as the Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel, or ACTUV. Sea Hunter is also slated to take on additional roles in the future and the Navy is trying to expand its unmanned surface and underwater fleets and have them take on more and more missions, in general. A large number of Wave Gliders equipped with even basic sonar and acoustic sensors and operating autonomously could provide an additional useful layer of information and spot underwater objects of interest for further investigation by more capable anti-submarine platforms. They have the benefit of being virtually silent and otherwise small and hard to detect themselves. With other sensors, such as electronic support measures and signals intelligence suites, they could gather additional information about surface vessels, aircraft, or even targets along the shoreline. Wave Gliders with multiple systems or groups of them in different configurations could be deployed as multi-purpose networked maritime surveillance arrays providing a breadth of useful information for military and civilian purposes . Even just a number of wave gliders spread out over a large area and equipped with a similar ESM suite could not only detect and track relevant radio frequency emissions, but by fusing their data together at a central remote hub that may be located thousands of miles away, they could geolocate those emissions with great accuracy. You can imagine how useful this could be for monitoring air and surface radio communications and RF sensor traffic over a huge swathe of ocean. It represents a remarkably cheap and persistent alternative to other platforms that wouldn’t benefit from the distributed nature of these wave gliders. Liquid Robotics says the craft can operate for up to 12 months at a time with little to no maintenance. Lost Wave Gliders could be replaced relatively quickly and cheaply. This would also mean they could be easy to deploy into choke points or other areas of interest on short notice, as necessary. This will be important for operating in increasingly contested areas , such as the South China Sea . The reality is that if they were networked together, even in a rudimentary fashion, others could adapt to best optimize their position if one is lost. In essence, the same tenets of aerial unmanned swarm warfare cross over to the unmanned surface vehicle space. We are in the process of reaching out to Liquid Robotics and the Navy to hopefully get more information about this particular Wave Glider and its purpose and capabilities. We will be sure to follow up if we learn anything new about this craft, could have exciting future implications for persistent surveillance of the world’s waterways. UPDATE: Thanks to @Johann_U96 we have absolute confirmation that this wave glider does indeed carry an electronic intelligence package that is pretty much exactly as we postulated above. It is built by ThayerMahan, a Grotton, Connecticut-based defense contractor. It is called SeaWatch and is described by the company as such: The SeaWatch system consists of an autonomous electronic surveillance package mounted on an autonomous surface vessel. Its purpose is to provide a long dwell maritime capability to detect electronic emissions related to illicit maritime activity. SeaWatch detects emissions that are either too weak to be picked up by more distant means, and also assists in localizing emissions by providing additional bearings from a different aspect relative to the emittor. Utilizing off-the-shelf equipment, internal development, and strategic partnerships, ThayerMahan has developed a system to continuously monitor the seas for RF activity. The ultra-endurance unmanned surface vehicle that hosts the payload, allows for self-sustained mission times of 90 days or greater. This monitoring, combined with the DF software, allows for an effective means to track down and intercept targets of interest. A user-friendly interface allows for the active tracking of multiple RF bands at once and access to recorded transmissions all on the same screen. Activity of interest is recorded and stored for further analysis, even with no active user monitoring the interface.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2021",Army Releases Ultra Rare Video Showing Green Berets Training In Taiwan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An official video from the U.S. Army’s 1st Special Forces Group has offered a rare look at Green Berets training on the island of Taiwan. The unusual release comes at a time when authorities in Taipei are looking to further distance themselves from the mainland government in Beijing, which has prompted threats from Chinese officials. In addition, the U.S. government has increasingly shown its support for Taiwan in more visible ways, including sending warships and aircraft through the Taiwan Strait and approving significant arms sales to the Taiwanese military. The 1st Special Forces Group first posted the short motivational video, titled “Excellence,” on its official Facebook page on June 16, 2020, and it remains up and prominently featured there at the time of writing. One segment notably shows Green Berets carrying a mock casualty to what is clearly a Taiwanese Army UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter, which is readily identifiable by the blue and white insignia on the tail boom. In another clip, an individual is seen holding a Type 91 assault rifle , the standard individual arm of the Taiwanese military. On June 29, the Chinese language Lianhe Zaobao newspaper in Singapore reported that the U.S. military had confirmed that the video shows Green Berets taking part in an exercise nicknamed Balance Tamper in Taiwan. A Taiwanese Army special operations unit, the 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion , also known as the Sea Dragon Frogmen, which is analogous to the U.S. Navy SEALs, also reportedly participated. 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group is forwarded deployed on the Japanese island of Okinawa and is assigned to Special Operations Command Pacific (SOCPAC). The rest of the group is based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State, but is also focused on the Pacific region. Lianhe Zaobao did not offer any additional specific details about the exercise, but “Balance” is a so-called “first word” that SOCPAC uses for ground-focused Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) events that U.S. Army Special Forces conduct throughout the Pacific region with allied and partner units, including foreign special operators. The War Zone is aware of at least 13 other exercises in the Balance series that occur regularly or semi-regularly involving Australia (Balance Action), Bangladesh (Balance Buffalo), India (Balance Iroquois), Malaysia (Balance Mint), the Maldives (Balance Metal), Mauritius (Balance Monk), Mongolia (Balance Magic), Nepal (Balance Nail), New Zealand (Balance Net), the Philippines (Balance Piston), South Korea (Balance Knife), Thailand (Balance Torch), and Vanuatu (Balance Velvet). SOCPAC also routinely sends Air Force and Navy special operators to various countries to conduct air and maritime-focused JCETs, with those exercises beginning with the first words “Teak” and “Flash,” respectively. A member of the US Army’s 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group works with a member of the Royal Thai Armed Forces during Balance Torch 16-2 in 2016., US Army JCETs provide a relatively low-impact way for U.S. special operators to train and train with foreign allies and partners that might work with during future military or humanitarian assistance operations. A typical JCET deployment is under 100 personnel, and usually closer to between 10 and 40 individuals. These small exercises usually focus on relatively general skill sets, such as small unit tactics , nighttime parachute jumping , and casualty management and other medical skills. JCETs in many ways mirror what U.S. special operators, especially Green Berets, are expected to do in an operational context with regards to training and otherwise working alongside local forces, including behind enemy lines as part unconventional warfare campaigns during a major conflict. Beyond that, they are often combined with civil engagements, such as pop-up health and dental clinics for locals near where the exercise is taking place, providing a soft-power component that promotes the general interests of the United States. A member of the Royal Thai Air Forces parachutes down in front of US Air Force Special Operators during a Teak Torch JCET in 2008., USAF The “Excellence” video actually includes an audio clip that sounds very reminiscent of official films and television news reports from the 1950s and 1960s about America’s then-new Special Forces. “There are no Marquess of Queensberry rules in guerrilla warfare,” the narrator says. “It’s a simple matter of kill or be killed. Capture or be captured.” It’s not clear how long the Balance Tamper exercises have been going on. U.S. special operations forces did deploy in some capacity to Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong, in 2016. The U.S. military had maintained a significant presence on Taiwan through the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command , which included a resident detachment of Army Special Forces, until 1979. That year, the U.S. government officially recognized the regime in Beijing as the sole government of China. However, that same year, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the U.S. government continues to engage with and provide for Taiwan’s defense until the final status of the island is formally settled. Authorities on the mainland view Taiwan as sovereign Chinese territory. Since 1979, the U.S. government, as well as officials in Taipei, have been tight-lipped about American troops deployed to or otherwise setting foot on the island for training. As of March 2020, the Pentagon acknowledged the presence of 21 uniformed military personnel – Four from the Air Force, five from the Army, two from the Navy, and 10 from the Marine Corps – stationed in Taiwan. These figures would not count short-duration deployments, such as a JCET. The Marines in Taiwan are assigned to the privately-run American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which serves as the de facto American embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, similar to how they are deployed to other traditional diplomatic posts around the world. The bulk of the rest of the American military personnel on the island are also understood to work out of the AIT’s offices. The American flag flies outside the American Institute in Taiwan, the US government’s de facto embassy on the island., American Institute in Taiwan It’s also unclear if this iteration of Balance Tamper reflects any sort of increased U.S. special operations activity, for training or any other purposes, on Taiwan. There has been renewed emphasis on the Pacific Region, with a particular eye towards China, in recent years, in general, following the release of a new National Defense Strategy in 2018 that focused heavily on “great power competition” with potential near-peer adversaries. At the same time, there has been growing animosity between Beijing and Taipei since Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen first took office in 2016. The Chinese government views Tsai’s government as presenting a real risk that the island could declare full independence and has threatened to use all means available, including a military intervention, to prevent that from happening. Tsai, who won a second term earlier this year, has promised to further separate Taiwanese affairs from the mainland, which has increased tensions even more. Tsai Ing Wen, ahead of a group of other Taiwanese officials, at the inauguration ceremony for her second term in May 2020., AP Tsai’s administration enjoys good relations with that U.S. President Donald Trump and has used that to secure a number of major arms deals, including most notably approval to purchase new, advanced Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets , as well as M1 Abrams tanks and other weapons and military equipment. Taiwan is now looking to buy land-based Harpoon anti-ship missile batteries, which could be particularly important in helping to beat back, or at least delay, a Chinese invasion, long enough for outside help to arrive. The 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, which trained with members of the 1st Special Forces Group during Balance Tamper, would also likely be a key component of Taiwan’s plans to counter a military intervention from the mainland. The 101st has units deployed to various islands in or near the Taiwan Strait. Kinmen is less than 10 miles from the mainland. The Taiwanese special operators would be expected to harass Chinese forces to delay their advance or even launch raids on the mainland. It’s unclear whether American special operators would be expected to join them directly in those operations depending on the circumstances. A map showing Kinmen, off the coast of Xiamen on the Chinese Mainland and the Matsu Islands nearer to Fuzhou, as well as Penghu, which closer to Taiwan itself., Google Maps In the last year or so, the U.S. military has also stepped up its own so-called Freedom of Navigation patrols, or FONOPs, through the Taiwan Strait, which have involved both American warships and military aircraft . These FONOPs are meant to demonstrate American resolve toward China and show the U.S. government’s commitment to Taiwan. Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy C-40 personnel transport aircraft also flew a particularly unusual route over the island proper. The rare public acknowledgment that Army Special Forces are training with their Taiwanese counterparts is well in line with these other activities and would seem to be part of a broader messaging campaign aimed at Beijing. With friction increasing between the parties on either side of the Taiwan Strait, it’s very possible, if not probable, that we will see more cooperative training between the United States and Taiwan in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 19, 2020",The A-7 Attack Jet’s Head Up Display Was A Revolution In Air Combat Tech,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ling-Temco-Vought A-7 Corsair II wasn’t sexy, it looked like a fat version of the F-8 Crusader from which it drew its lineage, but it sure was smart. It featured a slew of advanced avionics that would make its single pilot’s job easier and their attacks far more precise. One of these features was central to the leap in combat capabilities the stubby aircraft represented—the Head Up Display (HUD). The A-7 was the first operational American combat aircraft to get a fully instrumented HUD as we understand the concept today. This new addition was a monumental revolution in technology that changed air combat forever. A-7s with their predecessor, the A-4 Skyhawk, aboard the USS Ticonderoga in 1968., USN Before the A-7, tactical jets were receiving increasingly complex holographic gunsights with simple symbology, but nothing was tied directly to computers that worked to present all the key weapons delivery and primary flight information right up in front of the pilot’s eyes as they peered through the windscreen. The A-7 HUD, EU, and PDU shown by Colin Marshall. In October 1967 it was announced from Dallas in Texas U.S.A that Elliott Flight Automation had been awarded a four-year contract to supply LTV with Head Up Displays for the A-7. The initial contract was worth £14million for 1,200 displays and was the largest ever awarded to a British firm., Rochester Avionic Archives Looking back at the A-7’s AN/AVQ-7(V) HUD, which was made by Elliott Flight Automation along with Marconi, it is amazing what they pulled off in the mid-1960s. Much of the HUD’s general layout and symbology is still in use today, and just how deeply integrated the HUD was with the jet’s radar, navigation, and other systems is absolutely remarkable. Flight data ‘tapes,’ velocity vector, pitch ladder, steering cues, targeting points, bomb azimuth guides, AoA E-bracket, and much more are all there, just as they remain on so many tactical aircraft HUDs today. A-7 Cockpit, US Government Photo The aircraft’s HUD and the avionics and sensors that were tied into it greatly helped the A-7 become renowned as an incredibly precise weapons delivery platform in an age that predated the widespread use of precision-guided weapons. Various reports state that the A-7 improved the accuracy of weapons delivery by a multiple over the aircraft that came before it, most notably the plane it was meant to initially replace within the U.S. Navy, the A-4 Skyhawk. The A-7 would go on to serve in the USAF and Hellenic Air Force, as well as with Portugal and Thailand. Check out the absolutely awesome time capsule-like industry videos below that go over the symbology and functionality of the Corsair II’s revolutionary HUD: The A-7 would continue to make history in terms of pilot visual and targeting aids with the introduction of the first raster scan/CRT HUD that allowed for video imagery, as well as HUD symbology, to be projected in front of the pilot. As such, video from a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) pod could be projected into the pilot’s forward field of view, giving them a degree of night vision. When tied to terrain-following radar, precision all-weather, day-night attack capability was had. The FLIR pods could also be used to verify targets via a zoom function. This program was known as the A-7E Target Recognition Attack Multisensor (TRAM) configuration. Roughly over a decade and a half later, this capability would become a staple on many U.S. fighters, especially those that used the LANTIRN system , such as the Block 40 F-16C/D and the F-15E . The F/A-18 Hornet also had this capability via its AAS-38A/B Nite Hawk pod and its raster-scan HUD. A-7s carrying TRAM FLIR pods. , USN In many ways, the A-7 was ahead of its time, with its incredible mix of extreme range , payload, avionics, and overall efficiency. What it didn’t have going for it was looks or speed, which can be a deadly mix of deficiencies for a tactical jet trying to survive in a fighter pilot-Pentagon.  I often muse that such an aircraft in updated form would have been extremely valuable during the Global War On Terror. And of course, the A-7 could have turned into a higher-performance, even more advanced machine via the A-7F Strikefighter, but this never came to pass. It turned out to be yet another instance of ‘what could have been.’ You can read all about it in this prior feature of mine Regardless, one has to hand it to Elliott and Marconi, as well as the entire A-7 team, for getting the HUD so right on its first try. They truly changed air combat forever in the process. Hat tip to Rochester Avionic Archives for being such a cool repository for much of this visual historic info!

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 23, 2020",Here Are The Air Force’s Reports On Aircrew Encounters With Unidentified Flying Craft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, reports emerged about Navy fighter pilots having numerous encounters with unidentified flying objects while flying in restricted airspace off the East Coast of the United States. Details remain limited, though The War Zone has been steadily collecting more and more information that could help explain many of those incidents. At the same time, curiously, there haven’t been virtually any revelations about similar encounters with other U.S. military services’ flying branches, especially the Air Force, which is the entity primarily responsible for safeguarding America’s airspace. In May, The War Zone was first to publish details from a number of hazard reports from the Naval Safety Center, obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). regarding interactions between that service’s aircraft and unknown aerial craft that offered an additional look into what might be happening, why, and how these encounters were or weren’t getting reported. We can now share information from 25 similar reports obtained through the FOIA from the Air Force Safety Center. This whole issue, especially regarding U.S. military aircraft encountering unidentified objects when flying over or near the United States proper, was thrust back into the public consciousness just this week. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said that it was looking to get a full accounting of the issue from the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Pentagon. As part of a report accompanying the latest draft of the Senate version Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, the Committee members included language asking for a detailed review of exactly what information about these kinds of incidents exists now , how new data is getting collected, how this is all shared within the federal government, and what threats these aerial objects might pose, including whether they might reflect technological breakthroughs by potential adversaries. These Air Force reports, as well as the previously disclosed ones that the Navy has on file, could easily be among the information that the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense might end up compiling for Senators to review. The 25 reports that The War Zone obtained, which cover various types of incidents around the world and come from the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) database, came in response to a request that asked for copies of “any flight incident, hazard, or similar reports that the Air Force Safety Center received during the calendar years 2013 to 2019 that deal with encounters that any Air Force aircraft had anywhere in the world with any unidentified aerial objects.” This date range was meant to capture a snapshot of similar experiences that the Air Force might have been having around when Navy pilots said they saw a spike in the number of encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, more commonly known as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, off the East Coast of the United States through the end of the most recent complete calendar year. Personal identifying information is redacted throughout the Air Force reports. “Safety investigation boards’ Findings, Evaluations, Analyses, Conclusions, and Recommendations are exempt from disclosure,” the Air Force Safety Center also said in a letter accompanying the release, citing various Air Force and Department of Defense regulations, as well as relevant FOIA case law, which you can read in full, with certain personal information redacted by us, here . “All other privileged portions of the report have been withheld according to established laws,” the letter added. “Unfortunately, some pages are virtually illegible due to the quality of the microfilm record and our capability to reproduce it.” It’s not clear which of the records released, if any, were reproduced from reports contained on microfilm. The Air Force was still offering the option of sending FOIA request responses on actual microfilm in the late 2000s, but generally only for older records created years before the widespread introduction of computerized databases, such as AFSAS. #1 , June 17, 2014: 27th Special Operations Wing The 27th Special Operations Wing, the main unit at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico, reported an unidentified fixed-wing aircraft flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) intruding into the nearby R5104 range area. Neither the Range Control Officer (RCO) at the adjacent Melrose Air Force Range nor the base’s Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) could establish communications with the aircraft. Members of the 27th Special Operations Wing also advised the Federal Aviation Administration’s Albuquerque Center Air Route Traffic Control Center of the situation. The unidentified aircraft first appeared around 11:04 AM local time and it had exited R5104 by 11:22, after which radar contact was lost. #2, July 2, 2014: HC-130P Combat King and HH-60G Pave Hawk, 58th Special Operations Wing The 58th Special Operations Wing, a major unit at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, reported a near-collision during a nighttime aerial refueling training sortie on July 2, 2014. An HC-130P Combat King combat search and rescue and tanker aircraft, using the callsign Akela 39, was refueling an HH-60G Pave Hawk combat search and rescue helicopter, with the callsign Skull 65, when an “unidentified helicopter” flew under the two aircraft at a distance of between 100 and 300 feet. Both aircraft were flying in Aerial Refueling Track 117 near Sorocco, New Mexico. The HC-130P’s crew had first spotted to object when they saw a bright light near the aircraft. The HH-60G crew also saw it and initially thought it might be headlights on a vehicle on the road below. However, the light grew brighter to the point of blinding the Pave Hawk’s pilots, who were operating using night-vision goggles at the time. This resulted in an extremely dangerous situation in which the helicopter’s crew was no longer aware of their distance from the HC-130P, or that they were moving backward away from it, until the HH-60G’s aerial refueling probe inadvertently disconnected from the drogue basket trailing behind the Combat King. No communication was ever established with the unidentified helicopter and there was no indication it ever maneuvered to avoid either the HC-130P or the HH-60G. #3 , July 24, 2014: C-130J Hercules, 317th Airlift Group A C-130J Hercules airlift assigned to the 317th Airlift Group had a near-collision with an unidentified light fixed-wing aircraft while heading toward the Rogers Drop Zone (DZ), approximately eight miles to the south of Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State, during a training mission. The C-130J’s Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) alerted them to the other oncoming aircraft. “The EC [Event Crew] called a No Drop and executed a 180 degree turn during which the crew visually sighted a light fixed wing aircraft (EA2) [Event Aircraft 2] behind them still flying toward their position,” the report says. “The crew contacted Seattle Approach Control, but the aircraft did not seem to be in radio contact during the incident.” #4 , Nov. 21, 2014: KC-135R Stratotanker, 121st Aerial Refueling Wing A KC-135R tanker assigned to the 121st Aerial Refueling Wing, an element of the Ohio Air National Guard, got notice of a potential hazard from its Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) on Nov. 21, 2014, while climbing away from Wilmington Airpark near Wilmington, Ohio, following a planned missed approach as part of a training sortie. The crew slowed their climb out until the TCAS indicated that there was no longer any air traffic conflict #5 , Feb. 7, 2015: HC-130 Combat King, Unidentified Unit, and 45th Space Wing On Feb. 7, 2015, an HC-130 Combat King combat search and rescue and tanker aircraft belonging to an unidentified unit had an encounter with what was described as “a possible remote control (RC) aircraft” with a “flashing red light” near the junction of Florida State Road A1A and the Pineda Causeway. The 45th Space Wing at nearby Patrick Air Force Base subsequently reported the incident, which it felt had “high accident potential.” Personnel at the tower at Patrick spotted the possible remote control aircraft and contacted the Brevard Country Sheriff’s Office (BCSO), which subsequently sent deputies to investigate. The Air Force Security Forces Squadron at Patrick were also involved, but neither it nor the BCSO found any further evidence of the object, which had been flying an estimated 900 to 1,000 feet in the air. This particular entry notes the growing hazard posed by “hobbyists and other civilians” operating remote-control aircraft and drones. It states the FAA rules at the time prohibiting the operation of unmanned aircraft above 400 feet within three miles of airports and air bases. #6 , Apr. 21, 2015: KC-135R Stratotanker, 379th Air Expeditionary Wing A KC-135R tanker assigned to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, part of Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT) at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar had an encounter with an “unidentified aircraft” while conducting an operational aerial refueling mission over Afghanistan near Kandahar. The tanker’s crew visually acquired the unknown aircraft while refueling an unspecified combat jet, which had an “air-to-air radar.” The crew of that jet could not acquire the unidentified aircraft with their radar. Tactical air traffic control radar in the area never picked it up, either. The KC-135R ultimately completed its mission and safely returned to base. #7 , May 15, 2015: KC-135R Stratotanker, 100th Aerial Refueling Wing On May 15, 2015, a KC-135R Stratotanker from the 100th Aerial Refueling Wing had a near collision with an unidentified aircraft while on approach to its home base of RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom. The aircraft was also in contact with the Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) at RAF Lakenheath during the incident. The RAF Lakenheath RAPCON had informed the crew of the KC-135R of multiple contacts along its route, but they were unable to visually identify any of them. The subsequently descended to 2,600 feet Mean Sea Level as part of their approach before air traffic controllers warned them about another aircraft directly below them. Around five seconds after getting that alert, the aircraft’s own Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) also warned of a potential collision and advised an immediate 4,000 feet-per-minute climb. The crew performed that maneuver, leveling off at 3,600 feet Mean Sea Level when the TCAS indicated that the danger has passed. The crew of the aircraft never visually saw the other aircraft or received any radio calls from another plane warning of a potential collision. The KC-135R landed at Mildenhall without incident. #8 , May 21, 2015: C-17A Globemaster III, 452nd Air Mobility Wing One of the C-17A Globemaster III airlifters assigned to the 452nd Air Mobility Wing, an element of the Air Force Reserve, had a near-collision with an “unidentified remotely piloted aircraft” while on approach to March Air Reserve Base in California on May 21, 2015. The pilot said that the flying object came within 15 feet of the aircraft, passing it above and to the left. #9 , July 25, 2015: MC-130P Combat Shadow, 129th Rescue Wing An MC-130P Combat Shadow combat search and rescue and tanker aircraft from the California Air National Guard’s 129th Rescue Wing had to take evasive action to avoid hitting an unidentified object during a nighttime training mission on July 25, 2015 near Niagara Falls International Airport in New York State. While on approach to the airport, the pilot saw through their night-vision goggles an “object [that] appeared to be illuminated by a single external light]” and that looked to “be accelerating from left to right” in front of them. “Immediately after seeing the object, the pilot took evasive action by executing an abrupt climb and roll to the left,” according to the report. “Within one second of initiating evasive action the right wing of EA1 [Event Aircraft 1; the MC-130P] passed directly over the object.” The plane’s navigator also reported having seen a “hot spot” on the aircraft’s Infrared Detection System (IDS), which is meant to spot incoming missiles. No other members of the crew beyond the pilot said that had actually seen anything, but the incident was reported as a near-collision. #10, Aug. 13, 2015: KC-135R Stratotanker, 452nd Air Mobility Wing A KC-135R tanker assigned to the Air Force Reserve’s 452nd Air Mobility Wing suffered a near collision with what the crew described as a quad-copter-type drone while flying a pattern around March Air Reserve Base in California on Aug. 13, 2015. The “remotely piloted aircraft” (RPA) passed by the tanker at a distance of approximately 100 feet below and 300 feet to the right of where it was flying. It continued on in the opposite direction from the KC-135R and “disappeared from sight.” #11 , Jan. 15, 2016: 45th Space Wing Wing Members of the 45th Space Wing’s detachment at RAF Ascension Island on the island of the same name, a territory of the United Kingdom in the South Atlantic Ocean, reported seeing an “unauthorized personal drone” flying within restricted Class D airspace at two separate locations on Jan. 15, 2016. One of these sightings was near the island’s Long Beach within 3 miles of the “Ascension Auxiliary Airfield around the time a UK Royal Air Force (RAF) flight was scheduled to arrive.” The RAF pilots did not report seeing the drone nor did it interfere with their landing, but the 45th Space Wing described the incident as having a “high accident potential.” #12, Apr. 21, 2016: EC-130J(SJ), 193rd Special Operations Wing One of the EC-130J(SJ) aircraft assigned to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 193rd Special Operations Wing had a near collision with “a small drone/Small Unmanned Aerial System” on April 21, 2016. The aircraft was flying at around 4,000 feet Mean Sea Level and was in contact with aircraft controllers at Philadelphia International Airport. The aircraft was returning from a training airdrop mission over the Coyle Drop Zone near Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. “The crew initially thought they saw a bird, until they saw a flashing red light pass 3 ft above the left wing,” the report notes. #13, Jan. 25, 2017: 27th Special Operations Wing On Jan. 25, 2017, an unidentified apparently private fixed-wing aircraft flying at around 10,000 feet Mean Sea Level under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) intruded into the R5105 range area near Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico. The 27th Special Operations Wing is the main unit at that base and reported the incident to the Air Force Safety Center. The aircraft entered R5105 at approximately 4:10 PM local time, had flown to an area west of the adjacent R5104A range area by 4:20, and Cannon’s Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) had lost the signal from the aircraft’s transponder by 4:37. Authorities at the base reported “no training interruption or other aircraft were effected [sic].” The narrative also includes a typo suggesting this occurred in 2016, rather than 2017, but the 2017 date appears in multiple sections of the report, which itself was published on Feb. 1, 2017. #14, June 9, 2017: T-6A Texan II, 12th Flying Training Wing On June 9, 2017, a T-6A Texan II trainer from the 12th Flying Training Wing had a near collision with a “red unmanned aerial system” while flying at approximately 3,500 feet Mean Sea Level and around one nautical south of the Mobile Bay Bridge in Alabama. The aircraft was conducting a training sortie along an established route designated VR1024. “The UAS was spotted approximately one half to one wingtip away from the EA [Event Aircraft] and was co-altitude,” the report added. Naval Air Station Pensacola is identified as the “accounting base,” indicating that the training flight originated or end there, or both. #15, Nov. 1, 2017: F-15E Strike Eagle, 48th Fighter Wing An F-15E Strike assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing, an element of U.S. Air Force’s in Europe (USAFE), performed evasive maneuvers to avoid colliding with an “unidentified flying object” while flying near its home base at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom on Nov. 1, 2017. “The object passed over the right side of the aircraft with an estimated minimal separation of 100 feet,” according to the report. #16, Jan. 20, 2018: T-1 Jayhawk, 47th Flying Training Wing One of the 47th Flying Training Wing’s T-1 Jayhawk training jets, with the callsign Rake 06, reported a near-collision with an “unidentifiable unmanned drone” while on approach to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport in Arizona on Jan. 20, 2018. The incident occurred approximately 4.2 nautical miles from the airport’s runway 25L. The aircraft was flying at approximately 2,400 feet Mean Sea Level, or around 1,300 feet Above Ground Level, at the time and flew right under the drone. “The ECP [Event Copilot] was just able to maneuver below its flightpath as both EC [Event Crew] members called out the conflict when it became visible,” according to the report. “The ECP initially thought it was a bird but both pilots identified it as a UAV due to the fact it was not moving (hovering) and they saw a small white steady light emanating as they passed underneath it.” #17, Feb. 7, 2018: T-38C Talon, 71st Flying Training Wing On Feb. 7, 2018, a T-38C Talon jet trainer assigned to the 71st Flying Training Wing had a near collision with an unspecified drone while on approach to Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma. The unmanned aircraft came with 300 feet of the jet trainer, but did not prevent it from landing safely. #18, Feb. 5, 2018: 325th Fighter Wing and U.S. Navy T-6A Texan II On Feb. 5, 2018, the 325th Fighter Wing, one of the major units at Tyndall Air Force Base, reported a sighting of “a sizable, black in color, drone” near the base. The pilot of a transient U.S. Navy T-6A Texan II from an unspecified unit that was on approach had spotted the unmanned aircraft “approximately 1,200 feet off his left wing” and alerted personnel at the base. The T-6A was flying at approximately 1,000 feet Above Ground Level at the time and the pilot “noticed sun glint off of metal, this is when he realized the black object was not a bird and that it was moving to the southeast,” according to the report. “The pilot reported the sighting to tower personnel and 325 FW flight safety followed up later with a telephone interview. Local search efforts for object or operator was negative and no military or Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) drone operations were being conducted.” #19, Mar. 26, 2018: 45th Space Wing and Civilian Helicopter On Mar. 26, 2018, the pilot of an unidentified civilian helicopter flying near Patrick Air Force Base in Florida “had a model airplane come within about 100 feet.” The pilot of the civilian helicopter informed air traffic controllers at Orlando Melbourne International Airport of the incident, who appear to have relayed to the report to personnel at Patrick, after which the 45th Space Wing submitted a report to the Air Force Safety Center. The civilian helicopter had been in contact with personnel at Patrick during its flight, which took it through Class D airspace near the base. All the other major details about this incident are redacted, but it appears to have led to the issuance of a formal Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) regarding the potentially hazardous situation. #20, Sept. 10, 2018: C-130J Hercules, 86th Airlift Wing One of the C-130Js assigned to the 86th Airlift Wing, part of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, had a near collision with an unidentified unmanned aerial vehicle while flying near Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The report describes the drone as “spherical with an approximated 6 feet diameter top mounted rotor.” #21, Mar. 6, 2019: T-1 Jayhawk, 12th Flying Training Wing A T-1 Jayhawk training jet from the 12th Flying Training Wing reported seeing “a quad copter or non-traditional aircraft” that was “silver in color” while flying in Mississippi on a low-level training flight along an established route designated VR1022. “The UAS was stationary or near stationary” and was seen within one nautical mile of the T-1 hovering at around 1,500 feet Above Ground Level. The presence of the drone did not impact the training sortie or the aircraft’s ability to return to base safely. Naval Air Station Pensacola is identified as the “accounting base,” indicating that the training flight originated or ended there, or both. The crew of the T-1 also contacted air traffic controllers at Trent Lott International Airport in Moss Point, Mississippi about the drone sighting. #22, Mar. 13, 2019: C-17A Globemaster III, 445th Airlift Wing A C-17A Globemaster III airlifter assigned to the 445th Airlift Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit, had to take evasive action to avoid a small drone during a training sortie on Mar. 13, 2019. The aircraft was flying at approximately 3,500 feet Mean Sea Level over Ohio at the time. “The pilot flying (PF) observed a white sUAS [small unmanned aerial system] with either brown or black accents or propellers just below the EA [Event Aircraft],” the report notes. “The PF executed an evasive maneuver up and to the left to miss the sUAS, which was within 50 feet of the EA.” An unspecified “local police department” was informed about the incident afterward. #23, Mar. 21, 2019: E-3B Sentry, 552nd Air Control Wing On Mar. 21, 2019, an E-3B Sentry assigned to the 552nd Air Control Wing and using the callsign Sentry 60 reported that a “DJI style quad-copter/unmanned aerial system” passed by the aircraft approximately 20 feet below its number four engine. The plane was flying at approximately 3,000 feet Mean Sea Level near Tinker Air Force Base at the time. The aircraft’s pilot visually identified the drone, but their co-pilot never saw it. In addition to the informing personnel at Tinker about the encounter, the crew also told air traffic controllers at Oklahoma City Approach that “they came close to one.” The E-3B eventually moved to a holding pattern at Tinker for approximately 20 minutes so as not to return to the area where they had seen the drone, before ultimately landing without incident. #24, July 25, 2019: C-17A Globemaster III, 445th Airlift Wing A C-17A Globemaster III airlifter from the 445th Airlift Wing, part of the Air Force Reserve, when departing RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom on July 25, 2019. The crew of the aircraft “visually acquired an orange colored small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) as it passed approximately 50′ below the left wing” after climbing out to an altitude of 7,500 feet Mean Sea Level. “After spotting the sUAS [small unmanned aerial system] the EC [Event Crew] marked their position and proactively reported the encounter to the controlling air traffic agency, which seemed unaware that the UAS was operating in the area,” the report added. #25, Sept. 9, 2019: LC-130H Hercules, 109th Airlift Wing An LC-130H Hercules airlifter assigned to the 109th Airlift Wing, an element of the New York Air National Guard, reported a near-miss with a quad-copter-type drone while conducting a proficiency flight around Albany International Airport on Sept. 9, 2019. During a climb out at 1,100 feet Above Ground Level, the crew spotted the drone, which they said was yellow in color, approximately 300 feet away laterally and between 100 and 200 feet below the altitude at which they were flying. They reported it to air traffic controllers and did not see it for the remainder of their flight, which concluded with the plane landing safely at nearby Schenectady County Airport. You can find the full copies of the 25 reports as they were released to us here . Is this all? When The War Zone published the eight Naval Safety Center reports in May, we immediately noted that it was curious that there were so few such records apparently available in the Navy’s Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS) Aviation Mishap and Hazard Reporting System (WAMHRS). The number of incidents recorded in the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) also seems very small for a six-year time span. The fact that only one of these reports deals specifically with the direct experience of the crew of combat jet of any kind – the Nov. 1, 2017 near-collision involving the F-15E Strike Eagle from the 48th Fighter Wing – and that only one other report – the Apr. 21, 2015 event that the crew of a KC-135R Stratotanker assigned to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing reported – mentions the tangential involvement of a tactical aircraft also seems extremely odd. As The War Zone has noted in the past, tactical aircraft, especially fighter jets with more and more capable radars and other sensors, which will soon include the widespread deployment of Infrared Search and Track Systems , have already proven to be particularly well-positioned to spot and track small, unidentified objects. There is the possibility that, or a high probability rather, that for whatever reason, additional reports are getting passed through separate or even classified systems, including those outside the normal reporting channels for military aviation safety incidents. This week, The Black Vault received a number of internal Air Force Emails via FOIA related to this topic, including one that said “Currently the Air Force is not working any specific guidelines for reporting UAPs.” “**Side note and off the record – we do have reporting instructions for Unauthorized Air Vehicles/Military Installation Airspace Violation, but that is more in the C-UAS realm,” it continued. “That information is provided via OPREPs on SIPR.” “OPREP” refers to the Operational Reporting system, which, as this Email also notes, is contained on the Department of Defense’s classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRnet. Now, regardless of how complete the reporting of incidents involving unidentified aerial objects in AFSAS is, the 25 reports that we do have still show some interesting trends. The most immediate of these is the steady rise of lower-end drone activity in general, something that has been an increasing issue for commercial air operations , as well. Regulators around the world, including the Federal Aviation Administration, have struggled to develop rules and guidelines that are practical and enforceable . The scope of the reports that are available also shows that these are issues that are global in nature, even impacting areas as remote as Ascension Island. This only underscores the fact that small drones not only present real safety concerns, but also that they could be very real threats to U.S. military activities at home, as well as abroad. The proliferation of relatively cheap, but capable drone technology has already enabled non-state actors, in addition to the military forces of nation-states, to increasingly employ unmanned aircraft for surveillance and actual kinetic attacks on and off the battlefield . This is an issue we have been hammering on for years and it will rise to become among the most pressing strategic issues of our age, especially as more complex attacks become a reality and as the Department of Defense scrambles to play catchup to a threat they were astonishingly too incurious to recognize before it fully materialized . The War Zone is continuing to dive deeper into this issue, and especially in terms of how it relates to the recent rash of UAP/UFO encounters that the military and the intelligence community is supposedly grappling with, via a number of ongoing investigations, some of which you will hear more about very soon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, we posted a video of a downright awesome lecture by test pilot Paul Metz, the only person to fly both the YF-23 and the F-22. That event was put on by the Western Museum Of Flight in Torrance, California, with a seniors group in attendance publishing the presentation online. Very unique insights were had on the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program and why the YF-23 lost to the YF-22. Now we have another video to share from the same group. This one features retired Northrop Grumman Vice President and F-14 Tomcat designer Mike Ciminera , who explains just how innovative and big a push forward technologically the Tomcat really was. It is among the very best videos on the Tomcat I have ever seen. Ciminera starts with a short overview of the dawn of swing-wing technology and moves to the F-111B debacle that gave birth to the VFX program in the late 1960s. The VFX would become the F-14 Tomcat. Ciminera notes that his team of designers made over 6,000 design configurations as part of their effort to come up with the winning airframe for the VFX competition. He then goes into detail on the menagerie of flight control surfaces and fairings that were used to make the huge jet maneuver like a nimble fighter and also fly at high speed over long distances while loaded with missiles. The storied aerospace executive underlines the evolutionary relationship between the F-14 and the F-111 and just how big of a leap in swing-wing design the F-14 was even though it was developed, first flew, and was operational within a decade of the F-111 doing the same. Even the differences in the two types’ complex air inlet systems are discussed. Ciminera then goes into the weapon systems on the Tomcat, including how the E-2 Hawkeye and F-14 Tomcat became an uncannily capable team that allowed for new tactics and procedures to be implemented that were not possible before the Tomcat hit the fleet. He also gives commentary on a company montage video and in the question and answer period it really hits home just how amazing a feat the Tomcat’s design was, especially in terms of its complex swing-wing configuration. Ciminera fully attests that the advent of the F-14 as we know it would not have been at all possible without the existence of the F-111 and a helping hand from the General Dynamics team that designed it: “We learned from the F-111B… Without the F-111B we wouldn’t have been this smart.” Check out the fascinating lecture in full below: If you want to see where the Tomcat was set to evolve to if it was funded over the Super Hornet, check out our exclusive feature where we bring the Super Tomcat 21 to life by clicking here.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures and videos have now emerged offering the first full look at the U.K. Royal Air Force’s VIP-configured Voyager tanker transport aircraft wearing its new high-visibility paint job with the Union Jack on the tail. This change reportedly cost 900,000 pounds, or just over $1.1 million at the present rate of exchange. The British government made the decision to repaint the aircraft, which previously wore the standard gray scheme found on all other RAF Voyagers, to help it better promote the country’s national brand when it delivers the Prime Minister, members of the Royal Family, and other senior officials to their destinations. This also gives it an appearance that is more in line with that of the VIP aircraft that other countries use, such as the U.S. Air Force’s iconic VC-25A Air Force One aircraft. Twitter user @TommyGs_Tweets , an airspace regulator, pilot, and plane spotter, shared some of the first images of the Voyager, which carries the registration number ZZ336, leaving a hangar at a Cambridge City Airport in Cambridgeshire with its new paint scheme. Voyager is the RAF’s name for the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). ZZ336, which first went into the hangar on June 9, is now primarily white, with the stylized Union Jack on the tail and blue flourish along both sides of the fuselage. “United Kingdom” is written in gold lettering on the upper portion of the center of the fuselage on both sides, as well. Some observers were initially concerned that the Union Jack might have been painted incorrectly, but this has turned out to be incorrect . The scheme matches the one seen on an official diagram that leaked out online yesterday. AirlinerVideos subsequently posted a video showing the tail of the aircraft peeking out of the hangar at Cambridge City Airport. The aircraft has now departed Cambridge City Airport in its new livery. “The RAF Voyager used by the royal family and the PM [Prime Minister is currently in Cambridgeshire for pre-planned repainting,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson had told The Guardian newspaper on June 24, 2020. “This will mean that the plane can better represent the U.K. around the world with national branding, which will be in line with many other leaders’ planes.” It’s not clear whether Johnson, who became Prime Minister in July 2019, ordered the change, or if it had been in the works beforehand. “Why does it have to be grey?” he had lamented in 2018 when he was the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary. At that time he was advocating for a dedicated VIP plane for the country’s Foreign Office . “What I will say about the Voyager, I think it’s great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of. It never seems to be available,” he added at the time. “I don’t know who uses it, but it never seems to be available.” The cost of the new paint job has already received significant criticism in a time of tight U.K. budgets and global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s also unclear if the price of repainting the aircraft is already covered in the terms of the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s existing deal with AirTanker , a European consortium that includes Airbus. That firm leases nine Voyagers to the RAF, including ZZ336. There have also been concerns about whether the new paint job may limit the aircraft’s ability to serve as tanker transport, if needed, something it is technically required to be able to do. The RAF does not have a dedicated long-haul VIP plane, instead using this Voyager to support the Prime Minister, the Royal Family, other senior officials, and their accompanying delegations and members of the press. When flying these missions, ZZ336 has a special internal VIP configuration consisting of a first-class executive suite, known as Cabin A , as well as airline-style business-class seating. At the same time, there are increasingly significant limits to the utility of traditional camouflage in aerial combat, especially with regards to non-stealthy support aircraft, such as tankers and airlifters, which are becoming increasingly vulnerable, in general. In addition, despite concerns that the plane might emerge wearing a lurid Austin Powers -esque paint job, the scheme that ZZ336 is now wearing is actually very similar stylistically to ones that the RAF’s pair of smaller BAe 146 CC.2 VIP transports have worn in the past . The U.K. Ministry of Defense has been in the process of trying to sell those aircraft, as well as two gray-painted BAe 146 C.3 variants, but recently reconfigured some of them to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s also well in line with the appearance of other national-level VIP aircraft belonging to other large countries , including major U.K. allies, such as the United States and Canada . The story of Canada’s “ Can Force One ” and how it got its own controversial high-visibility paint scheme is actually very similar in many respects to what is now transpiring with regards to ZZ336. An RAF BAe 146 CC.2 VIP transport., Crown Copyright No matter what, this Voyager will now certainly get a different kind of attention when it makes official visits in the future. Update: 12:45 PM EST— The Royal Air Force has now issued an official press release regarding the newly painted Voyager, which is also nicknamed Vespina.  The aircraft is now back at RAF Brize Norton, the home of the service’s entire Voyager fleet. “This project was a privilege to have been involved in and I am delighted to have seen it delivered so quickly and efficiently, together with our industry partners,” RAF Air Commodore Simon Edwards, the chief officer in charge of the repainting project, said in a statement. “The aircraft’s new paint scheme will better reflect its prestige role which we are proud to undertake.” Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright The RAF says that repainting was part of a larger refurbishment effort that came about as a result of the U.K. government’s 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, but it remains unclear if it had already been paid for through previous contracts. “The Project first created and agreed an outline design before being modified to account for commercial, legal, operational and design needs,” the press release says. “This process was not only about the visual design, this was a complex engineering project requiring detailed drawings which were developed by Airbus. Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group were then chosen to deliver the project on time and within budget.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Force One Transports"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 2, 2019",This Is Our First Look At The Marines’ New CH-53K King Stallion Flying From A Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Marine Corps’ new CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift utility helicopter has finally made its way to an amphibious assault ship. The beast of a flying machine wrapped up its inaugural set of sea trials and the Navy has some great photos to show for it. The sight of the triple engine Sikorsky helo flying from the ‘Gator Navy’s’ big-deck amphibious assault ships will become commonplace in years to come, but today, it is totally new. The remarkably large and freakishly powerful helicopter is set to replace the aging CH-53E Super Stallion and is considered an absolutely critical aircraft program for the Corps’, which relies on its CH-53s to lug around it heaviest loads and outsized cargo, including armored vehicles and howitzers . Check out these shots of the historic shipboard tests that The War Zone obtained from the Navy: US Navy US Navy US Navy A Navy release about the trials reads: The CH-53K King Stallion completed a two-week period of sea trials in the Atlantic earlier this month. This was the first opportunity to see the aircraft working in a modern naval environment. Testing took place on the USS Wasp, a landing helicopter dock (LHD) amphibious assault ship operated by the U.S. Navy. “I’m very pleased with how the ship tests went,” said Col. Jack Perrin, H-53 helicopters program manager. “We were able to assess the K taking off and landing day, night, and with night vision goggles and it performed extremely well.” According to the CH-53K integrated test team, the sea trials are a series of tests to evaluate the performance of the aircraft at sea. Tests performed during the two weeks included: launch and recovery; rotor start and shutdown; blade fold; and shipboard compatibility testing – all in increasing wind speed and varying wind directions relative to the aircraft. “The bulk of the testing was in launch and recovery,” said Perrin, “and we nailed it every time, no matter what the wind/sea conditions were. The 53K is now a “feet-wet” warrior from the sea.” Ship compatibility testing includes towing the aircraft around the deck and in the hangar, performing maintenance while aboard the ship, ensuring the aircraft fits in all the locations it needs to around the ship deck and hangar, and evaluating chain/tie-down procedures. The CH-53K King Stallion continues to execute within the reprogrammed CH-53K timeline, moving toward completion of developmental test, leading to initial operational test and evaluation in 2021 and first fleet deployment in 2023-2024. It is exciting to see this program moving forward. The helicopter has been hit by its fair share of delays and cost overruns , but the future is looking brighter for the aircraft, whose lineage dates back over half a century. Still, the Marines need it to work and soon. As such, getting to the ship is a big milestone. UPDATE: Here is a statement from Bill Falk, the director of Sikorsky’s CH-53K program, on the shipboard tests: “The CH-53K demonstrated exceptional performance throughout its initial sea trials continuing the team’s progress towards initial operational test and evaluation in 2021 and deployment in 2023-2024 Executing 364 ship landings and takeoffs from all deck spots, expanding the wind envelope, performing multiple towing and hanger evolutions, and conducting multiple rotor blade spread, fold, engagement and disengagement operations, the CH-53K is right at home aboard a large-deck amphibious ship and is one step closer to deployment. The King Stallion, the only 21st Century fully marinized heavy-lift helicopter, excelled in the shipboard environment reinforcing its critical role allowing Marines the operational flexibility to move more material, more rapidly from ship to shore.” USN Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2020",Glitzy Air Force Video Lays Out “Skyborg” Artificial Intelligence Combat Drone Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released a slick new video regarding its Skyborg program , which is developing a suite of systems that will form an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” capable of flying networked “loyal wingman” type drones and fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , or UCAVs. The video offers new insights into what the service wants out of this project, how it sees it fitting into its larger aerial combat ecosystem , and what unmanned capabilities it might serve as a stepping stone toward in the future. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) posted the video on YouTube on June 24, 2020. AFRL is leading the development of Skyborg, which the Air Force first unveiled publicly in March 2019. The service issued a formal call for proposals regarding work to integrate the various systems into an actual prototype unmanned aircraft last month, saying it expected to hire multiple contractors to craft competing designs. The new Skyborg video features concept art with additional views of a notional loyal wingman-type drone that AFRL first showed publicly last year . The design, which has clear low-observable (stealthy) features, has a centrally-mounted main wing and v-tail. A top-mounted air intake at the rear of the fuselage feeds into a single small jet engine with a shrouded exhaust. A cutaway shows a modular equipment bay in the top of the forward fuselage, including what looks to be some kind of sensor, possibly meant to depict an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system, in the nose. This conceptual aircraft has two internal payload bays underneath the fuselage in between its tricycle landing gear. USAF USAF USAF USAF It’s important to note that there is no indication that this design is anything but a concept. However, it does highlight various features that AFRL appears to be interested in seeing on prototype drones for the Skyborg program. The video also details three general categories of priorities, described as “open,” “resilient,” and “autonomous” that are driving the Air Force’s requirements for the Skyborg system and the platform carrying it. USAF From when it first announced the project , the Air Force has focused heavily on its goals for Skyborg to use open-architecture and modular systems to enable the rapid insertion of new functionality and capabilities as time goes on by parties that might not have even been involved in its original development. The video also highlights the fact that the Skyborg systems are intended to be scalable and work on various platforms. AFRL has said in the past that the initial goal is to test Skyborg on a loyal wingman-type drone before moving on to a fighter jet-sized UCAV and that the systems could potentially find their way into manned aircraft, where they would act as a sort of artificial intelligence-driven virtual co-pilot . The Air Force has a separate effort underway, dubbed R2D2, after the famous droid from the Star Wars franchise who serves as a sort of robotic navigator and flight engineer, to develop a drone with a more robust autonomous air-to-air capability that could face off against a human fighter pilot as early as next year. You can read more about that project in this past War Zone piece . When it comes to Skyborg’s resiliency, what the Air Force means is that it has to have assured communications and navigation, as well as autonomy capabilities that will work even if its links to the outside world are jammed or spoofed . The need for aircraft, manned and unmanned, weapons, and other systems that can function in GPS-denied environments is a particularly important area of interest across the U.S. military. There is already extensive work being done on means of providing what is called Assured Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . There is a desire to keep the Skyborg systems, as well as the platforms carrying them, as low-cost as possible, too. The loyal wingman drones that the Air Force is exploring now are specifically supposed to be “ attritable ,” meaning that they would be cheap enough that commanders could employ them in situations where there would be greater risks of them not returning that would otherwise preclude the use of a more traditional reusable platform. As far as autonomy goes, the Air Force wants Skyborg to be capable of performing a broad range of tasks all by itself, ranging from simple things, such as taking off and landing, to more complex functionality, including making independent decisions dynamically based on various situational factors or a pre-defined objective. Drones with Skyborg would also be able to operate in networked groups tethered to manned aircraft in a loyal wingman capacity or operate fully untethered in an autonomous mode. The video includes a breakdown, seen below, of four more specific lines of effort that AFRL is pursuing with regards to Skyborg in support its broader goals. USAF With all this in mind, the video also includes a very interesting diagram showing how Skyborg would fit into the Air Force’s larger aerial combat ecosystem. Drones with the system would be primarily tasked with operating in contested areas, while non-stealthy manned aircraft would operate in uncontested environments. Stealth manned and unmanned platforms, potentially including true UCAVs , as well as expendable drones, which might include swarms of small unmanned aircraft , would take the fight into highly contested areas. Skyborg-equipped attritable drones, operating in this middle region, could support a wide variety of mission sets, including air-to-air and air-ground combat – described in the video as “OCA/DCA,” or Offensive Counter Air/Defense Counter Air, and “Munitions” – and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (IRS) tasks. It also mentions that some of these unmanned aircraft could carry elements of the future Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a command and control, communications, and data-sharing network architecture that the Air Force is working on separately. USAF capture Using these drones as communications and data-sharing nodes could be vital for sending critical information back and forth quickly between aircraft in the uncontested region and the highly contested region. The service has already been experimenting with the Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, which is also a frontrunner to carry the prototype Skyborg systems, in this relay role . The video indicates that Skyborg could ultimately support even more missions, such as close air support, interdiction, and “Next-Gen ISR/Strike,” the latter of which could refer to penetrating unmanned platforms including UCAVs. The Air Force is in the process of exploring future aerial combat concepts as part of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The video closes with a computer-generated clip of AFRL’s concept drone launching an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2020",British Government Says It Might Pass On $27M Upgrade For Some Of Its F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. government has disclosed for what appears to be the first time that it is not necessarily committed to eventually upgrading all 48 of the F-35B Joint Strike Fighters that it plans to buy with the still-in-development and increasingly costly Block 4 package . Jets without the updates would be left with more limited capabilities. This also raises questions about how existing and future F-35 operators might approach the same question. Jeremy Quin, the U.K. Minister for Defense Procurement and member of the country’s Conservative Party, offered this note about upgrading the F-35Bs in response to a question from Kevan Jones, a member of parliament from the opposition Labor Party, on June 23, 2020. Jane’s Gareth Jennings noted the exchange in Hansard, the official record of the proceedings of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, on Twitter. Jones asked “whether the F-35 Block 4 upgrade is already (a) costed and (b) budgeted for in the existing F-35 programme budget for the U.K.; how many aircraft will be upgraded; and what the forecast programme cost range is.” “The F-35 Block 4 upgrade has been included in the U.K. F-35 programme budget since its inception,” Quin responded. However, “decisions on the number of aircraft to be upgraded will be made on the basis of military capability requirements.” Much has been made about cost of retrofitting F-35 to Block 4 standard, with questions of affordability raised (over £22 m per a/c is a figure I've seen touted). AFAIK, this is the first time the gov has officially spoken to the possibility of not all UK F-35Bs being upgraded… pic.twitter.com/rn9DfF7PwD — Gareth Jennings (@GarethJennings3) June 24, 2020 The clear implication here is that while Block 4 has been a factor in the U.K. government’s budgeting around the F-35, that doesn’t mean that it plans to upgrade all 48 of the jets it expects to receive. Quin also declined to offer a figure for the total project cost of the upgrades, though Jennings noted that it has been reported to be as high as 22 million pounds – nearly $27.4 million at the rate of exchange at the time of writing – per aircraft in the past. The Block 4 package is slated to give all three variants of the Joint Strike Fighter the ability to use the latest sensor configurations. Among the future sensors for the F-35 will be a new Raytheon Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which allows the pilot to “see” in all directions, including through the fuselage, via video feeds projected on the visor of their helmets. You can read more about this system, and the existing Northrop Grumman AN/AAQ-37 DAS, in detail in this past War Zone piece . Jennings noted that the U.K. government has already signed on to add this new DAS, itself a costly upgrade, to its F-35Bs. The aircraft’s Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), which is based on out of date mid-2000s technology, will also be upgraded, among other sensor enhancements. Also worth noting that, aside from the Block 4 update, the UK has already committed itself to fitting its aircraft with the new Raytheon Distributed Aperture System. No costing for this given, but will likely take a large chunk out of any wider retrofit budget. — Gareth Jennings (@GarethJennings3) June 24, 2020 The Block 4 updates will also include the integration of new weaponry, such as the GBU-53/B StormBreaker precision-guided bomb and the SPEAR 3 miniature cruise missile , the latter of which is a U.K.-specific requirement. Some weapons that had been slated to come along with the Block 4 package are already being integrated, such as the AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW). It’s also worth noting that earlier this month, in response to a Freedom of information request, the U.K. government revealed that it has no plans to buy any 25mm gun pods for its F-35Bs. A briefing slide showing potential weapons to be added to F-35’s arsenal as part of the Block 4 upgrade package as of 2015. The Turkish weapons are no longer on the table given that that country has been ejected from the Joint Strike Fighter program. There is already integration work going on with regards to some of the others, including the JSOW., USN Regardless of what the package will or won’t include, the development of the Block 4 updates has been mired in delays and cost increases for some time now. In 2019, the Pentagon told Congress that the total estimated lifecycle costs of U.S. military F-35s had gone up by $22 billion entirely due to Block 4. At that time, the Pentagon said it expected to spend $1.196 trillion on operating and sustaining Joint Strike Fighters across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps through 2070. The year before, the F-35 Joint Program Office had announced plans to try to begin adding some Block 4 capabilities on a rolling basis as part of a concept known as Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2). It had already presented the possibility of breaking the upgrade package in four separate smaller updates referred to as Blocks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4. A concept called “ concurrency ” has long imposed a variety of costs on the F-35 program from the very beginning . Under this plan, Lockheed Martin began actually building Joint Strike Fighters knowing full well that there would be a need to insert fixes and modifications over time, albeit the scale and scope of those rework requirements were grossly underestimated. The idea, in theory, was that this was supposed to reduce costs by ramping up production earlier than normal. Lockheed Martin In practice, the decision drove up costs, created schedule delays, and has created a need for costly fixes and updates. Just today, Defense News reported that Lockheed Martin had disclosed a new issue with the Onboard Inert Gas Generation Systems (OIGGS) on U.S. Air Force F-35As, saying that it “appears this anomaly is occurring in the field after aircraft delivery,” which could point to the need for a new fix of some kind. The OIGGS fills empty space within the aircraft’s fuel tanks with nitrogen-enriched air, mitigating the risk that an aircraft suffering a lightning strike on the ground or in the air could experience a catastrophic explosion. This is a long-standing issue that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The rolling nature of these required reworks has also created a situation wherein there are many sub-configurations within the young fleet of F-35s, creating additional difficulties for both operating and maintaining the jets. Some of the earliest U.S. military examples are simply not fully combat capable and have been relegated to training and test and evaluation roles . The long-troubled Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, a cloud-based computer system that handles a host of maintenance and operational planning tasks, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece and is now set to be replaced , struggles with this reality. The continuing issuing of spare parts that simply don’t work on certain aircraft and the misdiagnosis of problems contributes substantially to high sustainment costs and low readiness rates . While F-35 operators outside of the United States, such as the United Kingdom, which received their aircraft later on, or have yet to even take delivery of their first examples, have escaped some of the worst impacts of concurrency, the Block 4 upgrade presents a new additional sustainment cost issue. Even if much of the research and development work has been paid for already, the remaining costs to actually update the jets will still be high. Certain modifications are especially cost-intensive given how hard it is to upgrade the aircraft’s physical structure due to its fixed mold-line built and the high-level of integrated across its systems. If the U.K. government does expect the unit cost of the upgrade package to be around $27.4 million, that would amount to increasing the purchase price of the jets by roughly a quarter or more. There have already been questions about whether there might be cuts to the planned British F-35 fleet in the face of other budget uncertainty in recent years. Other existing F-35 operators will have to make similar choices about the costs and benefits of upgrading their jets when the Block 4 package arrives. Even the newest Joint Strike Fighter customers, such as Poland , which expects to receive its first examples in 2024, could be impacted. As of 2019 , the Joint Program Office’s timeline for Block 4 had the very first production aircraft with the upgrades getting delivered in the 2023 Fiscal Year. That is all dependent on the development of the upgrade package proceeding as planned and getting delivered in full by that time. Aircraft delivered with some form of interim Block 4 update could still need updates depending on the operator’s exact requirements and the state of the upgrade package at the time of rolling off of the assembly line. Joint Strike Fighter operators could certainly use aircraft without the upgrades for training or test and evaluation roles, just as the branches of the U.S. military have done with their older aircraft. However, for smaller operators, relegating some of the handful of jets they have to primarily non-combat missions would reduce the overall combat capacity of their F-35 fleets and would result in mismatched fleet management. All told, the U.K. government’s ambiguous statement about whether or not it will upgrade all of its F-35Bs with the Block 4 package only further underscores the difficulties and growing costs that Joint Strike Fighter operators will continue to have to mitigate and defray as time goes on in order to get the most out of their F-35 fleets. There is no doubt that the Block 4 enhancements are extremely important to helping the F-35 realize its full potential, but they are going to come at a hefty cost that some operators may not be willing to bear.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",F-22 Raptors Could Become Aggressors Under Air Force’s Radical New Training Plan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The impacts of the Pentagon’s short-sighted decision to stop buying F-22 Raptor stealth fighters after the production of just 195 examples have long been visible in the high costs to operate and maintain the jets and historically low readiness rates across the relatively small fleet. All of this limits how much the Air Force can get out of what is arguably its most capable air-to-air aerial combat platform. While the idea of building more Raptors is off the table , the service is hoping that radical changes to how it trains its fighter pilots will free up more of these planes for combat missions or use as high-end “red air” aggressors . Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, which oversees the bulk of the service’s active-duty fighter jet fleets, outlined what Project Reforge , a potentially revolutionary pilot training concept he has been at the forefront of developing, could mean for the F-22s , on June 22, 2020. Holmes offered the details during a video conference the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute hosted as part of its Aerospace Nation talk series. “Part of what we’re trying to do is see if we could create more capacity without spending more money,” Holmes explained. “We can take some of that training-coded iron and turn it into combat-coded iron. We already paid for it, we already paid for the people that fly it.” Project Reforge, which Holmes first laid out publicly himself in a 2019 op-ed for War On The Rocks , aims to fundamentally up-end Air Force fighter pilot training, and potentially pilot training in general. Among the most radical changes would be the possibility of effectively eliminating Formal Training Units (FTU), which serve as the last step for a student pilot before they go to an operational squadron. Right now, future fight pilots go from a phase called Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals , or IFF, to an FTU, and then to their assigned operational unit. Under the Project Reforge plan, T-7A Red Hawk jet trainers, previously known as the T-X , might be assigned to the bases with operational fighter jet squadrons. Instead of going to an FTU, student pilots could then complete the last part of their training in the T-7A before effectively walking across the ramp to join an operational squadron, whether it be one operating the F-22 or some other type. Graphical representations of the existing pilot training cycle, at left, and a Project Reforge concept relying heavily on the T-7A, at left., via War On The Rocks The Air Force hopes that the final version of this concept, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , could trim back to the total time it takes to prepare new fighter pilots from the 40 months it takes at present down to as little as 22 months . Getting rid of the need for the FTUs, or even just substantially reducing the number of training sorties they need to support, also means the Air Force could use the aircraft assigned to those units for other purposes. David Timm, a contractor on the ACC staff who has also been heavily involved in Project Reforge, told Air Force Magazine for a piece it published last week that between 60 and 70 percent of sorties that the 43rd Fighter Squadron, the F-22 FTU, is performing now have to do with teaching relatively basic skills. “Teaching those skills sooner, with an advanced trainer [such as the T-7], you’re able to save 50 percent of the training days; or 60 percent of the F-22 sorties that we allocate for training in an FTU, and squadrons can use that money to focus on combat training,” he explained. Freeing up any aircraft types for other duties, or even more specialized training, through Project Reforge could be beneficial across the board, but it would be especially so for small fleets, such as the F-22s. At present, the Air Force only has 185 Raptors, in total, following a crash in May , around 125 of which are assigned to combat-coded units. The remaining 60 aircraft are assigned to training and test and evaluation units. As of 2017, the 43rd Fighter Squadron had around 31 jets . If the Air Force could reassign those jets to operational squadrons, or even create an additional operational squadron, it would grow the total number of combat-coded Raptors by nearly 25 percent effectively overnight. USAF Even if there was a need to keep some F-22s dedicated to pilot training activities, freeing up any additional aircraft could be a boon to the fleet overall. Holmes highlighted how the Raptors’ readiness rates increased when the service made the decision to consolidate its previous six operational squadrons, each with between 18 and 21 jets, into just five, each with 24 fighters. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, recommended doing just this in order to realize “maintenance efficiencies because people, equipment, and parts can be shared” in 2018. After Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, then the Air Force’s main F-22 base, later that year, the Air Force had an additional impetus to implement that plan. Holmes did note that there could be hurdles to transitioning training aircraft, which are generally older models that lack many recent upgrades, to operational units. He said that ACC asks “every year” to upgrade all of the aircraft to the latest standard, but that the Air Force’s top leadership declines in favor of other priorities. It’s possible that, if Project Reforge works, it would become more of a priority to update these jets. This could be an extremely costly proposition , but it might be offset by the added capability these fully modernized jets would offer. Having the full fleet in the latest configuration also increase available F-22 combat capacity during a major crisis or contingency, even if subtantial numbers of Raptors remained assigned to training or test and evaluation units. “The older-block F-22s, they’re already combat capable, even without bringing them up to the higher standard,” he added. “I’d certainly pick one of those over some of our legacy airplanes if I had to go fight.” USAF At the same time, Holmes said the Air Force could also look to consolidate its oldest Raptors and use them as advanced “red air” aggressors, something F-22s already do on a more limited basis . Even if there is a need to retain the FTU in at least some form, the reduction in the total number of necessary general training sorties could allow the service to devote more Raptor flight hours to this purpose. “With the two operational squadrons here [at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia], and the red air requirements for them and the red air requirements for the FTU, [we’re asking], Can we kind of trade airplanes among each other and make an effective use of the older airplanes in a red air role while we save our limited modernization dollars for … newer airplanes?'” Holmes explained. While older aircraft can adequately simulate a variety of existing threats, there will only be an increasing need for more advanced aggressors for Air Force fighter pilots to practice against as potential opponents, such as Russia and China , field their own stealthy and otherwise advanced combat jets. The service has already announced plans to shift some of its oldest F-35As into a new aggressor squadron to meet this growing demand. All of this is, of course, predicated on Project Reforge delivering the promised results. During his talk, Holmes acknowledged that the Air Force would have to experiment and refine the concept before it could ever be implemented on a wide scale. At the same time, the T-7 trainers that could support the new training plan are still some time away from entering service. There is also been talk about how derivative of that aircraft , notionally referred to as the F/T-7 or TF-7, might be necessary to provide suitably advanced capabilities in the final stages of the training regimen. The Air Force is also looking at other roles for the T-7 , or derivatives thereof, including employing them as aggressors . T-7A Red Hawks., Boeing ACC had looked at leasing a fleet of between four and eight South Korean KAI T-50 Golden Eagle advanced jet trainer aircraft by way of a sole-source contract to Texas-based Hillwood Aviation as a way to get experimenting with Project Reforge sooner rather than later. The command has now decided to hold an open competition, a process that will take longer to complete, to find a suitable fleet of jet trainers. No matter how it proceeds now, if the Air Force can make Project Reforge work, it could revolutionize how the service trains its pilots, in general, and provide a host of other second-order benefits, especially for its F-22 fleet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 6, 2020",Unprecedented Public Report On UFOs Requested From Senate Intel Committee,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of the U.S. Senate have expressed concern that the U.S. military, as well as other federal government agencies , have not been giving the appropriate amount of attention to reports of encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena , or UAP, more commonly referred to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, which may be linked to America’s adversaries . They are now looking to order the Director of National Intelligence to work with other relevant agencies to produce a report detailing just what information they have on UAPs already , how that data is collected and processed , how it is getting shared, and just what kind of threats or other risks these objects might pose. The call for the UAP review was included in a report accompanying a draft of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 that Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, submitted on behalf of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 17, 2020. Danny Silva of the SilvaRecord.com was the first to report on the document. “The Committee supports the efforts of the Unidentified Aerial  Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence to standardize collection and reporting on unidentified aerial phenomenon, any links they have to adversarial foreign governments, and the threat they pose to U.S. military assets and installations,” the committee report says. “However, the Committee remains concerned that there is no unified, comprehensive process within the Federal Government for collecting and analyzing intelligence on unidentified aerial phenomena, despite the potential threat. The Committee understands that the relevant intelligence may be sensitive; nevertheless, the Committee finds that the information sharing and coordination across the Intelligence Community has been inconsistent, and this issue has lacked attention from senior leaders.” So, what Rubio and his colleagues are now asking for is a report on these issues, within 180 days, that the Director of National Intelligence, together with the Secretary of Defense, and any other parties they deem relevant, would produce and that would be primarily unclassified, though it could have additional details in a classified annex. The review would have to cover the following points: 1. A detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence reporting collected or held by the Office of Naval Intelligence, including data and intelligence reporting held by the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force; 2. A detailed analysis of unidentified phenomena data collected by: a. geospatial intelligence; b. signals intelligence; c. human intelligence; and d. measurement and signals intelligence; 3. A detailed analysis of data of the FBI, which was derived from investigations of intrusions of unidentified aerial phenomena data over restricted United States airspace; 4. A detailed description of an interagency process for ensuring timely data collection and centralized analysis of all unidentified aerial phenomena reporting for the Federal Government, regardless of which service or agency acquired the information; 5. Identification of an official accountable for the process described in paragraph 4; 6. Identification of potential aerospace or other threats posed by the unidentified aerial phenomena to national security, and an assessment of whether this unidentified aerial phenomena activity may be attributed to one or more foreign adversaries; 7. Identification of any incidents or patterns that indicate a potential adversary may have achieved breakthrough aerospace capabilities that could put United States strategic or conventional forces at risk; and 8. Recommendations regarding increased collection of data, enhanced research and development, and additional funding and other resources. The full section regarding the UAP reporting requirement from the Senate’s draft Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021., US Senate It’s important to note that Senate still has to finalize its Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 and they will have to reconcile it with its companion in the House of Representatives. Both chambers then have to pass it and President Donald Trump has to sign it into law. Even then, the additional guidance in this accompanying report is non-binding. It’s also worth noting that this committee report, as well as the existing draft of the latest Intelligence Authorization Act, have classified annexes, which may have additional provisions regarding UAPs, though there is no way to tell for certain. However, the public request for a report by itself includes a number of significant new details, including, right up front, that the Navy has a dedicated task force focused on this issue. For reasons that remain unexplained, and that The War Zone has delved into in detail in the past, the Navy is the service at the center of all of the major publicized UAP encounters in the past two decades. There have been virtually no significant public comments from the rest of the U.S. military regarding any similar events. It is known that the Navy has been the service providing classified briefings on UAPs to senior members of Congress ever since the New York Times published its first detailed exposé on the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), and its predecessors , which also focused in part on investigating reports of unidentified aerial objects, in 2017. Some legislators have already expressed their concerns about the substance of the information that service has been providing, whether the known UAP encounters represent potential threats to national security, and whether those issues are being taken seriously, as the War Zone , among others, has reported in the past . The specific mention that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been collecting information about UAP sightings is also notable, if not surprising, as well. The bureau was among the U.S. government agencies that were known to be involved in the investigations into still unexplained sightings of unidentified objects flying over various parts of Colorado and Nebraska, including near sensitive U.S. Air Force facilities, between December 2019 and January 2020, though there’s no indication this incident was a direct factor in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence request. The War Zone has continued to explore that story in detail, which you can read more about here and here . In addition to information from the Navy and the FBI specifically, the Senate wants to see any other data on UAPs derived from basically any other intelligence sources and methods available to the U.S. government. It specifically mentions geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), and measurement and signals intelligence (MASINT). Perhaps the most interesting, and worrisome, part of this provision is the apparent admission that the Senators in charge of overseeing America’s intelligence-gathering activities do not already have a good understanding of the interagency process for the centralized collection and analysis of data on UAPs from across the federal government, or who might be the top official in charge of that process, if it exists. It’s hard to understand how this could be the case after all this time given the possibility that these encounters could reflect threats to U.S. national security, including directly from America’s potential adversaries, something The War Zone has regularly highlighted when discussing these events in the past . What the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s wants out of this report only underscores these concerns. The committee’s stipulations focus heavily on potential foreign involvement in these events, such as whether these UAP encounters can “be attributed to one or more foreign adversaries” and if they are indicators of “ breakthrough aerospace capabilities ,” rather than outright fears about any sort of potential extraterrestrial activity, but some may still interpret this as ambiguous. Last month, The War Zone was first to report on new information obtained via the Freedom of Information Act regarding encounters between Navy pilots and UAPs along the East Coast of the United States in recent years that specifically described many of the objects as familiar man-made designs or balloon-like objects. On top of all of this, it is also notable that members of the Senate are seeking an unclassified review of these issues that they could release to the American people. If this comes to pass, this could easily become one of the most significant publicly available official reports on UAP/UFO encounters since the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book studies in the 1950s and 1960s. If still remains to be seen how the Director of National Intelligence will respond to this request, but the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s inclusion of it in their report is a clear indicator there is a desire among at least some lawmakers to get more information about what the U.S. military, as well as other agencies, known about UAPs and what threats they might present to the United States.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The USAF Is Finally Ditching The Last Of Its Cold War Revolvers For New Semi-Auto Pistols,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it will finally replace the very last of its .38 Special caliber M15 revolvers with the compact variant of the U.S. Army’s new 9mm Modular Handgun System pistol , the M18. This will bring the service’s history with the six-shooters, once the primary sidearm of its military police elements, a title it held for more than 30 years, to an end for good. On Mar. 1, 2019 , the Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC) announced that it had begun shipping the first M18s out to units across the service. These new pistols will first take the place of the service’s existing 9mm Beretta M9s , but will eventually supplant the last Smith & Wesson M15s , as well as Sig Sauer M11A1s . Air Force Office of Special Investigations agents carry the latter handguns, which are easier to conceal during plainclothes assignments. In January 2017 , the Army first announced it had picked variants of Sig Sauer’s P320 pistol to become the full-size M17 and compact M18 and all of the other branches of the U.S. military, not just the Air Force, are now looking to adopt one or both types. The M15s, however, have already been largely out of Air Force service since the adoption of the M9. In 1992, the Air Force officially stopped issuing the revolvers, which had been in continuous service since 1956. Today, the only place where these revolvers are still in service are at the AFSFC as part of the Military Working Dog (MWD) training program, also known as the K9 program. It is possible to train dogs to identify gunshots as something of particular interest or even sniff out firearms . Just acclimatizing working dogs to the sound of gunfire is also an important part of their training to ensure that they don’t get distracted or too scared to carry out their tasks during a gunfight. “The Air Force Security Forces K9 program uses the revolvers to conduct gunfire training with blank ammunition for the dogs,” Vicki Stein, a spokesperson for the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC), which oversees the AFSFC, told The War Zone in an Email. “We do this because we don’t have a system to turn the M9 into a blank firing weapon.” The M18 pistol, which will eventually replace the last M15s., USAF Semi-automatic handguns, such as the M9, may not function reliability when using blank ammunition. Typical revolvers do not rely on any byproducts from the cartridge firing to work properly, allowing a shooter to switch from regular rounds to blanks and back again without any modifications or issues. So, despite having been out service in the Air Force as a sidearm for decades, the M15 has remained a perfectly acceptable training aid for this specific purpose. Air Force Security Forces personnel do not use the weapons for any live-fire training. An Air Force Security Forces dog handler wields an M15 revolver during a training exercise., USAF The M15 itself is a good, proven design that Smith & Wesson originally introduced in 1949 as the K-38 Combat Masterpiece . The company subsequently renamed it the Model 15 as part of a rebranding of its guns in the 1950s. It was a shorter barrel version of the K-38 Target Masterpiece , or Model 14. Both of these handguns were derivatives of the older Model 10 , which the company first began making in 1899. Between 2009 and 2011, Smith & Wesson discontinued production of all three of these revolvers, among others, but their continued popularity led to a commercial comeback as part of a “Classics” line. The company still sells a variant of the Model 10 more than a century after it first appeared on the market. A World War II-era Smith and Wesson Model 10., Oleg Volk via Wikimedia The M15, as well as other related Smith & Wesson revolvers, saw widespread use across the U.S. military, but the Air Force became a particularly prolific user. The first Air Force unit to receive the guns was the Strategic Air Command (SAC) Elite Guard, which was in charge of protecting SAC’s Headquarters and its commander General Curtis E. LeMay. But it soon became the primary weapon for the Air Police, the Air Force name for its military police units at the time. In 1966, these elements became known as Security Police and then, in 1997, they received a new name, Security Forces . The revolvers also subsequently became the default sidearm for combat aircraft crews and went into pilot survival kits . The service even introduced its own more powerful, higher velocity .38 caliber cartridge, called the PGU-12/B , in the 1960s. In the 1970s, as the U.S. military as a whole began to consider switching to 9mm handguns, which would eventually lead to the adoption of the M9, the Air Force looked into converting M15s to this caliber. As of 1974, the service still had 100,000 of these revolvers in its armories. But the M15’s time in Air Force service of any kind now is now coming to an end. The Army’s M17 and M18 are set to become the standard sidearms across all the branches of the U.S. military. The Air Force has since decided on the M18 as the default choice, regardless of who gets issued them and for what purpose. The service had evaluated the M17, including conducting tests to see what hazards the full-size pistol might pose to an ejecting pilot , before settling on the smaller version. A member of the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center makes adjustments to a dummy in device that simulates the effects of an ejection. The mock pilot is wearing a pair of holstered M17 pistols on its chest., USAF The primary difference between the M17 and the M18 is that the former has a barrel around 4.7-inches long, while the latter’s is only around four inches. The smaller variant can still accept the same 17-round standard size and 21-round extended magazines. It has the same general modular design, allowing armorers to readily swap out the frame to better suit the shoot’s hands, too. This also means the guns are more rapidly customizable for different roles in general, which you can read about more here . It’s this modularity that will help it take the place of the M15s, too. There are already drop-in kits on the market to easily convert the P320 to a blank-firing gun without making any permanent modifications and the Air Force has said it is looking into buying just such a system in the near future. A Sig Sauer product sheet for the commercial P320 showing various parts that users can easily swap out. The M17 and M18 retain this level of modularity., Sig Sauer Though the M15 has been an available option as a blank-firing training aid, one has to imagine the costs and complexities of continuing to use a small number of these revolvers, and the ammunition to go with them, has grown over the years. No other service still uses these guns or any other weapon chambered in .38 caliber. Having the AFSFC’s K9 program use the same pistols as everyone else can only make things simpler all around. “Once this new weapon system [the M18] is fielded, there will be future modifications,” Master Sergeant Courtney King of the AFSFC said in a video the Air Force posted online in February 2019, seen below, giving a basic rundown of the new pistols. These include “blank firing kits for MWDs [Military Working Dogs], Simunition kits for force-on-force training, and [sound] suppression kits for special missions.” Simunition is one brand of non-lethal training ammunition that gives military and law enforcement personnel a way to conduct simulated live-firing training against each other. Simunition and other companies provide conversion kits for various small arms that make only minimal changes to the existing gun so that the manual of arms – the general process of operating the weapon and its specific features – remains unchanged. The mention of adding a sound suppressor to the M18 package for special missions is one of the first indicators that the Air Force, at least, may be considering pushing the pistol to its special operations units. The U.S. military’s special operations community as a whole has become increasingly fond of Glock pistols in recent years. Glock had made a bid for the Army’s Modular Handgun System contract, but lost out to the Sig Sauer guns. What is clear is that the Air Force’s first priority is to issue enough M18s to replace the thousands of M9 spread across its units. Then it will move onto issuing the pistols in place of other guns, such as the service’s remaining Cold War-era revolvers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Private pilot Gabriel Zeifman is up to his usual aviation adventures once again, which sometimes includes traversing unusual airspace that is often off-limits to commercial and private air traffic. He has buzzed around the perimeter of Area 51 and through restricted ranges throughout the region, all legally with air traffic control’s permission. Now Zeifman took his little Cessna over the top of Beale Air Force Base in Northern California, home of the U-2 Dragon Lady and RQ-4 Global Hawk spy planes, along with the U-2 community’s black T-38 Talon trainers, and a squadron of KC-135R tankers, and snapped some photos along the way. The images are fascinating as always, but one area, in particular, is especially intriguing. The images show the storied base in its latest configuration. It is a relatively spartan airfield considering its huge strategic importance, with just one runway for its aircraft to use. Where SR-71 Blackbirds once sat, RQ-4 Global Hawk drones sit today. The U-2, which has called the base home for the better part of a century, is slated to continue flying into the foreseeable future, while a substantial portion of the RQ-4 Global Hawks—the Block 30 model—that were originally intended to replace them, may meet an early retirement . Still, the most capable Block 40 Global Hawks will continue on. Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman One major change on the base in recent months, according to satellite imagery, is the move of the T-38s from the northern part of the ramp with their own independent hangar, down to the central part of the ramp, where large sunshades have been erected to keep the black jets out of the baking sun. The hangar that once supported them has also gone through a heavy rework over the winter, with a new roof and structural modifications, the addition of heavy environmental systems, and what looks like a large fuel tank, right next door. A fence now surrounds that entire facility, as well, including its access to the general apron area. It isn’t clear if parts of this fence are temporary, although a more permanent security fence could easily be installed to encapsulate the facility and its own apron area. Gabriel Zeifman Last fall, Aviation Week’s Guy Norris posted the famed outlet’s latest report on the so-called RQ-180, a very stealthy, deep-penetrating, high-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned aircraft that could take on a similar role as a Global Hawk, and possibly more, but it can do so in highly contested environments. We have talked about the existence of this aircraft for years . At the time of Aviation Week publishing its report, Norris claimed that the operational unit that could be flying the all but fully admitted to secret aircraft is now based out of Beale, as well as possibly a number of RQ-180s. This would make sense for obvious reasons, but at the time, as we pointed out, there was nowhere highly secure and modified to a low observable (stealthy) aircraft’s special needs to put such an aircraft on the base. Now, with this new hangar rehabilitation with its curious features, this may no longer be the case. 2018 photo of the same hangar, the year before its major remodel began., Google Earth The hangar’s location is in a relatively remote part of the ramp and in a higher-security area of the installation that has very easy access to the end of the runway. Having its own fuel farm would also be very convenient for operating a sensitive platform independently and under tight security restrictions at an active base with less sensitive operations ongoing daily. Even touching the aircraft’s exotically coated skin would likely require special clearances. Is it possible that this facility could end up being used for something else? Absolutely. Maybe the T-38s will return to this ramp in the near future or the facility will be used for another purpose. But a lot is lining up here that points otherwise and the size of the hangar, roughly 200 feet wide, would probably allow for at least a couple of the secretive drones to be housed there. These aircraft would exist in very small numbers, so it wouldn’t be surprising for two of them to be based at Beale at this stage of the program, with more of them joining them over time and as more specialized facilities come available. If all this is indeed the case, the RQ-180’s transition from out of the black and into the gray may be imminent. We will be talking about this and so much more in our long-in-the-works RQ-180 feature. So, stay tuned for that.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",New Marine One VH-92A Helicopters Could Be Joined By Fleet Of CH-92A Trainer-Transports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is considering buying five additional Sikorsky S-92 helicopters to complement a planned fleet of 23 VH-92As , which are set to become the newest “ Marine Ones ” responsible for shuttling the president, their family, and their closest advisors around at home and abroad. The extra helicopters, which the service is tentatively referring to as CH-92As, would have less extensive modifications and would be used for training duties and for less critical logistics missions, such as flying around the White House staff and the media pool. The U.S. Marine Corps squadron that flies the president around refers to aircraft that perform this role as ‘green tops,” while the Marine One helicopters are ‘white tops.’ The House Armed Service’s Committee Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee highlighted the ongoing internal discussions about the potential purchase of the five CH-92As in a press release on June 22, 2020. The release was focused on the subcommittee’s desired additions to the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year. The members of the subcommittee are now looking to require the Navy to submit a full report on its requirement for these helicopters, including a cost/benefit analysis. The Navy is managing the purchase of the 23 VH-92As, but all but two will go to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), which will use them to replace all of the existing VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters in its white top presidential airlift fleet. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to retain the remaining pair for continued test and evaluation purposes. “Helicopter pilots assigned to HMX-1 go through an extensive pilot conversion training syllabus prior to flying the Presidential missions. The committee recognizes that adding the CH-92A aircraft would enable pilots to maintain monthly and annual flight time minimums without impacting operational Presidential lift assets,” the additions to the draft Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA says. “The committee also notes that newly assigned aircraft crew chiefs and maintenance personnel could start training on the CH-92A while awaiting their security clearances, a process that can take up to a year to complete.” A pair of VH-92As fly in formation., Blend Qatipi At present, at least publicly , no other units within the U.S. military beyond HMX-1 and NAVAIR fly or expect to fly S-92 variants. In 2018, the Marine Corps’ had planned to set aside four VH-92As for pilot and maintenance training. However, this would have limited the availability of those airframes, nearly a fifth of HMX-1’s total fleet, for their primary mission. In addition, as the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee noted, the exact specifics of the configuration of the VH-92As, which are designed to protect the nation’s top executive and keep them in secure contact with other senior officials at all times, are highly classified . This means that incoming personnel need the right clearances and have to pass through the appropriate, but time-consuming vetting process to get them. Until then, they can’t train on those helicopters. The security around the white tops is so tight that the helicopters are literally caged in their hangar apart from their green top stablemates when housed at HMX-1’s base in Quantico, Virginia. In its 2019 Aviation Plan, the Marine Corps said it wanted to acquire two CH-92As for HMX-1 for training purposes in 2023. That proposed fleet has now grown to five helicopters, according to the Committee Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, but it’s not clear if the potential delivery schedule has changed. A chart showing the projected structure of HMX-1’s helicopter fleets through the 2029 Fiscal Year, including the possible acquisition of two CH-92A, as of 2019., USMC At the same time, the mission sets that the Navy and Marines are considering for the CH-92As have also grown to include supporting the less critical logistics missions that HMX-1’s green tops perform. The ‘green side’ of HMX-1, which presently has a dozen MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors, is primarily responsible for moving around White House staff, members of the media, specialized quick reaction forces , Secret Service personnel , and other official guests, in support of presidential missions. It’s also worth noting that the squadron, as a whole, also has an operational test and evaluation mission. The green side’s V-22B Osprey tilt-rotor cadre is held to different standards of training, readiness, and security. The Osprey offers impressive speed and range, especially compared to the existing VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns , which could be especially useful for responding on short notice to any sort of emergency. However, the MV-22Bs are also maintenance-intensive and costly to operate and offer capabilities that are not always required. An MV-22B Osprey belonging to HMX-1’s “green side.”, USMC Beyond that, their powerful rotors place significant restrictions on where they can touch down during routine flight operations due to the risks the downwash poses to bystanders and nearby structures. The downward-blasting hot exhaust from the engines when they are rotated up at high angles can also damage the ground below. These issues are very real. An Osprey demonstration on Memorial Day in 2010 in Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island in New York City notably sent tree branches flying and injured 10 spectators . The Marine Corps limited MV-22B operations in Nepal in the wake of a massive earthquake in 2015 for fear that the downwash could knock down damaged buildings . There have also been concerns about the damage the downwash from the VH-92A’s rotor might do to the ground below, especially when it has to land inside the White House grounds, but it is far less of an issue than with the MV-22B and there has been work done already to mitigate its impact . Regardless, it’s not hard to see how the CH-92As could provide useful support when there isn’t a need for the MV-22Bs. The helicopters could provide a more direct replacement for the green top CH-46 Sea Knights, which HMX-1 retired after the Ospreys arrived. There was the possibility in the past that the squadron might recieve CH-53K King Stallions to replace the CH-53D and E models it had operated over the years, but there are no plans to do so at present. The CH-53K program has long been beset by technical difficulties and delays, which has caused the unit price of those helicopters to grow, all of which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . A CH-46 Sea King belonging to HMX-1’s green side in 2011. The unit has since retired these helicopters. , Andy Rusch via Wikimedia A green side CH-53E Super Stallion., Christopher Ebdon via Flickr A purchase of CH-92As for HMX-1 could also raise the possibility of the Navy acquiring more S-92s for other purposes. Other units within the U.S. military, might also have an interest in buying them, as well. Of course, the Navy has not yet made a firm decision on whether to buy the five CH-92As for HMX-1. It will also have to get Congress to approve the funds for the purchases, if it decides to go that route. The proposed additions to the Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA from the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee makes clear that at least some legislators want more information before they sign off any such plan. “The committee expects this report to provide a cost/benefit analysis of acquiring CH-92A aircraft and an assessment of the risk that potential industrial base changes, including a manufacturing facility closure, would pose to the ability to meet a validated trainer aircraft requirement,” the section on the CH-92A in the draft NDAA states. “The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92) directed an assessment of risks to the VH-92A industrial base, but the response received from the Secretary of the Navy provided none of the requested information or analysis.” The Marines expect HMX-1 to reach initial operational capability with the VH-92A this year and hope to have received the total fleet of helicopters by 2023. If plans to acquire a CH-92A fleet move ahead, the squadron could begin operating those helicopters in the same general time frame.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 22, 2020",Instructor Fighter Pilot Screams “Kill Him! Kill Him!” At Student In Hilarious Dogfight Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Oh, the difference a good teacher makes. That is a true axiom for just about anything, but when it comes to learning to fly a Cessna 152 or a T-38 Talon, a good flight instructor can be crucial to making your flying dreams come true. This is also true when learning how to go from flying a plane to fighting in one. There are endless stories about military pilots’ struggles to catch on to the ridiculously complex art of combat jet flying. Even many of the best of the best got hung up at one point or another in training and really needed extra attention to get them over it so that they could go on to master their trade. With that in mind, the video below, which shows the heads-up display in a T-38C Talon trainer, is a great example of uniquely motivating your pupil and having some fun while doing it. The video appears to have been shot during the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals syllabus, which serves as the foundation for a future U.S. Air Force fighter pilot’s career following undergraduate pilot training. The Air force describes IFF as such : IFF is an eight-week course designed to transform newly graduated pilots selected to fly fighters into fighter wingmen. The 49th Fighter Training Squadron teaches pilots the discipline, attitude and culture of what it takes to be at the peak of combat aviation. “It’s their first glimpse of the fighter culture,” said Maj. Michael Overstreet, 49th FTS assistant director of operations. “We are a fighter squadron. All of our instructors are fighter pilots. We have a culture that is unique and to our own.” Before a pilot enters IFF, they must earn their wings by graduating Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training, a 53-week course designed to teach students aircraft flight characteristics, emergency procedures, takeoff and landing procedures, aerobatics and formation flying. To ease the transition into more complex fighter aircraft, such as the F-22 Raptor and the F-35A Lightning II, IFF builds upon training learned in SUPT with a focus on the basic fundamentals of tactical aviation in the familiarity of the T-38C Talon. “We try to help shallow the learning curve from pilot training to that B-course, or formal training,” said Capt. Cole Stegeman, 49th FTS chief of scheduling. “That’s why we use this program as a means of that indoctrination of fighter culture and what it means to be a fighter pilot.” In addition to learning the basic fundamentals, students are taught how to become better wingmen. As a fighter pilot, you never fly alone. The term ‘wingman’ is not just a phrase, it’s a specific term that means so much more in IFF and carries a lot of responsibility in the world of aviation. Wingmen have the supporting role in the flight. They help the flight lead plan and organize the mission. They have visual lookout and sensor responsibilities and provide backup navigation for the flight as required. Wingmen execute as briefed or when directed by the flight lead and provide mutual support throughout all phases of the mission. DoD The video seems to have surfaced about ten years ago. From what I can summarize, it is of a student in a T-38C getting a handle on basic fighter maneuvers (BFM), more commonly and broadly referred to as dogfighting, in a one versus one engagement. You can see the gun funnel HUD symbology flop around as he struggles a bit to get the T-38’s nose pointed in the right direction to take advantage of his foe, then opportunity strikes! His instructor, gleefully declares ‘there’s the overshoot! Kill the motherfucker!” A number of maneuvers are executed with corrective commentary coming from the instructor in the backseat before the student has his adversary nearly in his sights. Sensing a kill is near, the instructor starts doing his best Sam Kinison impression, screaming in blood-curdling fashion “Go get him! Kill him! Kill him! Killlll himmmmm! Put the nose on him and killl himmmmmm! Come on he’s out front, shoot him!” Meanwhile, the student exclaims frustratingly “I’m trying! Aaaaaaaahhhhh!” Then, right as the student’s jet hits ‘bingo fuel’—alerting that there is just enough gas to return to base—and the fight is called off, he has his opponent in his gun funnel and his instructor lets loose a Joker-like victorious laugh. Check out this little gem of a video below, as well as a bit tamer T-38C BFM instruction tape below it (also note the difference in energy states): The HUD tape is hilarious and it really does underscore just how aggressive and ‘fangs out’ dogfighting is . I have heard countless stories about the lowest key guy in the squadron being just an animal when it comes to the dogfight. It seems to bring out a colorful part of some pilots’ personalities. And really, for good reason. If it happens in real life, it is very possible either you or the other guy won’t go home in their plane, or at all. The stakes are incredibly high and should you lose, many others could be put in danger as a result. So, here’s to you T-38C instructor pilot. Truly a teacher that is molding students’ lives through extra care! Just don’t use the same teaching style when your kid gets their learner’s permit, ok!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 2, 2020",Congress Pushes Navy To Add Hypersonic Missiles To Its Stealthy Destroyers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking to direct the U.S. Navy to start working on arming its Zumwalt class stealthy destroyers with the new Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic missile within the next six months or so. As it stands now, the service only plans to integrate this weapon on its future Block V Virginia class submarines and the four Ohio class submarines configured as guided missile submarines , or SSGNs. This push in Congress could lead to a major shift in plans for these missiles and might finally lead to the elimination of the 155mm Advanced Gun Systems on the Zumwalts , also referred as the DDG-1000 class, for which there is no ammunition available at present. The House Armed Services Committee’s Strategic Forces Subcommittee wants to include the provision to add the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , to the Zumwalts in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the 2021 Fiscal Year. On June 21, 2020, this subcommittee publicly released the text of this and other sections that it is hoping to make part of the final NDAA. “The  Secretary [of the Navy] shall initiate such transfer of [Conventional Prompt Strike] technologies to DDG–1000 class destroyers by not later than January 1, 2021.” The Conventional Prompt Strike system is the Navy’s version of a hypersonic weapon it is developing jointly with the U.S. Army . Both services will use a common missile and hypersonic boost-glide vehicle warhead design in their respective sea and land-based launch systems. An infographic the Army has released regarding its Long Range Hypersonic Weapon, which will use the same missile and hypersonic boost-glide vehicle warhead as the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike., US Army A hypersonic boost-glide vehicle is an unpowered hypersonic weapon. A rocket booster first gets it to the desired altitude and speed, after which it glides along a relatively flat flight trajectory within the Earth’s atmosphere toward its target. During the glide phase, these weapons can make abrupt vertical and horizontal course changes that help make it very hard to defend against. As such, they are very attractive weapons for penetrating dense enemy air defenses to conduct strikes on time-critical or otherwise high-value targets. A full-size model of the common hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon and the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike system will both use., US Army The newly proposed section in the Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA, described as an “integration” effort, does not appear to be directing the Navy to simply study adding the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles to the Zumwalts . It specifically amends an existing, more ambigious provision in the 2020 Fiscal Year NDAA , which Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2019, that says “The Secretary of the Navy shall ensure that the technologies developed for the conventional prompt global strike weapon system are transferrable to a surface-launched platform.” “Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the programmatic changes required to integrate the conventional prompt global strike weapon system into current or future surface combatant ships,” it adds. Based on that timeframe, the House and Senate Armed Services Committee should have received that report on what the available options were, such as adding Conventional Prompt Strike capability to the Zumwalts , by the end of April. The Zumwalts , despite the repeated watering down of their capabilities and the continued addition of external systems that negatively impact their reduced radar signature , are arguably the most advanced and survivable surface combatants the Navy has in service today. At present, the service has commissioned two of these ships, the USS Zumwalt and the USS Michael Monsoor , and a third example, the future Lyndon B. Johnson , is in the final stages of construction. The Navy had originally planned to buy 32 Zumwalts , but that total was successively scaled back to just these three hulls. The exact expected range of the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles is unknown, but the goal is for it to be in the thousands of miles . As such, the Zumwalts armed with these weapons would be able to use their stealth characteristics to have the best chance of getting close enough to launch the weapons at time-sensitive or critical targets in a contested environment during a major crisis or contingency. Combined with the already extreme speed of the weapons themselves, being able to get closer to the target would further reduce the time an opponent would have to react to the strike, either to try to relocate important assets or otherwise seek cover, increasing the chances of success. Adding the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles to Zumwalts could provide a fast path toward making the weapons operational, as well. The Navy’s current plan is to reach initial operational capability with these weapons in the 2028 Fiscal Year on the Block V Virginia class submarine. After that, the service would integrate them with the Ohio class SSGNs and it could add them to the arsenal of a future Large Payload Submarine , as well. The Army, by contrast, expects to reach initial operational capability with its land-based version in 2023. An infographic showing the Block V Virginia class and a cutaway for the new Virginia Payload Module for these boats, which will have four large multi-purpose launch tubes capable of firing the Conventional Prompt Strike missile, as well as other weapons and payloads., USN However, the modifications required to add the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles to the Zumwalts could be extensive and costly. Each one of the stealth destroyers has 80 Mk 57 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells able to accommodate a variety of missiles, including quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) and Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles . An artist’s conception of the USS Zumwalt firing missiles from its Mk 57 VLSs., USN While specific details about the Conventional Prompt Strike missile design, the Navy and the Army have stated that it will use a two-stage rocket booster with a diameter of 34 and a half inches. This is wider than the Mk 57 cell, meaning that Zumwalts will need a new launch system to fire these hypersonic weapons. In addition, the Army has said that its ground-based system will use a launcher that uses a modified M870 flatbed trailer and that the missile canister will be roughly as long as that trailer, which is just over 40 feet in length. The longest missile that the Mk 57 can accommodate is just over 20 feet, meaning that any new launcher would extend substantially further down into the ship’s hull, which could make it hard, if not impossible to simply swap out some number of the existing VLS arrays. As such, the most viable option could be to utilize the space on the ships that their two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) occupy. These weapons have effectively been dead weight since the Navy’s decision to cancel work on the specialized Long-Range Land-Attack Projectile (LRLAP), each of which was set to cost an exorbitant $800,000 , in 2016. There have been discussions about sourcing alternate ammunition types for the AGSs, but no final decision has been made on that front, at least publicly. Removing the AGSs and replacing them with some other weapon is something that many, including the War Zone , have proposed in the past. Adding the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles would certainly be in keeping with the Navy’s desire to have the Zumwalts focus on stand-off attacks against enemy ships and targets on land. Interestingly, in a summary of its proposals, the Strategic Forces Subcommittee also calls for the addition of the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles to the Zumwalts in order “to address miscalculation and ambiguity concerns.” These missiles have the potential to look just like any other ballistic missile to an opponent’s early warning systems at the time of launch. It could be hard, if not impossible, to know that a submarine firing one of the weapons is Virginia class or an Ohio class SSGN, rather than Ohio class ballistic missile submarine , or SSBN, or a future Columbia class ballistic missile boat . This could raise concerns that a near-peer nuclear-armed adversary, such as Russia or China, might mistake the missile for one carrying a nuclear weapon, or otherwise feel compelled to treat it as such, rather than risk not being able to respond in kind. Critics of the new W76-2 low yield warhead for the Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile, which is now in service on Ohio class SSBNs, have expressed similar fears about how an enemy would interpret the launch of one of those weapons, since there would be no realistic way to verify the warhead type until it detonated. Russia has already publicly said that it will treat it any employment of the W76-2 the same way it would treat the use of any other nuclear weapon. The USS Tennessee , an Ohio class SSBN., USN At least right now, there are no nuclear weapons available for Navy surface ships, meaning that there would be no ambiguity about whether a Zumwalt armed with the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles had fired something else. There has been discussion of adding a new nuclear-armed cruise missile to these destroyers, but the launch signature of that weapon would be different. That would, however, undoubtedly raise concerns about whether the ship’s launch of a conventionally armed cruise missile, such as the Tomahawk, would then be confused for a nuclear strike. Critics have brought up similar fears with regards to the deployment of a new air-launched nuclear cruise missile, despite U.S. bombers having employed conventional air-launched cruise missiles in combat for decades without any apparent issues, though never against a peer state. Beyond all of this, there is also a question of how useful a fleet of just three Zumwalts might be for providing this kind of strike capability. Last year the Navy decided to assign the trio of destroyers to a developmental unit, Surface Development Squadron One , where their main job will be testing and evaluating new weapons and systems, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures for surface ships. Of course, this would not necessarily preclude them from deploying operationally, as needed. The small size of the class could also exacerbate the already likely high cost burden associated with integrating a whole new VLS and refitting the deck space that goes all the way down to the keel. The Zumwalts have already long been over budget and behind schedule. One would imagine that it would be easier to integrate the Conventional Prompt Strike missiles onto a new class of surface ships, such as the future Large Surface Combatant , which could be designed from the beginning with large modular vertical launch tubes to accommodate various weapons. Unfortunately, those ships are still years away from becoming a reality. Of course, all of this is dependent on this provision becoming law. The House Armed Services Committee still needs to craft a final draft of the NDAA and make sure it aligns with the version now progressing through the Senate . After that, both chambers would need to pass it and President Donald Trump would have to sign it. That being said, the fact that this appears to be a direct follow-on to a provision that did successfully make it into the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA, based on information and recommendations the Navy provided earlier this year, suggests that there is some bipartisan consensus on this issue already.  If this does become law, the future of the Navy’s hypersonic weapons plans and the future of the Zumwalt class destroyers could be set to change significantly in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 17, 2020","No, The F-117 Never Had Air-To-Air Capability, But One Did Get A Radar","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After years of studying the history of the F-117 Nighthawk program and having written many articles about some of its most obscure elements , one topic that has continued to surface in various forms has to do with the stealth attack jet being used in the air-to-air role. Discussion of this surfaced briefly on the Fighter Pilot Podcast recently, which you can and should check out here . Comments from a veteran Nighthawk pilot resulted in speculation that this capability may have indeed existed in an operational sense. The hard truth is it absolutely did not, but Skunk Works and the Air Force did toy around with the idea of enabling the F-117 in the air-to-air arena and giving the jet a radar on multiple occasions during its first decade of existence. It is true that during the early 1980s, as the F-117 was marching towards an operational state, Lockheed’s Skunk Works and the Air Force kicked around the idea of using the F-117 as a clear air interceptor of sorts aimed at swatting down high-value Soviet assets. Years before that, prior to the true limitations and strengths of the final design becoming known, a more robust air-to-air capability was discussed. But these were just conceptual ideas. Some limited testing, much of which was a byproduct of trialing the stealth jet’s radar signature against U.S. airborne early warning and control aircraft and fighters, was done. That being said, we can now get back to the notion that the air-to-air mission was actually within the F-117’s operational repertoire. Here is the relevant excerpt from the Fight Pilot Podcast podcast, as transcribed by The Aviationist : “Yes its primary role was attack but having said that, it could actually carry every munition in the inventory at the time of its insertion, with the exception of the Sparrow missile which was radar-guided so we could carry air-to-air missiles we could carry the full gamut of air-to-ground munitions and everything. So the F-117 designation has long been rumored and then postulated and many beers have gone down about why it was as such but I think it was basically they just said – hey we don’t want to have anything really too extraordinary out there at all – but yes in all reality it is an attack jet but it did have a limited air-to-air capability.” … “Our secondary role was to shoot down the Soviet AWACS. So yeah, we were invisible to their radar and we didn’t want them controlling their airspace so, either on the way in or on the way out you could add a Soviet AWACS paint it to the side of your aircraft” The F-117’s cockpit was state of the art at the time of its introduction, but it didn’t have a radar. , Paul Weatherman/Lockheed Martin/Code One When I heard this, I was a bit flabbergasted. I knew that this wasn’t really the case, at least how it may have sounded. The free-flowing nature of the podcast really didn’t delve into it too deeply, so it was entirely possible it just came out a bit different than intended. So, our friends at the Fighter Pilot Podcast put us in touch with Robert “Robson” Donaldson, their guest for the episode and a veteran F-117 pilot who flew the jet during an amazing time in its operational history, between 1989 and 1992. We previously talked to him about the F-117’s nuclear strike role , which also came up briefly in the podcast. Donaldson was happy to clarify his statements on the topic and to discuss the matter in a bit more detail. According to the retired F-117 driver and commercial airline pilot, no, the Nighthawk never actually had air-to-air combat as an operational mission. It wasn’t trained for by F-117 crews and the aircraft were not really configured for it in any meaningful way. The concepts that had been passed around early in the jet’s existence included being able to sneak up on unsuspecting Soviet airborne early warning and control aircraft and take them out before they could ever alert prowling fighters as to the attacker’s whereabouts. This would have been done, at least notionally, by an F-117 toting a heat-seeking AIM-9L Sidewinder missile, as the jet had no radar of any kind in order to employ radar-guided missiles. The Soviet Beriev A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft was coming online just as the F-117 became operational. , Public Domain This sounds pretty cool, but in reality, it wasn’t plausible. The F-117 would have no way to look for an airborne target beyond what could be seen outside the cockpit windows, which were notoriously obscured. Its pilot was shut off from the outside world when the aircraft was in a stealth configuration, too. In other words, data-links and radio calls were really not an option, and relying on them alone at the time was far from ideal, especially for such a dangerous mission. If the F-117 was able to somehow find its target and could navigate within around four miles or so of it to be in a position to launch its AIM-9L, the missile would have to be extended into the slipstream with the F-117’s bay door open in order to even attempt to obtain a lock. Once again, that is only if the jet and the missile’s seeker were pointed directly at the target in the first place. The hard fact here is that opening the bay doors and extending the AIM-9 into the slipstream while trying to lock up the target would give away the F-117’s presence and its position. Considering it was a subsonic attack aircraft, running away at high speed wouldn’t have been a good option after a shot was taken, nor would it have been the stealthiest aspect of the aircraft to present to your enemies after they already knew you were present. In other words, this was totally implausible operationally speaking and it never became a reality for good reason. A Navy Hornet firing an AIM-9L/M Sidewinder from its wingtip rail. Lock-on after launch (LOAL), which is ideal for stealth aircraft with weapons bays, has only become a reality recently for the Sidewinder family of missiles. , USN What if the F-117 had its own air-to-air radar? It sounds intriguing, but making it happen, especially in the 1980s, was far harder than it sounds. Just using a traditional fighter’s fire control radar, assuming you could even mount it somehow and still have it be effective without compromising the jet’s radar signature, would give away the aircraft’s position via its radio frequency emissions. This would have negated the whole stealth technology thing and the F-117 was never designed to accommodate such a large piece of kit in its nose in the first place. Robert Donaldson told The War Zone that Ben Rich himself, head of the Skunk Works during the F-117’s ascendency, a man that is largely credited with giving birth to stealth technology as we know it today, told him about one concept his team was looking into while meeting with the aviation legend at the original Lockheed Skunk Works headquarters in Burbank. Rich described the concept as a radar that would fit into the existing nose of the F-117 and was housed behind a sliding door when not in use. F-117 with its FLIR visible. The turret sat behind a radar reflective screen. , USAF The idea was that the Nighthawk pilot would be able to activate the radar to take a ‘snapshot’ of the airspace in front of them, with the door snapping open and closed similar to a shutter on a camera so as to only disrupt the jet’s stealthy signature for a very short amount of time. This was similar to the aborted flip-down Radar Locating System (RLS) that never made it onto the production F-117. You can read all about the RLS and its weird backstory in this past piece of ours . In retrospect, the RLS system might have been effective when it came to locating and attacking enemy airborne early warning aircraft and they used a similar pop open and closed concept of operations, but that’s beside the point. By taking one quick radar sweep of the area, enemy sensors would have been challenged to home in on the radar’s emissions and identify the F-117’s general position. With the radar picture in hand, the pilot could target an aircraft in the distance and make a run on it, only taking quick radar snapshots as they closed in, providing just enough information to get the Nighthawk lined up for a quick Sidewinder shot. It’s an interesting idea, but as far as we know, it was just that, an idea. Still, Rich clearly was interested in it considering he shared it with the newly minted F-117 pilot. It certainly would have solved a lot of problems without heavily eroding the F-117’s inherent advantages. This was also an era where low-probability of intercept (LPI) radar technology was still fairly new, having first been tested in relation to a stealth aircraft on Northrop’s Tacit Blue demonstrator , and Lockheed was working on its own advanced LPI capabilities for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that would eventually give birth to the F-22 Raptor. F-22 and F-117. , USAF In fact, the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar technology that was set to be a fixture in the ATF program would have likely been necessary for Rich’s radar-enabled F-117 concept, as there would be no place to put a mechanically scanned array behind a flat faceted door as it was described. The place for such a radar would have likely been where the forward-looking infrared turret exists in the F-117’s nose. This would have provided a way to largely retain the F-117’s outer mold line while still giving the jet a limited air-to-air radar capability. It wouldn’t have been able to scan an azimuth as wide as a traditional fighter radome would have allowed, but a small AESA could have provided a usable cone-like scan volume very quickly so as to give the pilot some situational awareness as to what lay in front of the jet. LPI radar modes would have helped keep the F-117 safe from the enemy’s passive radio frequency detection capabilities. Donaldson’s account is highly intriguing. It really does point to a concept of taking the advances made for the looming ATF program in terms of radar tech and injecting them into the already existing F-117, and thus giving it new capabilities and missions. But why do you need a relatively anemic performing F-117 with limited radar capabilities when you could have an F-22? Well, the latter aircraft wouldn’t be operational for many years, so using even early forms of its sensor tech with the operational F-117 may have proven to be attractive for Rich and his Skunks. Ben Rich and the F-117., Lockheed Martin The thing is, Rich’s concept as relayed to Robertson would have been at least a second try to realize a radar-toting F-117 if it had ever been put into practice. Shortly after the F-117 was operational, a program aimed to turn the stealth jet into an all-weather attack aircraft via the addition of a radar. Multiple sources have described this offshoot of the program to me over the years, including a senior officer that was intimately familiar with the F-117 program during the period in question. An F-117 is said to have been modified to house a radar set that was a cousin of the AN/APQ-164 passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar that would eventually find itself in the B-1B bomber. The B-1B had a reduced radar signature and its radar required LPI modes, so that capability aspect may have already been baked into the radar set at the time of the F-117 tests, or at least it was deep in development. The radar’s ability to take detailed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) maps of what was ahead allowed for relatively precise targeting in all weather. It could also detect moving targets on the ground and its downward-angled face provided a reduced radar signature for the aircraft that was carrying it. Since it was possible to electronically steer its beam, it would have been probably the best candidate available to fit within the odd shaping limitations of even a modified F-117 nose. A mechanically scanned dish would have created a variable radar signature that could potentially compromise the stealthy jet. The AN/APQ-164 PESA on the B-1B., Public Domain via Defense-Update.com One of the developmental F-117s, tail #794 according to Have Blue and the F-117A : Evolution of the “Stealth Fighter,” received the radar in 1984 at the Skunk Works’ Burbank plant and began flight testing out of Groom Lake after the modifications were complete. The installation was unique, with a specially built selective frequency ‘evanescent’ radome covering the PESA antenna that allowed for the radar to work while also maintaining a high degree of low-observability. This radome technology was absolutely cutting-edge at the time and eventually found itself utilized on the F-22 Raptor. It isn’t clear exactly how the tests went, but as I understand it the entire concept would have been very costly to achieve in a scaled manner. Also, the F-117 was an extremely precise strike asset via its infrared targeting and navigation system and laser-guided bombs. While the F-117 may have been able to find its target in bad weather with the radar, it would not have been able to deliver its two bombs with anywhere near the accuracy as what laser guidance provided by just using the radar alone. It turns out that it would be exactly two decades after the radar tests that the F-117 finally got all-weather strike capability via the GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM)—no radar needed. F-117 during JDAM trials in the early 2000s. , USAF As for what the F-117 looked like with such a radar installed, that remains a mystery. We have inquired with Lockheed and the Air Force in an attempt to get a photo of the unique configuration, but have come up empty-handed, which isn’t all the surprising considering elements of the F-117 program remain remarkably murky. It’s also possible that this radar-equipped F-117 was tested against aerial targets if the radar had an air-to-air a mode at the time, but we don’t know that for sure. In some ways, the whole idea of an F-117 with an air-to-air mission was too ahead of its time. Today, low observable aircraft can stay connected to critical networks without sacrificing stealth and radars have become more compact and powerful, with AESA arrays being commonplace today. LPI modes on those radars have become ever more wily and harder to detect, as well. So, even without a radar, in this current age in which combat aircraft and the missiles they fire themselves are networked, an upgraded F-117 could rely entirely on off-board targeting information when attacking an enemy aircraft from beyond visual range. Even its own electronic surveillance suite would be sensitive enough to geolocate an enemy aircraft via its own emissions and to prosecute an attack based on that information. But this is now, not three decades ago. At that time, this simply wasn’t possible. In the end, it’s safe to say that the F-117 never had an air-to-air role, but it certainly wasn’t due to a lack of imagination on the part of the Skunk Works. Still, not a single air-to-air missile was ever fired by an F-117, not even in basic testing.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week Â The War Zone reported on intriguing tests involving Scaled Composites’ high-flying Proteus test platform and the company’s two Model 401 ‘ Son Of Ares ‘ stealthy jet demonstrators , which still largely remain a mystery. We can now say that these missions have not only continued, they have expanded to include new aircraft types.Â Make sure to read our previous piece on these peculiar operations linked here in order to get up to speed and for full context.Â Author’s Update: We have new images of one of the Model 401s and they are bizarre, to say the least. Check out our new story here Â after finishing this one. This week, the trio of highly experimental aircraft were airborne once again over and near the Navy’s massive Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake range complex in the Mojave Desert. Proteus and one of the Model 401s sortied from Scaled Composite’s home base at Mojave Air and Space Port, while the other Model 401 flew out of China Lake, just like last time. But this time around they were joined by another player, a NASA F-15D Eagle carrying a large pod. The ‘SCAT’ pack up over China Lake on Wednesday, June 17th, 2020., ADSBexchange.com The appearance of a NASA F-15 for the tests is interesting. Nearby Armstrong Flight Research Center supports development and flight test work that have both civilian and military applications. Considering the exotic podded payloads Proteus often lugs around, which range between NASA scientific instruments to advanced military sensors, its involvement isn’t too puzzling. Our photo contributor Christopher McGreevy found himself under the flight path of the F-15D and the Model 401 and captured a couple of photos of the formation:Â The NASA F-15D had a unique pod under its right wing., Christopher McGreevy According to local observers and plane trackers, the Model 401s flew together at times and separate at others and a KC-10 was present to provide fuel for the NASA F-15D as the tests wore on. Proteus was also close by at a similar altitude, around 25,000 feet, as the Model 401s, flying its large racetrack-like patterns oftentimes to the west of the actionÂ This photo was not taken on this mission, but it serves as an example of the exotic test pods NASA F-15s carry from time-to-tome: This week seems to be about all things space related, so I figured Iâ€™d contribute in my own (subtle) way to the theme! ðŸš€ pic.twitter.com/iV5pslyz30 — Scott Dworkin (@mach91photo) May 27, 2020 Hans Friedel was near Mojave as this was going on and snapped some photos of one of the Model 401s and Proteus as they recovered at Mojave Air and Space Port. This is our first good look at N401XP in its configuration for these tests. Note that the aircraft wears a new overall gray coating and there are large discolored diamond-like shapes below the cockpit and on its lower tail section. It is unclear what exactly these patches are for, but it seems like the Model 401s may be participating in a test that at least has something to do with their signatures, which can include radar, electronic, infrared, and visual. Model 401 N401XP with some interesting trapezoidal markings next to the cockpit and one on the tail., Hanz Friedel We also get a look at the other side of the pod Proteus is carrying, which appears to have some sort of electro-optical system installed. It’s not clear if there is also a radar or some emitter situated in between, as well. If so, this would certainly help slew the optical systems on to their targets. With two apertures seen, it may make sense why two model 401s are participating in the test. The configuration would also point to why the planes are flying largely on the same plane as the cameras, if they are cameras, as they would have a limited ability to pan and tilt in this flush-mounted configuration. Still, we don’t know for sure what the payload is or its utility for certain, so take all this with a grain of salt. Hanz Friedel Hanz Friedel The odd surface treatment on the Model 401 may also point to some sort of a coating test, maybe one that works to reduce the infrared signature of the aircraft, which is becoming more and more important as infrared search and track (IRST) systems are increasing in their capabilities and pose a real threat to stealthy aircraft. In addition, a significant portion of air-to-air missile capabilities also relies on imaging infrared homing . But reductions in infrared signature alone may not be the extent of the tests. The Pentagon has long been interested in visual signature reduction. You can read all about the long developmental past of aerial ‘cloaking’ technologies and where such a capability may be at today in this past feature of ours . It’s also worth noting that past technology demonstrator aircraft, such as Boeing’s Bird Of Prey , existed partially to test visual signature reduction measures.Â Once again, these are just some thoughts based on the information we have at hand. Those areas on the Model 401’s skin could be conformal antennas or even calibration and tracking marks to aid an optical tracking system that is being tested. As such, the Model 401s could be providing lower observable targets for challenging that system, nothing more. We just don’t know.Â There has been much speculation that these aircraft could be manned or optionally manned demonstrators to prove unmanned technologies, such as the loyal wingman concept of operations and more. Like many other Scaled Composites other designs, their actual reason for being may be multi-fold or will shift over time. Hanz also pointed out to us that the Model 401 sounds remarkably strange when landing and he even connected it to a video of an RQ-170 Sentinel landing at Creech Air Force Base some time ago that we have discussed here on The War Zone in the past. Check out the two videos below: It is not clear if the similarities are due to a common powerplant or the odd inlet designs on both aircraft, or even a combination of both, but it is interesting none the less.Â So, that is where it sits now. There has been no action with the Model 401s today as far as we can tell, although Raytheon’s ‘Voodoo 1’ 727 sensor test jet has been flying over the same area that Proteus was yesterday. It isn’t clear if any of this is tied to the ongoing testing in question. Regardless, it seems clear that whatever program is underway involving these little stealthy jets it is a complex one that requires a large variety of assets and multiple test flights.Â With that in mind, we probably will be seeing a lot more of the Model 401s and their friends in the days to come.Â Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 19, 2020",Stealthy ‘Son Of Ares’ Jet Seen Covered In Mirrors During Mysterious Test Flights,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our most recent article on a number of strange tests that have been ongoing high above the Mojave Desert involving three of Scaled Composites’ experimental aircraft and a host of other players from the U.S. military and NASA, we now have exclusive new images showing one of the mysterious Model 401 ‘Son of Ares’ jets flying while covered in a mirror-like coating. The images were taken on June 13th, a few days after our initial report on the testing, and they offer new insights and prompt new questions as to what the twin stealthy experimental jets and their high-flying Proteus cousin have been up to. Make sure to read our latest piece on these peculiar test flights linked here and below for proper context and background information. The images show a large portion of what is likely the Model 401 registered as N401XD—its twin is registered as N401XP—substantially mirrored over with dark coatings covering much of the remaining surfaces. It looks like some primer paint or another coating exists around the canopy bow and the leading edges of the dorsal jet air intake. It is unclear if the aircraft has the same application on both sides. This is undoubtedly one incredibly bizarre-looking treatment on an already alien-looking aircraft. The photographer who took the photos said the extremely bright glint coming from its fuselage made the aircraft very visible. So, the question is, why mirror over a large portion a jet for a test? We can’t answer that definitively, but we have some ideas. One of the sci-fi-looking Model 401 ‘Son of Ares’ jets during testing in April of 2018. Note the very different skin treatment at the time as well as the nose instrumentation. The two aircraft now have a cleaner and stealthier configuration. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The first would be to support laser testing. The Pentagon has a slew of directed energy efforts ongoing , including those in the air-to-air realm. Considering where the treatment is situated on the aircraft, the latter would seem like the most likely application. The pod hung under Proteus for the tests appears to have two large dark lenses and one smaller one that could be indicative of cameras needed to record a laser test. They are fixed and facing directly to the side of the aircraft, so recording another aircraft would make sense here especially considering that the Model 401 jets and Proteus have been flying at around the same altitude, but offset laterally to varying distances. Hans Friedel Hans Friedel The pod does have a large sliding door on the bottom, a feature that is usually associated with electro-optical systems. As to whether it holds a directed energy turret is unknown, but we do know that the demonstrators were flying with a NASA F-15D recently that was carrying an unusual pod that looks similar to one that may hold a laser system (see below). Regardless of what aircraft could have been toting the laser, getting an idea of how much laser energy is reflected by different aircraft coatings under real-world conditions could be very beneficial. Said laser doesn’t have to be some very high-power system capable of damaging the target it is being fired at, either, and that would be counterproductive, anyway. An age of tactical aircraft being equipped with lasers for defensive and eventually offensive purposes is on the horizon. The Air Force has its own Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program that is underway and there are surely others. Adversaries are not sitting still in this regard either. It makes sense that when you develop any new disruptive measure, you also invest in exploring countermeasures to it for refining the system you have, as well as the tactics behind it. Doing so would result in a more capable and resilient weapon and would also provide key data in regards to how to defend against a similar capability. Having coatings and surface treatments that can reflect laser energy, thus decreasing the range and increasing the dwell-time needed for a laser system to be able to damage an aircraft is a worthy, if not outright necessary endeavor. The potential benefits for manned and unmanned aircraft that may confront directed energy threats in the future are clear, but this will be even more important for cruise missiles and lower-flying drones that could face such a capability much sooner. This would also fit with the odd markings we saw on the other Model 401 demonstrator, which included reflective coatings on different parts of the aircraft. The other Model 401 now wears a new gray coating with strange patches applied below the cockpit and on its tail. These patches reflected light in odd ways in the photos we have seen of them., Hans Friedel So, would mirroring a flying object, or applying other exotic reflective surface treatments, help defend them against directed energy attacks? Maybe that is exactly what testers are working on with Proteus, the Model 401 demonstrators, and the other players that have been so active in the area over the last two weeks. The other thought we had is that this could be part of an ongoing test of infrared sensors, quite possibly infrared search and track (IRST) systems that are going to be fielded very soon within the Air Force and Navy . By using different coatings, including one that is blindingly effective, it could push the sensor to its limits and could help uncover hardware flaws and software issues that could occur in a real-world environment with the system. A mirrored aircraft, in particular, may prove to be a unique challenge for these systems, and flying one alongside an exact copy of that aircraft without the treatment could provide a control variable to test against. The two Model 401s have been flying together for much of the testing that has occurred, according to flight tracking software. This would also help explain Proteus’ pod with the dark optical windows, which would house the infrared sensors, as well as the reason for other aircraft to take part in these tests, including F-117s, which have a reduced infrared signature not commonly found on combat aircraft. Once again, these are just a couple of possibilities. Testing these odd reflective coatings, including a mirror-like covering, on these aircraft could be for another reason altogether. What is clear is that charcoal and mirrored-over ‘Son of Ares’ jet would be one heck of a sight to behold close-up. Maybe one day we will get photos of what this aircraft looked like with such an exotic application to its skin. Also, this would explain why one of the demonstrators is flying out of Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake instead of Mojave Air and Space Port as a mirrored alien-looking test aircraft would draw a ton of attention there. Finally, the question of is this aircraft even manned is bound to come up. Since the Model 401s first emerged , there has been speculation that they may be optionally manned. Depending on how invasive and dangerous these tests are would dictate what measures would be taken to either protect the pilot or not have them present at all if the aircraft is truly capable of unmanned operations, which we have no proof of at this time. Still, Scaled Composites is very capable of realizing such a capability , so it is possible. At this time it is safe to assume it is manned, but that could change as more information comes available. We will continue to update this story over the next 24 hours if more information comes available. Author’s note: A huge thanks to @Wamoyanu for the photos.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 23, 2020",Russia Sent Three Types Of Fighters To Intercept B-52s Flying Rare Mission Into Sea Of Okhotsk (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian military sent Su-30 Flanker and Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jets and MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors to monitor two U.S. Air Force B-52H bombers that flew over the Sea of Okhotsk yesterday. This the first time B-52Hs have flown into this body water, which is surrounded on three sides by Russian territory and where American combat aircraft typically have not ventured in the past, in recent memory. This flight also comes nearly a month after a B-1B conducted a long-range training mission along a similar route as part of the implementation of a new concept of operations for U.S. heavy bomber sorties earlier this year. The Russian Defense Ministry’s National Defense Control Center publicly announced the intercept over the Sea of Okhotsk on June 19, 2020, though it had taken place the day before. Twitter user and good friend of The War Zone @AircraftSpots tracked the two B-52Hs on June 18 as they flew from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska through the Bering Sea and out over the North Pacific. Eielson is notably not a bomber base. A trio of B-52Hs from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana , which is home to the active component 2nd Bomb Wing and the Air Force Reserve 307th Bomb Wing, arrived at the base in Alaska on June 14, as part of a short-term Bomber Task Force deployment. As such, this particular flight not only underscored the ability of the bombers to project power far away from America’s borders while operating from bases within the country, it also highlighted how they can first stage themselves at other bases closer to the intended area of operation, as needed . After arriving in the North Pacific for this particular training mission yesterday, the two B-52Hs then alerted air traffic controllers in the region that they would be flying “ due regard ,” or with their transponders off, for approximately two hours, at which time they turned north toward the Sea of Okhotsk. This sea is a sort of giant bay situated between Sakhalin Island to the west, as well as portions of Russia’s mainland Far East region to the north, and the Kamchatka Peninsula to the east. “On June 19, 2020, the air defense quick reaction alert forces of the Eastern Military District spotted and started tracking a pair of US Air Force B-52H bombers over the Sea of Okhotsk,” Russia’s National Defense Control Center’s statement said . “At a considerable distance from the state border of the Russian Federation, the U.S. Air Force planes were continuously tracked by Russian monitoring capabilities. Su-30, Su-35, and MiG-31 fighters from the air defense quick reaction alert forces of the Eastern Military District were scrambled to intercept the targets.” The statement also said that the B-52Hs did not ever appear to make a concerted approach toward Russia’s sovereign airspace and remained at least 186 miles from the country’s borders throughout the duration of the flight. “The Russian aircraft performed the flights in strict compliance with the international rules of using the airspace over the neutral waters, without violating the borders of other states,” the National Defense Control Center added. It’s worth noting that B-52Hs , as well as B-1Bs and B-2s , have flown a near-constant, if irregularly scheduled long-range training missions across the Pacific region, as well as in and around Europe, since the Air Force adopted the Dynamic Force Employment model for bomber operations in April. This followed the abrupt decision to end the Continuous Bomber Presence mission that same month, which The War Zone was first to report . Under the Continuous Bomber Presence concept, which the service implemented 2004, new rotations of bombers deployed to the island of Guam in the Pacific roughly every six months. The goal of the Dynamic Force Employment concept, which the U.S. military as a whole has been increasingly employing, is to make it more difficult for potential adversaries to predict and monitor deployments, adding more uncertainty and risk into their operational planning processes. However, much of the new bomber activity that has been observed in recent months has clearly been meant to send especially strong signals to potential American adversaries, especially Russia and China. In May, the Air Force released pictures of personnel on Guam loading stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) land-attack cruise missiles onto a B-1B bomber in a pointed message aimed at China. That same month, other B-1Bs flew into the Black Sea on a training mission simulating the employment of AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) in that region, where the only real possible opponent is Russia. Just this week, B-2 bombers also flew into the Norwegian Sea above the Arctic Circle , as well, the latest in a string of bomber flights over and around Northern Europe and Scandanavia in recent months. A pair of B-1B bombers fly on a simulate anti-ship mission over the Black Sea region in May together with a Su-27 Flanker, in the foreground, and a MiG-29 Fulcrum, in the background, both belonging to the Ukrainian Air Force., Ukrainian Ministry of Defense The B-52Hs flying into the Sea of Okhotsk, very much Russia’s backyard in the Pacific, is another clear signal. The flight of a B-1B into the body of water on May 21, the first known instance of an American bomber entering the area following the adoption of the Dynamic Force Employment concept, was already a bold and largely unprecedented sortie . These long-range training flights into the Sea of Okhotsk also come amid equally steady Russian bomber and long-range maritime patrol aircraft sorties in international airspace near Alaska. So far this year, U.S. and Canadian military aircraft assigned to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) have intercepted Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers and Tu-142 Bear-F patrol planes, sometimes flying with other supporting aircraft, off Alaska on at least eight occasions . In March, NORAD also sent jets to intercept a pair of Tu-142s that flew relatively low over a base camp on an ice floe in international waters in the Arctic off Alaska that was supporting a U.S. Navy-led submarine exercise. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Doi1k-7rH2I With bombers now flying long-range training missions under the Dynamic Force Employment model on a regular basis, sorties into the Sea of Okhotsk may well become an increasingly common sight, especially if Russia continues with its own more routine flights near Alaska. Update: 1:00 PM EST— Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) has now released pictures of the B-52s flying on their Bomber Task Force mission on June 18 together with a pair of U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft near the Kuril Islands, south of the Sea of Okhotsk. The Growlers could support the bombers during an actual conflict or other contingency in the region. A U.S. Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, a type that the Navy also operated until it replaced them with the EA-18G, notably provided similar support for the U.S.-led missile barrage against targets in Syria in 2018. B-1B bombers also took part in that operation, among other aircraft and naval assets. The Kuril Islands are notably at the center of a long-standing dispute between Russia and Japan, the latter of which is a U.S. ally. The Russian government presently administers all of the 56 islands in the chain, but Japanese authorities claim that the four southernmost ones are their sovereign territory. This disagreement on the final status of these islands has prevented the two countries from ever signing a formal World War II peace deal, despite that conflict having been over for 75 years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020",Turkey Now Has Swarming Suicide Drones It Could Export,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Turkish military reportedly plans to buy more than 500 quad-copter-type Kargu series loitering munitions, or suicide drones , in the near term. The Kargus, at present, can operate in semi-autonomous or manually-controlled modes, but work is underway to give up to 20 of them the ability to carry out mass attacks as a swarm , which could give Turkey’s troops a potentially game-changing new capability. Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency news outlet first reported that Defense Technologies Engineering and Trade Inc., also known by its Turkish acronym STM , was expecting to deliver the hundreds of drones to the Turkish armed forces on June 15, 2020. It’s not clear if this total order for “over 500” of the drones includes or is in addition to a purchase agreement for 356 Kargus that the Turkish government itself announced in January . STM introduced the first generation Kargu in 2017 and the Turkish military first began receiving small numbers of the improved Kargu-2 variant last year. Turkish forces have reportedly at least deployed , if not employed, the drones during operations along the country’s border with Syria last year. The manufacturer says that Kargu, a name that literally translates as “hawk” in Turkish, and which is also used to refer to small mountain watchtowers, “has been engineered specifically for anti-terror and asymmetric warfare scenarios.” The 15-pound Kargu-2 can fly at up to 90 miles per hour and can remain airborne for up to 30 minutes. It has a line-of-sight control link with a range of around six miles. The Kargu-2 can also fly higher, has a longer range, and has the ability to remain in a designated area for a longer period of time compared to the earlier models . It also has updated targeting capabilities and improvements to reduce its auditory signature, the latter of which helps reduce the chance that an opponent will spot the drone before it’s too late. An operator on the ground can manually control any of the Kargu series drones and use their onboard sensors, which includes electro-optical and infrared video cameras and a laser imaging system, or LIDAR, to conduct general surveillance and identify and track targets. They can then direct the quad-copters to attack a designated threat, even if it’s on the move. The loitering munitions can also safely return to their operators for re-use if no targets are found. The drones can carry one of three different types of warheads, including a high-explosive fragmentation one for engaging personnel and other unarmored targets in the open, a thermobaric type good for targets in confined spaces such as buildings or caves, and a shaped charge for attacking lightly armored threats. Each one weighs around three pounds. The drone’s warhead can also be set to function on impact or airburst above the target, the latter being a feature particularly useful for the fragmentation and thermobaric types. A Kargu-2 drone. Its warhead is seen on top in the center. , STM The operator can also employ the Kargus as a traditional missile against fixed targets. In this method of attack, the drone would use its GPS navigation system to strike the desired location. The Kargu series of drones can also operate in a semi-autonomous mode, wherein the operator directs the quad-copter to fly to a certain area and then detect and engage targets on its own. As long as the line-of-sight control link remains unbroke, the operator remains in-the-loop throughout the process and can redirect the drone or abort its attack, if necessary. Israel has long been a pioneer of these kinds of man-in-the-loop control systems, which are now the default for most suicide drones and have become increasingly popular on other types of munitions , as well. Most importantly, however, last year, STM announced it was working to give the Kargu family of drones additional autonomy and the ability to work together in large swarms. The swarming technology is in development as part of a larger Turkish government program known as Kerkes , which is also looking to develop systems to improve the ability of drones to operate in GPS-denied environments, something that is increasingly a very real threat. It’s not clear how heavily networked together the company is expecting to make the armed quad-copters, but even being able to launch more rudimentary massed attacks with up to 20 of them at a time would offer a significant boost in capability. Tests have shown that a single Kargu with the air-bursting high-explosive fragmentation warhead can effectively engage clusters of personnel within a circle around 20 feet in diameter. More than one working together could evenly engage threats across a relatively wide area. Beyond just being devastating to concentrations of personnel, this could enable quick large scale attacks against other soft targets, including convoys of light vehicles, parked aircraft, radar dishes and sensor systems, ammunition and fuel dumps, and much more. With a mixture of the different warhead options presently available for Kargu, a group of the drones might be able to carry out more complex attacks, as well. If the swarming Kargus have the ability to operate in a fully-autonomous mode, within pre-set parameters, they could become even more capable. Swarms by their very nature can confuse and overwhelm an opponent’s defenses, even those belonging to major militaries, causing havoc even if a significant number of them get shot down before they can reach their targets. This is a very real threat that War Zone has explored in detail on multiple occasions in the past . Based on its general size and configuration, the Kargus appear to be a relatively low-cost option for providing this capability, which also underscores how low the barrier to entry for this kind of swarming technology is becoming. Beyond more robust military developments with regards to swarming, small quad-copter-type drones flying in large coordinated formations have been employed in the commercial sector for years now , as well. The swarming technology STM is developing may also be applicable to other drones and loitering munitions it is developing now. Among its other products, the company also offers a fixed-wing tube-launched loitering munition, called Alpagu , which is very similar in form and function to AeroVironment’s Switchblade and is now also in Turkish service. It seems very possible that, in addition to providing these improved Kargus to the Turkish armed forces, STM could also seek to export them , proliferating this capability further around the world. STM has already said that it has received serious inquires about the Kargu series from at least three unnamed potential foreign customers . Turkey, as a whole, has become a powerhouse of drone development and production , employing larger types to great effect in Syria and Libya just this year. This is precisely the type of weapon we have been warning about for years now. The fact that it is already here and potentially exportable should be yet another wake-up call to the level of threat low-end drones pose to U.S. and allied forces, as well as domestic infrastructure and VIPs . “I argue all the time with my Air Force friends that the future of flight is vertical and it’s unmanned,” U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said at an event hosted by the Middle East Institute last week . “I’m not talking about large unmanned platforms, which are the size of a conventional fighter jet that we can see and deal with, as we would any other platform.” “I’m talking about the one you can go out and buy at Costco right now in the United States for a thousand dollars, four quad, rotorcraft or something like that that can be launched and flown,” he continued. “And with very simple modifications, it can make made into something that can drop a weapon like a hand grenade or something else .” The Kargus, and their future swarming capabilities, could very well become the next major Turkish drone success story, for better or worse.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet , assigned to Carrier Air Wing 11 embarked on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt , crashed in the Philippine Sea earlier today. The jet’s two crew members ejected successfully and were rescued by an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 8 (HSC 8) also assigned to the carrier. The mishap occurred during routine flight operations on June 18, 2020, according to a statement from the Navy. An investigation into the accident is already underway. The full statement from the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s public affairs division is as follows: “Two aviators safely ejected and were quickly recovered by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 8 aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) while conducting routine flight operations in the Philippine Sea.” “The incident occurred as the F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to Carrier Air Wing 11 was conducting routine pilot proficiency training. The incident is currently under investigation. Both aviators were assessed by the medical team on board Theodore Roosevelt and are in good condition.” The statement does not identify the specific squadron that the Super Hornet was assigned to, but USNI News has reported that the only one on the carrier at present to fly the two-seat F/A-18F is Strike Fighter Squadron 154 (VFA-154), the “Black Knights,” which has its home base at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California. The Theodore Roosevelt , along with Carrier Air Wing 11, only recently resumed operations in the Western Pacific. The ship had spent months in port in Guam earlier this year following a serious COVID-19 outbreak among its crew that devolved in a major political scandal . This crash also follows a string of U.S. military aviation mishaps in recent months, both in the United States and overseas. Just on June 15, a U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle assigned to the 493rd Fighter Squadron, part of the 48th Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom, came down in the North Sea , tragically killing the pilot, 1st Lieutenant Kenneth Allen. A C-130H Hercules airlifter also overshot the runway at Camp Taji in Iraq, hitting a wall and suffering a subsequent fire, last week. In May, an Air Force F-22 Raptor and one of that service’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighters crashed in separate incidents while operating out of Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Another F-15C went skidding off the runway at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington, D.C. that same month after making an emergency landing. The nose landing gear on another F-35A collapsed after that jet also made an emergency landing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah earlier this month.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 21, 2019",Ukraine Cleared To Buy 16 Of The U.S. Navy’s Newest Patrol Boats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has approved the potential sale of 16 Mk VI patrol boats , as well as various weapons and associated equipment, to Ukraine. These boats could be a valuable addition to the relatively small Ukrainian Navy, which is primarily focused on patrolling the country’s coastlines on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. This has led to altercations with Russian security forces, as well as with separatists in the Eastern Donbass region and troops that Moscow has sent there to support them , in recent years. In 2018, a particularly serious skirmish between the two countries’ maritime forces led to the capture of three of Ukraine’s naval vessels , including two gunboats , and 24 Ukrainian sailors . The U.S. military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) issued a press release on June 17, 2020, that announced that the U.S. State Department had signed off on the prospective deal, which is valued at approximately $600 million. The complete package includes 32 MSI Seahawk A2 remote-controlled gun systems, two per boat, as well as a Mk 44 Bushmaster II 30mm automatic cannon for each of those mounts, along with eight spares, for a total of 40 guns. Each Mk VI would also come with an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, a sensor turret with visible and infrared video cameras, and a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), the latter of which can be used to hail or signal other ships, as well as act as a non-lethal weapon to deter boarders. You can read more about LRADs in this past War Zone piece . The full list of items included in the Mk VI package, as well as ancillary support services, is as follows: “The Government of Ukraine has requested to buy up to sixteen (16) Mark VI Patrol Boats; thirty-two (32) MSI Seahawk A2 gun systems; twenty (20) Electro-Optics-Infrared Radar (FLIR) (16 installed and 4 spares); sixteen (16) Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) 5km loudspeaker systems; sixteen (16) Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems; forty (40) MK44 cannons (32 installed and 8 spares); communication equipment; support equipment; spare and repair parts; tools and test equipment; technical data and publications; personnel training and training equipment; U.S. government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services; and other related elements of logistics support.  The estimated total cost is $600 million.” “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,” DSCA noted. “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s capability to meet current and future threats by providing a modern, fast, short-range vessel. Ukraine will utilize the vessels to better defend its territorial waters and protect other maritime interests.” It’s worth noting that the configuration of the potential Mk VIs for Ukraine described in the DSCA notice is not the same as that of the ones that the manufacturer, SAFE Boats International, has supplied to the initial customer, the U.S. Navy . Instead of the 30mm Bushmaster II-armed MSI Seahawk A2s that would go onto the Ukrainian variants, the American examples have two Mk 38 Mod 2 mounts, each one with a 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon, as their main armament. The M242 is also the main gun on the U.S. Army’s Bradley Fighting Vehicles . An MSI Seahawk A2, which can also be manually operated, if required, using the triggers seen behind the gun., MSI-Defense Systems The Mk 38 Mod 2 weapon system on a US Navy Mk VI patrol boat., USN The Navy’s Mk VIs also have two smaller remote weapon stations, each with a .50 caliber machine gun, one on top of the front of the pilothouse and one on the superstructure behind it. There are four other mounts, two on top of the superstructure and two on either side the stern, for additional machine guns or automatic grenade launchers. It’s not clear if the configuration of the boats on offer to Ukraine will have provisions for these or any other additional weapons. The remote weapon station above the pilothouse is visible in this picture of a US Navy Mk VI, as well as two of the three other mounts for manually-operated weapons elsewhere on the boat., USN The Navy’s Mk VIs, which started entering service in 2016, have displacements of 72 tons, a top speed of around 45 knots, and an impressive range for a boat of their size and performance of up of 750 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 25 knots. The Ukrainian versions, which, if anything, will have less equipment, are likely to have similar performance. The general aluminum-hulled design of the Mk VI also offers room for the insertion of additional weapons and other capabilities in the future. The Navy has discussed possibly adding launchers for the small AGM-176 Griffin missile , among other similarly sized precision-guided weapons . Lockheed Martin has even proposed a launcher system for the boats with four AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The rear ramp on the Mk VIs can also be used to launch and recover small watercraft, such as rubber rafts, as well as small unmanned undersea vehicles, such as the Mk 18 Kingfish underwater drone for mine-hunting. Navy personnel have demonstrated their ability to launch small unmanned aerial vehicles by hand from the boats, as well. A US Navy sailor launches an RQ-20 Puma small drone while standing on top of the pilothouse of a Mk VI patrol boat., USN Beyond that, the U.S. Navy also tested a single command and control boat version with added communications and data-sharing capabilities, but a more limited armament of just two .50 caliber machine gun-equipped remote weapon stations and the four mounts for manually-operated machine guns and automatic grenade launchers. The lone Command and Control Boat variant of the Mk VI that the US Navy operates., USN No matter what the exact configuration of any Mk VI patrol boats for Ukraine might be in the end, a fleet of 16 of them could help bolster the country’s Navy. At present, the Ukrainian Navy has a lone Soviet-era Krivak III class frigate, the 3,510-ton-displacement Hetman Sahaydachniy . This ship serves as the Ukrainian Navy’s flagship, but the core of the country’s naval combat capability comes from 10 patrol boats, across five different classes, all of which have displacements under 300 tons and the vast majority of which displace less than 170 tons. This includes the two 54-ton-displacement Gurza-M class armored gunboats that Ukraine only got back from Russia in November 2019, nearly a year after the 2018 skirmish in the strategic Kerch Strait, which links the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The head of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko, claimed that the Russians had sent the boats back in a terrible state, with even their toilets ripped out , which the Kremlin denied. When the Berdyansk and the Nikopol will return to full operational service remains to be seen. The Gurza-M class armored gunboat Berdyansk. , Ukrainian Ministry of Defense The Mk VIs are larger and faster than the Gurza-Ms , of which the Ukrainian Navy presently has six and are the most numerous combat vessels in service in the country right now, as well as the newest, with the most recent example being commissioned in 2018. Each one of these gunboats has two BM-5M.01 Katran-M weapon systems, which have a 30mm automatic cannon, anti-tank guided missiles, a 30mm automatic grenade launcher, and a 7.62mm machine gun and are the main armament on the Gurza-M s. As of 2017, Ukraine hoped to have 20 Gurza-M s in service by the end of this year, but, at present, one additional example is undergoing sea trials and another is under construction. Even if this full fleet of those armored gunboats were to become a reality, the acquisition of the 16 Mk VIs would still almost double the total size of the Ukrainian Navy’s patrol boat fleets. Of course, all of these patrol boats would be best suited to inshore patrolling and security duties, including countering any maritime smuggling to or from groups in the Donbass, as well as providing some general combat capabilities against any separatist elements that have taken up positions along the coast. However, in the past, those same forces, and Russians troops supporting them, have sunk at least one Ukrainian Border Guard Service boat using artillery fire. A Ukrainian Border Guard Service patrol boat burns in the Sea of Azov in 2014 after being hit by artillery fire , Ukrainian Border Guard Service The Ukrainian Navy still lacks the kind of capability to actively deter or otherwise challenge the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet , which would be its most likely immediate naval opponent. The Black Sea Fleet has some 50 surface vessels, including a cruiser, a destroyer, and a number of frigates, as well as six submarines. This is not to mention the expansive military capabilities that Russia has deployed on the Crimean Peninsula , which it has illegally occupied since 2014, and elsewhere in the Black Sea region, including significant amounts of combat airpower and shore-based anti-ship, as well as anti-aircraft defenses. In 2018, the United States did propose the sale of two ex-U.S. Navy Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates to Ukraine. So far, authorities in Kyiv have not pursued that deal. However, despite a significant scandal in 2019, the Trump Administration has approved the sale of and delivered significant amounts of military aid to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-tank missiles , which Ukrainian personnel could also fire from the decks of the Mk VIs, in recent years. Earlier today, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced another $60 million worth of weapons and equipment were headed for the Ukrainian military. More deals, including for Patriot surface-to-air missile systems , may now be in the works. This potential deal could also be an important sale for SAFE Boats. The Navy has said it has no plans, at least a present, to acquire any more Mk VIs beyond the 12 it has now. Since 2016, the company has continued to offer them to foreign customers, including through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. Saudi Arabia is also set to receive a number of these boats . Ukraine still has to formally decide to pursue the purchase of the Mk VIs, but the patrol boats would offer valuable maritime capabilities the country sorely needs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 19, 2020",The Stealthy F-117 Nighthawk Could Have Executed Nuclear Strikes Against The Soviet Union,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 Nighthawk continues to capture the public’s imagination well over a decade after it was officially retired . Even though it flies on in a limited fashion for testing and training purposes , its days as a combat aircraft are long behind it . While it was best known for snaking its way through enemy air defenses to strike fixed targets with pinpoint precision using conventional laser-guided bombs, the truth is the ‘Black Jet’ was fully equipped to deliver far more devastating weaponry if the balloon went up during the twilight of the Cold War. Originally, the Senior Trend program that gave birth to the F-117 included the goal of having the aircraft be able to carry the majority of the weapons the Air Force had to offer for its tactical fighter and attack aircraft at the time—the 1970s. The realization of the jet’s limitations and strengths paired down its operational weapons menu considerably. Still, all the cockpit interfaces and diverse stores management capabilities were baked into the design—including the provision to carry and employ nuclear gravity bombs —namely the B57 and B61 (shown front and center in banner image). The F-117s cockpit included an Aircraft Monitoring And Control (AMAC) panel that interfaced with the Permissive Action Link (PAL) on the nuclear weapons that allowed them to be armed and programmed prior to delivery. This hard-wired nuclear capability lasted throughout the F-117’s entire career, and, at least for a time, it wasn’t just something the Air Force largely forgot about. The ‘wooden bird” F-117 mockup that helped reduce risk prior to production of the actual aircraft included fit tests for the B61 and B57 tactical nuclear bombs. , Lockheed At first glance, the F-117 would have been a terrifying nuclear delivery platform for the Soviets to contend with. It was built to penetrate dense enemy air defenses via a cocktail of measures. Shaping, which accounted for roughly 75 percent of the aircraft’s radar cross-section reduction, and radar-absorbent materials and coatings , which made up the rest, are the aircraft’s most known and innovative traits, but its mission planning software, which was state-of-the-art at the time, was also extremely important when it came to the plane’s enhanced survivability. The F-117’s route was meticulously planned before each strike mission, with the latest electronic and other intelligence on enemy air defense threats and overall force posture factored into its every pre-planned move. Even the angle at which the F-117 presented itself to known threatening emitters was part of the computerized planning process that aimed to give the F-117 pilot the best shot at surviving based on all known factors. As such, when taking on the Russian Bear’s deeply entrenched air defenses in Eastern Europe, the F-117s chances of making it to its target would likely have far eclipsed that other tactical jets in the Air Force’s inventory at the time. An ad highlighting the mission planning systems that emanated from the F-117 program., Lockheed Sanders ad Beyond these finite details, it was a stealth attack plane the likes of which the world had never seen. It represented an almost magic-like technology at the time. Without knowing its Achilles heels, it would likely have seemed invincible to Moscow. But using the stealth jets poised to strike on the front lines of the Cold War as a nuclear deterrent wasn’t meant to be. During the mid-1980s, as the F-117 program morphed from a development and testing effort to also an operational one, the idea of forward-deploying groups of F-117s to stand nuclear alert in the United Kingdom and even South Korea were examined. The main issue with doing so was the fact that the aircraft was one of America’s most closely guarded secrets, so extending operations to two points around the globe on any scale could have resulted in the aircraft’s existence, and even its configuration and its general capabilities, to be known. Also consider that during this time the aircraft was such a tightly held secret that it lived at a remote, extremely high-security airfield in Southern Nevada and only came out at night . All of the sudden pushing the F-117 overseas, even in small groups, would have negated all the work that had been done and continued to be done to keep it secret. A shot of one of the F-117s in a hangar at Tonopah Test Range Airport. , Public Domain Just the unique infrastructure the F-117s required for prolonged large-scale operations would have made such an idea highly unattainable on a security level, not to mention it being an expensive proposition, to say the least. For so few aircraft, only 59 F-117As were built, and considering it could carry just two bombs, the trade-off in secrecy and cost against the impact they would have on a sudden nuclear exchange just didn’t balance. So, saving contingency operations, the F-117 would not serve in the nuclear alert role in any standardized fashion, at least while its existence remained highly classified. That didn’t mean that the nuclear strike mission was abandoned. Instead, operational F-117s units were well aware of the jet’s latent nuclear capability and their regular precision strike training that included infiltrating deep into enemy airspace also prepared pilots for the nuclear mission, in at least a tertiary fashion. If there was a crisis that would have required the F-117’s presence in a nuclear weapons delivery role, regardless of if it compromised the veil of secrecy surrounding it at the time, crews would have been able to spin up quickly for the unique mission and execute it if need be. F-117 releasing a GBU-27 laser-guided bomb., USAF The F-117 test enterprise, which was extremely active alongside the operational elements of the program throughout the aircraft’s early operational days to its retirement, worked at validating various deployment profiles of at least the B61 tactical nuclear bomb throughout the 1980s. It isn’t exactly clear just how diverse a set of tactics and procedures they validated, but it’s safe to say that by the end of the Cold War and beyond, the jet’s nuclear weapons delivery capability became more proven. This also points to the reality that the test team could have ramped up nuclear weapons delivery trials and refined existing procedures further in short order if geopolitical events required them to do so even early on in the jet’s active-service career. One example of the ongoing nuclear delivery profile expansion testing lies in an incident with a test F-117 flying out of Groom Lake in 1985. The aircraft had a major malfunction with its v-tail section during the test flight that included at least in part, a weapons compatibility objective. While the weapon was hanging out in the slipstream during a maneuver, the aircraft began to shake violently . The pilot was able to recover safely and the issue was quickly fixed, but the weapons integration test the program was executing during that flight was for a delivery profile—supposedly a toss from medium altitude —with a dummy B61 nuclear bomb. B61 nuclear bomb, National Archives Veteran F-117 pilot Robert “Robson” Donaldson, Bandit #321, recently appeared on the Fighter Pilot Podcast , in which a very brief mention of the F-117’s secondary nuclear mission was made, prompting our investigation. You should give the segment a listen here . We got in contact with Donaldson through our friends at the Fighter Pilot Podcast to learn more about his experience with the Nighthawk and the plane’s very seldom discussed nuclear role. Considering he flew the jet at the very tail end of the Cold War, from 1989-1992, just as the aircraft was really maturing on an operational level and at the very end of its deep ‘in the black’ existence, he would certainly be able to clarify the off-hand mention in the podcast. Donaldson told The War Zone that they never really practiced heavily for the mission, but it was always looming in the background. If the jets were needed in a crisis, they were prepared to deploy to the United Kingdom where they would prosecute targets in Eastern Europe. He remembers having to fully memorize the mission to hit his assigned target, which was in Rostock, East Germany, and he was tested on it in front of other officers in the unit to make sure he was fully up to speed should the call come. This was apparently a common experience across the active F-117 pilot corps at the time. His preparation for this mission was for a conventional weapons delivery—GBU-27 laser-guided bombs—but the idea of sudden snap deployment to hit targets in Eastern Europe could have ported over to the nuclear mission, as well. USAF Donaldson also notes that if the aircraft were to have exercised its nuclear weapons employment capability, it would have likely used the laydown method of delivery nuclear bomb delivery profile to maximize its stealthiness and survivability. This is where the aircraft zooms overhead the target and drops a retarded nuclear bomb, which would use a parachute to slow its descent to the ground, in some cases lying in the target area for a short moment in time before detonating. This allows the aircraft to get away without being caught in the nuclear weapon’s powerful shockwave. Using this method would have allowed the F-117 to maintain a relatively conservative attitude along a very carefully planned path while also minimizing the time the jet’s bay doors are open, which balloons its small radar signature. As we just mentioned, the F-117s could have been used in the non-nuclear role during World War III, as well, knocking out key infrastructure and defenses in the opening days of a conflict. Its limited range would have curtailed just how far it could have struck into the USSR and operating over an active nuclear battlefield in an aircraft no more hardened for the nuclear combat environment than any Tactical Air Command fighter of the era, may have also been issue as the conflict matured. The question of what basing and tanker support would even have been left by the time the F-117s mobilized overseas makes their involvement in any form of World War Three, aside from the opening punches if they were forward deployed in advanced, fairly questionable. The F-117 crept out of the darkness just as the Cold War and the 1980s were ending. Forward deploying the jets even while the program was still largely under wraps was tested successfully following the aircraft’s combat debut in Panama in 1989. The F-117s recovered at England AFB in Louisiana after the mission, a detail that wasn’t disclosed until many years after the mission took place. The F-117s executed a true test deployment , also to England Air Force Base, under far less secrecy in 1990, which really paved the way for future expeditionary operations. So, even with some of the secrecy and security restrictions having been relaxed, the question of if the world’s first stealth combat aircraft would be folded into NATO’s larger nuclear strategy on a consistent basis would never be answered, and thankfully so. F-117 chugging gas from a KC-10 Extender tanker., USAF While the F-117 could and did deploy overseas with some regularity after its declassification, with the threat from Russia diminished and other hotspots taking the spotlight, the notion of sending the F-117s on some sort of standing nuclear alert eroded even further. The B-2 Spirit had also transformed from dream to a flying reality in this same period and that aircraft, which was totally optimized to the deep nuclear strike mission, provided the U.S. with a penetrating stealth bomber with a huge weapons load that could duke it out with a major power during the apocalypse. The introduction of the AGM-129 stealth cruise missile into service in 1990 also made the F-117’s latent nuclear capabilities even more redundant. So, all said, you can think of the F-117’s nuclear capability as very real, but it was kept largely in reserve during the Cold War. The jet’s extreme secrecy kept it from actively deterring the unthinkable, but if a major crisis in which there was time spin-up and push some of the Nighthawks to the frontline had occurred, they could have been ready to weave their way through enemy air defenses beyond the Iron Curtain and even over of the Demilitarized Zone that bisects North and South Korea, if called upon. F-117 in one of their tailor-made barns at Tonopah Test Range Airport in the late 1980s., Public Domain As for the F-117’s nuclear capability long after the Cold War ended—it never fully melted away, although by the end of the Gulf War the Nighthawk had been crowned America’s silver bullet precision conventional strike superweapon and further refining that capability would continue to be the program’s focus till its official retirement in 2008.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 19, 2020",This Is Our Best Look Yet At The Shadowy Hellfire Missile With Pop-Out Sword Blades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged online that shows the remains of three AGM-114R9X missiles used in a recent strike on Al Qaeda-linked terrorists in Syria, providing the best look yet at the innards of this mysterious version of the venerable Hellfire, which has six pop-out sword-like blades in lieu of a traditional explosive warhead. The War Zone was one of the first to report on a previous photograph that gave us our very first look at the inner workings of this weapon. Visible markings, which include the R9X designation, seen in the new video also offer additional details. The video clip first appeared on social media on June 17, 2020. This comes three days after an AGM-114R9X strike on an SUV in Syria’s Idlib Governorates. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said its sources had informed it that two individuals, one of Jordanian nationality and another from Yemen, in the vehicle had died in the strike . Both were reportedly members of Hurras al-Din, a terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, which the U.S. government also refers to simply as Al Qaeda in Syria , or AQ-S. Experts and observers had previously determined that at least three, and possibly four, AGM-114R9Xs had struck the SUV in Idlib in total, which would match up with what looks to be components from three distinct missiles in the video. In once case, the remains of at least three blades are visible attached to a central hub structure. A second hub, with what appears to have a more complete blade still attached, is also present. Red spheres are also seen. Diagrams of previous AGM-114 variants, including the basic AGM-114R version, show a similar component located toward the rear of the missile. This is what is called a ‘pneumatic accumulator’ and is not unique to this rare variant of the missile. An official diagram showing cutaways of various AGM-114 variants, with red spheres visible inside the AGM-114K, M, N, and R variants., US Army The same hub structure and blade stubs are also seen in a photo from the aftermath of a previous targeted strike in which one of these missiles was employed against a minivan in Idlib in December 2019. You can read the War Zone ‘s full initial assessment of how the missile works here . That strike killed a member of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which Hurras al-Din split from in 2017. HTS, which had rebranded itself from the Al Nusra Front earlier that year, has at least officially renounced its links to Al Qaeda. The video also appears to show, for the first time, the official markings on the AGM-114R9X, which are, for this particular example, as follows: P/N: 13707784 AGM-114R-9X S/N: 2007108 Lot: MGP17K835M131 The marking seen in the video on the side of the remains of one of the apparent AGM-114R9X missiles, via Twitter While the clip is unconfirmed, publicly available records show that this part number, or P/N, corresponds to a “Guided Missile, Surface Attack” and indicate that it was previously associated with a Hellfire variant known as the AGM-114R9G. Of the known AGM-114R subvariants, which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone piece , information about the R9G version is particularly scant. However, information the War Zone previously received had suggested that AGM-114R9G was the original designation for the sword-blade-armed variant, but that it had been redesignated as the R9X as part of a decision to place it in a more secretive realm. This would fit with the fact that, despite its clear, if gruesome effectiveness and its low risk to innocent bystanders, the weapon appears to be issued only on a very limited basis. By all indications, drones that the U.S. military’s notoriously shy Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the Central Intelligence Agency appear to be the only ones to carry it. The U.S.-led coalition fighting against ISIS in Iraq and Syria notably told AFP that it was not involved in the most recent strike, which actually aligns with previous U.S. military statements that have suggested that this and other strikes against Al Qaeda-linked groups in northwestern Syria are part of a separate and distinct operation. The publicly available information regarding this particular part number also shows that the Air Force has been the service officially responsible for managing this variant since 2017. That is also the year when the first known instance of this weapon being employed took place, when one of the missiles killed Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader Abu Khayr al Masri while he was driving in Idlib. The War Zone Zone was first to highlight that he had likely died at the hands of a new type of exotic low-collateral damage munition. So far, the U.S. military has not officially confirmed the existence of the R9X at all, unlike the AGM-114R9H, a publicly acknowledged “very low collateral damage” version of the Hellfire that may not have a warhead of any kind inside. This is all despite now extensive media reporting and a clear and obvious increase in its use, primarily in Syria. In January, the missile was employed for what appeared to be the first time in Afghanistan . The Wall Street Journal , which first broke details about the R9X in 2019, also reported that the weapon had been fired at targets in Libya, Iraq, Yemen, and Somalia, as well. Despite this heavy secrecy surrounding the missile, it leaves far too distinct impact marks, damage effects, and identifiable wreckage due to the lack of an explosive warhead to conceal its use. The fact that the weapon is clearly marked just like any other Hellfire is another indication that knowledge of its existence is unavoidable. If anything, the AGM-114R9X is now firmly an open secret and it seems likely we will continue to learn more about it as it sees increasing use.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 31, 2020","Canada Cleared To Upgrade Its Aging CF-18 Hornets With New Radars, AIM-9X Sidewinders","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has approved the potential sale of an extensive upgrade package, dubbed the Hornet Extension Program, for Canada’s CF-18A/B+ Hornet fighter jets . The proposed deal most notably includes enough AN/APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to equip two squadrons worth of jets, which would give those aircraft a desperately needed boost in their ability to detect, track, and engage threats at extended ranges. The U.S. military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the State Department had signed off on the prospective sales, valued at $862.3 million in total, on June 16, 2020. In addition to the 38 radars, the package now on offer also includes 50 AIM-9X Block II air-to-air missiles, as well as additional training versions of the AIM-9X, and 20 AGM-154C Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bombs. The Royal Canadian Air Force already has stocks of AGM-154s, but notably does not have any AIM-9Xs , the newest and most capable variant in the Sidewinder family. You can read more about the AIM-9X Block II, which is a further upgrade over the basic AIM-9X, and the AGM-154C in these respective War Zone pieces . A Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18A+ Hornet., Canadian Forces Further upgrades and ancillary items and support services, including the addition of an Automated Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS) for the jets, 30 ADM-141C Improved Tactical Air-Launched Decoys (ITALD), Data Transfer Device/Data Transfer Units, AN/ARC-210 RT-2036 (Gen 6) radios, and software updates for the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System (ADCTS) flight simulators to reflect the upgrades, are part of the package, as well. The full itemized list from the DSCA statement is as follows: “The Government of Canada has requested to buy fifty (50) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II Tactical missiles; fifty (50) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs); ten (10) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II Special Air Training Missiles (NATMs); ten (10) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II Tactical Guidance Units; ten (10) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II CATM Guidance Units; thirty-eight (38) APG-79(V)4 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar units; thirty-eight (38) APG-79(V)4 AESA Radar A1 kits; twenty (20) Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) C, AGM-154C; forty-six (46) F/A-18A Wide Band RADOMEs.  Also included are additional technical and logistics support for the AESA radar; upgrades to the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System (ADCTS) to ensure flight trainers remain current with the new technologies; software development to integrate the systems listed into the F/A-18A airframe and install Automated Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS); thirty (30) Bomb Release Unit (BRU) – 42 Triple Ejector Racks (TER); thirty (30) Improved Tactical Air Launched Decoy (ITALD); one hundred four (104) Data Transfer Device/Data Transfer Units (DTD/DTU); twelve (12) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS); one hundred twelve (112) AN/ARC-210 RT-2036 (Gen 6) radios and F/A-18 integration equipment; support equipment; tools and test equipment; technical data and publications; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services; and other related elements of logistical and program support.  The total estimated program cost is $862.3 million.” DoD “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the military capability of Canada, a NATO ally that is an important force for ensuring political stability and economic progress and a contributor to military, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations around the world,” DSCA’s notice regarding the proposed deal says. “This sale will provide Canada a 2-squadron bridge of enhanced F/A-18A aircraft to continue meeting NORAD and NATO commitments while it gradually introduces new advanced aircraft via the Future Fighter Capability Program between 2025 and 2035.” The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) presently has around 75 CF-18A/B+ Hornets, which it first acquired in the 1980s and which have received significant upgrades in the past, including the addition of the improved AN/APG-73 mechanically-scanned pulse-doppler radar. These aircraft, which have also deployed overseas for combat missions over Iraq and Afghanistan, continue to form the core of the RCAF’s contribution to the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which guards the airspace over both countries, as well as its participation in NATO’s rotational air policing missions over Iceland and the Baltic Sea region . An RCAF CF-18A+ flies in formation with an Icelandic Coast Guard Dash-8 patrol plane., Canadian Forces The RCAF is also in the process of acquiring an additional 25 ex-Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18A/B models, 18 of which are set to eventually enter operational service after receiving their own modifications to bring them up to Canadian standards. The remaining seven jets will be used as sources of spare parts. As is the case with the proposed upgrade package for the CF-18A/B+s, the acquisition of the former RAAF jets is also supposed to help bolster the RCAF’s aging Hornet fleet until the country’s Department of National Defense selects a replacement type, a decision that government auditors have since slammed as a bad deal that is unlikely to provide a meaningful increase in overall capability. Canada’s efforts to acquire a new fleet of 88 fighter jets is a long-running and controversial saga of its own that you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . Armed-up CF-18 over the CENTCOM area of operations. , DoD If Canada does proceed with the purchase of this upgrade package it could significantly boon for the two squadrons worth of aircraft that receive the enhancements. The addition of the AN/APG-79(V)4 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar, an adapted version of the Super Hornet’s radar which slots directly into the Legacy Hornet’s existing radar bay, by itself is a relatively efficient and low-effort means of drastically improving the capabilities of its Hornets. Compared to older mechanically-scanned array radars, AESAs can spot and track targets further away and with greater speed and accuracy, even against smaller and harder to detect threats, such as low flying cruise missiles—a capability that is becoming increasingly important for the NORAD air sovereignty mission. The increased power they offer also means they generally have better target discrimination capabilities and multi-target tracking capabilities, as well as greater resistance to electronic warfare systems. Above all else, they are more reliable than their mechanically scanned array counterparts. You can read more about AESA radars in this past piece of ours . This could be very useful when combined with the AIM-9X Block II’s expanded engagement envelope , which is thanks to its two-way data link and lock-on after launch capability. The AIM-9X, even the Block I variant, can also take better advantage of cueing from the aircraft’s improved radar, in general. However, these radars would be even more valuable when combined with the improved AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Canada had gotten approval to buy those missiles back in 2017, but without the AESA radars for its Hornet that would’ve been essential for getting the most of them. You can read all about this interesting situation in this past piece of ours . There is no indication that the Canadian government followed through with that purchase in the end, though it may be something they move forward with now. A breakdown of the Block II AIM-9X Sidewinder’s new features., USN Canada’s preset lack of AIM-9Xs also limits its Hornet’s within-visual-range combat capability. The RCAF is still using the AIM-9L/M, which does not have high off-boresight targeting and engagement capability, yet their CF-18s have been equipped with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS) that are used to target the AIM-9X by the pilot looking at the target. The F-22 famously has the opposite issue . It has the AIM-9X, but no helmet-mounted display to get the most out of the missile. Regardless, this capability mismatch will be plugged if this acquisition goes through and the RCAF’s fighter pilots can finally get the most out of their JHMCS. An RCAF Hornet pilot climbs aboard while wearing JHMCS. , RCAF Upgrading at least a portion of the RCAF CF-18A/B+ aircraft could become increasingly more of a necessity as delays and other issues continue to dog Canada’s fighter replacement plans. This year alone, the Department of National Defense has already twice pushed back the deadline for companies to just submit their final bids, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Firms now have until July to send in their offers. The expected competitors are Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , and the Saab Gripen E . France’s Dassault, which had planned to pitch its Rafale, announced it was dropping out in 2018 over technical data-sharing requirements and the need for a high degree of interoperability with American combat aircraft because of the NORAD mission. Canadian authorities still hope to receive the first of the country’s new fighter jets in 2025 and have the full fleet of 88 aircraft operational within around a decade after that. It remains to be seen if they will be able to keep to that schedule. RCAF In the meantime, the CF-18A/B+s will continue to soldier on, but with roughly half the active fleet potentially getting this upgrade, it will certainly give them a considerable capability boost and put them inline with just under 100 USMC F/A-18C/Ds that are slated to get a similar set of enhancements . Canada still has to officially move forward with the plan now that the potential sale is approved by the U.S. Government, but at this point, it seems like they have little choice.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 1, 2020",Air Force Says These Are Its Options For Hiring Private Aerial Refueling Companies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released a report it sent to Congress earlier this year about how it might make use of private contractors to provide aerial refueling services to support various non-combat training and testing activities. The service has been exploring this for years now, but there has been an increased impetus for doing so recently given significant issues with the new KC-46A Pegasus tanker aircraft. The Air Force has said it will not use those aircraft for day-to-day aerial refueling operations of any kind, except in an emergency , until serious problems get fixed, which will take years. This has raised concerns about a tanker gap as its aging KC-135R and KC-10A fleets become more difficult to operate and maintain. Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett sent the report, which outlines five separate potential courses of action, many of which The War Zone has also outlined on multiple occasions in the past, to Congress on April 22, 2020. However, the service only publicly released a copy just last week as part of its ongoing discussions with private companies about a potential aerial refueling services contract. Aviation Week was first to report on the document , which the House Committee on Armed Services had requested as part of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2020 Fiscal Year. “Air refueling is a critical capability which sustains Joint force readiness and enables global power projection in support of all National Defense Strategy mission areas,” the report says in its executive summary. “ Recent testimony by the Commander, USTRANSCOM [U.S. Transportation Command] indicates the aerial refueling fleet is their most-stressed capability and number one readiness concern.” “Degraded readiness of the existing aerial refueling force, delays in delivery of capable KC-46s , planned force structure reductions of KC-10s and KC-135s , and forecasted increases in aerial refueling demand indicate a critical and deepening shortfall in taskable aerial refueling aircraft and aircrews, especially over the next 5-7 years,” it continues. A KC-10A refuels a KC-46A, while a KC-135R flies in the foreground., USAF It’s worth noting that Air Force aerial refueling tankers routinely support U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft during combat operations and non-combat activities, such as training and long-distance movements, as well as providing similar support to American allies and partners overseas. With this in mind, the U.S. military’s joint service Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), in cooperation with the Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC), which oversees the bulk of the service’s tankers, has been in charge of exploring the use of contractors to make up for possible future shortfalls in available aerial refueling support. It’s also important to note that the Navy has been employing private contractor Omega Air Refueling support non-combat activities since 2001. However, the Navy, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, employ the probe-and-drogue aerial refueling method, while the Air Force uses the boom method. TRANSCOM and the Air Force need boom-equipped tankers, though possibly with secondary probe-and-drogue capability, to meet their requirements, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Omega only recently began introducing tankers with booms into its fleets. A briefing slide showing the Air Force’s draft requirements for a potential aerial refueling services contract, as of December 2019., USAF TRANSCOM did initial market research in 2018, before consulting directly with the AMC. The two organizations established the Commercial Air Refueling Working Group to further explore available options in 2019. That year, after multiple discussions with representatives from private industry, the Working Group crafted five possible contracting options, which are as follows. Just give contractors Air Force tankers to use The first proposed option is simply to have contractors fly Air Force tankers as part of a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement. This is a concept the U.S. military as a whole routinely employs for various activities, including aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations . The Air Force’s report notes that there are potential legal and regulatory hurdles to implementing this course of action, as well as all of the other four proposals, which could at best delay or at worst prohibit the service from pursuing it. In this particular case, the main challenge would be in the time necessary to certify contractors to operate U.S. government-owned aircraft. On top of that, it’s not clear if this plan would be viable at all given that the primary issue is a lack of available tankers, not personnel, as well as the age of the aircraft in service now. “The USAF does not have, at this time, any excess tanker aircraft available to provide to a contractor under a contract for services,” the report notes. “Additionally, because of service life issues identified with legacy tanker airframes, further study is needed to determine whether these aircraft would be viable for contract air refueling service.” The report does say that this might be a useful interim option, if “excess legacy aircraft are available” and “the cost and feasibility hurdles to extending the life of legacy aircraft, and commercial sources of qualified personnel can be overcome,” to provide time to pursue a more permanent option. The Air Force estimated it would take between 12 and 18 months to implement this strategy after awarding a contract. Sell or lease surplus tankers to contractors The second potential course of action the report outlined is to sell or lease surplus aerial refueling tankers to private contractors. At present, there are 14 KC-135Rs at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, as well as numerous older KC-135 models, though the exact state of these aircraft is unclear. Additional KC-135Rs, as well as KC-10As, could become available to private companies when and if the Air Force is able to proceed with its retirement plans for those aircraft. KC-135s, among other aircraft, in storage at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. , kitmasterbloke via Flickr However, the Air Force’s report highlights significant potential legal impediments to this plan. As it stands now, by law, the process for divesting surplus military equipment, including aircraft, is by way of the General Services Administration (GSA) through a public auction , where no preference can be given to a particular buyer, after putting the system in question through a demilitarization process. “The demilitarization guidance governs the DoD’s requirements to demilitarize key military components, to include the aerial refueling systems, which would void the current airworthiness and receiver aircraft air refueling certifications,” the report explains. The contractor, if they successfully acquired the aircraft at auction, would then have to restore these capabilities and make the aircraft airworthy again, a time consuming and potentially costly process. The report also raises concerns about what might happen if the contractors that bought the tanker decided not to bid on future aerial refueling contracts or otherwise lost out to competitors. Leasing would be another option that could help mitigate this and other concerns, but, by law, the Air Force cannot issue such a contract for more than one year at a time, which would force it to go through this process every 12 months. The Air Force ultimately described this proposal as being similar in viability to having contractors fly Air Force tankers and another possible near-term option ahead of a more robust solution. However, the service said that it could still take between two and five years to implement this course of action after a contract award. Have contractors buy foreign surplus tankers The Air Force’s third proposal is to recommend contractors purchase surplus boom-equipped tankers from foreign governments, particularly those that the service previously facilitated the sale of through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Since Air Force Materiel Command was technically the original purchaser of those aircraft, primarily KC-135s delivered to various allies and partners around the world, they already had to been certified to meet its standards. A number of foreign KC-135R operators are in the process of retiring those aircraft, if they haven’t already , meaning that there will be an increasing number of these aircraft on the open market. The report does highlight that many of these tankers are aging themselves, just like their Air Force counterparts, which could lead to higher operating and maintenance costs. In addition, KC-135Rs supplied to foreign customers do not use the exact same boom as the Air Force’s version. “FMS aircraft use what is called a FMS Boom (Boeing proprietary), which is about 75% compatible with the USAF High Speed Boom,” the report notes. Unfortunately, there are no current suppliers for the remaining 25 percent of the components that are not common between the two designs. If a new supplier base or another adequate source of spare parts could not be found, there would be a need to modify these booms into a sustainable configuration. The Air Force added that this course of action could be slowed depending on how hard it might be to get new U.S. type certifications for these aircraft and given the still limited number of properly equipped tankers available for purchase overseas. The report does note that there is “one, and possibly two, commercial air refueling operators are in the process of acquiring used boom-equipped air refueling aircraft from a foreign government that could accelerate the potential feasibility and timeline of this option.” The Air Force did not name either of the two companies in question. However, Omega Air Refueling did acquire a boom-equipped ex-Royal Netherlands Air Force KDC-10 last year, making it the first private company to acquire a tanker capable of refueling via this method. Omega Air’s new KDC-10., Don Rogers With all this in mind, the Air Force said it could take anywhere from 12 to 18 months to five to seven years to implement this strategy. Have contractors use converted commercial aircraft The fourth potential course of action the Air Force outlined is hiring private contractors to fly non-combat aerial refueling missions using commercial aircraft converted into boom-equipped tankers. This, of course, would require those companies to buy suitable aircraft, modify them, and certify them to meet the service’s standards. This is not to say that this couldn’t be done. In 2018, Lockheed and Airbus announced they would team up to offer commercial aerial refueling services using the latter’s A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) design, which is already in service around the world, including in a boom-equipped configuration. Other contractors could seek to acquire A330s on the open market and modify those aircraft to a similar configuration. A Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A, a version of the A330 MRTT with a boom., USAF The War Zone previously learned that a small contractor called Bison Aerospace and Defense explored what it might take to convert Airbus A310s into boom-equipped tankers, but it is unclear what, if anything, ever came from that effort. We have reached out in the past without getting a response. What was then known as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, or EADS, demonstrated a version of the A310 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) with a boom in the late 2000s. The A310 MRTT boom demonstrator., via Wikimedia Boeing itself has supplied boom-equipped 767-based tankers, known as KC-767s , to foreign air forces in the past, before the development of the troubled KC-46A, which is based on the same airframe, but uses a unique configuration of components from different 767 variants and is more militarized overall. Israel Aerospace Industry’s Bedek Aviation Group has also been selling modified Boeing 767, though primarily with probe-and-drogue refueling systems only. Bedek had planned to offer a boom-equipped version to the Israeli Air Force as a potential replacement for its aging KC-707 tankers, but has said Boeing, which is also vying for that contract with the KC-46, blocked that plan to narrow the competition. The Air Force’s report said that this was the option with the longest potential timeline to implement, possibly taking between seven and 10 years following a contract award. Have contractors buy new commercial-off-the-shelf tankers The fifth and final potential option would be for contractors to acquire brand new tankers from aircraft manufacturers. The Air Force would stipulate that these be existing commercial-off-the-shelf designs to help keep costs low, but the service still said estimated the average unit cost for these aircraft, which aerial refueling companies would have to pay up front, would be around $300 million each. As already noted, a number of manufacturers are offering boom-equipped tankers. It’s possible that those companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Airbus, could cut out the middle man and offer the aircraft themselves, to help keep costs low. Utilizing designs that the Air Force may have already certified, or that are similar to tankers the service has already tested, could help ease the ever-present regulatory concerns, as well. The service has already extensively evaluated the A330 MRTT, for instance, as part of two previous tanker competitions. The Air Force said that it could take at least two years to implement this strategy. Where does the Air Force go from here? Private contractors that TRANSCOM and the Air Force consulted with said that they were interested in the first, third, fourth, and fifth proposed courses of action, according to the report. There is no specific explanation for why companies said they were not in favor of the second potential option, the sale or lease of surplus aircraft, though, as noted, that plan did have significant potential issues. “The cost per flying hour for these solutions ranged from $15,000 to $27,000, but could drop to between $12,000 and $15,000 once the contract capability was established,” the report says, but does not specify which options these cost estimates apply to. “Commercial contractors desire a long-term contract structure, of possibly up to 10 years, in order to obtain the necessary return on investment.” The report also reveals that, at present, it costs the Air Force an exorbitant $98,000 per flight hour to operate the KC-46As, despite their limited capabilities, though “cost per flying hour projections for KC-46 will decrease as the program progresses to steady state.” By comparison, the KC-135R’s cost per flight hour to operate is $26,000, while that of the KC-10A is $23,000. This puts the price of flying the Pegasuses closer to that of the B-2 stealth bomber, which sits at around $122,000 per flight hour , than other tankers. A KC-46A refuels an F-16C Viper fight jet during a test., USAF But perhaps what’s most interesting, especially given the report’s concerns about how long it might take to implement any of the proposed courses of action with a potential tanker gap looming before the decade is over, is how long the Air Force has waited to actively explore alternatives and why. The report notes that the service consulted a report on contractor air refueling that TRANSCOM produced in 1997 , as well as one regarding private companies providing both refueling and airlift support that the Office of the Secretary of Defense produced that same year. In both cases, no action was taken based on the position that any commercial tankers would need to be able to support combat operations and that they would limit opportunities for the Air Force’s own tanker crews to train together with other aircraft. A 2006 RAND Corporation report on KC-135 Recapitalization reiterated those viewpoints. In 2008, Congress even compelled the Air Force to conduct a pilot program to assess the costs and other issues related to possibly employing contractor aerial refueling services for certain missions. The Air Force estimated it would cost between $850 and $900 million to hire two contractors to each provide two tankers, with both companies providing 2,400 hours worth of aerial refueling support in total each year over five years. At the time, the Air National Guard said it could provide equivalent support over five years for $215 million and the pilot program was scrapped. Then, as was the case in 2006 when RAND issued its report, as well, the Air Force did have access to far more aerial refueling tanker capacity and had more available airframes that it does now. The KC-46A program has also now underscored how difficult it has become for the service to field a new tanker. The saga of Boeing’s latest design is further magnified when one considers it took the company less than year to go from the first flight the original KC-135, which took place on Aug. 31, 1956, to it entering service. The Air Force’s view of what services contrators can provide has also dramatically evolved in the past two decades. Last year, it hired no less than seven companies to provide “red air” aggressor support , as well as air-to-ground training services , at bases across the country as part of a multi-billion dollar deal. Whether or not the conclusions from those various assessments were accurate at the tie, the Air Force, together with TRANSCOM, now appears to be steadily moving toward hiring contractors to provide aerial refueling support in some fashion. With the KC-46A still years away from getting the fixes necessary for it to reach its full operational potential, the value of hiring private companies to help meet the demand for additional tanker support will only keep growing.

Aaron Amick,"Posted on Jun 30, 2020","Nukes, Nubs And Coners: The Unique Social Hierarchy Aboard A Nuclear Submarine","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Living in a machine with over 100 sailors requires a person to be flexible socially and sometimes physically. I spent two decades on United States Navy submarines performing sonar duties among eccentric personalities in incredibly stressful situations. When sailors report to their first submarine, they are joining a work culture unlike any other. Surrounded by crew members busily moving about tight spaces and narrow walkways, announcements over the circuit boxes, roving watchstanders, equipment humming to 400hz fans, it can be anxiety-inducing to any sailor. That is why every new crewmember starts as a NUB. But, if they work hard and learn the systems, they will earn their dolphins and become a member of another entirely unique subculture within the grander social hierarchy that exists within the confines of the submerged tube they call home for months on end. Here’s is what is expected of a new crew member and a bit about the various ‘unique’ groups of people aboard the submarine, one of which the NUB will find themselves an integral part of once they get minted a submariner. The NUB A new crewmember is a Non-Useful Body, or NUB. He or she uses our limited supply of space, water, food, and oxygen. They are not welcome, but BUPERS (Bureau of Personnel) keeps sending them. The NUB is easily identifiable as he will be the only crewman wearing a command ball cap with the ship’s name and no Dolphins symbol on the front. They have their qualification card in their rear pocket at all times and had better have a small notebook in their hand for studying. They do not have movie privileges unless they are a “Hot Runner.” Hot Runner refers to a torpedo self-starting despite the fact it hasn’t been launched yet. Very dangerous, but Submariners like that kind of initiative in the NUB. A sailor washes down the USS Washington (SSN-787)., USN Everyone, officer or enlisted, is a NUB when they report to their first submarine. They are treated with contempt. In the case of the officer, it’s respectful contempt, sir. The NUB is expected to qualify in submarines within 12 months. This can be extended a few months if there are outside circumstances that delay qualification opportunities. Qualification on a U.S. submarine is a formal process completed in phases. The first phase introduces all the major systems around the boat. This orientation phase is purposefully designed to ease the NUB through the culture shock of living inside a machine the Navy sends to submerge in the ocean for weeks on end. This introduces the NUB to their fellow crewman, one watch station at a time. This first impression will affect how difficult their qualification path is because the crew decides if you are to become a submariner or not. They must earn their confidence. They must prove that they can perform emergency actions without direction and with confidence during a ‘casualty,’ when something goes wrong. A sailor mans the main console of the ship’s Ballast Control Panel on board the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine USS Pennsylvania (SSBN-735), USN Phase two of submarine qualification is the most difficult. It requires detailed knowledge of every system on the boat, from the nuclear powerplant, to ventilation, to electrical and hydraulic systems, to simple atmosphere scrubbing and gravity drains. The Non-Useful Body must memorize every system, be able to draw it from memory on command, and know the initial actions they must perform if a causality occurs to that system. Even if it’s not their assigned equipment, they must know how to prevent a failure from cascading into a major casualty that could be catastrophic for the boat. Phase three of submarine qualification is the most physically demanding. This is the walkthrough phase. The NUB will walk through every level of every compartment one at a time with a qualified crewman. During this tour, they may be dressed in full protective gear like a Fire Fighting Equipment (FFE) asbestos bodysuit and wearing breathing protection. This physical discomfort compounded with an oral interview answering detailed system-specific operational questions simulates a small, but important amount of stress compared to what they would endure during a real casualty situation. Sailors assigned to USS Indiana (SSN-789) eat dinner in the crew’s mess while underway., USN Phase four is ‘The Board.’ This is the end phase of the submarine qualification and is more difficult to schedule than it is to pass. The NUB must find at least three submarine qualified crewmen who have three to five hours of off-watch time at the same time to be part of an oral interview board. There must be at least one submarine qualified officer, one senior enlisted man, and one system expert on the Board. It is customary for the qualifying crewman to bring a small snack to the Board. Usually, there is a bowl of Jolly Rancher hard candies, but I have seen a cook make a full dessert platter with pastries and a cake. The Board members can’t ask hard questions when they are enjoying some sugary treats! A sailor checks a radar display while another studies a chart inside the control room of the USS Florida ( SSGN -728)., USN If a Board interview is failed, a crew member can reschedule a second board when they are ready. He or she is only restricted by the time constraints of the qualification schedule. If they fail a second board they may be removed from submarine service, but this is very rare. Good submariners can be built if given enough time by the crew to help them. I have seen both enlisted and officers wash out of the submarine qualification program and in each of those cases it was for the better. It very possibly saved their lives and ensured the safety of our ship. The final phase is a one-on-one interview with the Executive Officer and the Commanding Officer. Every submarine qualified sailor is awarded their dolphins with the full confidence and trust of the submarine Captain. By this time, the crewman has earned the respect of their shipmates and demonstrated that they know the basics to keep the submarine in fighting shape, no matter the circumstances. U.S. Navy Master Chief Jeffrey Bottoms, chief of the boat for the USS Rhode Island , far left; Navy Cmdr. Robert J. Clark, commanding officer for the Rhode Island, and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Paul Pampuro, far right, watch as Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class William Corring speaks at a ceremony in the Rhode Island crew’s mess as the submarine patrols in the Atlantic Ocean, Aug. 16, 2010. Corring received his Dolphin pin during the ceremony., USN After achieving the approval of the crew and getting one’s dolphins, they get categorized into one of two groups—Nukes and Coners. The Nuke Crewmen who work in the engine room are called Nukes. They are made up of high school graduates who loved Star Trek so much they decided to role-play their science fiction fantasy in real life. Incredibly smart and able to digest volumes of information in a short time, these mystical figures often whisper of powerband constraints and millirems amongst themselves. They use math so much in their daily routine they ran out of numbers and added some Latin letters to their measurement logs. They are best avoided at mealtime and are given their own table in the crew’s mess next to the Chief Petty Officers. Nukes come in three varieties: The Reactor Operator is likely the stereotypical 90-pound geek who maintains a World of Warcraft account despite being underway for 10 months of the year. He’s wiry, lanky, and a little jittery from energy drinks. Despite his excitement, he is the smoothest Reactor Operator in the nuclear program and can catch a power spike like he’s dimming the bedroom lights next to his waifu body pillow. Nukes studying one of the boat’s systems., USN The Nuclear Electrician is the most chameleon-like and may be difficult to spot in a crew photo. He often has average height and build allowing him to blend in with the ‘Coners’ if left unchallenged. He gives himself away by always having a Sudoku puzzle book tucked inside his poopy suit and a faint odor of ozone follows him around. The Nuclear Mechanic is the protector and enforcer of the engine room. These sailors are often very large compared to their fellow Nukes. They have oil-stained fingers and faded blue poopy suits that have seen more underway time than was intended. They eat at the Nuke table in the crew’s mess with gusto, filling their frames with enough carbs to make it through the next six hours in the hot engine room. Life in the engine room is routine at sea. No matter what the mission or our deployment location they serve one purpose: Push the Cone. The Coner Coners live in the Cone. That’s any space forward of the engine room. They make up the rest of the crew. A grab bag of cultures and backgrounds, from small-town USA to big city living, the Cone represents a microcosm of the United States’ young men and women. This mix of people come together at the needs of the Navy and perform well despite their differences. Submariners scan the horizon through periscopes aboard the fast attack submarine USS Santa Fe (SSN-763) searching for contacts during a transit of the Pacific Ocean., USN The Radioman is the most elusive of the Coners. He spends his time locked in his ‘Radio Shack’ both off watch and on. This limited access space offers a small amount of privacy not seen anywhere else outside the Captain’s stateroom. From this room, messages are dispatched around the boat. Radiomen are the gatekeepers of all message traffic from the most sensitive top-secret orders to routine personal messages. No matter what is happening or planned, the Radiomen know about it first. The Quartermaster , or “QM,” could be mistaken for a militant artist with his bandolier of colored pencils and erasers. He is the ‘Keeper of the Chart.’ Hunched over a plotting table for six hours at a time, he is constantly calculating and verifying the ship’s position. Off watch, they are preparing charts for the next day or next mission. A modern, Neo-QM has turned in his colored pencils for a tablet pc and paper charts for their digital replacement, but their fixation for geolocating and browsing rules of the aquatic road remains a constant. Plotting a course aboard Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Texas . , USN Sonarmen , sometimes referred to as “shower techs” or “sonar girls,” are the most eccentric of the crew zoo. In a world where every evolution from flushing the toilet to firing up the kettle has a written procedure, the sonarman works in the most liberal and creative of environments. Sonar is a talent-based skill that varies from sailor to sailor and some of the best are also some of the most unstable personalities to be awarded a secret clearance. They are most likely encountered in or near the shower as they have an affinity for bathing underway. Missile Technicians , “MTs,” are the stewards of ‘Sherwood Forest.’ Rising between levels in the missile compartment, 24 large orange trunks fill the nuclear ballistic submarine like an apocalyptic orchard. MTs rove around the ballistic missile tubes checking temperatures and pressures, ensuring their precious reentry vehicles and the nuclear warheads nested inside them are very comfortable. The watertight hatch that separates the rest of the boat from ‘Sherwood Forest.”, USN Auxillarymen , or an “A-Ganger,” is a hostile creature and the natural predator of the sonarman. A combination of ‘Nuke Waste,’ a sailor who failed nuclear power school, and a backyard diesel mechanic, the A-Ganger is the gruffest, foul-mouthed sailor onboard any United States Navy vessel. They are responsible for scrubbing the atmosphere clean, managing the waste tanks, and keeping the sweet Fairbanks Morse diesel engine running smoothly. They appear to be a less evolved Nuclear Mechanic whose smell is as rank as their language. The Torpedoman can always be found in the torpedo room. Both on watch and off watch, the torpedo room is the crew’s social center on an attack submarine. A master of small arms and heavy explosives, the Torpedoman is the weapons master of the crew. They are always cleaning rifles and polishing the torpedo tubes to a new level of brass brightness. They are often found in pairs due to their reader-worker routines, checklist and grease pencil in hand. If you find yourself in the torpedo room, look for the most heavily armed person there and that is your Torpedoman. Torpedomen conduct maintenance on small arms in the torpedo room aboard the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Helena (SSN-725). , USN The Cooks , or Mess Specialists, are the most liked persons of the submarine crew. They dish out 1,000 calories of happiness every six hours, every day and keep the crew fueled. While every crewman has their watch team and circle of friends, everyone knows the cooks. Clad in very distinctive white chefs outfits and paper hats, they manage to serve up chow with a smile and light banter to keep morale up. Anyone who has spent time at sea respects the cook. Cooking ng up some pancakes on a Los Angeles class fast attack submarine. , UNS Yeomen are crewmen with a very specific skill. They can type. Commonly found in the ‘Yeomen Shack’ hunched over a keyboard like Schroeder on the piano or in the torpedo room yammering about how they don’t have to stand watch because they work so much. The Yeoman is the Executive Officer’s right hand and has a chest full of Navy Achievement Medals to prove it. He or she processes the paperwork bureaucracy that keeps the Navy afloat and flowing in the right direction. Doc , the submarine’s Corpsman, also known as the “Pecker Checker,” keeps everyone healthy or at least can identify when someone is not.  From dispensing the Navy’s universal cure, Motrin, to the ‘morale check’ (a slap on the crotch), the Doc makes sure everyone has absorbed enough radiation for evolutionary mutation and is ready to stand watch. Master Chief Hospital Corpsman David Peterson administers a flu vaccine to Machinist’s Mate 1st Class Kyle Leoard aboard the Los Angeles -class fast attack submarine USS Cheyenne (SSN 773)., USN This is the American Submarine crew. On their own, they may be goofy and socially awkward, but as a crew, this band of misfits becomes the best warfighters I have ever had the honor of serving with. Life on board a submarine is rewarding because it is a demonstration of what a diverse group of people can achieve under incredibly difficult conditions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Her Majesty’s Coast Guard in the United Kingdom has found the wreckage of a U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle that crashed in the North Sea earlier today. Search and rescue efforts are continuing in hopes of finding the pilot of the jet, who remains missing. The aircraft, assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath , was on a routine training mission at the time of the crash. The crash, the cause of which is unknown, occurred at approximately 9:40 AM local time, according to the 48th Fighter Wing, which operates both F-15C/D Eagles and F-15E Strike Eagles. The full statement from the Wing is as follows: “A U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle crashed at approximately 0940 today in the North Sea. The aircraft was from the 48th Fighter Wing, RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was on a routine training mission with one pilot on board. The cause of the crash as well as the status of the pilot are unknown at this time, and U.K. Search and Rescue have been called to support.” “As soon as additional details become available, they will be provided.” Local news outlets in the United Kingdom have reported that the crash site was around 74 nautical miles from Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast. Her Majesty’s Coast Guard quickly responded by sending an S-92 helicopter and two lifeboats to the area to look for the fighter jet and its pilot. Other U.S. Air Force and U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft have been spotted flying the area assisting in the search and rescue effort, as well. This included three Air Force KC-135R tankers and two B-52 bombers, as well as an RAF Voyager tanker and Typhoon fighter jets. An RAF E-3 AWACS assigned to NATO has been helping to coordinate the search and rescue effort, too. CV-22 Osprey tilt rotors , with a KC-10 tanker in support, also reportedly joined the search. The Air Force has Ospreys in the United Kingdom assigned to the 7th Special Operations Squadron at RAF Mildenhall. These aircraft represent the service’s top combat search and rescue capability. There are also reports that an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft may have been present for at time supporting the search and rescue operation. A significant number of American aircraft, as well as those from NATO allies, are presently operating in the region, in general, as part of the annual Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) exercise , which began on June 7, 2020, and is scheduled to run through June 16. This crash comes just over a month after another F-15C went skidding off the runway at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington, D.C. after making an emergency landing. There have also been a string of other mishaps involving F-22 Raptors and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters at various bases in the United States in the past two months. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 1:45 PM EST— The 48th Fighter Wing has now sadly confirmed that the pilot of the F-15C that crashed in the North Sea, whose name is being withheld pending notification of next of kind, died in the accident earlier today. “Our deepest condolences go out to the pilot’s family and the 493rd Fighter Squadron,” Air Force Colonel William Marshall, the Wing’s commander, said in a videotaped statement, seen below. Update: 6/16/2016— The 48th Fighter Wing has identified the pilot of the F-15C who died in the crash in the North Sea on June 15, 2020, as 1st Lieutenant Kenneth Allen, the Assistant Chief of Weapons and Tactics for the Wing’s 493rd Fighter Squadron. The full statement is as follows: “With next of kin notifications complete, we can confirm that the pilot killed in yesterday’s F-15C Eagle crash was 1st Lt. Kenneth Allen, assistant chief of weapons and tactics for the 493rd Fighter Squadron.” “Allen first arrived at the 48th Fighter Wing in Feb. 2020, and is survived by his wife and parents.” “‘We are deeply saddened by the loss of Lt. Allen, and mourn with his family and his fellow Reapers in the 493rd Fighter Squadron. The tremendous outpouring of love and support from our communities has been a ray of light in this time of darkness,’ said Col Will Marshall, 48th Fighter Wing commander.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces F-15 Fighters Search And Rescue U.S. Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020",Navy Super Hornet Conducts First Guided Launch Of Impressive ‘Stormbreaker” Miniature Bomb,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ​​​​Raytheon says that a U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet has successfully conducted a guided release of a GBU-53/B StormBreaker glide bomb for the first time. The test comes as deliveries of these bombs to the Navy, as well as the U.S. Air Force, have been halted for months over a number of issues, including the premature failure of clips that help prevent its folding tail fins from springing open and inadvertently, potentially damaging the aircraft carrying them. The Massachusetts-headquartered defense contractor publicly announced the flight test on June 15, 2020, but did not say when or where it had taken place specifically. The Air Force is also in the process of integrating the GBU-53/B onto its F-15E Strike Eagles , and the weapon is also slated to get added to the arsenal of all three F-35 Joint Strike Fighter variants, which will be able to carry them internally. “StormBreaker is the only weapon that enables pilots to hit moving targets during bad weather or if dust and smoke are in the area,” Cristy Stagg, the StormBreaker program director at Raytheon’s Missiles and Defense division, said in a statement. “Super Hornet pilots will be able to use poor visibility to their advantage when StormBreaker integration is complete.” The GBU-53/B, previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb II, has these capabilities thanks to a robust multi-mode guidance system. The bomb can find its mark, on land or at sea, using an imaging infrared seeker or millimeter-wave radar, or by using semi-active laser-homing to zero in on the target. The weapon also has a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system to help get it to the general target area first, after gliding first for up to 69 miles, depending on the release profile. The launching aircraft can also use this mode to strike fixed targets directly. The weapon is also compact, allowing aircraft to carry a large number of them at once, giving them added magazine depth. The F-15E will be able to carry up to 28 of them in total on seven special racks, each loaded with four bombs. The Navy’s Super Hornets will also be able to use those bomb racks and all three variants of the F-35 will be able to carry four of them in each of their internal bays. This is similar to how U.S. military aircraft carry the existing GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb, which is a Boeing product. You can read more about the GBU-53/B, which Raytheon has been working on since 2010, as well as the older GBU-39/B, in this past War Zone piece . Marines conduct a fit check to make sure that four GBU-53/Bs fit inside the internal bay of an F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. The B variant has truncated weapons bays due to its short and vertical takeoff and landing configuration and required modifications to accommodate the StormBreakers internally., USAF Unfortunately, when the Air Force or the Navy may actually begin fielding the weapons is unclear. The Air Force had previously planned to declare initial operational capability with StormBreaker on the F-15E this month, but that has been pushed back at least until August, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). “During operational testing in 2018-2019, the program completed 56 mission scenarios and reported 11 failures,” the Congressional watchdog reported. “According to program officials, eight were software related and are being addressed through new software releases, two were hardware related and corrective actions have been implemented, and one was the result of an anomaly with the guidance component.” “The program may have to redesign the component and conduct retrofits on all bombs delivered to date,” it continued. Beyond that, the production of the third lot of GBU-53/Bs for both the Air Force and the Navy has been paused for months after the discovery of a number of safety issues and is only scheduled to resume next month at the earliest, which Defense News was first to report . The most glaring of these issues is the untimely failure of retaining clips that secure the bomb’s four folding tail fins. Vibrations from the aircraft carrying the weapons during flight were the cause of these parts breakages. A GBU-53/B StormBreaker loaded onto an F-15E Strike Eagle during a test. The problematic retaining clip is visible around the tail fins at the rear., Raytheon “The problem is related to fatigue of the clips holding the fins in place until the bomb is released from the aircraft,” GAO’s report explained. “While this problem could affect all aircraft carrying the bomb, officials said the greatest impact is to the F-35, because the bomb is carried in the aircraft’s internal weapons bay and could cause serious damage if the fins deploy while the bomb is in the bay.” Air Force Captain Jake Bailey, a spokesperson for the service, told Defense News last week that the clips are a backup safety measure and in testing, so far, there have been no instances where the bomb’s fins accidentally deployed prematurely. The clip issue, which Raytheon is working to mitigate now, is the sole remaining issue to be solved before production can resume. The company will pay out of pocket to develop the replacement part and will refit all of the existing 598 bombs it has delivered so far when the new clip is ready. As for the third production lot, specifically, 204 of the 312 bombs on order have been delivered so far and will need the upgraded clips. The new parts will also be added to the remaining 108 bombs in that lot, as well as all others going forward. GAO also revealed that the StormBreaker program had run into a significant supply chain issue regarding circuit boards that Raytheon uses in the manufacture of the weapon’s guidance system. The supplier of those boards has said it will stop making them because they’re otherwise obsolete, four years earlier than expected. “As a result, the program needs to order all circuit cards necessary to complete production by December 2020,” the Congressional watchdog’s report noted. It’s not clear how this might impact further production down the road, but “the program is working with the Office of the Secretary of Defense on a mitigation strategy.” The Navy has said in the past that it expects to reach initial operational capability with the GBU-53/B on its Super Hornets this year, but it’s unclear how these various delays might impact those plans. It remains to be seen whether the Air Force will meet its own new goal of having these bombs ready for use on its F-15Es by August. Despite these various issues, StormBreaker does appear to be making steady progress toward finally entering service with at least one branch of the U.S. military in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 2, 2020",Japan Halts Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Plans Indefinitely Amid Public Opposition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono has publicly announced a decision to suspend the establishment of two Aegis Ashore missile defense systems in the country indefinitely. Kono cited technical issues and rising costs as the main factors, but there has been significant domestic opposition to the program, which already forced Japanese authorities to abandon plans to deploy one of the missile defense systems at a site in the country’s northeastern Akita Prefecture. Japan’s top defense official informed members of the press about the shift in the country’s missile defense plans on June 15, 2020. Kono said he had told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about the decision on June 12. The Japanese government finalized their initial plans to set up the two Aegis Ashore sites back in December 2017. The U.S. government formally approved the sale of the missile defense systems, as well as ancillary items and support services, a complete package valued at around $2.15 billion , in January 2019. Japan had already pushed back the date it hoped to have both Aegis Ashore systems up and running from 2023 to 2025. Kono blamed technical issues, and the costs to rectify them, as the primary reasons behind the suspension of the Aegis Ashore plans. The main issue, he explained, was ensuring that the rocket booster from the SM-3 missile interceptors that are the system’s primary armament would fall away from the rest of the interceptor and not hit populated areas down below. The Japanese Defense Minister said that attempts to modify the software in these weapons to make sure the debris only lands in designated areas has been unsuccessful so far. This promises to be an issue for all SM-3 variants, including the still-in-development Block IIA version, which the Japanese government has been working on together with the United States for years now. Japan has spent approximately $1.02 billion of its own money on that project, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . The Block IIA is designed to offer significantly expanded capabilities against larger missiles over earlier versions of the SM-3, all of which are intended to engage ballistic missile threats flying outside the Earth’s atmosphere during the midcourse portion of their flight . The Aegis Ashore sites also have the potential to be able to launch other missiles , such as the increasingly capable SM-6 missile series , in the future, as well. A breakdown SM-3 Block IIA’s configuration and the workshare on various components between the United States and Japan., MDA The Japanese Defense Minister’s explanation, however, inherently underscored the significant pushback that the country’s authorities have faced over the Aegis Ashore plans since they were first announced two and a half years ago. There has been significant public concern about the potential health impacts from the radiation from the Aegis Ashore system’s powerful radars. Japan’s sites are set to use Lockheed Martin’s Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) in place of the AN/SPY-1 that the U.S. Navy presently employs in its version of the system. The main control center at the U.S. military’s Aegis Ashore missile defense test complex in Kauai, Hawaii. Japan’s Aegis Ashore sites are expected to be of a similar design, but with Lockheed Martin’s Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) instead of the AN/SPY-1 seen here., Kyodo via AP Images On top of that, in June 2019, Japanese officials had to make the embarrassing admission that they had picked one of the two planned Aegis Ashore sites, the Araya Maneuver Area in Akita Prefecture, based on miscalculated terrain data from Google Earth . Japan’s Ministry of Defense agreed to redo 20 geographical surveys to reassess whether Araya was indeed the best option, and hoped to have the results ready by March. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has repeatedly pushed that schedule back and authorities announced that they had formally abandoned plans to use the site in Akita without choosing a substitute in May. Domestic opposition had also been building in communities near the other proposed site situated in the country’s southwestern Yamaguchi Prefecture. “For the time being, we’ll maintain our capability of missile defense by Aegis-equipped destroyers,” Kono said. At present, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has seven guided-missile destroyers across three classes with the Aegis combat system that are capable of firing SM-3 variants, which represents a key component of the country’s current ballistic missile capabilities. This includes the advanced JS Maya , the first of two planned so-called 27DDG destroyers, which the JMSDF commissioned in March and that you can read more about in depth in this past War Zone piece . These ships are also set to receive the advanced SM-3 Block IIA interceptors. The Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) also operates a number of Patriot surface-to-air missile system batteries, as well, a number of which are now capable of launching the newest PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors. However, these systems still have a far more limited terminal phase ballistic missile defense capability compared to the mid-course intercept capabilities of the existing Aegis destroyers and planned Aegis Ashore sites. An infographic describing the general capabilities of the PAC-3 MSE interceptor for the Patriot surface-to-air missile system., Lockheed Martin The Aegis Ashore sites were supposed to provide Japan with an additional layer of defense against potential threats, especially from North Korea’s ballistic missile arsenal , which has been steadily growing in size and scope in recent years . The North Koreans, who have recently begun making worryingly provocative threats against South Korea and have shut down formal lines of communication after years of thawing relations between the two sides, have test first missiles over Japan’s home islands , as well as near Japanese territorial waters , on multiple occasions in the past. There were also expected to expand the country’s general regional missile defense capabilities. Friction between Japanese and Chinese officials over long-standing territorial despites , particularly surrounding the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which Japan controls, has been growing in recent years. The Senkakus are more than 550 miles southwest of Japan’s home islands, but are less than 250 miles east from the Chinese mainland. Japan’s Aegis Ashore sites were also set to be heavily integrated with the U.S. military’s own ballistic missile defense assets in the country and the overall American ballistic missile defense infrastructure around the world. A new delay in the Japanese government schedule for setting these sites up, or if authorities in Tokyo decide to give up on the effort entirely, could also limit the defenses available to U.S. forces in the country and elsewhere in the region during a major contingency. Regardless, for now, Japan has halted its Aegis Ashore missile defense plans. With no sign that domestic opposition to the establishment of the two sites is waning, it very much remains to be seen how the Japanese government will now decide to proceed with the project in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has a robust fleet of 737s. Today, nearly all of them are C-40s, which act as executive and priority passenger transports, but they are not totally alone. For instance, one older NT-43 example that is heavily modified and extremely shy, goes about its shadowy business as an airborne aircraft signature measurement test laboratory. But by and large, the 737’s role within the Air Force’s stable is well known. Now a strangely modified 737-700 with a civilian registration, but an Air Force owner, has just emerged and its past is just as murky as its current mission. The aircraft in question carries a civilian registration number N712JM, which is a bit odd for an aircraft owned by the United States Air Force. The Boeing jet came to our attention when it showed up at the Santa Maria Public Airport in Southern California. The images sent to us by an aerospace enthusiast showed the aircraft in detail with its unique, if not crude modifications. It must be stated that this is a busy public airport and no moves were made to hide the aircraft in question. FAA It is also a bit interesting that the area has many military base options, but it landed in Santa Maria. This is not unheard of by any means, military aircraft often use private fixed base operators (FBOs) for refueling and to work out of for basic cross country training and other proficiency flights, but this decision will become a bit more puzzling as the story unfolds below. Also, the witness said the crew was wearing t-shirts and very casual attire—not your normal buttoned-down Air Force aircrew, by any means. The 737-73W first flew in 2013, but seven years later, it still wears its green zinc chromate coating that it was delivered with. Usually, this is immediately stripped and the aircraft is painted before entering service. I have talked to a number of experts in Boeing airliner products, none of them have ever heard of a Boeing jet wearing its factory coating for so long and it was noted that it appears to be corroding in some areas. Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of the theaircurrent.com , told The War Zone : “This is definitely an airplane that never made it to a formal finish you’d expect from a commercial airplane. The green finish is a protective coating applied to fuselages during manufacturing to protect from scratches and other damage. It is dissolved during painting. You can also still see the manufacturing (line) number as well that’s from its original trip down the assembly line. There’s also quite a bit of instrumentation visible with sensor wiring leading into the cabin through the passenger windows. this type of arrangement points to a flight test setup of some kind.” Reader submission The plane’s history is also highly puzzling. It was originally delivered to a Wells Fargo Bank trustee, a common way to hide the true ownership of an aircraft and a financial tool often used by aircraft owners, in 2013. It stayed this way until April of 2019, when a relatively obscure company named Denmar Technical Services took ownership of it. The company simply describes itself as “providing our customer with superior radar measurement systems and services” and nothing more on its website. Note, it says customer, not customers. They are based in Reno, Nevada, and have relatively minor activity in terms of disclosed government contracts. The company owned the aircraft for a short period of time, just one year almost to the day, before it was transferred to the USAF. During this time, and a year before it, there was no flight data we could find under its registration until it showed up in Colorado Springs in March of 2020. The aircraft appears to have been a resident of Sierra Nevada Corporation at Colorado Springs Airport, which is adjacent to a significant Air Force Base that shares its runways, but the mystery 737 wasn’t being housed there. SNC is maybe the world’s most known aircraft modification company, especially for unique military applications. So, a specially modified 737 is literally right up their alley. The aircraft had taken a handful of local flights in May, likely check flights to test its airworthiness and its modifications, before making the trip from Colorado Springs to Santa Maria on the 12th of June. With the aircraft on the ground there, it brings us up to the time when the photos were taken. They show the aircraft with what appears to be wiring and sensors speed-taped all along the fuselage. The modifications cover nearly the entire length of the airframe and punch through the cabin windows in some areas. The War Zone ran these modifications by a number of airliner experts who, at first glance, didn’t notice this particular configuration and found it to be quite unusual. Reader submission Reader submission Reader submission Reader submission Reader submission Things get even more interesting the next day, when the aircraft in question, under the callsign “STING38,’ flew a mission from Santa Maria far out into the SOCAL Range Complex. Adsbexchange.com This area, which sits off the Baja Peninsula and San Guadalupe Island, is associated with long-range missile tests and carrier strike group workups, not common test flights of 737s. It was just highly active for the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group’s COMPUTEX training, which occurs just prior to deployment. It is a remote and quiet place to also test new capabilities far from areas where they could interfere with populated areas, especially in terms of radio frequency-related trials. USN The 737s flight lasted roughly five hours. Whatever it did out there required substantial presence over the area. So, what the heck is this thing up to? We really have no idea. Is it testing a new electronic surveillance measures suite for large aircraft? The sensors placed around the aircraft would make sense as these systems use interferometry to geolocate emitters, such as active radars and other air defense nodes, as well as communications systems. What about some sort of conformal communications system? Or was this something totally different, like to evaluate 737 airframe durability or some other sort of aerodynamic testing? That would seem odd considering the details we know about this aircraft shadowy ownership, but it is entirely possible. Some notes on the aircraft’s ownership. The Air Force technically owns the fleet of ‘ Janet Airlines’ 737-600s that move folks around to Area 51, Tonopah Test Range Airport, and other sensitive sites. Apparently, Denmar has done some modifications to ‘Janet’ aircraft in the past, although that was one of the King Airs that are known to move around smaller numbers of people that work at clandestine sites around the American Southwest. Also, this aircraft is a 737-700, not a 600, and the Janets are registered to Hill AFB, not Bolling AFB like N712JM. It’s also worth noting that Bolling AFB is home to the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), and it appears that the registered address of this aircraft is the exact same address of the RCO. The RCO heads up cutting-edge high-stakes programs such as the X-37B spaceplane and the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . As such, using a 737 to test a new subsystem that is destined for an aircraft like the B-21 would be right within their purview. Then again, this could be something else entirely, either more mundane or far more exotic, but whatever it is, it is definitely unique, because this aircraft has a life and origin like no other testbed aircraft we know of. As such, at least for now, N712JM remains very much an enigma. What do you think? Have you seen modifications like this before? Let us know in the comments below. UPDATE: 1:00 PM PDT— She was up in the air again, down in the SOCAL range just like yesterday. This was a six-hour flight: Adsbexchange.com Another possibility is flight-testing a system for PNT ( positioning, navigation, and timing )— navigation in a GPS denied environment .

Fire season is upon us and the 10 Tanker team has deployed two of their four DC-10-30 very large air tankers (VLATs) to Arizona to fight the ongoing blazes that have struck the state. With fires burning on steep mountain ridges and inside tight canyons, the DC-10’s power and maneuverability, and the 10 Tanker crews’ skills, have been put to the test. Like always, they put on quite a show. Case in point are the videos below showing some of the most extreme recent retardant drops over the Copper State that will leave you biting your nails and holding your breath. You can read more about these awesome life and property saving converted DC-10 tankers, as well as check out some of their most incredible drops, in these past posts of mine . While the DC-10s held the mantle of the world’s biggest aerial firefighting aircraft after Evergreen retired its largely passed-over, but way ahead of its time 747-100 VLAT, the 747 has regained the crown once again, with a 747-400 now in service with the Global Supertanker.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 27, 2020","Easing Drone Export Rules Is Great For The Defense Industry, But Doing So Has Consequences","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We knew this had been at least on the table for some time, but Reuters reported today that the Trump Administration is looking to ‘reinterpret’ the over three decades old Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The MTCR is an agreement between 35 countries that places severe restrictions on the export of missiles and unmanned aircraft that can carry payloads of more than 1,100 pounds to distances of more than 190 miles. The Administration’s change policy could allow the U.S. to export military-grade unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), even possibly those with kinetic capabilities, to many more governments than the handful that are allowed right now. Doing so would represent a huge financial opportunity to U.S. aerospace and defense firms that currently have a very limited set of customers they can sell more advanced unmanned systems and their accouterments, including munitions, to. This change would likely lead to whole new classes of American-made drones that specifically address foreign customers’ unique needs and financial limitations. In other words, the development and sale of advanced U.S. drone tech wouldn’t be largely restrained to the systems the Pentagon has developed for itself. While all this may sound great to some, there are some potentially massive negative consequences that could come with such a policy shift, as well. Reuters reports : Reinterpreting the MTCR is part of a broader Trump administration effort to sell more weapons overseas. It has overhauled here a broad range of arms export regulations and removed the U.S. from international arms treaties including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty. Sidestepping the accord would allow U.S. defense contractors General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc and Northrop Grumman Corp to break into new markets currently dominated by less sophisticated offerings from China and Israel, which do not participate in the MTCR. Heidi Grant, the Pentagon’s Director of Defense Technology Security Administration, declined to comment on the pending MTCR policy change but said the U.S. military is eager to see drone sales expanded to more countries. Such sales would bolster the militaries of allies and replace drones sales from other nations, she said. “If we are unable to meet this growing demand, we shoot ourselves in the foot,” Grant told Reuters. She said the drones would help allies fight terrorism, establish border control and generally help stop threats before they reach the United States. Grant declined to name specific nations the Pentagon believes should get more U.S.-made weapons. The State Department, which makes final decisions on drone sales, declined to comment on the policy change. The White House also declined to comment. U.S. agencies including the departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice and Homeland Security agreed to the change in May, and the State Department is expected to approve the first drone sales under the new interpretation as soon as this summer, said the U.S. official and industry executives. They said the administration has already notified Northrop Grumman and General Atomics, the two major U.S. drone makers, of its plans. The change is scheduled for a review by the White House National Security Council at its June 16 meeting, said one of the executives and a former U.S. official with knowledge of the internal policy discussions. The council is expected to support the policy change and discuss a possible White House announcement, they said. While Grant is correct that drones could help friendly countries fight terror and monitor their own borders, they have also been proven to be increasingly decisive weapons used in proxy wars far from a country’s own shores. Maybe the best example of this is how Turkey changed the tide of the civil war in Libya in recent months, with the country’s indigenously developed armed Bayraktar TB2 drones massively contributing to the success of that operation. In fact, some would argue the arrival of the Turkish drones largely turned around the conflict for the struggling government in Tripoli. Turkish President Recep Erdogan in front of one of the country’s game-changing Bayraktar TB2 armed drones. , AP Bayraktar is also a good example of a drone class the United States does not make or export. It sits between the larger and more complex MQ-9 Reaper and smaller drones like the RQ-7 Shadow, but does not rely as heavily on beyond-line-of-sight data-links for man-in-the-loop control like the MQ-1 Predator. This is a niche in the marketplace that seems most attractive for air arms abroad that may not be able to afford a Reaper, or even a high-bandwidth satellite data-link controlled drone of any type, or that may not want to deal with the technological complexity of those systems, but does want higher performance, long-endurance, and the kinetic punch of something larger than what’s available smaller and shorter-ranged types. It’s also worth noting that Turkey, which is party to the MTCR, built the Bayraktar specifically to fall just within the lower Class II section of systems that are less regulated by the MTCR. Without having to rely on the U.S. as the primary customer, along with a small handful of potential buyers abroad, innovation can happen across the UAS industry in the United States at a far more rapid pace if America’s policy in regards to the MTCR were to shift. While this sounds great for business and technological innovation, there is clearly a dark side to the equation. Proliferating unmanned systems, some of which may be capable of striking targets with pinpoint accuracy over considerable ranges, provides new and potentially destabilizing capabilities to countries that are not as close to the U.S. foreign policy orbit or its circle of trust than what was required previously. The proliferation of kinetic drone systems, especially, will also inflame an already slowly building unmanned arms race around the globe. As such, countries that are not allied with the U.S. or its friends will increasingly look to procure or develop their own capabilities in this regard. This, combined with what is clearly a lower threshold of use than manned platforms in an armed conflict, could invite some fairly disastrous unintended consequences. While some will say that these outcomes are inevitable, accelerating conditions in which drone wars become far more commonplace is a fairly ominous proposition, especially as defenses against this type of technology are still many years behind even the current pace of the drone threat . Israel was a pioneer in unmanned aircraft technology and still has some of the most capable and battle-proven drones of all different sizes on the market. Here is a Huron that has similar capabilities as the MQ-1 Predator., AP Even in the unarmed role, the fact that these systems could be used on a country’s own population in ways that run counter to American values, especially when it comes to hardline state surveillance and quashing descent, could also be a less than stellar byproduct of opening up export restrictions for these systems. Yet it’s worth noting that the use of unmanned aerial surveillance even over U.S. soil is moving in a direction many are uncomfortable with. Then again, if the United States doesn’t export these capabilities even to those it calls its friends, someone else eventually will. In fact, they already have been. China, in particular, which is not a formal member of the MTCR, though it has ostensibly agreed to abide by its guidelines as they were first defined in 1987, has been aggressively selling its armed drones abroad. Those systems have proven to be less reliable and effective than their western counterparts, but Beijing’s diverse set of unmanned technologies are accelerating developmentally at warp speed and the issues found in their first generation of drone exports will increasingly be solved in follow-on generations. China’s CH-5 has improved upon the CH-4 and corrected some of its major deficiencies. , Public Domain In fact, in some ways , China could eclipse the U.S. in unmanned aircraft technology in the not too distant future unless more of an emphasis is put on unmanned tech in America’s national defense strategy. Also, China isn’t the only exporter of military-grade unmanned aircraft systems. Israel, which is also not a member of the MTCR, as well as Russia, which is, among others, also have offerings that compete with some U.S. options or fulfill a different capability set that the U.S. doesn’t even have a ready solution for. But regardless of the Defense Department’s support, loosening export restrictions could turbocharge the American drone industry and keep the U.S. on the leading edge of all aspects of the unmanned air combat revolution. When it comes to industry, unmanned aircraft manufacturers big and small, and the many companies that support their programs, stand to gain huge from this change, but for General Atomics, in particular, it could be a godsend. The aeronautical systems arm of this diversified high-technology firm has long held the mantle of the predominant unmanned aircraft manufacturer for the U.S. Air Force, but with the MQ-9 Reaper production line facing its end, the MQ-1 Predator already retired , the Avenger seemingly stillborn , at least in terms of robust domestic orders, and Boeing winning the Navy’s unmanned tanker contract, the storied drone maker faces a murky future . General Atomics’ Predator family of unmanned aircraft largely sparked the unmanned air combat revolution, but domestic orders have stalled. Being able to export these existing designs and build new ones for specific customers abroad would be a huge boon for the company. Here we see Predator, Reaper, and Avenger together., General Atomics Concepts like a high-value asset protector drone have been thrown out there, but as it sits now, the next big shot General Atomics has at a major U.S. Air Force contract will be for the MQ-9’s replacement in 2030. That program has been dubbed the MQ-Next. Of course, there are plenty of classified initiatives underway, but the ability to export their armed products to many different customers, including the stealthy Avenger and SkyGuardian version of the MQ-9, and to design new drone types to satisfy specific overseas customers’ needs, could provide a very solid fiscal foundation for General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. for years to come. So, as you can see, this is a very complicated issue with massive implications, good and bad. Above all else, the growing demand for such a change to America’s drone export policy serves as yet another reminder that the future of air combat, both at home and abroad, is very much unmanned.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. RAF Bentwaters bustled alongside RAF Woodbridge, commonly known as the ‘Twin Bases,’ near Britain’s eastern shore during the Cold War. Various tactical jet types were based there over the decades and the base had a nuclear alert mission during most of its existence that would have seen the atomic bombs stored in its high-security magazine sent to prosecute the apocalypse. Supposedly, it also played host to one of the most bizarre known encounters between the military and a seemingly unknown craft in 1980, an event commonly referred to as the Rendlesham Forest Incident . The base, which has been converted into a business and studio park of sorts after the U.S. Air Force vacated it in 1993, is like a Cold War Disneyland—a fairly ominous place frozen in time that has been used as the set to many entertainment projects over the years, and rightfully so. It has some cool features that would cost huge money to replicate for the big or small screen. Arguably the most bizarre of them is the aptly named and out of this world looking ‘Star Wars Building.’ I randomly stumbled across this odd structure while researching another project. I had never seen anything like it. It was clearly designed to attenuate the concussive shockwave from a nearby blast and make attacking it directly on the ground far more challenging, but it looked more like a modernist monument or something out of science fiction than the usual heavily reinforced concrete fortifications built for military applications. RAF Bentwaters looks like a movie set as it is, with its guard towers, fortified hangars and operations buildings, weapons magazines, and fenced in control areas, but this thing looked like it was dropped down to earth from another planet. Just some of the retired RAF Bentwaters include watchtowers, high-security weapons bunkers, an engine-run hush-house, and much more. , Bentwatersparks.com After a bit of research into the intriguing structure, that is in a somewhat secluded area near the nuclear weapons storage area and surrounded by auxiliary aircraft parking areas, I quickly learned that it was nicknamed the “Star Wars Building,” which made perfect sense. But little else was available on why it was built, when it is what built, and who used it? Moreover, was this structure a one-of-a-kind design, or were there similar buildings at other U.S. air bases in Europe? I certainly haven’t heard of any. The almost temple-like Brutalist lines of the Star Wars Building. , Bentwatersparks.com Military aviation museums are an incredible trove of knowledge that would otherwise be long forgotten. It turns out that the long-closed base has an outstanding one, the Bentwaters Cold War Museum . I reached out to them in an attempt to learn more about the structure in question. The reply I promptly received from the museum’s Graham Gilbert was absolutely awesome. When was the ‘Star Wars Building’ built and what was its primary use? It wasn’t there in 1986 as we have an aerial photo from that year of the base, so I’m guessing it was around 1987/1988. It was built for the 527th Aggressor Squadron. The 527th Aggressor Squadron was one of a small number of specialist units that provided training to other squadrons on Soviet air combat techniques. The 527th with their F-16C Fighting Falcon jets covered all Europe’s NATO needs and there were also other aggressor squadrons in the USA and Asia. After a training mission with other NATO aircraft, which very often were based at Bentwaters on a week’s detachment, the Star Wars building was used as an Air Combat Manoeuvring Instrumentation (ACMI) debriefing facility where the pilots would go through the combat training mission they had just flown. The 527th had a short lifespan at Bentwaters… They were assigned to the base from 1st of July, 1988 until the 30th of September, 1990. The building was then used by the 510th Tactical Fighter Squadron’s maintenance personnel for staff use and keeping maintenance records on the Squadrons A-10 ‘Tank Buster’ jets which were located in that area of the airfield. A Block 30 F-16C of the 527th Aggressor Squadron at RAF Woodbridge. A faded insignia is still visible on the hardened aircraft shelter today.  , USAF It seems like a very unique design. Do you have any details about how it ended up looking like that? The wall around the single-story building is to help protect it from nearby bomb blasts if a war had broken out. The front walls are faceted to deflect the blast away from the building, although the side and rear walls are flat! Inside the Star Wars Building today. The facility is quite large with a labyrinth of rooms, lab-like areas, and corridors., Bentwatersparks.com To your knowledge, is there any other structure similar to it at other bases in the UK or Europe? As far as we know it is a one-off design. Can you give me a little history on the base’s nuclear mission? What type of alert was in place and what aircraft would deliver the weapons if the call had come? What special alterations were made to the base for this purpose? The USAF’s 81st Fighter Wing who arrived at RAF Bentwaters (and RAF Woodbridge close by, they were known as the Twin Bases) in September, 1951. The 81st was an all fighter-interceptor F-86 Sabre equipped wing, then from October, 1954 on, the Wing started to re-equip with the F-84F Thundersteak which had a tactical nuclear strike mission. Being a single seat and single-engined jet, they carried one small nuclear bomb and targets would have been airfields and other military targets. The F-84F Thunderstreaks were replaced with the F-101A/F-101C Voodoo in 1958, the Voodoo was twin-engined and bigger, but was still a single pilot aircraft. The Voodoo’s were replaced with the F-4C Phantom in 1966 (later the F-4D model replaced the C) which were roughly the same size as the Voodoo, but had two crew. These were all still tactical nuclear strike mission aircraft. We have spoken to some of the pilots who said they knew it was going to be a one-way mission. One F-101 Voodoo pilot told us that his target was a military airfield in Poland and after dropping his bomb he was to fly to a spot near the Norwegian coast and eject and await pick-up from a U.S submarine. Phantoms at RAF Bentwaters in 1978, shortly before the base lost its nuclear mission. , National Archives When the A-10 ‘Tank Buster’ jets replaced the F-4 Phantoms in 1979, the nuclear strike mission finished. There are eight alert ‘barns’ on Bentwaters (four at Woodbridge) which were located in the ‘victor alert’ area close to the Western end of the runway so that the jets could take-off to the East. When operational, this area was highly secure with triple fences and a security tower. The jets on alert would sit loaded with a nuke one to each ‘barn’ and depending on the alert status, the crews would be inside a separate building close to their aircraft. National Archives The nukes were stored on base in a special bomb store called the WSA, Weapons Storage Area. This was a row of earth-covered bunkers also in a very secure area with triple fences, entry control zone, dog patrols, security tower, and a security police blockhouse which also contained an armored vehicle. Here are three great videos. The first is of the base in 2001, including the abandoned Star Wars Building, which pops up at seven minutes and 25 seconds into the video’s runtime. The second is some more recent drone footage of the base, with great shots of the Stars Wars Building and the nuclear weapons storage area. The third is just the second part of the video: The best photo collection I have seen of this haunting place is from Behind Closed Doors Urban Exploration , which you can and absolutely should check out here . They include the best shots of the interior of the Star Wars Building and some great images of the nuclear storage areas and checkpoints. So, there you have it, the strange and totally unique Star Wars Building at RAF Bentwaters, a relic to a time long gone that lives on today to make fantasy a reality. Because of its current mission, the good news is that you may very well see the structure appear in a blockbuster movie or science fiction show. Bentwaters Parks, which now operates the installation for commercial purposes, rents out various areas for television and film production, as well as for creative events. I mean, the high-security gate and turnstile area alone is just about as good as it gets for a military thriller or dystopian movie set, right?

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2021",Senate Looks To Block Many Of The Pentagon’s “Tough Choices” Airpower Cuts In Next Budget,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When the Pentagon released its budget proposal for the upcoming 2021 Fiscal Year it included a number of significant planned cuts to military aviation programs across the services. As The War Zone noted at the time , Congress still had to approve those divestments and, in many cases, they looked set to face major opposition from legislators. Now, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) has signed off on a draft version of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which, as expected, seeks to block many of the proposed cuts, if it gets passed and signed into law. The House of Representatives will still need to craft their own bill and make sure it aligns with the Senate version, before a full vote can take place, as well. However, only two of the 27 SASC members voted against this Senate draft, underscoring that there is wide agreement across party lines in prohibiting the U.S. military from getting rid of various aircraft, at least for another year. Here is a brief overview of the actions the Senate’s current version of the NDAA would take if passed today: Block any cuts to the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft fleet. The Air Force is seeking to retire the oldest 44 A-10s in the 2021 Fiscal Year. Delay any divestment of KC-135R and KC-10A aerial refueling tankers until a full fix for the troubled Remote Vision System (RVS) on the KC-46A is implemented. The Air Force had initially wanted to get rid of 13 KC-135Rs and 16 KC-10As in the upcoming fiscal year, before backing away from that plan . Boeing has agreed to completely overhaul the RVS, a saga you can read about more here , but does not expect to have developed a full fix until 2023 at the earliest. The Air Force recently said it had pushed back the planned date to approve the start of full-rate KC-46A production to 2024 and the service has previously said it will not use these aircraft for day-to-day aerial refueling missions in the meantime, except in an emergency . Prevents U.S. Special Operations Command from getting rid of any manned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, such as the U-28A Draco . Blocks U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) planned purchase of manned “ armed overwatch ” light attack aircraft “until it is determined the Air Force’s current forces have neither the skill nor capacity to provide close air support to U.S. forces deployed operationally.” SOCOM has said it wants to replace its U-28As with this new aircraft. “Requires the Secretary of Defense to recommend a minimum number of bomber aircraft to enable the Air Force to carry out its long-range penetrating strike mission.” The Air Force wants to retire the 17 oldest B-1B bombers in the 2021 Fiscal Year. Adds 12 more F-35A Joint Strike Fighters for the Air Force, as well as two more F-35Bs and F-35Cs for the Marine Corps and Navy, each, respectively. This would bring the total purchase of F-35s in the 2021 Fiscal Year to 60 F-35As, 12 F-35Bs, and 23 F-35Cs, or 95 aircraft in total. The Pentagon’s 2021 Fiscal Year Budget proposal called for the purchase of 79 Joint Strike Fighters, 19 fewer than Congress had approved funds for in the 2020 Fiscal Year. “Increases MQ-9 procurement by a total of $170.6 million to prevent termination without a replacement.” The Air Force’s 2021 Fiscal Year Budget proposal included an unexpected announcement of that service’s plans to stop buying MQ-9 Reapers starting in the 2022 Fiscal Year. The service has now initiated a new program to find a Reaper replacement, dubbed MQ-Next . Slows divestment of F-15C/D Eagle fighter jets. The Air Force has asked for funds to procure 12 more F-15EX Advanced Eagles in the 2021 Fiscal Year, but that acquisition program may now be facing delays due to the decision to hold a competition to select which company will supply the engines for those aircraft. No mention is made of any required changes to the Air Force’s proposed plan to cut all 21 of its older Block 20 and Block 30 RQ-4B and its three EQ-4B Global Hawks, the latter of which carry the highly specialized Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload. The Senate’s draft NDAA also includes some interesting proposed additions and other changes that could impact U.S. military airpower plans, especially for the Air Force. Enshrines the goal of an Air Force with 386 operational squadrons into law. Authorizes the modification and transfer of six F-35As originally bound for the Turkish Air Force to the U.S. Air Force following Turkey’s ejection from the Joint Strike Fighter program last year over its purchase of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system. Demands that any munitions that Joint Strike Fighter program members are certifying for use on their aircraft be certified for use on all F-35s. “Requires the Navy to create a fighter aircraft force structure acquisition strategy and report on aircraft carrier air wing composition and carrier-based strike fighter squadrons to better prepare for potential conflicts envisioned by the National Defense Strategy.” Adds 10 AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) to the Air Force’s budget to “enhance our ability to blunt a Chinese offensive.” Shifts $75 million from purchases of AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) land-attack cruise missile variants to support the purchase of additional LRASMs. “Requires a plan for the operational test and utility evaluation of the Low-Cost Attributable [sic;  Attritable] Aircraft Technology [ LCAAT ] System, an innovative solution with game-changing capability and capacity, and increases funds by $128 million above the President’s request to purchase addition XQ-58 aircraft and operationally relevant testing.” Adds another MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone to the U.S. Army’s budget “to meet state requirements for unmanned fixed wing ISR.” Of course, as noted, the Senate and House Armed Services Committees still have to finalize their respective drafts and make sure they line up, so these provisions are by no means final. The full Senate and House will also have to pass the final versions of the law and President Donald Trump will then have to sign it. Still, with such consensus within the Senate on this version of the NDAA, across party lines, would indicate that many of the major airpower plans the Pentagon has are set to be curtailed, if not blocked entirely.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 19, 2020",Scaled Composites’ Mysterious Stealthy Jets Spotted Working With High-Flying Proteus (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scaled Composites’ mysterious Model 401 demonstrators flew together yesterday along with the company’s Proteus high-altitude test platform in what appears to have been some sort of test operation not far from their home base at Mojave Air and Space Port. The flight was captured from the ground by one of our readers, aerospace enthusiast Hans Friedel. According to Hans, on June 9th, 2020, the following occurred: “I noticed on ADSB-Exchange that the Northrop/Rutan Proteus was flying an irregular pattern out over Lake Isabella. There was also a Northrop/Rutan Model 401 circling around the Ridgecrest/China Lake area. Both the Proteus and Model 401 were circling around 24,000 feet… Around noon, the Proteus and the Model 401 joined up over lake Isabella and flew in my direction towards Mojave. I pulled over to see if I could see them and to my surprise both Model 401s were in formation with the Proteus high overhead… I don’t think there are any photos of any of these planes together in formation. When I looked closer at ADSB, I noticed that the two 401s had been there all along, flying identical paths in formation. I’m wondering if the 401s were involved in some sort of loyal wingman test. The Proteus and at least one 401 recovered to Mojave Air and Space Port – not sure if both did.” Formation of Proteus and both model 401s and the earlier flight track of the 401s in formation. , Hans Friedel/ADSBexchange.com Adsbexchange.com Note, N401XD appears to be working out of NAWS China Lake. , Adsbexchange.com Adsbexchange.com Proteus first flew in 1998 and has since become one of the legendary aerospace design and manufacturing firm’s most successful vehicles. It has been used to prove many technologies and concepts of operation, with its ability to carry outsized payloads in central gondola-like pods to high altitudes—up to 65,000 feet—for the better part of a day. These payloads have included everything from rockets, to NASA scientific payloads , to dummy bombs, to the Global Hawk’s newest radar system. Proteus’ design also influenced the company’s ‘White Knight’ mothership aircraft that haul their suborbital manned spaceships up tens of thousands of feet for launch. Proteus, which hit is 1,000th flight back in 2017, is one of kind, with no other examples of the test platform ever being built. NASA The Model 401, also known internally as ‘Son Of Ares,’ is far more of a mystery. While their existence has not been a secret and they do fly and operate in the open, their exact purpose and even who they were built for remains unknown. The War Zone has kept maybe the closest eye on this intriguing program and we have been able to discover some information about the aircraft and its unique lineage, but an overall idea of the program and its objectives remains a question mark. Last we wrote about the Model 401, it was headed to NAS Patuxent River for some sort of trials. We later received indications that this visit was likely to test the stealthy design’s radar cross-section in laboratory-like conditions. Although not ‘very low observable’ in nature, the design has well-established low-observable features that definitely reduce its radar and infrared signature. Being built from composite materials only helps in terms of the type’s radar profile when viewed from different aspects and at various wavelengths. There has been some speculation as to what these aircraft are meant to do, especially in terms of being possible surrogates for unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) or that they may even be optionally manned themselves. Some sort of loitering reconnaissance platform and light attack role has also been floated. The design has large ventral bays that could hold sensor turrets and other systems and their wings are canted upward providing a better line-of-sight to the horizon while orbiting over an area. Scaled Composites So, with all this in mind, Hans’s comment about a possible loyal wingman test isn’t without its merits. A similar concept was envisioned using a version of Proteus as a central player over a decade ago as part of what eventually was coined in the press as the Hunter-Killer unmanned aircraft project. A militarized and strictly unmanned variant of Proteus, known as the Model 395 , was eyed to be procured in conjunction with that program’s goals. With the B-21 Raider coming online in the not so distant future , an aircraft that is primed to work as a centralized command and control and networking platform for swarms of unmanned combat air vehicles, using Proteus and the Model 401 demonstrators to test the building blocks of such a capability, and the communications architecture that will underpin it, would make sense. The B-21 will likely have a high operational ceiling that will give it long line-of-sight connectivity, something that Proteus could emulate in follow-on testing as the B-21 works towards its first flight. It’s also worth noting that the Scaled Composites is owned by Northrop Grumman, the manufacturer of the B-21 Raider. If the two types were indeed working together, as they seem to have been, a sensor Proteus was carrying could have been tested against the low-observable Model 401s. The Global Hawk’s new Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar, which has been tested extensively on Proteus, has a latent air-to-air capability that hasn’t been developed, but that could be changing especially as low-observable threats are proliferating around the globe. There are plenty of other larger airborne sensors in development that would need flight trials, including the B-21’s future radar system. Proteus with MR-RTIP radar system that is now flying on the Block 40 Global Hawk. , Scaled Composites As such, the Model 401s may be used as flying low radar cross-section targets in a similar manner as to how the retired F-117s have been used , working as something of a flying control variable to benchmark sensor systems. Of course, this very well could be just one of their uses and not even their primary reason for existing. And maybe they were up to something totally different, we just don’t know. For instance, there are plenty of initiatives ongoing in the artificial intelligence-infused air combat space alone that will need surrogate aircraft. An optionally manned one may be highly attractive at least for some of those tests. Like so many of Scaled Composites’ unique designs, the Model 401 aircraft could have multiple purposes, some of which will emerge as time goes on and technology moves forward. In fact, that is the story of their namesake, Ares, which started life as a gun-toting very light battlefield interdiction demonstrator and went on to work in many developmental roles, including acting as an unmanned aircraft surrogate and more. Ares early in its career as a gun-slinging close air support demonstrator and later as a surrogate testbed. , Scaled Composites We formally inquired about the Model 401 as recently as last month, but nothing more about the program was released to us. With both demonstrators hard at work, maybe we will find out more about them in the not so distant future. We will certainly keep an eye out for future missions with Son of Ares flying in conjunction with Proteus, as well. UPDATE: The three aircraft flew again today, and like the day before, one of Model 401s appears to be working out of NAWS China Lake. Apparently, F-117s were also up today and flew into China Lake at around the same time. They could be part of the test, as well. An EA-18G Growler appears to also be involved in some manner. Hans mentioned it was also present on June 9th, but it wasn’t clear how involved it was. It actually ended up landing at Mojave on that day. Here are the flight tracks from today: Adsbexchange.com Adsbexchange.com Adsbexchange.com If the F-117s were involved, this would point to this being a sensor test against low radar cross-section aircraft, with Proteus flying the sensor aloft. The EA-18G could test the sensor’s resistance to electronic attack while trying to spot the stealthy targets. Update: Images of F-117s leaving Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) yesterday before flying to Edwards AFB for approaches and eventually landing at NAWS China Lake. Images courtesy of Matt McRae. Check out more of his shots on Instagram @west.coast.aviation . According to Matt: “We were out at TTR, saw one jet takeoff and do a full 180 pointed south, then it did another 180 north and joined with a second jet. Then they joined up flew for a bit then broke off…” After leaving the TTR area they headed west to Edwards AFB.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 9, 2020",When You Get “Killed” In A Chinese Wargame Smoke Pops Out The Top Of Your Helmet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Making training as realistic as possible is an absolute imperative for any major modern military. For obvious reasons, troops can’t actually shoot at each other during force-on-force exercises, so you need some other way to register hits and misses and make it clear for everyone involved. A new Chinese state television segment about the People’s Liberation Army’s massive and curious Zhurihe Training Center, the topic of a recent War Zone feature , shows one solution to this problem: helmets with laser tag-like sensors with small colored smoke canisters on top that go off when you get “killed.” China Central Television’s Channel 7, or CCTV-7, aired the segment on Zhurihe on June 3 and posted a copy on YouTube two days later. It’s not entirely clear what People’s Liberation Army (PLA) units took part in the exercise or exercises shown, but the role of the enemy at the training center is played by a dedicated Opposing Force (OPFOR), or Blue Army, the 195th Mechanized Infantry Brigade, also known as the Wolves of Zhurihe . Various types of combined arms maneuvers are shown involving tanks, armored personnel carriers, and attack helicopters. However, the CCTV-7 segment focuses primarily on small infantry units conducting Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) at Zhurihe’s expansive and highly detailed urban training section. This portion of the base, which you can read about in more detail here , consists of a complete city center with various multi-story buildings. The smoking helmets are on full display as troops maneuver around and assault various structures, making way their way up stairs and down hallways, and taking shots at each other from one building to another. The Blue Army OPFOR units get helmets that emit blue smoke, while the units that have come to Zhurihe to train against the Wolves get ones that spew red. This color-coding for friendly and hostile units is the reverse of what it is for most of the western world, but Communist parties around the world have historically used symbols with red as the primary color and the militaries of Communist countries have often described themselves as “Red Armies,” so it makes perfect sense for the PLA. CCTV capture CCTV capture Each soldier’s rifle is equipped with a laser system that “fires” instead of a real bullet when the trigger is pulled and the guns themselves are loaded with blanks. When sensors on an individual’s helmet or a harness they wear on their torso register a hit, the smoke goes off and that’s it for them. A good look at one of the training system helmets with the smoke canister on top. This one belongs to the OPFOR as denoted by its blue color., CCTV capture The laser component of the system mounted on the forend of a Type 95 assault rifle., CCTV The PLA isn’t the only country to employ a laser-based training system for force-on-force exercises. In the late 1970s, the U.S. Army adopted the first iteration of the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES). The service, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, had adopted improved versions in the decades since then. When it comes to infantry units, MILES works much the same way as the PLA’s system, with lasers attached to rifles and machine guns and troops wearing rigs on their helmets and harnesses on their bodies with sensors to register hits. Unlike the Chinese system, MILES declares individuals to be “dead” with a loud tone. Early versions of MILES presented opportunities for troops to cheat by turning the sensors off and then on again to stop the noise. Later versions of this system, as well as those in use elsewhere around the world, have instituted methods to prevent this, such as forcing the individual to remove a key from the laser on the weapon, disabling it, and then inserting it into a separate box to stop the ringing. Some variants require the wearer to physically lie down on their back to cut off the sound. Some more advanced versions are even networked and will alert commanders and exercise controllers of kills remotely. As long as it accurately registers a hit, the Chinese system offers a different way of making it abundantly clear when an individual gets knocked out, at least initially. It’s not clear if they could wait out the relatively short burn time on the smoke canister and then get back in the fight or if the laser on their weapon gets disable somehow in the process, as well. It’s also a much more visual display than troops would get on an actual battlefield, where it might be unclear if an enemy is actually neutralized, especially during firefights at extended ranges. The CCTV segment also offers some broader views of Zhurihe. Directly adjacent to that urban training area that is the focus of the television program is another section featuring a full-scale cloverleaf highway interchange and an additional cluster of buildings that, provocatively, includes a replica of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, Taiwan, as well as the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. None of these structures appear in the footage, but it does show another particularly odd feature at Zhurihe, a sub-scale recreation of France’s Eiffel Tower.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 6, 2020",MiG-29 Fighter Jet Reportedly Appears Over Key Libyan City That Is Now Under Siege,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are as yet unconfirmed reports that at least one MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter from a tranche of jets that Russia sent to Libya to bolster forces aligned with strongman Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army last month has now flown a mission over the strategic coastal city of Sirte . This comes as the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord is pushing to retake control of that area after weeks of substantial victories fueled by Turkish military assistance, especially deliveries of armed drones . The reported sighting of the MiG-29 over Sirte also follows a Greek Navy frigate’s attempt to board and inspect a Turkish-operated Tanzanian-flagged cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea that is suspected of carrying a new shipment of Turkish weapons or other military equipment bound for Libya in violation of the United Nations arms embargo on that country. Turkish frigates escorting the vessel rejected the request and warned off the Greek warship, which is now reportedly shadowing the flotilla. This all underscores the growing spillover of broader geopolitical competition in the Mediterranean region emanating from the Libyan civil conflict. Images purportedly of the MiG-29 flying over Sirte first emerged on social media on June 10, 2020. They came after a similarly unconfirmed sighting of an Il-76 transport plane landing in the city. The Government of National Accord (GNA), which sits in the country’s internationally recognized capital Tripoli, announced the start of its offensive to take Sirte on June 6. This included airstrikes against elements of Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) in the city. The appearance of the MiG-29 overhead could be an effort to deter further strikes, especially against any aircraft, such as the Il-76, bringing in supplies and reinforcements, which would be particularly vulnerable while unloading on the ground at Sirte’s airport. GNA-aligned forces have been steadily routing the LNA, including contingents of Russian mercenaries with very close, if not direct ties to the Russian government, for weeks now, seizing various important locations in western Libya. The included the re-capture of the city of Tarhuna, which had served as a major node in Haftar’s logistics network, including as part of the supply chain to Al Jufrah Air Base , where one of the Russian-supplied MiG-29s was spotted on May 19. The GNA is now pushing into the broader Al Jufrah district. If forces aligned with the government in Tripoli seize that air base it could force the LNA to shift its air operations further west to less vulnerable locations, such as Al Khadim Air Base, where Su-24 Fencer combat jets that Russia also sent to Libya had been spotted previously . You can read more about the Kremlin’s dispatching of these aircraft to Libya in these recent War Zone pieces . GNA forces have already destroyed a substantial amount of LNA armored and unarmored vehicles, as well as UAE-supplied Russian-made Panstir-S1 point defense air defense systems, as they have pushed east. Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, which Turkey first supplied to the government in Tripoli last year, have made a mockery of the Pantsirs and contributed substantially to the GNA advances. The LNA left behind significant amounts of weapons, ammunition, and other military hardware for the GNA to capture as it retreated, too. This includes Mi-35 Hind gunship attack helicopters and Chinese FN-6 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fF9y-EvEU0 As is clear, the flow of arms and other military equipment to both sides of the conflict has been steady despite the arms embargo. In the past year or so, Turkey has emerged as the primary ally of the government in Tripoli, while Haftar continues to enjoy the support of Russia, the UAE, and Egypt, among others. He has also been more recently linked to the regime of Venezuela’s dictatorial President Nicolas Maduro , who may be working with the rogue general in Libya to circumvent sanctions, especially on the export of Venezuelan gold. International efforts to enforce Libya’s arms embargo have been, at best, mixed. Just today, the Greek Navy’s Hydra class frigate Spetsai had failed in its attempt to board the freighter under escort by Turkish warships in the Mediterranean. After it did not receive a response from that cargo ship, Spetsai had sent out its Sikorsky S-70B-6 Aegean Hawk helicopter, an export variant of the SH-60 Seahawk , to fly over the vessel and attempt to make contact. One of two unnamed Turkish Navy frigates, possibly members of the Gabya class that have been spotted off Libya in recent months, declined the request and told the Greek warship to stay. The Greek Navy’s Hydra class frigate Spetsai. , USN Spetsai is presently operating in the Mediterranean as part of Operation Irini , a European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) that began on Mar. 31, 2020. The Italian Navy has been designated as the lead entity in charge of the entire operation. An Italian naval officer is also presently in charge of day-to-day activities, with plans to rotate that post with the Greek Navy every six months. This effort is primarily focused on enforcing the arms embargo, but with additional authority to help stem illicit oil exports and human trafficking coming out of Libya. “European force vessels cannot intervene on ships accompanied by third-country warships – which makes European business even more difficult,” a piece from CNN Greece reported. Germany, Luxembourg, and Poland have all, at times, contributed land-based maritime patrol aircraft to the effort. France had also previously sent a Cassard class frigate , the Jean Bart , to support the operation. That warship prevented the Gabon-flagged UAE-operated tanker Jal Laxmi from entering Tobruk in eastern Libya, in May. Tobruk is the Haftar’s main hub. All told, the situation in Libya is now much more fluid, after it had looked like the LNA might finally capture Tripoli earlier this year. What’s happening in and around libya also underscores how the North African country has become a central point in a growing multi-faceted geopolitical struggle across the region. Over the weekend, Egypt attempted to broker a major ceasefire deal, which the GNA rejected. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had implied that his country’s military could intervene directly in an attempt to enforce this halt in the fighting. Video footage, some of which is seen below, circulated widely on social media purportedly showing Egyptian heavy armor, including M1 Abrams tanks, and other forces heading to the border between the two countries. Sisi has now distanced himself from the ceasefire plan, which he says Haftar proposed , and any imminent threat of Egyptian forces publicly entering the conflict has subsided. For its part, the government in Tripoli has indicated that it will stop its advances after it re-takes Sirte, which is in an immensely strategic location situated along the central Libyan coast on a major highway that links both sides of the country. Russia and Turkey, who have repeatedly sparred over Syria , as well as worked together when it has been convenient , have now clearly expanded that competition to include Libya, as well. Those two countries attempted to get the GNA and the LNA to agree to a peace plan earlier this year, which Haftar rejected. Barring some sort of power-sharing agreement, which seems extremely unlikely given the rhetoric coming from both sides, any such deal could easily lead to a more formally divided Libya. Beyond that, a deal between the government in Tripoli and Turkey last year precipitated a still-ongoing maritime boundary dispute in the Mediterranean between Libya and Turkey and other countries in the region, including Egypt, Greece, and Italy. Just yesterday, the Greek and Italian Prime Ministers signed their own competing maritime agreement . Its perhaps no surprise then that the Greeks and the Italians are leading the European Union effort to try to stop the flow of arms into the conflict, which, so far, has largely benefitted Turkish ambitions. Turkey, Italy, and Greece are all members of the NATO alliance, but Turkey is not a member of the European Union. The myriad competing interests at play look set to continue making it difficult to bring Libya’s civil war to an end that satisfies all the parties involved. How the ongoing fight for Sirte plays out now could have a significant impact on how the conflict continues to evolve in the coming months.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 7, 2022",Watch Russian Troops Snuff Out An Oil Well Blaze With An Anti-Tank Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Army used a Cold War-era 100mm towed anti-tank gun to help put out an oil well fire in Siberia earlier this week. Troops used the weapon to blast away the wellhead, which had failed, from a safe distance. The Russian Ministry of Defense released a video of the operation, seen below, along with a brief statement , on June 8, 2020. The fire, which was the result of a sudden depressurization of the wellhead, occurred the day before in the remote Ust-Kutsky district of the country’s Irkutsk region. The Russian military says it flew the MT-12 anti-tank gun , as well as gunners from Russia’s Central Military District, also known by the Russia abbreviation TsVO, in from the Samara region, more than 2,000 miles to the West. The troops shot multiple rounds at the well-head from just under 187 yards away, the closest they could get to the raging fire, breaking it off with “a jeweler’s precision,” according to the Russian Ministry of Defense’s statement. “This helped set up the blowout prevention equipment to then seal the well and put out the fire,” that press release added . Though not mentioned specifically in the Russian Ministry of Defense’s statement, firing explosive shells at the wellhead could have also helped in putting out the fire directly by using the blasts to choke off the oxygen fueling it – just like a blowing out a candle, but on a much larger scale. Explosive charges have been used in oil well fire fighting for this exact purpose in the past, including notably in Kuwait after retreating Iraqi troops set oilfields alight during the First Gulf War in 1991. Explosives, including artillery shells and even air-dropped bombs, are sometimes employed to fight forest fires in hard to access areas based on the same principle. In July 2018, a Swedish Air Force JAS 39C Gripen fighter jet notably dropped a 500-pound class GBU-49/B Paveway precision-guided bomb to help smother a forest fire that had spread onto a military firing range. Firefighters couldn’t get at it on the ground due to the risk of unexploded ordnance. Some countries have also employed firefighting vehicles equipped with jet engines to blow out large fires, especially in oil fields. You can read more about these systems, and other curious applications of jet engines on the ground, in this past War Zone piece . It’s also not the first time the Russian military has deployed novel capabilities to help fight large fires, either. The Russian Ministry of Defense sent two unmanned firefighting vehicles to help contain the blaze at an ammunition depot in Siberia after it suffered a massive explosion last year. However, using a towed anti-tank gun for this purpose is something that only a relatively small number of countries, including Russia, could even contemplate. Western militaries almost universally stopped using these weapons decades ago, primarily in favor of guided anti-tank missiles. The MT-12, also known as the Rapira, or Rapier, first entered Soviet military service in the early 1970s. The weapon, which is also still in limited service in a number of other countries across the world, was an upgrade of the earlier T-12, which had Soviet troops first began using in 1961. The updated design featured a new, more capable 100mm gun, as well as a redesigned carriage offering greater mobility and an improved protective shield for the gun crew. Russian troops fire an MT-12 anti-tank gun during a much more typical training exercise., Юрий Кучинский via Wikimedia The Soviets had developed the T-12 series to replace World War II-era anti-tank guns, including the BS-3 100mm type . As with the BS-3, the T-12 and subsequently improved variants are really more multi-purpose field guns capable of firing both specialized armor-piercing fin-stabilized discard-sabot (APFSDS) rounds, which contain a smaller diameter solid metal dart that gets propelled at extremely high speeds to physically punch through enemy armor, as well as regular high-explosive ammunition. The video below shows how a typical APFSDS anti-tank round works. The Soviets made further improvements to the MT-12, including the MT-12R with a small RLPK-1 ground-surveillance radar to help find targets hidden behind smoke, dust, or just bad weather, as well as the MT-12K, which had a laser designator, allowing it to fire beam-riding gun-launched anti-tank missiles. A 9M117M Bastion gun-launched beam-riding anti-tank missile, which the MT-12K anti-tank gun is capable of firing., Vitaly Kuzmin via Wikimedia In the 1980s, the Soviet Union even developed a larger, more capable towed anti-tank gun, the 2A45 Sprut , followed by an improved 2A45M variant. These are both 125mm guns and use the same ammunition as the guns on Russia’s T-72, T-80, and T-90s main battle tanks. As is clearly evidenced by the MT-12’s appearance at the oil well fire in Irkutsk, the Russian Army continues to keep some of those guns available, at least in storage, for potential use. The 2A45s also technically remain in service. While considered obsolete by much of the world, the guns certainly do offer a relatively low-cost way of increasing static defenses against both armored vehicles and softer targets. Flying one of the guns out to Siberia also highlights how they can be brought forward areas to provide additional firepower. The oil well workers in the Ust-Kutsky district were no doubt very pleased that the Russian Army still keeps some of these weapons on hand, even if they never get used for their primary purpose of destroying armored vehicles and engaging other targets on the battlefield.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",Trump Orders Coast Guard To Look Into Building Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers Like Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on Arctic and Antarctic security today that called on the U.S. Coast Guard to explore the possibility of buying nuclear-powered icebreakers, a type of ship that only Russia operates . The same document orders an assessment of what kind of defensive weapons any future icebreakers might carry, specifically to defend against possible threats from “near-peer competitors,” such as Russia or China. The Coast Guard’s tiny existing icebreaking fleets have been in increasingly desperate need of replacement for years now and the service finally awarded a contract for its first new heavy icebreaker, a conventionally-powered design, in decades just over a year ago. Trump issued the new Memorandum on Safeguarding U.S. National Interests in the Arctic and Antarctic Regions on June 9, 2020. Despite its more general name, the document is centered entirely on buying icebreakers and related issues. The memo directs the Department of Homeland Security, by way of the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of Energy, to conduct a study of the “benefits and risks of a polar security icebreaking fleet mix that … are appropriately outfitted to meet the objectives of this memorandum.” This is part of a larger assessment of icebreaking requirements that the Secretary of Homeland Security, with help from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, is now also instructed to conduct. The study that the Coast Guard will now conduct will include an assessment of “expanded operational capabilities, with estimated associated costs, for both heavy and medium PSCs [Polar Security Cutters] not yet contracted for,” according to the memo. “This assessment shall also evaluate defensive armament adequate to defend against threats by near-peer competitors and the potential for nuclear-powered propulsion.” This requirement to explore nuclear-powered icebreakers, almost certainly the reason why the Secretary of Energy will be involved in the study, is unprecedented. Neither the Coast Guard nor the U.S. Navy has ever operated a nuclear-powered icebreaker of any kind. In fact, the only country to do so to date is Russia, which operates four such ships, including the massive 21,000 ton-displacement Taymyr , and is looking to build at least five more , on top of dozens of other conventionally-powered icebreakers and other ice-capable ships . China is now in the process of building its own nuclear-powered heavy icebreaker , as well. Nuclear-powered ships, of course, have the benefit of not needing regular refueling as is the case with conventionally-powered vessels. A ship with nuclear propulsion could effectively operate for long stretches of time with at-sea replenishment of other supplies and onboard freshwater generation capabilities. This could enable more persistent patrolling of Arctic and Antarctic areas, which, in turn, could be valuable for maintaining an American presence in those regions. The Arctic , in particular, has emerged as a major area of geopolitical competition as the polar ice cap continues to recede amid global climate change, allowing for new trade routes and the increased exploitation of underwater resources. A chart showing major icebreakers and other large ice-capable ships in service around the world as of 2017., USCG At the same time, nuclear propulsion is costly and complex, and employing it on icebreakers could raise concerns about potential operational and environmental risks for ships that will be primarily operating in regions well known for experiencing extreme weather. Environmental activists have long expressed these concerns with regard to Russia’s nuclear icebreaking fleets, as well as its new floating nuclear powerplants . Taymyr alone has suffered a number of radiation leaks over the years. https://youtube.com/watch?v=kc1cN0OePkQ There is also the possibility that future nuclear-powered Coast Guard icebreakers could find themselves in aggressive confrontations with Russian or other countries’ ships, especially in the Arctic region. This is what is certainly driving the demand to explore potential defensive armament for America’s next icebreakers. Trump’s memorandum doesn’t mention any specific armament options for the Coast Guard to consider, but its own requirements for its latest heavy icebreaker have included keeping space available for the possible inclusion of weapons of some kind in the future. In 2017, Admiral Paul Zukunft, then-Commandant of the Coast Guard, also told members of Congress that his service was looking at adding both defensive and offensive armament, including anti-ship cruise missiles, onto future icebreakers. An artist’s conception of the Coast Guards new future heavy icebreaker., VT Halter Marine via USNI News While talk of Coast Guard cutters of any kind, icebreaking or not, armed with anti-ship missiles might seem unusual, the service did upgrade at least three Hamilton class cutters in the 1980s to be able to fire RGM-84 Harpoons . By the mid-1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, these ships had lost this capability, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . The entire class, of which two remain in U.S. service, also received additional defenses in the form of 20mm Mk 15 Phalanx Close-in Weapon Systems (CIWS) and Mk 38 25mm automatic cannon mounts. The first-in-class USCGC Hamilton seen when she had the two four-round Harpoon missile launchers installed on her bow., Public Domain Much of the rest of Trump’s memorandum covers things the Coast Guard already appears to be doing or has done. The required assessments will examine fleet mixes to include at least three heavy icebreakers. The service has long said that it wants to acquire three medium icebreakers after it gets its trio of heavy types. The difference between the two categories is the thickness of ice they can plow through, with heavy designs being able to get through ice up to 10 feet thick, while the fulls of medium types can manage up to eight feet of ice. “Use cases in the Arctic that span the full range of national and economic security missions (including the facilitation of resource exploration and exploitation and undersea cable laying and maintenance) that may be executed by a class of medium PSCs [Polar Security Cutters], as well as analysis of how these use cases differ with respect to the anticipated use of heavy PSCs for these same activities,” the memo notes. “These use cases shall identify the optimal number and type of polar security icebreakers for ensuring a persistent presence in both the Arctic and, as appropriate, the Antarctic regions.” The Coast Guard, at present, only has one operational heavy icebreaker, the USCGC Polar Star , which is aging and prone to major breakdowns , and one newer medium one, the USCGC Healy , that is still decades-old now. The USCGC Polar Star ., USCG “Based on the determined fleet size and composition, an identification and assessment of at least two optimal United States basing locations and at least two international basing locations,” the memo adds. “The basing location assessment shall include the costs, benefits, risks, and challenges related to infrastructure, crewing, and logistics and maintenance support for PSCs at these locations. In addition, this assessment shall account for potential burden-sharing opportunities for basing with the Department of Defense and allies and partners, as appropriate.” The Coast Guard’s plan, as it stands now , is to hopefully have taken delivery of all three conventionally-powered heavy icebreakers by 2026. Polar Star could also undergo a service life extension upgrade to keep it in service through at least 2025. There is no firm schedule yet for acquiring the additional medium icebreakers. Trump’s memo says there needs to be “a ready, capable, and available fleet of polar security icebreakers that is operationally tested and fully deployable by Fiscal Year 2029,” by which time Polar Star and Healy are both expected to be retired. Trump’s memorandum requires the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard to submit their respective reports to the President, by way of the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, within the next 60 days. So, it may not be long before we learn whether America’s icebreaker plans have changed to include the purchase of its first-ever nuclear-powered types.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 29, 2020",Taiwanese Fighters Drive Off Chinese Jets After Navy Transport Plane Flies Over The Island,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwanese fighter jets reportedly “drove off” Chinese Su-30 Flankers after the latter briefly entered the island’s air defense identification zone earlier today. That incident came after a U.S. Navy C-40A Clipper passenger transport aircraft flew an extremely unusual route over Taiwan’s western coast, a flight that was almost sure to draw some form of rebuke from authorities in Beijing, who consider the island part the country’s sovereign territory. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense announced that the aerial altercation had occurred to the southwest of the island on June 9, 2020. The Ministry’s statement said that unspecified Taiwanese Air Force fighter jets had intercepted the Chinese Flankers and issued verbal warnings for them to leave the area before more forcefully driving them out of the area. Following an increase in Chinese military flights around the island in recent years, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen, who won a second term in a landslide in January, has previously said that Taiwanese jets would conduct a “ forceful expulsion ” of any Chinese combat aircraft that crossed the so-called “Median Line” in the Taiwan Strait. The Median Line is the de facto boundary between the island and the People’s Republic of China on the mainland, the latter of which sees Taiwan as an integral part of its national territory. Taiwanese Air Force F-16A/B fighter jets. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense did not say what fighters it sent to intercept the Chinese Su-30s on June 9., ROCAF The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has been conducting major exercises in the South China Sea to the southeast of Taiwan, including with its new aircraft carrier, the Shandong , which many experts and observers have taken to be a signal aimed at Taiwanese authorities. Beijing routinely threatens to use military force if the government in Taipei moves to formally declare independence. Notably, the PLA’s largest land training facility at Zhurihe, which you can read about in this recent War Zone feature , has a highly accurate mockup of Taiwan’s President Office Building, as well as one representing the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs building and other full-scale urban structures. The rhetoric between Beijing and Taipei had ratcheted up substantially after Tsai’s election victory and has grown even more heated following her inauguration, in which she said that the island would move to further distance itself politically from the mainland. In addition to widespread domestic support for her government, the Taiwanese President has also enjoyed a particularly strong and close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Taipei has secured unprecedented arms deals in the past year or so, including getting approval to purchase new, advanced Block 70 variants of the F-16C/D Viper fighter jet, something that the government in Beijing has said would be a “red line” issue in the past. The United States technically recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate government in China, but has reserved the right to continue to engage with Taiwan and help provide for its defense until its final status is officially resolved. As such, as friction between Beijing and Taipei has increased, the U.S. military has stepped up so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrols (FONOP) through the Taiwan straight, sending both ships and planes through the area as a demonstration of the United States’ ongoing commitment to Taiwan. The C-40A flight, which took place on June 9 before the incident between Taiwanese and Chinese fighter jets, appears to be another example of that. However, while the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait, and the airspace above it, is technically a neutral international space, the Clipper’s route took it through actual Taiwanese airspace, where U.S. military aircraft generally don’t venture. A US Navy C-40A like the one that flew over Taiwan on June 9., USN Plane spotters using online flight tracking software first noticed the C-40A appearing to leave Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa and then head southwest toward Taiwan. The aircraft, which has the Bureau Number serial number 169036 and is assigned to the Navy Reserve’s Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 61 (VR-61), based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington State, then passed near Taipei on Taiwan’s northern tip before heading south along the coast. Flight tracking data shows the aircraft then continued south into the South China Sea and then eventually made its way to U-Tapao Airport in Thailand. After leaving there, it appeared to fly toward the strategic island of Guam in the South Pacific. A full look at the recorded flight tracking data regarding the Navy C-40A’s flight on June 9., ADS-B Exchange The flight over Taiwan proper is a much more pointed demonstration of the de facto independence of the island and its ability to set its own rules about the use of its airspace that more traditional FONOPS. The Taiwan Times newspaper reported that Shih Shun Wen, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense, said in a statement that “the nation’s military has full control over the airspace over Taiwan and that the current situation is normal,” but declined to confirm or deny the C-40A had flown over the western coast. Taiwan’s China Times newspaper also reported that the Clipper had made an emergency landing at Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in the city of Taichung, but there is no evidence that this was the case. It’s worth noting that the C-40A’s flight comes after weeks of other unprecedented aerial activity in the Pacific region. This has included a number of long-range sorties by U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers, many of which are clearly meant to send a message to China , as well. The chill in relations between authorities in Taipei and their counterparts in Beijing does not look set to end any time soon. Relations between the two parties had already seen additional strains this year over the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Chinese government’s efforts to force Taiwanese authorities out of international response efforts , as well as the months-long crackdown on protests in Hong Kong over the mainland’s efforts to curtail that semi-autonomous region’s unique freedoms. Tsai Ing Wen’s government says it will look for ways to help Hong Kongers in response to the Chinese Communist Party proceeding with implementing a new draconian National Security Law covering the latter region. With the parties on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as the United States, digging in their heels, at least rhetorically, it seems more likely than not that we will continue to see more assertive signaling, including aggressive aerial encounters and FONOPS, in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you follow aerospace enthusiasts and pilots on social media, especially Instagram, you see a lot of takeoffs and landings from short and austere airstrips, some of which are seemingly located at the ends of the world. Long before social media was a thing, I had a fascination with this unique flavor of aviation and for good reason. Extreme bush flying certainly has a certain romance and air of adventure to it, and it definitely isn’t short on risk. In an age of viral content, at a certain point, you feel like you have seen it all—until you realize you haven’t. Case in point, the video below of a Cessna—likely a 206 Stationair—landing in what appears to be nothing more than a tree line break and a trail in a dense jungle wilderness. I really don’t have any background for this clip. If you read the comments, many are wondering if this was some sort of drug-running operation . I have no idea if that is the case, but the reality is light planes land in some very rough terrain every day, providing what is often a single point lifeline to far-flung communities, many of which are of indigenous peoples. In most of those cases, the airstrips are at least a bit better cleared than this, although they can have their own extreme challenges where there is little room for error or contingencies. Still, this is an extreme example of that by any measure. Maybe we will find out more about this video. As usual, we ask our readers to let us know if it looks familiar or if they have any additional information on it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 23, 2020",Air Force Reveals B-1Bs Were Practicing Decapitating Russia’s Black Sea Fleet Last Week,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that the B-1B Bones that flew to and from the Black Sea region last week practiced procedures for employing the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, during that training mission. The service has focused heavily on the future employment of these bombers against maritime threats as they enter the twilight of their career, but with a heavy emphasis on operations during a potential crisis in the Pacific . This flight shows that there is interest in how those capabilities might support contingencies in Europe, and in the Black Sea where they could present a particularly serious challenge to the Russian Navy, and the Kremlin is taking notice. The two B-1Bs from the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota flew the long-range Bomber Task Force Mission on May 29, 2020, and worked with a variety of aircraft from NATO allies and other European partners, which you can read more in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on this training flight. This included flying with Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets and taking on fuel from a Turkish KC-135R tanker, a first for the Air Force’s Bone fleet in both cases. U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) revealed the anti-ship component of the mission on June 1, 2020, though it’s not clear if either of the aircraft were actually carrying any LRASMs. B-1B bombers have been flying similar training missions on a routine, if irregular basis in the Pacific and Europe since the Air Force abruptly ended its Continuous Bomber Presence mission at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam in April 2020, which The War Zone was first to report . This brought an end to some 16 years of regular, six-month-long deployments of B-1Bs, as well as B-52s, to Andersen. In its place, the Air Force has adopted a policy of Dynamic Force Employment , a concept gaining traction throughout the U.S. military , which involves unannounced, shorter-duration deployments that are intended to keep potential adversaries on edge and add greater uncertainty and risk into their operational planning processes. America’s strategic bomber fleets already offer immense flexibility and are set to gain the ability to employ a wide array of new weapons in the coming years, including hypersonic missiles, that will further expand their stand-off strike capabilities. The B-1Bs have been getting a particular amount of attention in this regard, with plans to explore possibly expanding the total number of weapons they can carry by using external pylons, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece .  At the same time, there has also been a revival of interest in recent years in employing bombers, and Bones armed with LRASMs especially, to support maritime operations. The two B-1B bombers involved in the May 29, 2020, Bomber Task Force Mission fly over the Black Sea region flanked by a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker, in the foreground, and a MiG-29 Fulcrum, in the background., Ukrainian Ministry of Defense “LRASM plays a critical role in ensuring U.S. naval access to operate in both open-ocean and littoral environments due to its enhanced ability to discriminate between targets from long-range,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Albrecht, a member of USAFE’s 603rd Air Operations Center and the Bomber Task Force mission planner, said with regards to the May 29 flight to the Black Sea. “With the increase of maritime threats and their improvement of anti-access/area-denial environmental weapons, this stealthy anti-ship cruise missile provides reduced risk to strike assets by penetrating and defeating sophisticated enemy air-defense systems.” The B-1Bs have been certified to carry AGM-158Cs in their internal bays since December 2018. The LRASM is derived from the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family of air-launched land-attack cruise missiles, which these bombers can also employ. Just last month, the Air Force released pictures of personnel on Guam loading live JASSMs onto a B-1B during a short-duration deployment of the bombers to that strategic U.S. territory in a clear signal to America’s opponents in the region, primarily China. The Air Force’s announcement regarding the anti-ship dimension to the Bomber Task Force flight is similar messaging clearly meant for Russia and its Black Sea Fleet. The Black Sea would likely turn into anti-ship missile shooting gallery all around during a major conflict, but Russia’s Navy has certain advantages to start with. The only way in and out of the body of water is via the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, straits that Turkey controls. Under the Montreux Convention , countries that do not have a Black Sea border cannot keep vessels there for more than 21 days at a time or even sail warships above a certain total tonnage in or out at all. In addition, sending the B-1Bs to the Black Sea region at all, and having them train with Ukrainian aircraft, was an obvious signal to begin with. In 2014, the Kremlin illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula , which juts out into the Black Sea, and the naval base there, and subsequently began actively supporting separatists in that country’s eastern Donbass region . The Russian military has steadily increased its military presence in Crimea , including the deployment of combat aircraft, long-range surface-to-air missile systems, and anti-ship missile batteries. Russian Flanker fighter jets based in the region flew out to intercept the Bones during their May 29 mission. Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of Russia’s General Staff Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi gives a briefing on June 1 in front a map showing the route of the May 29 B-1B Bomber Task Force mission, as well as the general location of Russian long-range surface-to-air missile batteries on the Crimean Peninsula, as well as in areas of Russia nearby., Russian Ministry of Defense With all this in mind, shore-based anti-ship defenses in allied and partner states in the region, such as NATO allies Romania – which also sent aircraft to take part in the May 29 Bomber Task Force mission – and Bulgaria, as well as air-launched anti-ship weapons could be especially critical in any maritime engagement. A single B-1B can carry 24 JASSMs and is likely able to carry a similar load of LRASMs. There are only a little over 50 surface ships and a half dozen submarines assigned to the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet. A relatively small flight of Bones could realistically try to engage all of them with multiple missiles in a relatively short period of time. A Romanian F-16C Viper flies with the two B-1B bombers in the Black Sea region on May 29., USAF The ability of B-1Bs to fly in from bases far outside the region to launch stand-off anti-ship attacks from outside the range of Russia’s extremely dense integrated air defense bubble in the Black Sea area could be very valuable. Being able to fly from the United States proper to carry out these operations would also avoid the need to use bases in Europe that could be vulnerable to strikes themselves . The LRASM itself is designed to navigate autonomously around the threats, including at times when its GPS-assisted guidance system and two-way data links might be jammed, and otherwise use its stealthy features to dodge enemy defenses. It also uses an imaging infrared seeker in the terminal stage of flight, which is also not susceptible to electronic warfare jamming. You can read more about this missile and its advanced features here . It’s not surprising, given all this, that Russia has taken notice of the increasing number of American bomber sorties. In a briefing on June 1, the Russian Ministry of Defense decried the U.S. aerial activity, as well as other NATO exercises, as provocative , focusing heavily on an air-and-sea exercise the Alliance held on the Barents Sea in early May. “For the first time since the end of the Cold War on the eve of celebrating the 75th anniversary of Victory over Nazi Germany a task force of warships of the NATO joint naval forces held drills in the Barents Sea,” Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of Russia’s General Staff Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi said. “During the exercises, they practiced the tasks of striking targets in Russian territory and intercepting Russian ballistic missiles,” he continued. “We view these steps as a provocation although the US side had notified us about the entry of these ships in the Barents Sea on short notice.” Colonel General Rudskoi talks about the NATO exercise in the Barents Sea in May in front of a map showing the activities of various ships and aircraft from the Alliance, as well as Russia, during those drills., Russian Ministry of Defense Rudskoi also brought up the May 29 B-1B flight to the Black Sea, as well as other Bomber Task Force missions in international airspace around Russia’s borders in Europe and the Pacific in recent months. This includes an unprecedented flight on May 21 by one of the bombers into the Sea Of Okhotsk, which is surrounded on three sides by Russian territory and where U.S. military aircraft generally don’t venture. The War Zone was first to report on that sortie. The Air Force has already been projecting combat airpower in the Pacific Region via the B-1Bs and their Bomber Task Force missions in a way not seen in decades, if ever before. The service is now clearly expanding the scale and scope of similar activities, pointed aimed at Russia, across Europe.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 9, 2020",More Than Half Of Finland’s F-18 Hornets Take Part In An “Elephant Walk” Readiness Drill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. So-called ‘ elephant walks ,’ air readiness exercises that involve large numbers of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft that are meant to demonstrate the ability to rapidly get significant numbers of planes and helicopters into the air during a major contingency, have become increasingly common within the U.S. military in recent years . It’s far rarer to see similar displays from other air forces around the world, many of which are simply exponentially smaller than their American counterparts. So it’s interesting to see the Finnish Air Force conduct one of these drills with more than half of its F-18C/D Hornet fleet. The Finnish Air Force, or Ilmavoimat , announced that the exercise had taken place on June 4, 2020, and said it had involved a total of 32 Hornets. Pictures the service released only show 16 of the fighter jets together at Kuopio Air Base, which shares its runway with Kuopio Airport, in the central part of the country. Kuopio is home to Fighter Squadron 31, one of two Finnish squadrons that fly Hornets, so it is possible that Fighter Squadron 11, based at Rovaniemi Air Base further to the north, also launched additional 16 aircraft as part of the exercise. Ilmavoimat Ilmavoimat Ilmavoimat Ilmavoimat “A total of 32 F/A-18 Hornet multi-purpose fighters demonstrated the Air Force’s readiness to defend the whole of Finland in honor of the Defense Forces’ flag day,” the Finnish Air Force explained in social media posts on Twitter and Facebook. “The Hornets, which flew in eight flocks of four planes, crossed several locations from Helsinki to Ivalo.” Yhteensä 32 F/A-18 Hornet -monitoimihävittäjää osoitti Puolustusvoimain lippujuhlan päivän kunniaksi Ilmavoimien valmiutta puolustaa koko Suomea. Kahdeksassa neljän koneen parvessa lentäneet Hornetit ylittivät useita paikkakuntia Helsingistä Ivaloon. #ilmavoimat #valmius pic.twitter.com/RxxsyPBsUn — Ilmavoimat (@FinnishAirForce) June 4, 2020 The Ilmavoimat has 54 single-seat F-18Cs and another seven twin-seat F-18Ds, in total, which it first began acquiring in the mid-1990s. Finland bought the aircraft primarily for air defense missions, so Boeing did not refer to them by the “fighter-attack” or “F/A” nomenclature that it has applied to other Hornets, including those the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps operate. The Finnish Air Force has since upgraded its jets to have a full ground-attack capability. Though smaller than many U.S. military elephant walks, this Finnish exercise was still a significant display of the country’s combat airpower. Finland, which is not a member of the NATO alliance, occupies an immensely strategic position between Russia and the rest of Scandinavia to the West and the Baltic Sea region to the south. Finland regularly scrambles its Hornets to intercept Russian aircraft near its land and sea borders and has accused them of violating its sovereign airspace on multiple occasions in recent years . Finnish authorities have also had to deal GPS jamming emanating from Russia , ostensibly linked to major exercises, as well other provocative Russian drills . Though not a member of the Warsaw Pact and officially neutral, Finland was still tied in many ways to the Soviet Union during the Cold War through the 1948 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, despite its long, tense, and often outright acrimonious relationship with Moscow. The country has grown ever closer to NATO and West since the 1990s. There has even been talk about it joining the alliance in the future, which has, in turn, drawn sharp criticism and threats from officials in Russia. In 2018, there was also a moment of James Bond-esque intrigue after Finnish security forces raided the private island of a shady Russian businessman, officially as part an investigation into various financial crimes, but which led many to wonder about whether there were potential connections to Russia’s intelligence services. You can read more about that incident in this past War Zone piece . Given its proximity to Russia, in any major conflict between the two countries, it would be important for the Ilmavoimat to get as many aircraft in the air as rapidly as possible to shield them from stand-off attacks on Kuopio and Rovaniemi, which would certainly be prime targets. With those same concerns in mind, the Ilmavoimat routinely trains to use highways as runways, should their established bases get destroyed or otherwise become unavailable . Beyond air defense, the Hornets would be Finland’s most capable stand-off strike asset. The jets are capable of launching AGM-154 Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bombs and AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) cruise missiles, both of which have stealthy features and would be essential for penetrating Russia’s dense integrated air defenses in order to engage targets, as well as neutralizing those defenses themselves. This exercise also comes as Finland is working steadily toward acquiring a fleet of 64 new fighter jets to replace these Hornets, which are aging and becoming more difficult to operate and maintain. In addition, despite the substantial upgrades they’ve received over the years, simply do not reflect the most modern capabilities available on the open market. The Finnish Air Force issued a formal request for proposals as part of its fighter jet replacement program, also known simply as HX, in 2018. American firms Boeing and Lockheed Martin have offered their F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , respectively. French firm Dassault has pitched its Rafale , while the European consortium behind the Eurofighter Typhoon has proposed that aircraft. Sweden’s Saab is also in the running with its Gripen E . In February, Finland began conducting in-country evaluations of these aircraft and it hopes to make a final selection in 2021. Until any replacement jets arrive, however, the F-18C/Ds will continue to form the backbone of Finland’s combat airpower and the elephant walk underscored the Finnish Air Force’s ability to rapidly get a large number of these jets into action to defend the country when called upon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 16, 2020",Air Force Is Looking Beyond Traditional Orbits To Get An Upper Hand In Space,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force is running an internal competition to pick a new project to explore potential military activities in new areas of space. In the running are proposed efforts to examine the potential uses of very low orbits around the Earth, as well as operations in cislunar space between the Earth and the Moon where there are growing concerns about future competition with potential adversaries, especially China . Air Force Colonel Eric Felt, head of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate, revealed the contest during an online event that Space News hosted on June 5, 2020. Felt said that four separate teams within his directorate had crafted possible projects and that he could pick a winner in July. The winning pitch will get funding in order to carry out a demonstration. “The best payoff is coming from things that we’re not currently doing in space today,” Felt said. He did not offer specific details about what the four teams are working on, but said that at least one of them dealt with concepts of operation closer to Earth than where the U.S. military is currently active while another was looking beyond traditional orbits around the planet. NASA Very low earth orbits, or vLEO, defined as been between around 124 and 186 miles above the Earth’s surface, has been associated often with limited experimental spaceflight, though it was also where early reconnaissance satellites operated . Satellites and other craft operating at these altitudes are more susceptible to the planet’s gravitational pull and require some kind of constant propulsion to prevent them from falling back down. The weight and bulk of the propulsion systems required for sustained operation in vLEO have made the entire proposition impractical in the past. “Now, we’ve got better technology for in-space propulsion,” Felt said. The head of AFRL’s Space Vehicles Directorate did not offer any specific examples, but the Air Force has used its shadowy X-37B mini-space shuttle to test a Rocketdyne’s XR-5A Hall-effect thruster , a high-efficiency electric propulsion system, in the past. Observers on the ground have noted that the X-37B has demonstrated a significant degree of maneuverability in space, something that senior Air Force officials have further alluded to in the past , as well. The X-37B recently launched on its latest mission, in Low Earth Orbit, where it has been conducting tests of a potentially game-changing microwave power beaming system, among other tasks, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The Air Force’s X-37B mini-space shuttle., USAF Being able to operate regularly in vLEO “opens up this new orbital regime for potential use,” Felt continued. This could be important as traditional LEO and other orbital areas around the Earth become increasingly packed with both military and commercial satellites from around the world, as well as potentially hazardous “space junk,” such as failed or otherwise inoperable satellites and other debris. A computer-generated image of satellites and other significant objects that NASA is tracking in orbit around the Earth., NASA Launching satellites and other spacecraft into vLEO would also require less effort than putting them into higher orbits. This, in turn, could make it an attractive area for rapidly putting new or replacement capabilities into space, including via air-launched, two-stage-to-space launch systems, something you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The U.S. military, among others , has been actively exploring various options for quickly launching satellites as potential adversaries, such as Russia and China, continue to develop and field new and improved anti-satellite capabilities, including ground-based and air-launched anti-satellite interceptors and potential “ killer satellites .” American forces rely heavily on space-based assets for a wide array of tasks, including early warning , intelligence-gathering , navigation and weapons guidance , and communications and data sharing . The disruption or loss of satellites performing those tasks could put them at a distinct disadvantage in a major conflict. Concerns about competition and potential conflict in space are increasingly not limited to traditional orbits around the Earth, either. This brings up the proposal Colonel Felt described that deals with activities in cislunar space, situated outside of Geostationary Orbit, or GEO, which is defined as around 22,236 miles above Earth’s equator. A diagram showing the location of the Geostationary Orbit compared to other, lower orbits., Cmglee via Wikimedia “We in AFRL are working on technologies to expand space domain awareness above the GEO belt – so from the GEO belt all the way to the Moon and even a little bit beyond,” Felt explained. “It’s what we call the xGEO, or the cislunar, area of operations. And as commercial people move there, and our adversaries move there, that becomes an area where we need to know what’s going on up there.” Though not named, the primary potential adversary in cislunar space that Felt was likely referring to is China. The Chinese national space program has a heavy emphasis on expanding missions around the Moon, which includes plans for a manned mission there in the 2030s. In January 2019, China’s Chang’e 4 spacecraft became the first ever to touch down on the far side of the moon. These activities have raised concerns within the U.S. military about whether the Chinese might be able to launch attacks from the Moon or cislunar space in the future. While experts have questioned whether doing so would be practical or feasible, at least at present, the Air Force, especially, has nevertheless begun to focus on the matter of potential competition in these spaces, especially as American military and civilian space programs also turn to areas further away from Earth. “As the space beyond geosynchronous orbit becomes more crowded and competitive, it is important for the Air Force to extend its space domain awareness responsibilities to include this new regime,” a December 2019 contracting notice from AFWERX, a technology incubator the service established in 2017, noted. “The Air Force is seeking commercial innovation in support of space domain awareness for future cislunar operations.” Breaking Defense also pointed out that AFRL’s Space Vehicles Directorate, especially with regards to this new internal contest, could be facing a different kind of competition, with the new Space Force, which might seek to take over the winning project. The Directorate’s future, as a whole, is uncertain, with Secretary of the Air Force Barabara Barrett, explaining in March that it would likely be subject to a convoluted arrangement by which its personnel would technically be reassigned to Space Force, which would then put them back under the direct oversight of AFRL. Space Force, while a separate branch, is also formally within the Department of the Air Force and Secretary Barrett is the top civilian authority for both services. Other turf wars have already been emerging with regards to project that cross space and terrestrial domains. This includes a project known as XVI , another AFRL-led effort that is exploring using satellites equipped with Link 16 data links in LEO to expand the range and capabilities of that widely used waveform, which relies primarily on a line-of-sight concept of operations. A diagram depicting the components of an expanded, satellite-enabled Link 16 network., Viasat “There are some 30,000 Link 16 radios out there,” Colonel Felt said during the online event. “You would basically have a Link 16 capability everywhere, all the time, all over the world, and that is [a] pretty powerful enabler to our warfighters.” The Air Force has also been exploring the use of constellations of smaller satellites , including commercial options such as SpaceX’s Starlink , as a general means to expand and distribute space-based communications and other capabilities. These concepts notably offer potential additional protection against enemy attacks, since an opponent would have to destroy a far larger number of total satellites to disrupt or destroy the network in question. These are the kind of projects that the Air Force is presently fighting to retain control over rather than ceding them to Space Force. A Pentagon infographic depicting how it might employ constellations of small satellites for different functions. The ability to conduct sustained operations in vLEO or outside GEO could provide space for additional layers of capability., DOD It will be very interesting to see what project Colonel Felt eventually deems to be the winner of the internal contest. Whatever the case, its clear indicator that competition between the United States and other countries in space, as well as between the Air Force and Space Force over who gets to oversee new projects focused on those areas, is ramping up.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force C-130H Hercules cargo plane overshot the runway at Camp Taji in Iraq, hit a wall, and burst into flames earlier this evening. Four servicemembers suffered non-life threatening injuries and are now receiving treatment at the Iraqi base. The U.S. military says that there is no indication that hostile activity was responsible for the mishap in any way. The C-130H, which is assigned to the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, crashed at Taji, which is situated approximately 17 miles north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, at around 10:10 PM local time. Iraqi officials told The Associated Press that there were seven crew members and 26 passengers on the aircraft, in total, but the U.S. military has not yet confirmed this. The incident is already under investigation. “The airfield crash, fire and rescue team were on the scene within 4 minutes, extinguished the fire, and assisted an evacuation of the plane,” U.S. Army Colonel Myles Caggins, the top spokesperson for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, said in a statement. “The quick actions of the airfield crash, fire and rescue team helped patients, and limited damage to equipment and infrastructure.” While an enemy attack is not suspected in this case, Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have fired rockets at Taji on a number of occasions in the past. One such attack on March 11, 2020, killed U.S. Army Specialist Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias, Air Force Staff Sergeant Marshal Roberts, as well as Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon, a British Army medic. The U.S. military subsequently launched airstrikes on five different sites linked to the militia Kata’ib Hizbollah. The Air Force had another mishap, as well, today with one of its F-35As. That aircraft’s gear collapsed after landing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. We will update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 30, 2020",Pentagon Has Tested A Suicide Drone That Gets To Its Target Area At Hypersonic Speed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon tested a loitering munition, more commonly referred to as a suicide drone , last year that will arrive over its designated target area at hypersonic speeds. It has since turned the project over to the U.S. Army for further development. Additional details about the program, dubbed Vintage Racer, have now emerged in an official picture showing Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy discussing it, as well as other advanced weapon systems. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and a good friend of The War Zone , first reported on the new details about Vintage Racer after spotting the picture of McCarthy at Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) top annual conference and exhibition in Washington, D.C. last year. The picture was taken on Oct. 14, 2019. The program itself dates back to at least the 2017 Fiscal Year, according to Pentagon budget documents, with the Office of the Secretary of Defense receiving $2.5 million in the 2017 Fiscal Year and another $1.2 million in the 2018 Fiscal Year for the project. “Vintage Racer matured an advanced capability to prosecute targets of interest,” a brief note about the project in the Pentagon’s 2021 Budget Request says about the program. “The project successfully validated aerodynamic design with wind tunnel testing and integrated a guidance subsystem for targeted kinetic effects before culminating in a FY 2019 flight test. Documentation and prototype technologies transitioned to the U.S. Army for additional development and follow-on acquisition activities.” The section of the Pentagon’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request mentioning Vintage Racer., DOD Other budget documents say that there were originally plans for a flight demonstration in the 2018 Fiscal Year. This schedule appears to have gotten pushed back a year for unknown reasons. In addition, the 2019 Fiscal Year ended on Sept. 30, 2019, meaning that it is possible that the Army may have taken ownership of the project by the time McCarthy got the information about it at the AUSA event in Washington. The entry on Vintage Racer from the Pentagon’s 2020 budget request. Seen listed is the funding, in millions of dollars, that the program received in the 2018 Fiscal Year., DOD The entry on Vintage Racer from the Pentagon’s 2019 budget request. Seen listed is the funding, in millions of dollars, that the program received in the 2017 Fiscal Year., DOD The picture of the Army Secretary at that event shows him standing in front of a small table talking with other individuals with a print out of a Vintage Racer briefing slide in front of him. A small model of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, which the service is developing as the warhead for its ground-launched Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) together with the U.S. Navy, as well as a kinetic projectile similar to those fired from electromagnetic railguns, such as the one the Army has been experimenting with in recent years, are also seen. A number of metal objects with holes burned in them, including what appears to be a section of a barrel from a 155mm howitzer, possibly from a laser directed energy weapon , are also present. Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy at the 2019 Association of the US Army conference and exhibition on Oct. 14, 2019. His right hand is rest on a printout of a Vintage Racer briefing slide., US Army A close up of the briefing slide., US Army Trimble highlighted that the Vintage Racer briefing slide also has “Loitering Weapon System (LWS) Overview” in its title, as well as six large bullet points – Hypersonic Ingress, Survivable, Time Over Target, Multi-role, Modular payload, and Cost Imposition Strategy – each with a number of sub-bullet points. Aviation Week was later able to enhance the image to be able to read all of these additional highlights. “Hypersonic Ingress” indicates the Vintage Racer loitering munition has the ability to get its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as above Mach 5. It’s not clear how the munition gets to the target area at these speeds, but a ballistic missile seems most plausible based on the information publicly available now. An air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile could be another option, but this seems less likely given the high cost and complexity associated with those types of weapons and their current developmental state. It’s also not clear from the Pentagon budget documents if the Office of the Secretary of Defense conducted a full flight test of the complete system or just the loitering munition component. Advanced maneuvering hypersonic weapons are, by their nature , highly survivable based on their sheer speed, as well as their generally level atmospheric flight trajectories and their high degrees of maneuverability. This allows them to penetrate past dense integrated air defenses. This all makes them ideal for time-sensitive strikes, as well as engaging otherwise critical targets in denied areas, since opponents have little time to relocate or otherwise take cover or even attempt to shoot down the incoming weapon, which is a difficult prospect, in general. Meanwhile, ballistic missiles can still travel at hypersonic speeds and can be difficult to defend against, but are less survivable in most cases than their more advanced hypersonic counterparts. The briefing slide Secretary McCarthy saw last October also indicated that the Vintage Racer munition would have a stealthy radar cross-section and an overall “low signature,” which could also refer to other features to reduce its infrared , visual, and acoustic signatures , making it even harder to detect. In either case, adding a loitering capability to the mix, extending the munition’s “time over target” to between 60 and 90 minutes according to the briefing slide from the 2019 AUSA conference, could provide additional benefits. The launching unit would not necessarily need to know the exact location of the target before firing the weapon, which could then use its own multi-mode guidance system to seek it out and destroy it. With a two-way satellite data-link, it is possible that an individual safely back at the launch site or in a separate command center could use a man-in-the-loop control system to actually guide it into the desired target, as well. This kind of capability, which Israel has pioneered , would offer additional accuracy, especially against moving targets, as well as offering the ability to shift focus rapidly if another, higher priority threat emerges. It can also help in avoiding collateral damage, by allowing the controller to abort the strike, even when the weapon is very close to impact, should innocent bystanders enter the area. The video below shows the man-in-the-loop capabilities of the Israel Aerospace Industries Green Dragon, a tactical loitering munition. These kinds of loitering munitions could be employed as area denial weapons, as well. Deploying them over certain areas, such as likely deployment sites for road-mobile ballistic or long-range cruise missiles , could frustrate an opponent’s attempt to employ those assets, as well as their efforts to distribute them to multiple locations to help protect them from detection and strikes by other means. It would be similarly possible to seed them in critical areas in advance of incoming friendly aircraft in order to destroy enemy air defenses, especially if the exact locations of those threats are not known. They could also be used to take out pop up threats, such as road-mobile air defense systems, or other targets of opportunity. A “multi-role” weapon design that can accept “modular payloads” also means that these loitering munitions could take on non-kinetic strike missions, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and electronic warfare . Depending on how the Pentagon, and now the Army, envisions employing the Vintage Racer system, it might be possible to deploy them in networked autonomous swarms, where different configured variants take on various roles. Sensor carrying versions could spot targets for ones with kinetic payloads or direct those with electronic warfare jammers to scramble enemy air defenses. A swarm, by its very nature, might also just be able to overwhelm and confuse an opponent by striking en masse from various different directions at once. The briefing slide that Secretary McCarthy examined in October 2019 specifically noted that the Vintage Racer would hopefully be “inexpensive to deploy,” but “costly to defeat.” The goal is for each munition to cost between $100,000 and $200,000, a fraction of what the U.S. military is paying for cruise missiles, for instance. The briefing slide also said that modular loitering munition might be able to take on non-combat “support roles,” as well, mentioning “position, navigation, and timing,” or PNT, as well as “networked communications in a contested environment. The U.S. military, as a whole, is looking increasingly at a concept called Assured PNT as potential threats to the GPS satellite-based navigation system grow. The basic idea behind Assured PNT, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces , is to use various means to distribute navigation system nodes across various platforms throughout the battlespace, and networking them together. The result is an ecosystem that can provide accurate and reliable position information without having to rely on GPS. Similarly, distributed communications nodes could help overcome enemy electronic warfare attacks. Beyond the Vintage Racer system’s ability to provide a useful addition layer in these concepts, its rapidly deployable nature could make it an important means of filling connectivity gaps during critical operations. An infographic showing how various signal sources could provide navigation data in BAE System’s Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOP) concept, which could help provide Assured PNT., BAE Systems It’s worth noting that the Army actually teased the idea of using its future Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) quasi-ballistic missile as a way to deploy loitering intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drones deep into enemy territory in order to provide targeting information back in 2018. Employing a mobile, ground-launched platform could further increase the system’s flexibility. A 2018 Army briefing slide covering various long-range artillery and missile developments. “PrSM Loitering ISR” is mentioned in the “Deep Targeting Asset” category at the upper lefthand corner., US Army Lockheed Martin is developing PrSM ostensibly as a replacement for the service’s existing Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) quasi-ballistic missiles. The Army and Lockheed Martin are also now testing a multi-mode guidance system for these missiles that could enable them to engage large moving targets, such as ships. There had previously been talk about giving ATACMS a similar moving target capability. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Army had worked on a version of the ATACMS that would carry a payload of 13 Brilliant Anti-Tank (BAT) submunitions , which has some broad similarities to the idea of launching drones using the PrSM, as well as the Vintage Racer concept. BAT was a small unpowered glide bomb that used acoustic sensors to find its targets and imaging infrared seeker to home in on them. The Army ultimately canceled the BAT-filled ATACMS project, though the weapons themselves evolved into the GBU-44/B Viper Strike air-launched glide bomb. Of course, Vintage Racer is hardly the U.S. military’s first foray into the idea of a long-range, stand-off conventionally-armed loitering munition for prosecuting time-sensitive and other critical strikes. In the early 2000s, the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research (ONR) worked on developing a low-cost cruise missile-type weapon with loitering capability known as the Affordable Weapon System (AWS). “The Affordable Weapon System, a loitering cruise-missile-like system that can carry a variety of payloads, transitioned to the acquisition community for development,” Navy Rear Admiral Jay Cohen, then-Chief of Naval Research, told members of Congress in March 2005. The Titan Corporation, now part of L-3 Communications, continued development of the AWS under contract to ONR until at least 2007. The company was supposed to build 85 of these missiles for test and evaluation purposes, though it’s unclear if that ever came to pass. A test launch of an Affordable Weapon System loitering missile prototype. The weapon’s large wing is visible along the top. After launch, this wing would turn 180 degrees into a deployed configuration., USN An Affordable Weapon System missile prototype on a trailer with its wing in the deployed state., USN In 2014, the U.S. Air Force also published a Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPA) Vector , covering “vision and enabling concepts” envisioned for the 2013 to 2038 timeframe. This document included mention of a notional “hypersonic near-space ‘mother ship’ RPA that deliver[s] multiple SUAS [small unmanned aerial systems] to provide a strategically significant number of lethal, EA [electronic attack], or cyberattack capabilities within minutes.” The portion of the 2014 RPA Vector dealing with the “hypersonic near-space ‘mother ship.'”, USAF Vintage Racer would seem to be the latest attempt to provide this kind of capability. That the Office of the Secretary of Defense initially managed the effort and paid for its through its Quick Reaction Fund, suggests that there is real hope that this project will move quickly toward becoming an operational reality. “The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) provided … opportunities to capitalize on relatively mature technologies. Capabilities addressed National Defense Strategy priorities and informed programs of record or new acquisition pathways to more effectively and affordably push innovation to the field.,” according to the Pentagon’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request. “QRF focused on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs. QRF initiatives typically delivered a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.” It will be very exciting to see how quickly the Army can continue to refine and improve the Vintage Racer system as it works on moving it from an experimental to an operational capability.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 6, 2020",USS Nimitz Aircraft Carrier Deploys With Powerful New Infrared Sensor System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The supercarrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68) , now America’s oldest operational aircraft carrier , just got an upgrade before she left port in Washington State to head to the waters off the Southern California coast to participate alongside her strike group in the most complex training her crew will take part in before deploying to the increasingly turbulent Pacific. The enhancement in question is a very high-power stand-alone electro-optical and infrared imaging system that has been mounted on the forward part of her island superstructure. The modification appears to be totally unique to Nimitz at this time. The system itself appears to be the Mk 6 Mod 4 Stalker Long-Range Electro-Optical Infrared Laser Sensor System (SLREOSS) built by Ball. The system uses an HD electro-optical (EO) camera system and a medium-wavelength infrared (MWIR) camera paired with a laser rangefinder, all of which are very high-power and can peer over great distances with fully stabilized accuracy and tracking. This standalone mounted system is derived from the one Ball builds for the Mk 95 Sea Sparrow radar director systems found on some U.S. Navy big deck amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers, as well as some allied NATO ships. The Mk 95 directors are used to provide radar illumination for the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow (ESSM). The latest ESSM Block II does not rely on external radar directors, but it hasn’t found its way on America’s supercarriers due to weight compatibility issues with the existing Mk 29 armored box launchers on these ships. Regardless, some of the Mk 95s, which are stabilized radar tracking platforms in their own right, have been equipped with telephoto video camera systems for years. Stalker attached to Mk 95 radar directors. , Ball The Stalker system goes beyond that basic capability, incorporating both EO and IR sensors, along with laser rangefinding, which can be highly effective at positively identifying and prioritizing incoming threats the ship chooses to engage. In addition, it can be invaluable in deciding if follow-on salvos of missiles need to be launched at a target. This is highly important considering only eight missiles are carried in each Mk 29 armored box launcher. Mk 29 firing an ESSM with the Mk 95 director seen blow the missile with an older camera system attached. , USN A few of America’s carriers’ Mk 95s already have the Stalker system installed atop their turrets. Those that do, only appear to have them on their two primary directors mounted centrally on the island superstructure. So, even if they do have a version of the system on the directors themselves, having one that can work independently of those critical self-defense systems would be a hugely useful for identifying threats around the ship, both in the air and on the surface, and also for navigation and man-overboard operations. An image from April 2020 showing the Mk 6 Mod 4 independent Stalker mount being installed before the ship leaving to Southern California. , USN The first Arleigh Burke class destroyer was delivered with a similar system that was primarily intended to assist in employing the ship’s five-inch gun. It turned out to be one of the class’s most useful, albeit obscure tools, performing many other tasks, as well. Eventually, increasingly capable versions of that system were installed on newer destroyers and it has since been retrofitted to many of America’s remaining Ticonderoga class cruisers. That system is the Mark 20 electro-optical sensor system (EOSS). You can learn all about this system, and in doing so, gain valuable insights into the Stalker system that is quite similar to it, in this past article of ours . Another image of the Nimitz’s island with the Stalker mount installed taken on May 20th, 2020. , USN A supercarrier’s Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system (CIWS) mounts also have telephoto and infrared cameras, as do the Mk 38 25mm chain gun weapon systems. But adding a far more powerful system like Stalker that can operate independently of any weapon system and is mounted high atop the island would provide exceptional line of sight and high situational awareness as to what is going on around the ship at any given time. Considering its Sea Sparrow director roots, it is likely tied into the ship’s other sensor systems, especially radar, so it could be able to be cued at targets of interest that are first spotted using those sensors. This image shows one of two of the Nimitz’s island-mounted Mk 95 directors (upper right inside the cone-like mount) fitted with a version of the Stalker system. This was taken in 2013. It looks like the system has since been removed.  , USN The inner sanctum around a carrier, while it is underway in the littorals, is where it is most vulnerable, as we have seen time and time again . So, being able to visually identify threats and monitor them as far away as possible is a huge deal. This includes those flying through the air, not just skimming along the water’s surface. This stand-alone Stalker system should help in those efforts significantly. Nimitz just departed on her operational cruise. It is nice to know that her crew has a new capability discreetly assigned to keeping watch over their home away from home as it sails into less than friendly waters.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle has become the first aircraft type certified to deliver the United States’ B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb following a series of tests over the Tonopah Test Range in March. The War Zone was first to report that month on a sighting of an F-15E carrying an inert B61-12 at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, which oversees the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range , inside which the Tonopah Test Range is situated. This particular F-15E was certainly among those involved in this testing of America’s latest nuclear bomb, each of which will cost more than their weight in gold , literally. The Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories, which has been leading the development of B61-12 under the auspices of the National Nuclear Security Administration, announced the completion of the latest round of flight testing, and subsequent certification of the F-15E to employ the weapon, on June 8, 2020. The final two end-to-end flight tests in March demonstrated Air Force crews’ ability to handle, load, and otherwise simulate the employment of the bomb in both high and low-altitude release profiles. On Mar. 9, 2020, Air Force crews loaded an inert B61-12 “containing non-nuclear and mock nuclear components” onto an F-15E at an undisclosed location “to ensure the mock weapon was secure and digital and analog interfaces were properly configured and communicating between the aircraft and weapon,” according to Sandia’s release. Aviation photographer Kris Trajano observed a Strike Eagle carrying an inert version of this bomb arriving at Nellis on Mar. 10, as The War Zone previously reported . The low altitude test flight, which involved an F-15E releasing the bomb at an altitude of around 1,000 feet while flying near Mach 1 over the Tonopah Test Range, took place on Mar. 12. Sandia says the weapon hit the desert floor 35 seconds after release. Past variants of the B61 series could be equipped with a tail assembly containing a parachute to slow the bomb’s fall, giving the aircraft that dropped it time to escape the blast. Aircraft could also drop bombs equipped with a parachute, or some other form of retarding device, such as a ballute , in a so-called “laydown” mode, where the denotation occurs after a set time delay after it hits the ground. You can read more about these release profiles in this past War Zone piece . However, the B61-12 features a new tail assembly with a GPS precision guidance system. It’s not clear how this might impact the new version’s available low-level release profile options. The video below shows testing of inert versions of earlier B61 variants. Sandia did not say when the subsequent high-altitude test took place exactly. In that case, the F-15E flew at over 25,000 feet, while again flying at near Mach 1, and it took 55 seconds for the bomb to reach the ground. “This is a full demonstration of a B61-12 delivery on an F-15E – verifying compatibility in real pre-flight and flight environments,” Steven Samuels, a manager with Sandia’s B61-12 System’s Team, said in a statement. “This is the real deal, minus the nuclear package. This test brought together years of planning, design, analysis, test, and qualification to fully demonstrate the B61-12 on the F-15E Strike Eagle.” The B61-12 has been in development since at least 2011 and is technically a refurbishment and consolidation of four existing variants, the B61-3, -4, -7, and -10. The U.S. military has also indicated that the new variant could eventually replace the specialized B61-11 bunker-buster version, though it’s unclear how it would be able to provide the same capabilities against deeply buried targets. You can read more about the entire B61 family, which has been in service longer than any other series of U.S. nuclear bombs, in this past War Zone feature . A diagram showing how the four earlier B61 variants will get recycled into the latest B61-12 bombs., Federation of American Scientists The F-15E, as well as the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber , have been involved in numerous earlier flight tests. A B-2 actually flew an end-to-end test with the B61-12 for the first time in 2018 , but has not yet been certified to employ the weapon. The Air Force plans to eventually certify the bomb on so-called “dual-capable” F-16C/D Vipers, as well as at least some of its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . NATO allies that are part of the alliance’s nuclear weapons sharing agreement , such as Germany , will also eventually certify their own dual-capable aircraft to deliver these bombs. Sandia’s statement notably does not mention the B-21 Raider stealth bomber , which has been mentioned in the past as a platform that will employ the B61-12, or the B-52H bomber, which is no longer certified to use older B61 variants or any other nuclear gravity bombs. The achievement of certifying the Strike Eagle now is also somewhat muted in the fact that the Air Force does not now expect to take delivery of any B61-12s until 2022. NNSA announced last year that the delivery schedule had gotten pushed back after it discovered a commercially-sourced part it was using did not meet its stringent reliability standards. It will cost an estimated $850 million, in total, replace all of these parts, each of which costs just $5, in the B61-12s that are now in production, as well as in upgraded W88 ALT 370 warheads that will eventually go into the U.S. Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launch ballistics missiles. An inert B61-12 hits the ground during a drop test., Sandia National Laboratories The B61-12 project had already suffered numerous delays and cost increases. It has been famously pointed out in the past that each one of the bombs will cost more than its literal weight in gold. This has been based on previous reports that the bomb weighed around 700 pounds. Interestingly, Sandia now says the weapon, which is also around 12 feet long, weighs closer to 825 pounds. At the time of writing, the price of an ounce of gold was just under $1,703, or $27,248 per pound. At that conversion rate, 825 pounds of gold would be worth $22,479,600. The total cost of the B61-12 program, including building 400 bombs, as of 2012 was $10 billion, or just over $11 billion in 2020 dollars. The average cost per bomb based on that figure would be $27,500,000. However, this does not include the cost of the GPS guidance tail kits and subsequent cost increases, such as the recent part issue. So, even now knowing more about the bomb’s weight, it’s still more expensive than a pile of gold with the same weight. Still, whenever the Air Force does not begin to start taking delivery of its first B61-12s, its F-15Es, at least, will be ready to drop them, if necessary.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Well over a decade after the stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel spy drone first appeared in Kandahar, Afghanistan, there is still very little official information about it. In fact, most of what does exist in the public domain has been obtained via the Freedom Of Information Act , not from standard communications channels. To this day, even the aircraft’s basic dimensions have been up for debate, but a satellite image taken of Creech Air Force Base in Nevada on January 30th, 2020 can put that debate to rest. The satellite image, which The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, shows the flying-wing RQ-170 Sentinel taxiing near an MQ-9 Reaper on the northeast unmanned aircraft apron at the Air Force’s master drone base. The incredibly shy RQ-170s have been at least partially based there for years . Using Plant Labs’ measuring tools, we get an exact match for the Reaper’s wingspan, 66 feet. For the RQ-170 we get roughly 38 feet. This may sound small and certainly our own estimates of the aircraft’s wingspan have morphed over the years, but based on the many photographs that have emerged since one of the RQ-170 crashed in Iran back in late 2011, and others taken here in the United States of the aircraft in flight , this makes perfect sense. The only official image ever released of the RQ-170 was obtained via FOIA by our own Joseph Trevithick. The image was shot at Andersen AFB on the island of Guam., USAF via FOIA A wingspan of 38 feet would roughly equate to an eight-foot fuselage section and two 15 foot wing sections. The aircraft actually is designed in these components for transfer and the RQ-170 that crashed in Iran was moved in this same manner and reassembled, albeit a bit crudely, for display. But this makes it substantially smaller than the predominate estimates you will find from various sources, including the military’s own indirectly related literature , which states the aircraft has a span of just under 66 feet. The RQ-170 being recovered in Iran. , Iranian State Media Documentary via Youtube So, there you have it, the RQ-170 is about 38 feet wide. We do know that Lockheed’s Skunk Works has openly proposed and even teased larger variants of the RQ-170 design, which could have strike and other missions beyond penetrating and persistence reconnaissance capabilities. We have speculated that such an aircraft could already exist and may have been flying for some time now. Regardless, as it sits today, the world’s only confirmed operational flying-wing stealthy drone has a smaller wingspan by about 10 feet than the MQ-9 Reaper’s predecessor, the MQ-1 Predator . As for the RQ-170 Sentinel that the United States lost to Iran, after nearly a decade of prodding, poking, and displaying, it looks really rough. Even some of its Formica-like radar-absorbent material is chipping away from its edges.  At this point, America’s peer state adversaries have all had an invasive examination of the captured Sentinel, which likely helped their own stealth flying wing initiatives dramatically . Iranian State Media Iranian State Media Iranian State Media Iranian State Media Considering the RQ-170 was openly being used at a busy foreign air base in daylight back in 2007, and at least part of its l ineage has now been revealed , one hopes America’s high-end unmanned capabilities have drastically advanced.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 16, 2020",Does This Image Show The Colorado Mystery Drone Swarm? (UPDATE: It Doesn’t),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the most bizarre aerospace-related stories in recent memory was the saga of the unidentified drones that were reportedly seen throughout eastern Colorado and western Nebraska. Numerous reports were filed with various local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, and a joint task force was eventually formed to investigate the phenomenon. Despite the attention the alleged mystery drones received, the case has largely faded out of the public eye, likely due to the lack of either answers or definitive evidence related to the drones’ origins. Editor’s Note: We asked our readers to help us investigate this image for a good reason. One of our esteemed commenters @Orb, found the photo using a reverse image search tool called Yandex. It appears to have emanated from a coordinated drone demonstration in this video . So we can safely say that the image included in the FOIA documents is not of the Colorado incidents. The War Zone and Douglas D. Johnson of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies are still filing records requests at the federal and state level in relation to the apparent drone mystery and information is now starting to trickle in. As part of those requests, Johnson recently received a single email from the FAA that may contain the best image of the mystery drones we have seen, if that is indeed what the photograph shows. The Unresolved Saga of the Mystery Drones of America’s West and Midwest The War Zone was among the first outlets to report on the bizarre saga of the mystery drones being reported in the skies above Colorado and Nebraska. Reports of the drones first appeared in December 2019 and sightings continued into the first few months of 2020. Public concern grew so large that the FAA along with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies formed a task force that included a PC-12 surveillance aircraft operated by the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. The War Zone is still actively pursuing Colorado state records in relation to that aircraft and its use to hunt for the drones, although those requests have faced significant delays due to disruptions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Public interest in the alleged drones seems to have died down and there is some speculation that a portion of these sightings could have been of misidentified satellites or conventional aircraft, which is far from implausible. Still, many of the sightings and accounts of drones have been made by trained personnel including law enforcement officers and the similarities among the most credible reports do suggest that formations of small unmanned aircraft have indeed been spotted flying around the region at low-level. There was also rampant speculation that the drones were somehow related to or operated by nearby military installations including F.E. Warren Air Force Base. Emails obtained by Douglas D. Johnson of the SCU show that there was confusion and concern about the drones among personnel at the base and do not provide any conclusions that explain away the mystery. Nearly all the images in the documentation from F.E. Warren Air Force Base were strangely redacted, as well. So, as it sits now, the strangest part of this bizarre saga is the lack of a resolution. No conclusive answers or pieces of evidence have been provided about the identity of the alleged drones, their operators, or how so many people, including reliable observers, were mistaken and by what. However, the addition of this latest image, obtained through the Freedom Of Information Act, could lend credence to the existence of the unidentified drone swarms. The FAA’s Mysterious Image The image Douglas Johnson obtained appears to show a formation of ten pairs of lights in the twilight or early morning sky, possibly belonging to the craft. Another object can be seen in the lower-right portion of the image which may be an individual’s silhouette, although the low resolution and the lighting conditions make it difficult to tell what exactly can be seen in the foreground in the photograph, but the lights of the airborne formation are distinct. In the initial coverage of the unidentified drones in December 2019, The Denver Post reported that eyewitnesses described small aircraft featuring red, white, and blue lights . In the image included in the FAA email, some of the lights appear to be blue and red. FAA via FOIA The photograph was included in an email exchange between Ian Gregror, Communications Manager for the FAA Pacific Division, and Rick Breitenfeldt, a public affairs officer at the William J. Hughes Technical Center housed at the Atlantic City International Airport. From the email, it appears that the photograph was taken by a friend of Breitenfeldt’s brother-in-law who lives in central Nebraska. There is no other information in the emails, although Gregor did state that he wanted to pass the image on to local law enforcement agencies, presumably in Nebraska. VIA FOIA It’s still unclear what the photograph shows, although if confirmed to actually be a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles, it would certainly support many of the eyewitness reports of formations of drones moving through the skies above Colorado and Nebraska. It’s also entirely possible that it could be from some other source material unrelated to the Colorado drone scare, but the fact that the FAA official passed it along with a personal reference is significant evidence that would seem to point to the contrary. We invite our readers to help with this investigation. Does this image look familiar? Let us know in the comments below or via email. We will continue to investigate the rash of reports of unidentified drones over the Central United States last winter and will have future updates as more information surfaces and our records requests are fulfilled.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2020",Manned Fighter To Face Autonomous Drone Next Year In Sci-Fi Movie-Like Showdown,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force is hoping to pit an autonomous drone equipped with an artificial intelligence-driven flight control system against a fighter jet with a human pilot in a little over a year. The service has described this effort in the past as a “big moonshot” that could revolutionize air-to-air combat in ways that have so far been limited to the realm of fiction – at least as far as we know. Air Force Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, head of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), revealed that the Air Force had set the goal of holding the faceoff in July 2021 during a remote event that the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies held on June 4, 2020. The Pentagon established the JAIC in 2018 to serve as a central point of focus for AI developments and related activities across the U.S. military. Shanahan did not offer any details about the design of the unmanned aircraft that is supposed to take part in this in this future aerial duel or specifics about its planned capabilities. He did say that Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Autonomy Capability Team 3 (ACT3), led by Steve Rogers, was still in charge of the effort, which Inside Defense first reported the existence of in May 2018. AFRL created ACT3 that year to focus on AI developments. Joint Artificial Intelligence Center head Air Force Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, at left, at an event in February 2020., DOD Regardless, the general concept of a fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) capable of air-to-air combat, as well as air-to-ground strikes, hold great potential to fundamentally change the character of aerial warfare, something The War Zone has explored in great depth in the past. At its most basic, a UCAV would be able to perform many of the same functions as manned aircraft, but would be able to make key decisions faster and more accurately, taking into account much more information in a shorter period of time, without any concern about being distracted or confused by the general chaos of combat. They can also be networked into swarms that work cooperatively to maximize their combat effectiveness at any given time far beyond what a human-piloted formation could. The design of the drones themselves would be freed from parameters required to accommodate and protect a human pilot. Their planforms could be better optimized for aerial maneuvering and the pilotless aircraft could handle greater stresses during more aggressive flying than would be deemed too dangerous if a person was inside. The drones would also likely be cheaper to build and maintain than manned fighter jets and, networked together into swarms, might not have to perform all missions equally well. In an air-to-air scenario, some might carry a powerful radar or an infrared search and track (IRST) system or other sensors to spot and track threats, while others, acting as missile trucks, would then engage those targets. The Air Force, as well as other U.S. military services and foreign air forces , is already exploring how semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” drones might provide many of the same benefits when networked together with manned combat aircraft, something you can read about in these past War Zone stories . There are also separate efforts in progress to integrate similar AI-driven systems into manned aircraft themselves to help improve decision making and reduce pilot fatigue, among other benefits that you can find out more about in this previous War Zone piece . The Air Force has been using Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, seen here flying with a T-38 Talon jet trainer, to explore loyal wingman concepts. , USAF In 2018, AFRL’s Steve Rogers had told Inside Defense that his team was looking to integrate AI-driven capabilities into manned fighter jets first. “Our human pilots, the really good ones, have a couple thousand hours of experience,” he said at the time. “What happens if I can augment their ability with a system that can have literally millions of hours of training time?” Rogers continued “How can I make myself a tactical autopilot so in an air-to-air fight, this system could help make decisions on a timeline that humans can’t even begin to think about?” It’s not clear what progress Rogers’ team has made on that front or toward the goal of a fully-autonomous UCAV since then. In his remarks during the Mitchell Institute event, Lieutenant General Shanahan implied that the scheduled faceoff was very much an aspirational goal and that it wasn’t clear if it would happen as planned. Rogers “is probably going to have a hard time getting to that flight next year … when the machine beats the human,” the JAIC head said. “If he does it, great.” An artist’s conception of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter attempting to engage a stealthy 5GAT aerial target drone with an AIM-9X sidewinder missile. The manufacturer, Sierra Technical Services, has said it is interested in pitching this design, or a derivative thereof, to the Air Force as a loyal wingman, as well., Sierra Technical Services It’s worth noting that in 2018 Rogers had told Inside Defense that the plan was for the dogfight to take place within 18 months, which would have been sometime before the end of this year. So, the July 2021 date is already seven months behind that schedule. In addition, it’s not clear how this project is or isn’t connected to the AFRL’s Skyborg program , which is looking to demonstrate a loyal wingman type drone equipped with an AI-driven “computer brain” next year. The service has also said that it would be interested in installing a more mature version of the Skyborg system on a fighter jet-sized unmanned aircraft in 2022. On top of that, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been working to develop AI-driven software that could help automate air-to-air combat as part of its Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program. It’s unclear how this project might inform any of AFRL’s developments. There’s also no explanation of why the Air Force is only doing this now and why it appears to be taking so long. While there have certainly been important developments in recent years in artificial intelligence and general advanced computing, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, among others, both demonstrated highly autonomous prototype UCAVs years ago, which you can read about in this past War Zone feature . There have undoubtedly been more advanced unmanned aircraft developments in the classified realm, as well. There have similarly been successful demonstrations of semi-autonomous loyal wingman type drones in the past. In 2015, the Air Force itself conducted a test, dubbed Have Raider , in which a pilotless F-16D Viper fighter jet flew linked together with piloted one. In a follow-on experiment, Have Raider II, which took place two years later, the unmanned Viper successfully broke away from its manned counterpart on command, flew a simulated mission, and then returned to formation. The proposed faceoff also runs the risk of becoming a distraction from all this existing UCAV work and for future developments. Of course, there idea of holding a John Henry-esque man-versus-machine contest between a fighter pilot and UCAV, something that has been a staple of military and science fiction for decades, such as the opening moments of 2011’s Green Lantern or the entire premise of the 2005 movie Stealth , is certainly very alluring. “The [F-35] competitor should be a drone fighter plane that’s remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy,” Elon Musk, founder of space launch firm SpaceX, co-founder of electric car company Telsa, and a general advanced technology entrepreneur, notably Tweeted out in February in an exchange in which he also declared the age of the manned fighter jet to be over. “The F-35 would have no chance against it.” However, a one-on-one matchup, especially, is not necessarily indicative of how either platform would perform in a real, complex, multi-faceted combat environment filled with other friendly enabling assets and threats in the air and down below . The emphasis on dogfighting prowess has already waned somewhat in terms of how the Air Force, among others, expects to gain air superiority in the future as part of a larger force including elements from other services, as well as allies and partners. It is only going to become increasingly more possible to dominate in the air without dogfighting and to develop and acquire fleets of unmanned aircraft around that reality that optimize low-observability (stealth), range, payload, and even cost, over high-performance. At the same time, the Air Force and the Navy have both repeatedly said that they expect their future forces to include both piloted aircraft and drones, though the exact mix is still being debated. All told, it remains very much to be seen what AFRL’s manned-versus-unmanned aerial duel will actually look like in the end next summer, if it doesn’t just get pushed back yet again. If anything else, it will be a good gauge to see how far artificial intelligence and its air combat applications can be pushed, regardless of its actual battlefield relevance at this time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 8, 2020",These Photos Of Ford And Nimitz Class Carriers Sailing Side-By-Side Offer Best Comparison Yet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s $13B first of its kind Ford class supercarrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) , which now has Carrier Air Wing 8 embarked onboard, is slowly showing signs of improvement to its various systems after a litany of engineering setbacks , but it still has a long way to go before becoming available for actual operational deployments. As such, the Navy’s 10 Nimitz class carriers will continue providing for America’s national defense needs alone. Beyond their general configurations, the two classes have major differences, both outwardly visible and not. Pictures released by the Navy today showing the USS Harry S. Truman sailing alongside USS Gerald R. Ford give us our best visual comparison yet of the two classes. The best image of the lot is seen below. It shows the differences in the island superstructures, which is the most radical visual change between the two classes. The Nimitz class’ superstructure has changed substantially over the years itself and still varies a bit from ship-to-ship in some instances. You can read all about this in this past story of ours . However, on the Ford class, the island’s footprint was substantially shrunk and it was moved back by 140 feet on the ship to provide for more deck space overall and to create a deck layout that is supposed to enhance operational tempo substantially. USN Its unique shape comes from the requirement to house its active electronically scanned array (AESA) Dual Band Radar (DBR). This radar has six separate arrays, one smaller and one larger on three of the island’s sides, providing 360-degree coverage around the ship. The old spinning 3D and 2D radars that have been staples on earlier carriers have been totally eliminated. The DBR, which has been mired in its own developmental and technical issues, has effectively been canceled going forward. The Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), which uses just three arrays and will have major commonality across the Navy’s flattop fleet and among many of its new surface combatants , will be installed on all other Ford class carriers from the future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) onward. You can read all about EASR and its future aboard the Navy’s flattops and other ships in this past piece of ours . Regardless, the point here is that the DBR is now a one-off unique to Ford, but the island design won’t change much because it will still need to sport the EASR’s three large active electronically scanned arrays (AESA). The images below show the overall configuration of both ships and the differences in their deck layouts. The Ford class has just three aircraft elevators instead of four, but their placement and larger size are supposed to actually enhance operations, not hinder them. The Navy also says that the larger flight deck area will help the ship achieve its goal of being able to execute 25 percent more sorties per day than its predecessor, an aspiration that is still far from being realized at this time. USN USN The change from four arresting wires to three actually occurred with the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), not the Ford class. , USN Another big change is the large and box-like ‘wing’ structures on the Ford’s stern. These provide a large increase of room on the hangar deck for storage, work areas, and more. Topside they offer a large surface area for mounting future defensive weaponry, such as lasers , and sensors to be mounted. They could even possibly accommodate a vertical launch system of some sort one day. USN These are just some of the major external design changes you can see in these images. A seemingly endless list of changes lies beneath the Ford’s skin, many of which you may never even notice, but they are drastic departures in their own right from their predecessors. You can learn all about how the Navy ended up with the design for the Ford class in the video below. Some of it has aged very poorly, but it stands as a historical reference as to how this ship design, regardless of its troubled state, came to be. We plan on doing a post on this video alone in the future, but it is highly relevant to this article, so enjoy!

"Chris ""Ox"" Harmer","Updated on Jun 2, 2020",Veteran Military Helicopter Pilot On Why Hovering Over Protestors Was Dangerous And Stupid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Early in my career flying H-60 Seahawks in the U.S. Navy, our carrier air wing was operating down in the Caribbean. I planned and led a complex training mission involving about a dozen aircraft, including four helicopters, eight strike fighters, as well as some Navy SEALS .  We expended a lot of live ordnance, accomplished all our training requirements, and in general had a great time. Afterward, as we were celebrating at a bar just outside of Naval Air Station Roosevelt Roads on Puerto Rico, one of the senior officers in the air wing took me aside and said: “There is a fine line between being aggressive and being stupid. Right now you are nowhere near that line. You are operating all the way on the stupid side of that line, and you need to un-fuck yourself before you get somebody killed.” I am reminded of this incident at random times and it usually brings a smile to my face, because he was right. I was being aggressive, but stupidly so, and putting everyone at risk. I changed my ways and became a much safer, more effective, more responsible Naval Aviator. An Unjustified Act On Monday, I saw something that reminded me of the fact that there is a fine line between aggression and stupidity, and the memory did not bring a smile to my face. Just the opposite. I watched military helicopters being used to conduct crowd control and dispersal operations on U.S. citizens engaged in protests in our nation’s capital. You can see all the videos of these incidents and The War Zone’s in-depth coverage on them here. I don’t know who thought this was a good idea, but it’s not courageous, it’s not smart, it’s not effective, it’s just stupid and counterproductive on every level. It’s also both unjustified and unnecessary. Shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, I was trained how to use a helicopter as a “show of force” at low altitude to disperse crowds. Thankfully, I was never tasked with actually doing this mission while deployed. I know plenty of helicopter pilots who were tasked with these types of missions—used to disperse crowds so that insurgents couldn’t hide in them—in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they all hated it. Even if it is necessary, using a helicopter to sandblast civilians is not what anyone thought they were signing up for. I never thought I would see U.S. military helicopters being used in this way on American soil. There is a legitimate use for helicopters in civilian law enforcement. Virtually every major local police department has a flight division operating helicopters and light fixed-wing aircraft. Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department has an Air Support Unit . I don’t think anyone has a problem with local law enforcement using aircraft to conduct routine operations, but there is something fundamentally wrong with using military helicopters to disperse American citizens engaged in the protected exercise of free speech. The Crews Endangered Themselves And Everyone Below Them I live just outside of Washington, D.C., so I am accustomed to hearing every major event, such as the current wave of protests, analyzed through a political lens, i.e., who does this hurt, who does it help, how does it change the political or electoral dynamic. That’s just the way D.C. operates and this issue of an American military helicopter being used to disperse American citizens in the nation’s capital is being analyzed in a similar fashion. With that said, over the last 24 hours I have talked to a dozen or so former or current Navy helicopter pilots about this incident and each of them pointed out that regardless of the political messaging or posturing, the real issue in their minds was just how dangerous it was, both for the protestors on the ground and for the flight crew. While hovering over a crowd at low altitude, the downwash from the rotor circulates debris and dust at high speed. While some of the protestors were wearing rudimentary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), many were not. Those citizens were at risk of being seriously injured as a result. As far as the helicopter goes, kicking up that much dust and debris is almost certain to result in some Foreign Object Debris (FOD) ingestion into the engines. The worst-case scenario—an engine or control system failure while in a hover—would leave no room to maneuver to a safe landing spot and not enough altitude to enter an autorotation. It’s far safer to be in forward flight at altitude than in a permanent hover. Both the American citizens who were subjected to the debris blast and the helicopter crew were placed in danger for no apparent reason. A Violation Of Longstanding Principle and Precedence The most obvious objection to this incident is it violates long-standing precedence and principle that the American military should only be used for domestic security purposes when absolutely necessary, in highly atypical situations. While the recent deployment of U.S. Navy hospital ships in support of the COVID-19 response brought temporary attention to the U.S. military’s role in responding to domestic emergencies, the fact is the U.S. military has a baseline capability and responsibility to support civilian authorities during natural disasters and other contingencies. These missions are generally referred to as Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations and each military service trains to do this. Far less common is the use of the U.S. military in case of a total breakdown of law and order. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the security situation deteriorated so quickly that local law enforcement was overwhelmed, and the U.S. military, primarily elements of the National Guard, temporarily assumed some law enforcement and civil order functions. The public supported that action because it was necessary and temporary. I doubt the American public will support the use of military helicopters to suppress and disperse American citizens. Time For Answers As this piece was being written, the District of Columbia National Guard announced that its Commanding General, Major General William J. Walker, was directing an investigation into the actions of the helicopter crew. The message was short, but emphasized that the National Guard is operating in support of civil authorities and that the priority was the safety of both the Guardsmen and citizens. With this message, it makes it much easier for critics of the action on June 1 to conclude that it was an unauthorized event—a mistake or an unfortunate choice by a small number of people—rather than a deliberate institutional decision. Let’s hope this is the case and demand that it never happens again. There are a time and a place for U.S. military helicopters to engage in crowd dispersal and show of force. It should never happen on American soil. Editor’s update: Secretary of Defense Esper has since commented that he ordered the investigation into these incidents. Chris Harmer is a retired Naval Aviator. He flew SH-60F and HH-60H helicopters, accumulating approximately 3,500 total flight hours.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 3, 2020",Nuclear Detection Helicopter Flies Mission Around Washington D.C. Amid Unrest (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports of curious aerial activity over and around Washington, D.C. continue to emerge amid the response in the nation’s capital to protests and riots stemming from the police killing of Minneapolis resident George Floyd last week. Earlier today, a Department of Energy helicopter equipped with a specialized system to measure and map radiation levels flew a route around the greater D.C. area. It’s unclear if this flight was somehow related to the ongoing protests or if it was just a routine survey. A map showing N411DE’s flight around Washington, D.C. on June 2, 2020. , FlightRadar24 The helicopter in question, a Bell 412 that carries the civil registration number N411DE, is one of two that are part of the Aerial Measuring System (AMS), which also includes a number of specially configured Beachcraft King Air fixed-wing aircraft. The National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA), the division of the Department of Energy responsible for overseeing the development and production of nuclear weapons, manages the AMS program through its Remote Sensing Laboratory. Elements of the AMS are based at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington, D.C. and at Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas, Nevada. The King Airs have sensors and other equipment to detect and geolocate radioactive hotspots on the ground and gather certain data about that radiation. The Bell 412s, flying at much lower levels, are employed to conduct more detailed surveys to fully map out the spread of radiation down below. Both components generate data in near real-time, while also collecting information that scientists on the ground can further analyze after the mission is complete. You can read more about the AMS in this past War Zone piece . The complete system’s primary job is to figure out the extent and severity of the spread of radiation after some sort of nuclear or radiological incident. This could be something like radiation leaks from a nuclear power plant or waste disposal facility following a natural or man-made disaster. It could also be the spread of radiation from a terrorist attack involving a dirty bomb or an accident involving an actual nuclear weapon . There’s been no such incident in Washington, D.C., but NNSA does send the AMS-equipped helicopters to conduct mapping surveys of background radiation ahead of significant public events, such as presidential visits or Super Bowls . The helicopters then fly additional patrols of the area afterward to monitor for any concerning changes. “We deploy the helicopter right as a security bubble is being established around a major public event,” Jay Tilden, NNSA’s Associate Administrator for Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation, told Defense News last year. “Oftentimes in a city, you’ll find a hospital or a cancer treatment center, and so that will pop up depending on the location of the source and what it’s in [and] that will show [in the mapped data] and it will allow then the local and/or the federal officials to determine that it, in fact, should be there.” One of the AMS-equipped Bell 412s undergoing maintenance. A King Air aircraft equipped with its component of the system is seen in the background., Department of Energy A dirty bomb could be especially devastating if detonated in the midst of a large public gathering, such as a massive protest. Mass panic from such an attack could also lead to significant casualties simply from people fleeing the epicenter. The appearance of the Department of Energy Bell 412 over Washington, D.C. came after President Donald Trump announced new increased security measures to stem protests and rioting in the capital. This is exactly the kind of decision that could result in a “security bubble” getting established, which might then prompt NNSA to conduct an AMS survey mission as Associated Administrator Tilden had explained. It’s also possible that this flight is unrelated in any way to current events. NNSA does deploy AMS-equipped helicopters and aircraft to conduct routine radiation surveys to collect baseline data in major cities. As with surveys conducted in relation to public events, this provides a picture of what the normal, naturally-occurring radiation levels look like across a certain area to help identify worrisome abnormalities in the future. The Department of Energy has conducted at least one such survey of Washington, D.C., in 2013. Data about background radiation in Washington, D.C. that the Department of Energy collected using AMS in 2013 overlaid over a Google Earth map., Department of Energy There is also a possibility, albeit much less likely, that the Bell 412 is collecting information about some other form of environmental contamination. However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in talking about its Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology (ASPECT) surveillance aircraft, which does have the ability to detect various pollutants from the air, specifically notes that AMS “only collects radiological data in real-time, while ASPECT provides a multi-sensor capability.” You can read more about ASPECT in this past War Zone piece . The War Zone has already reached out to the Department of Energy for clarification and information about the AMS-equipped helicopter’s recent flight around the nation’s capital. We will be sure to update this piece when we receive any additional details. Update: 6/3/2020— The NNSA public affairs office has responded to our queries and says that the flight by N411DE around Washington, D.C. yesterday was a routine flight following maintenance on the helicopter. The full statement is provided below: “NNSA’s Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST) rotary-wing aircraft conducted a routine proficiency flight on Tuesday in the airspace above Washington, D.C.  The flight was an operational check after completion of a routine maintenance inspection and was in no way related to the federal government’s response to the civil unrest in the District.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Helicopters"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 6, 2024",About That Huge Rifle The Secret Service Sniper Was Carrying During Trump’s Photo Op Walk,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We get a lot on inquiries sent here to The War Zone HQ, especially after events like the bizarre use of U.S. military assets in Washington D.C. last night, but one feature of yesterday’s strange course of events around the White House that seemed to stand out to people watching on TV was a pair of U.S. Secret Service snipers who walked with the big group of administration officials over to St. John’s Church for Trump’s photo-op. Seeing the snipers walk with the crowd was strange for a number of reasons, but one of the sniper’s huge and futuristic-looking rifle seemed to have captured more than a few imaginations. You can get an even better look at the weapon in the tweet below. The rifle is based on Accuracy International’s bolt-action AX chassis system (AXAICS). This advanced platform is designed for extreme accuracy shooting and allows customers, such as law enforcement agencies and military units, to customize the caliber, action, and barrel combination for their specific needs. The fully adjustable stock and forend with Picatinny rail and KeyMod accessory attachment points also offer full customization to the user’s needs. Accuracy International AICS fully outfitted. , Accuracy International The AXAICS can accommodate actions chambered for everything from .308 Winchester on the lower-power end, all the way up to .338 Lapua Magnum on the higher end. The company also makes a .50 caliber rifle that is based on a variant of the AX chassis. The weapon being carried by the U.S. Secret Service sniper in the photos is most likely chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum or .338 Lapua Magnum. .308 Winchester, .300 Winchester Magnum, .338 Lapua Magnum, Grasyl /wikicommons It is replete with a suppressor and a very high-power scope. In fact, it appears to be the Schmidt & Bender 5-25×56 PM II . The scope alone runs about $4,500 retail, while a fully outfitted AX series rifle costs roughly $7,000. The suppressor adds around $1,500 more to the total price tag. The heavy-duty bipod is another $300 or so. So, the total package for an off-the-shelf weapon system like this is roughly $13,300—of course, government contracts change everything. AP The USSS sniper team includes another shooter/spotter equipped with an SR-25 pattern semi-automatic rifle . This weapon, chambered in .308 Winchester and equipped with a 5.5×50 ACOG illuminated scope , doesn’t offer the extreme reach or precision of the AX chassis rifle, but it does provide a larger volume of fire and is more suited for medium-range engagements. As such, the individual with the longer-ranged weapon can work more in the counter-sniper and anti-material role, while the other one can be equipped to cover shorter-ranged threats against multiple opponents. Either can act as the spotter for the other, as well. A look at a sniper team atop the White House with an Accuracy International AX variant rifle seen. , AP As to why exactly they walked over to the church with the administration, it isn’t clear. They really don’t provide a protection function in doing so and a counter-sniper team is always set up in advance of such a movement. There is some talk of the photo-op being done on very short notice and maybe a team wasn’t already in place. Whatever the case, it allowed us a very up-close look at the latest and greatest sniper kit used by the Secret Service for its most sensitive and highest-stakes mission. UPDATE: We have new information on this version of the rifle in question. It is at least primarily based on the USMC’s MK13 Mod 7 , which was born out of the Special Operations community and uses the same family of Accuracy Internationa’s chassis as described above. That rifle is chambered in 300 Winchester Magnum and has a special stainless steel barrel unique to this variant made by Lilja. We also found a great video showing the USSS practicing with the rifle.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 7, 2019",Navy’s Highly Promising Long-Range Air Defense Busting Missile Has Taken Its First Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced that an F/A-18E Super Hornet carried a prototype of the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER, aloft for the very first time. The test flight took place at the Patuxent River Test Range in Maryland earlier in the week. The Navy’s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23), based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, provided the F/A-18E for the test. The AGM-88G prototype involved was a captive carry test article, meaning that it was not capable of being launched and lacked other key systems that will be found on the final missiles, such as their guidance package and warhead. The captive carry test flight gathered data on how the aircraft performed with the weapon under its wing, as well as the stresses and strains on the missile itself as the jet went through a series of maneuvers, according to a press release from Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). “This first flight represents a significant step in the AARGM-ER Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase,” Navy Captain Mitch Commerford, head of NAVAIR’s Direct and Time Sensitive Strike program office, said in a statement on June 2. “Data collected from this testing will inform the planned build-up and overall expansion of flight testing with AARGM-ER.” The F/A-18E Super Hornet from VX-23 with the captive-carry AGM-88G AARGM prototype under its left wing., USN Development of the AGM-88G, which The War Zone has reported on extensively in the past , began in 2015. The missile offers significant improvements over the existing and already highly capable AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM). Orbital ATK, which developed the AARGM, was responsible for work on the AARGM-ER until 2018, when Northrop Grumman bought the company, renaming it Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems in the process, which is now the primary contractor for the AGM-88G. A breakdown of the features of the AGM-88E AARGM., Orbital ATK The AGM-88G actually uses the same guidance and control sections as the earlier AGM-88E, but put it in a sleeker body together with a new rocket motor, warhead, and control surfaces in the tail. Though the Navy has not released specific details, it has said that the new AARGM-ER will be significantly faster and longer range than its predecessor. The present AARGM missiles have a maximum range of around 80 miles and can hit Mach 2 during a high-speed sprint in the terminal stage of their flight, according to publicly available information . USN USN The AARGM-ER’s primary task, as is the case with the AARGM, will be the suppression and destruction of enemy integrated air defense networks, homing in on hostile radars and other emitters associated with surface-to-air missiles and other air defense systems. However, it’s guidance package is multi-mode guidance, with a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system component to get to the general target area at extended ranges and a millimeter-wave radar capable of locating targets, even if they shut down and stop emitting signals to zero in on. The guidance package is networked, too, so the launching aircraft can fire it without having to first acquire the target’s emissions, if at all. The off-board sources beyond the plane that fires it can feed updated targeting information the missile in flight. The weapon is reportedly able to relay data back in its final moments about whether it successfully struck the target or not, too. All of this means that the new missile will have a general air-to-surface capability, too. The AGM-88Es, which, as noted, has the same multi-mode guidance system, have already given the Navy, as well as the U.S. Air Force and other operators around the world, a highly capable and precise weapon for engaging various targets down below. The Navy plans to initially field the AGM-88G on its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers by 2023, but the missile is also designed to fit inside the internal bays on the service’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighters . You can read much more about AARGM-ER, its capabilities, and what it means for the Navy, as well as the Air Force, which is also planning to integrate this missile internally on its F-35As, in these past War Zone pieces . An AARGM-ER prototype during a fit check inside the internal bay of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter., Orbital ATK The AGM-88G body is also designed to be modular, allowing for the rapid integration of new and improved capabilities to the missile in the future, such as changes to optimize it for the anti-ship role, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . This has also made the basic design readily adaptable to other mission sets and the Air Force is already developing its own derivative, known as the Stand-in Attack Weapon, or SiAW, as a time-sensitive strike weapon against targets on land. You can read more about the SiAW project in this past War Zone piece . Northrop Grumman has also explored a ground-based, containerized launcher capable of firing both the AGM-88E and AGM-88G.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 3, 2020",Military Helicopters Descend On Washington In Bizarre Very Low-Altitude Show Of Force (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army UH-72 Lakota helicopters, as well as UH-60 Black Hawks , one possibly belonging to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , have been flying extremely low-level show-of-force maneuvers over areas of Washington, D.C. in obvious attempts to try to disperse groups protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week. Some of the helicopters have held a hover right over groups of people, hitting them with their rotor wash and the deafening sound of their rotors and engines. This comes after President Donald Trump announced he had ordered hardline measures against protesters and rioters in the nation’s capital, including the deployment of additional national guardsmen, federal troops, and federal law enforcement officers. Daniella Cheslow, a reporter for WAMU 88.5 , American University Radio, in Washington, D.C. posted the video seen below of one UH-72 Lakota “parked” above a group of people on Twitter. Steven Dengler, the co-founder of XE Currency , a FOREX software tools and services company, and a licensed helicopter pilot, chimed in to point out that, at least under Federal Aviation Administration rules, this maneuver was very illegal. It also seems bizarrely dangerous. If something were to have happened to the helicopter, it could have quickly fallen into the crowd, offering them little chance to get out of the way. The risk of rotor wash sending debris flying either into the helicopter or toward people on the ground is another risk from this kind of flight profile, especially in a dense urban environment . There is no surveillance value added by hovering at that low of an altitude, quite the contrary actually. There have been examples of military units, particularly the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , conducting similar flights in domestic urban areas for training in the past , but with the cooperation of local authorities to help keep bystanders safely away and areas clear of potential dangers. The UH-72 in this instance has red crosses on white square backgrounds on its door and under the fuselage, denoting that its primary mission is as an air ambulance. It’s not clear what unit the Lakota, or a standard Black Hawk that was also seen performing similar maneuvers, are assigned to. Both the D.C. National Guard and the active Army’s 12th Aviation Battalion , the latter of which is based at Davison Army Airfield in Virginia, have UH-72s, including examples in the air ambulance role, as well as UH-60 Black Hawks. There is also a possibility, albeit much less likely, that the helicopters might have come from somewhere else given that the Trump Administration has called in substantial additional federal military and law enforcement support. As we noted, UH-60s have been conducting similar shows of force, as well. New York Times reporter Thomas Gibbons-Neff said that one of the Black Hawks had flown so low that it broke a large branch off a tree with its rotor wash, which fell, but thankfully didn’t injure anyone on the ground below. While some of the UH-60s may be from the 12th Aviation Battalion, Doug Davies, who also goes by the Twitter handle @Dougilis , spotted a Black Hawk flying around D.C. just as the curfew took hold that appears, by every indication, to be one that belongs to the FBI’s elite Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) . He was kind enough to share some pictures of it that he took, seen below, with us. This raises the possibility that at least some of the UH-60s involved in these show of force missions may belong to the FBI. As you can see, the UH-60 in question has fully equipped operators, replete with suppressed carbines, hanging out of their doors, some of which have four-tube night vision goggles mounted on their helmets. HRT is America’s most elite special tactics unit. Doug Davies Doug Davies To say that this kind of activity is unprecedented would be putting it mildly. Washington, D.C. is under a curfew order, but it’s unclear what legal authority there is to employ Army helicopters in this way against citizens that were not rioting. It may also be a sign of the kind of response, at least in the nation’s capital, that we can expect to see going forward to these ongoing protests. Other assets are involved in the overwatch missions beyond the usual police and agency helicopters, as well. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Dash-8 turboprops , which are heavily modified with advanced sensors, are flying missions out of Reagan National Airport. A Cessna Citation registered to the National Aircraft Leasing Corporation, but linked to the FBI, is also now orbiting over the D.C. area. Other fixed-wing aircraft have been seen flying high overhead, as well, some of which do not have their transponders on—which is another highly peculiar move. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 12:35 AM EST— This show of force tactic apparently hasn’t been limited to D.C. Video has emerged online showing a New York Police Department Bell Model 429 helicopter conducting a similar maneuver over protesters in Manhattan. In D.C., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley has been out on the street in fatigues observing the situation assessing the increasing military presence. There are also reports that the elements of the 82nd Airborne Division’s Immediate Response Force, which last deployed to Iraq to bolster security there following an attack on the Embassy in Baghdad in December 2019, are arriving in D.C. from the unit’s home base at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. This would be in line with Trump’s earlier statement that thousands of troops were heading to the capital. Units assigned to the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) have reportedly been put on alert, too. JSOC, which is the U.S. military’s premier counter-terrorism force, has something of a nebulous mission in the greater D.C. area, also known as the National Capital Region, as part of a unit known as the Joint Interagency Task Force-National Capital Region (JIATF-NCR), also sometimes referred to as SOCOM-National Capital Region (SOCOM-NCR) or just the Interagency Task Force (IATF). There have been other reports of C-17s and C-130Js flying in from other posts, as well, including Fort Drum in New York, home of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, and Fort Riley in Kansas, where the 1st Infantry Division is based. UPDATE: 11:28 PM PST— We have reached out to the U.S. Army Military District of Washington to try to get an idea of how or even if these helicopter tactics were approved, and if so why?

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 25, 2019",Special Operators In Syria Are First American Unit To Use Computerized Sights On Their Rifles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos have emerged showing U.S. special operators training to use an advanced optical sighting system for their carbines, including against targets simulating small drones , at the strategic At Tanf garrison in southern Syria. This “smart sight” helps identify targets and then shows the shooter where to aim, increasing their chance of getting a hit on the very first shot, even when stressed and fatigued. Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR), the top command for special operations units involved in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, posted the pictures on the U.S. military’s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service website on May 30, 2020. The photographs show multiple individuals wearing American flag patches, but with no unit insignias visible, familiarizing themselves with M4A1 carbines equipped with the Israeli-made Smart Shooter SMASH 2000 system. “Coalition Forces zero Smart Shooter sighting devices during a familiarization range near At-Tanf Garrison, Syria, May 30, 2020,” a caption to one of the pictures reads “Coalition and partner forces regularly train on various weapon systems in a joint effort to help set conditions for the enduring defeat of Daesh in Syria.” Personnel at At Tanf in Syria train with M4A1 carbines equipped with the Smart Shooter SMASH 2000 sighting system., US Army The SMASH 2000 system consists primarily of an optical sighting system, which attaches to the top of the weapon via a standard accessory rail, along with a special pistol grip and a pressure button that attaches to the handguard. The shooter aims just as they would with any normal non-magnifying red dot or holographic sight. However, with the SMASH 2000, when they put the crosshairs over a target, they can press the button the handguard to “lock on.” The software-driven system will then compute an optimal point of aim, even if the target is moving, with the help of a camera and a laser rangefinder. It will also take into account the shooter’s own movements, which they might make involuntarily because they are tired or stressed. The shooter can then simply engage the target by manually aligning the crosshairs with the designated aim point that the SMASH 2000 projects into the sight picture. They can also switch into a “locked” mode, in which the system will only actually fire once it detects that the weapon is pointed at the right spot. Smart Shooter says this mode of operation also helps reduce the chance of inadvertently firing at bystanders, while also significantly improving the probability of a fire-round hit. Making the first shot is often extremely important in of itself, given that the target might retreat behind cover or otherwise alert other enemies in the area if the round misses its mark. SMASH 2000 can also record its camera feed or take still images for analysis later. This is useful for training purposes, helping troops to figure out how they might improve their shooting, as well as giving the system a limited secondary surveillance capability. Smart Shooter says that the sights are network-enabled, but their exact wireless data transfer capabilities are unclear. It’s not clear whether any U.S. special operations units have actually adopted the SMASH 2000 system or if this training is part of a field trial or other demonstration. The pictures show the special operators at At Tanf firing at a box suspended below a small quadcopter-type drone at one point, demonstrating the system’s ability to detect and track these kinds of aerial targets. The quadcopter with an underslung box as a target is seen here., US Army US Army US Army This is a type of threat that has become a very real danger to American troops, especially in Iraq and Syria, in recent years. It March, reports emerged that American forces in northeastern Syria had come under attack from small unmanned aircraft dropping mortar shell-type projectiles. The U.S. military, as a whole, has been exploring a wide array of counter-drone systems , often sending them in limited numbers to units in combat zones for evaluation. Adding SMASH 2000 sights to even a small number of weapons within a special operations unit, as well as conventional ones, could give them another option for engaging these targets quickly whenever they appear. At the same time, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has been interested, in general, in advanced optics and small arms fire control systems to improve the effectiveness of its operators in the field, as have the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, among others. SOCOM’s interest in advanced aiming systems, especially for sniper rifles, dates back to at least the 1990s . Between 2008 and 2015, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) also experimented with an actual precision-guided .50 caliber bullet, approaching the issue from that direction rather than a new sight, as part of the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program. The SMASH 2000 is not the first smart sight to appear on the open market, either. In 2013, TrackingPoint unveiled the XS1 sniper rifle and its computerized scope, which has many similar features to Smart Shooter’s product, but is intended for long-range precision shooting. The company did subsequently develop rifles based on the AR-15/M16 family with a smaller version of the sighting system . The Army purchased six XS1s for testing, but did not ultimately adopt it. It’s also interesting to note that in 2017, computer security experts exposed major vulnerabilities with the rifle’s WiFi-enabled targeting system, highlighting how fielding more and more networked work systems could exacerbate already significant cybersecurity challenges in the future. In 2018, the Israel Defense Forces became the first publicly known user of the SMASH 2000. In January, Smart Shooter announced that the U.S. Army was evaluating it as part of its Next Generation Squad Weapon program, which is seeking to develop and acquire replacements for the M4A1 carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon . The Australian military has also tested this sighting system in the past. An Israeli soldier with Tavor assault rifle equipped with a SMASH 2000., Smart Shooter U.S. special operators in Syria appear to have now become the first American military personnel to take the system out into an actual combat zone. Their experience will likely help inform the Army’s evaluations and decisions about whether to acquire more of the sights, or different ones with similar features, and field them on a broader basis, which could dramatically change how U.S. soldiers fight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 30, 2020",This Is What The Insurrection Act Of 1807 Is And How Trump Could Try To Use It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy U.S. military forces to major cities in a federal capacity in response to continued violence across the country in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The President has such authorities under the current version of the Insurrection Act , which was first enacted in 1807 and allows for the use of troops in a federal capacity in response to domestic unrest and certain other contingencies. There are certain limitations on when it can be invoked, though, and it’s unclear if Trump will be able to do so unilaterally. Trump made his comments about deploying the military domestically while speaking to the press on June 1, 2020. You can watch video clips of the relevant portions of his remarks below: “Governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D.C.” “I am your president of law and order,” Trump added. “As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property.” George Floyd, an African American, died on May 25, after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired Minneapolis Police Department Officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Police were arresting Floyd for allegedly trying to pay with counterfeit $20 bills at a nearby deli. Chauvin is now in custody on charges of murder and manslaughter, but this has not stopped days of growing violence in cities around the country. That incident has also inflamed both peaceful protests and rioting in response to other recent instances of police brutality against African Americans. More than 17,000 National Guard personnel are now deployed across 23 states and Washington, D.C. to support state and local police in responding to developing situations in their jurisdictions. Federal law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Customs and Border Protection , have also become involved. The U.S. military is generally barred from deploying within the United States or performing domestic law enforcement functions, primarily through the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. At the same time, the Insurrection Act of 1807 provides a broad exemption, allowing the President to send troops to respond to “any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” that “opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.” The President may invoke the Insurrection Act without consulting Congress, but must do so through a formal proclamation that gives individuals in the affected area or areas time to disperse and return to their homes. Trump has not done this and there are already reports that, despite his claims, he has not yet dispatched any federal troops within the United States. He is, however, Commander in Chief of the Washington, D.C. National Guard, an authority he exercises through the Secretary of Defense, and he has dispatched those forces to take up positions within the Capital. The city unique status also means that he can, and has, ordered federal troops to deploy there. The Justice Department has also deployed additional federal law enforcement personnel within the city, where it also has substantial jurisdiction. The Insurrection Act has been used very infrequently in the more than two centuries since it was enacted, with President George H.W. Bush being the last to do so in 1992 in response rioting in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted the police officers involved in the brutal beating of Rodney King. Congress also notably expanded the scope of circumstances under which the Act can be invoked in the wake of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This was done despite the objections of every governor in the country at the time, who collectively saw the amendments to the law as a massive overreach by the federal government. Trump has reportedly been considering invoking the Insurrection Act all day. However, despite how he framed his threat, he could face significant challenges in doing so without the cooperation of state governors. The law specifically says “whenever there is an insurrection [as defined by the Act] in any state against its government, the president may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection.” However, it also says the President employ this authority if the domestic violence “hinders the execution of the laws of that state, and of the United States within the state, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that state are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection.” As such, invoking the act unilaterally could be illegal and could well be met by legal challenges from state authorities who may not agree that they have been unable, failed, or refused to protect the rights and privileges of their residents. Whether a lawsuit against the federal government would prevent troops from actually moving into cities across the country, at least initially, is unclear. Trump’s threat follows a tense conference call with governors earlier in the day in which he recommended a variety of heavy-handed tactics to stop both protestors and rioters. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who was also on the call, described American cities as “battlespaces” and called for state and local authorities to “dominate” them, terms typically associated with military operations. Trump could also deploy U.S. military troops to conduct non-law-enforcement related tasks, such as guarding critical infrastructure or providing medical or logistics support, through other statutes, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . Doing so still generally requires requests from federal or state and local civilian agencies first. At the same time, some governors may welcome the additional assistance from the U.S. military. All told, it remains to be seen whether Trump will actually follow through with what could be an unprecedented deployment of American troops on U.S. soil in modern memory, if he is even able to do so at all. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 8:55 PM EST— New York State Attorney General Letitia James has already Tweeted out that it is her position that Trump cannot legally deploy federal troops under the Insurrection Act absent a request from the state’s authorities. She has also said the state will challenge any attempt to do so in court. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 7, 2020",Watch A JAS-39 Gripen Fighter Fire A New Ground Attack Version Of The Sidewinder Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is no missile on this planet that has developed as rich a heritage and as much success as the Sidewinder family of missiles. The type dates back to the dawn of missile technology and has evolved steadily ever since. Now available in the AIM-9X Block II form, that missile is already deep in its lifecycle and gaining exciting new capabilities that you can read all about here . Yet even as new short-range air-to-air missiles like the AIM-9X have eclipsed the prior AIM-9L/M Sidewinder series, there are still throngs of these older Sidewinders in stockpiles around the globe. With that in mind, Germany’s Diehl Defense, which remains an OEM for the AIM-9L/M, came up with the idea of converting these missiles into laser-guided, low-collateral damage, highly precise air-to-ground weapons. It is not the first time the Sidewinder has been eyed for air-to-ground applications. Most notably, the AGM-122 Sidearm variant of the Sidewinder was adapted to take out enemy radar emitters in the close-range anti-radiation missile role. You can read more about this unique weapon in this past piece of ours . There have been other experiments as well and the AIM-9X has an increasingly robust secondary air-to-ground capability. Other countries, most notably Iran, have toyed with AIM-9 design, too. That country recently unveiled an indigenous knock-off anti-tank variant of the Sidewinder. Diehl Adapting existing aerial weapons to home in on a laser designator’s spot is becoming an increasingly popular trend. Laser-guided rockets have allowed combat aircraft to drastically and relatively efficiently increase their air-to-ground magazine depth for light attack and close air support missions. They have also provided a new class of weapon that is extremely precise and capable of making low-collateral damage strikes—two characteristics that are especially attractive for urban combat operations. You can read all about how a pair of modified OV-10 Broncos were turned into ‘man hunters’ while supporting special operations forces oversees, slinging their laser-guided rockets through doorways and windows to extinguish their targets in the dark of night, here . These upgraded rockets have even been tested in an air-to-air role recently . The laser-guided sidewinder follows a similar concept of operations as the laser-guided rocket, but the nice thing is that it has a longer range and a larger warhead compared to a 2.75-inch/70mm Hydra 70-based laser-guided rocket system. Most of all, the missiles themselves are already built and paid for. They mainly need their seekers converted from infrared homing to semi-active laser-guided, as well as new digital interfaces and a control unit. So, think of it as a recycling program of sorts. Also, fighters already cleared to carry the AIM-9 don’t need to carry these adapted air-to-ground weapons in a draggy container that takes up a weapons station as the laser-guided rockets do. Instead, they can fly with the missile on the wingtip or underwing launch rail that is usually used for the standard Sidewinder or some other short-range air-to-air missile. A video, posted by @Gripennews, shows the testing of the laser-guided Sidewinder using a JAS-39 Gripen at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration’s (FMV) test range in Vidsel, Sweden: Test & Eval of #Laser Guided #Sidewinder at Vidsel from Swedish JAS 39 #Gripen in 2018. Video source: FMV pic.twitter.com/LSV954pgMs — Gripen News (@GripenNews) June 1, 2020 The test was to support Germany’s program to arm their Tornado jets with the laser-guided Sidewinder. The program is being run by Diehl and the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw). Three out of three direct hits were scored, with the missiles slamming through their targets. Note, that they were not armed with live warheads for the tests. The Sidewinder’s warhead is based on a 21-pound annular blast design that fragments outward in a ring upon detonation. Germany moved to the far more advanced IRIS-T air-to-air missile well over a decade ago, so they certainly have plenty of extra Sidewinders in their stocks that can be converted to the new air-to-ground configuration. One would assume that the cost of developing the “LaGS” could be offset by offering the conversion to foreign air arms, as well. Tornado ECR. , Alan Wilson/Wikicommons Germany’s Tornado ECRs are currently in the twilight of their careers with the Luftwaffe. As it stands now, a mix of new EF2000 Typhoons and F/A-18 Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers will replace them completely by 2030. In the meantime, Germany, with the help of its Swedish neighbors, has developed and tested its novel Sidewinder adaptation and it will give the aging swing-wing Tornado jets a highly flexible weapon to use as they enter into their last decade of service. The laser-guided missiles could also be used by the Luftwaffe’s future Super Hornets and by their existing and future Typhoons, both of which have been cleared to carry the AIM-9L/M Sidewinder. If the video above is any indication, it will also be a remarkably effective weapon, both in terms of cost and lethality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 2, 2019",White House OKs Rules Giving Troops Along Mexico Border New Authority To Use Lethal Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The White House has reportedly issued a memo that would empower U.S. military personnel along the border with Mexico, along with National Guardsmen operating there under federal authority, to directly engage in law enforcement activities and use lethal force if necessary. The decision to employ the military domestically in this way could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which imposes major restrictions on such activities, but may still be legal through exemptions and other legislation. Military Times ’ Tara Copp was first to report that President Donald Trump’s Administration had actually pursued this course of action, with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said to have signed a “cabinet order” authorizing the plan late on Nov. 20, 2018. CNN and other outlets had previously reported that Trump might issue an executive order to this effect. The order gives “Department of Defense military personnel” the authority to “perform those military protective activities that the Secretary of Defense determines are reasonably necessary” to support Customs and Border Protection’s mission along the United States’ southern border, according to Military Times . These tasks could include “a show or use of force (including lethal force, where necessary), crowd control, temporary detention, and cursory search.” In October 2018, U.S. Northern Command began deploying thousands of personnel from all of the services to provide what is called “Defense Support to Civil Authorities,” or DSCA, along the boundary with Mexico. These missions, which you can read about in more depth here , typically include a host of support functions, including surveillance, construction projects, vehicle maintenance, and static site security. A convoy of vehicles belonging to the US Army’s 87th Engineer Company prepares to move out in Arizona in support of the border support mission in November 2018., US Army The ostensible reason for this new operation, initially nicknamed Faithful Patriot, was to help bolster security on the border in advance of the arrival of a large group of migrants from Central and South America. These individuals, who are fleeing violence and high crime in their home countries, had very publicly stated their intention to make their way to the United States and seek asylum. There is no assurance that those claims would be successful and that they would be allowed to remain in the country. At present, there are approximately 5,900 U.S. military personnel, together with some 2,100 members of the National Guard acting in a federal capacity, conducting DSCA missions on the border. The emplacement of concertina wire along portions of the border, including in areas that already have physical barriers, has been, by far , the most visible of those activities. “Short term, get the obstacles in,” is how Secretary of Defense James Mattis described the goals of the operation during a visit with troops deployed on the border on Nov. 14, 2018. “Longer term…it is somewhat to be determined.” The long-term mission now appears to encompass the authority to conduct actual law enforcement activities, including detaining immigrants who cross illegally and employing potentially lethal force if necessary. U.S. Northern Command does have standing Concept of Operations Plans (CONPLAN) outlining how it conducts DSCA missions and how it would proceed with more active missions. CONPLAN 3501 covers DSCA tasks specifically, but notes the prohibition on troops taking an active law enforcement role “except as otherwise provided.” CONPLAN 3502, Civil Disturbance Operations, sets out the basic parameters for responding to the breakdown of law and order during a major domestic crisis. Relevant portions of CONPLAN 3501 covering support to law enforcement activities., NORTHCOM But this has already created serious legal questions. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which has received multiple amendments since then, expressly forbids the deployment of U.S. military personnel domestically for these purposes, “except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.” The question becomes whether the Trump Administration will invoke the president’s inherent right to defend the national security of the United States as enshrined in the Constitution as justification. This seems very likely, given that Trump himself has claimed that there are terrorists and violent gang members within the group of migrants heading toward the border, though without providing any evidence . Leaked military planning documents for Operation Faithful Patriot said that the likelihood of such threats emerging was low. The president’s administration has also zeroed in on the size of the so-called “caravan,” saying that the migrants’ plans to cross into the United States en masse threatens to undermine the basic integrity of American border controls. Though immigrants have overwhelmed the capacity of certain detention facilities, a result of Trump Administration policies , there is no indication that the latest group of migrants present a unique concern in this regard. Customs and Border Protection officers guard the San Ysidro border crossing during a temporary shutdown on Nov. 19, 2018, to install additional protective measures., CBP The Trump Administration could also invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 , which has also seen subsequent amendments, but which legal precedent indicates offers a standing exemption to the provisions of the Posse Comitatus Act. The latest revision to this law, which came in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and that every governor in the United States at the time opposed , gives the president authority to deploy troops to respond to “any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” that “opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.” Trump , along with the Departments of Homeland Security , Justice , and State have all at times implied that the organization of a caravan with the goal of mass entry into the United States is, in of itself, in some way illegal, though they have not provided a clear justification for those claims. The Trump Administration recently sought to suspend the right for any individual to seek asylum anywhere but a designated border crossing. A federal judge blocked the implementation of that order on Nov. 19, 2018, pending further hearings. The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush authorized the deployment of U.S. Army and Marine personnel to help quell rioting in Los Angeles following the acquittal of police officers involved in the brutal beating of Rodney King. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, then-commander of the Marine’s 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion , was involved in that operation. It seems almost inevitable that opponents of this plan will seek to push back against it in federal court, as they have with regards to other executive actions from the Trump Administration regarding immigration issues. Congress could seek to block the new authorities or otherwise modify the provisions of the Posse Comitatus Act or the Insurrection Act, as well. There is no guarantee that the Department of Defense would seek to make use of the new authorizations, either. The ability to use lethal force, even in self-defense, during domestic operations is, understandably, a sensitive issue within the Pentagon. In 1997, U.S. Marines performing a DSCA counter-drug trafficking surveillance mission shot and killed 18-year old Esequiel Hernández Jr. , a U.S. citizen who was tending to his goats. Believing the teenager, who was armed with a .22 caliber rifle, may have been there illegally, they had asked members of what was then simply the U.S. Border Patrol to come and assess the situation. A map showing where Marines were deployed along the border for counter-drug operations as of July 1996. , USMC While waiting, Hernández reportedly fired his gun in the direction of the Marines, likely to ward off a predator, prompting them to return fire. A Grand Jury decided not to indict any of the four members of the Marine Corps patrol, but the U.S. government did pay out nearly $2 million to settle a resulting civil lawsuit. There have been concerns that similar incidents might occur if the Trump Administration loosens the rules of engagement for military personnel along the border. Trump has already suggested that American security forces could treat migrants throwing rocks as equal threats to individuals with guns, and respond accordingly. The president later backtracked on those comments . “There has been no call for any lethal force from DHS [Department of  Homeland Security],” Mattis told reporters at a Pentagon news conference later on Nov. 21, 2018, clearly trying to downplay these worries. “There is no armed element going in. I will determine it,  based on what DHS asks for and a mission analysis.” “Relax. Don’t worry about it,” he continued. “They’re not even carrying guns for Christ’s sake.” President Donald Trump talks about border security and immigration issues at the White House on Nov. 1, 2018., Chris Kleponis/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images It is possible that this issue may soon become moot. Unless Trump orders an extension to the mission, the military border security operation is set to end entirely on Dec. 15, 2018 . Reports have indicated that commanders are looking to send some units back to their home stations earlier than that, too. The first members of the migrant caravan began to arrive in Tijuana, Mexico ahead of the planned crossing into the United States earlier in November 2018. Some residents in that city, which sits on the border with California, have protested the arrival of the immigrants, saying it burdens their infrastructure and brings the risk of increased crime. Whether or not these individuals ultimately choose to cross the border in large numbers, and what sort of American security response will be waiting for them, remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 4, 2018",Trump Ends Restrictions on Giving Surplus Military Gear to Cops,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has removed a set of restrictions his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had placed on a program that allows the U.S. military to transfer excess equipment to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies , including tracked armored personnel carriers, various kinds of military weaponry , and other gear. The changes are likely to reinvigorate the public debate about the controversial process, also known as the 1033 Program , which continues to be plagued by serious problems. Announced on Aug. 28, 2017, Trump’s new executive order rescinds the earlier one Obama had signed , which led to the prohibition on the Defense Logistics Agency sending tracked armored vehicles, “weaponized” vehicles of any kind, firearms firing rounds .50 caliber or larger, .50 caliber or larger ammunition, grenade launchers, bayonets, and camouflage uniforms, to police units. The order also resulted in additional controls and oversight of other so-called “controlled equipment,” such as vehicles, aircraft, explosives, and specialized firearms and ammunition. These new requirements included asking requesting agencies to more thoroughly justify their requests for the gear and to submit more detailed plans explaining how they would properly train their personnel in its use. “(W)e are fighting a multi-front battle: an increase in violent crime, a rise in vicious gangs, an opioid epidemic, threats from terrorism, combined with a culture in which family and discipline seem to be eroding further and a disturbing disrespect for the rule of law ,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police’s (FOP) national conference on Aug. 28, 2017. “The executive order the President will sign today will ensure that you can get the lifesaving gear that you need to do your job and send a strong message that we will not allow criminal activity, violence and lawlessness to become a new normal.” The program is formally known as DLA’s Law Enforcement Support Office. The “1033” in the more common moniker refers to the specific line in the defense budget for the 1997 fiscal year that first authorized the program. A MaxxPro MRAP belonging to the Willimantic, Connecticut Police Department, which it received through the 1033 Program., AP Between 1989 and 1997, previous mechanisms had existed for the transfer of military equipment, but specifically for counter-drug efforts. The 1033 Program removed that restriction, allowing the Pentagon to transfer items for any approved law enforcement purpose. Many, including various police lobby groups such FOP, had expected this change after Trump won the 2016 presidential election. FOP endorsed Trump after, among other things, he promised to reverse Obama’s decision on the 1033 Program. The organization was quick to laud the policy shift in an official statement. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_BwSQWrT2V0 “The previous Administration was more concerned with the image of law enforcement being too ‘militarized’ than they were about our [police officers] safety,” FOP’s National President Chuck Canterbury said in a statement. “In an effort to shut down a single program run by the Defense Department, known as the 1033 program, they restricted access to surplus equipment across the federal government.” It is important to note that the Obama administration did not shut down the 1033 program and its restrictions had no direct impact on any other mechanism to transfer military equipment within the federal government. FOP’s statement also does not mention the protests in Ferguson, Missouri in late 2014, or the police response, which led directly to the decision to implement the new rules. A police marksman sits on top of a Bearcat armored vehicle during the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014., AP The images from those protests, some of which showed police in heavy riot gear atop armored vehicles pointing rifles at unarmed individuals, that sparked a public outcry and a call for increased scrutiny of federal processes such as the 1033 Program. Various media investigations, including numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, highlighted the sheer scope and volume of the transfers, which ranged from the potentially worrisome to the bizarre. Investigative journalism collective Muckrock, which crowdsources FOIA requests, eventually published full lists of the equipment deliveries it had obtained from DLA, which you can find here . DLA itself began releasing additional information proactively. Those tables, which showed transfers of armored vehicles, aircraft, weapons, and more to law enforcement entities ranging from state police to offices on college campuses and school districts, as well as the responses to other requests for new information prompted demands for investigations into how the program was vetting requests. According to DLA’s website , between 1997 and 2016, the agency facilitated the transfer of more than $6 billion in surplus military equipment, ranging from everything from mine-resistant trucks and rifles to musical instruments and sporting equipment – no, really . In 2014 alone, law enforcement agencies got nearly $1 billion in gear. The Yuma County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona got Tommy the horse through the 1033 Program., via DLA The main argument against the Obama restrictions, as espoused by FOP and other law enforcement advocacy and lobby organizations, was that they prevented the transfer of potentially life-saving equipment to police departments and other law enforcement groups that would be unable to otherwise afford it. Military-style vehicles in particular might better protect officers in extreme emergencies. In its report, The Associated Press noted that an armored truck had played an important role in response to a domestic terror attack in San Bernadino, California in December 2015. “It’s an important program,” Representative Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican, said in July 2017, according to The Washington Times . “I happen to know a sheriff’s deputy fairly well that stepped out of a Bear Cat [armored truck], and as he stepped out of it, a buckshot hit the window, and had he been in a normal squad car, he wouldn’t be with us today.” An FBI Bearcat armored vehicle blocks a road during the Malheur Wildlife Refuge standoff in 2016., AP The counter-argument is that military-style equipment distance police departments, who are supposed to protect and serve, from the communities they work in and make them increasingly inclined to use extreme force. Critics of things like the 1033 program say there is evidence that once law enforcement agencies have something, they’re more likely to find opportunities to use it. If it’s a weapon or an armored vehicle, they’d less likely to choose options that might de-escalate a situation and prevent the need for a violent resolution. “We’ve seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there’s an occupying force as opposed to a force that’s part of the community that’s protecting them and serving them,” Obama himself said in a speech in May 2015. “It can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message.” The change in the restrictions seems unlikely, however, to get at the real and continuing problems of how DLA vets requesters and assesses their needs. These issues continue to be more worrisome than the exact type of equipment it doles out to police, much of which seems to have been handed over with little oversight on either end. A MaxxPro MPAP that the Florence County North Carolina Sheriff’s Department obtained via the 1033 Program., Florence County Sheriff’s Department “That was one of those things in the old days you got it because you thought it was cool,” Lynwood Yates, police chief in the town of Morven, Georgia, had told The Associated Press back in 2013 about his decision to request bayonets through the 1033 Program. “Then, after you get it, you’re like, ‘What the hell am I going to do with this?’” I discovered a similar situation when I tracked down how Black River Technical College, a small technical college in Arkansas with approximately 2,500 students, had gotten its hands on an ex-U.S. Army C-23 Sherpa light utility aircraft through the process in 2014. The school has a law enforcement academy that includes an aviation program. Steve Shults, the director of Black River’s Law Enforcement Training Academy, wrote a memo less than 100 words long asking for the plane. According to DLA’s records, he only sent that letter in six months after the C-23 touched down a Black River. One of the C-23s DLA subsequently transferred to a federal, state, or local agency., US Army Another two C-23s went to South Carolina’s Richland County Sheriff’s Department, after which they were improperly exchanged with a private aviation firm for two other aircraft, touching off a serious legal dispute with the federal government in 2015. Technically, the items DLA distributes under the 1033 Program remain U.S. military property that it can ask for back at any time. Even after the new restrictions went into effect, there were still serious concerns about how DLA manages the program. In July 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a damning report explaining how it had set up an entirely fake law enforcement agency and obtained approximately $1.2 million in controlled items, including night-vision goggles and simulated rifles and explosives. Some of the items GAO’s investigators obtained via the 1033 Program while posing as cops., GAO “DLA personnel [are] not routinely requesting and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer,” the congressional watchdog found. “Further, GAO found that DLA has not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO [Law Enforcement Support Office] program, including the application process.” The Pentagon concurred with all of GAO’s recommendations, which called for strengthening controls and accounting processes related to the 1033 Program. DLA estimated it would complete a full fraud risk assessment and implement a strategy to mitigate any problems it identifies by April 1, 2018. The agency also said it had already put into place new procedures for reviewing law enforcement agencies and their requests. These new assurances are unlikely to sway critics of the 1033 Program given that DLA already had a mandate to improve these controls for over a year. The ranking Democrat on the House Armed services Committee, Adam Smith from Washington State, along with a colleague, Madeleine Bordallo, a Democrat representing Guam, had already called for a suspension of controlled equipment transfers after the GAO’s report. It seems likely that Trump’s executive order with spur even more debate in Congress over the future of the 1033 Program. In the meantime, the more than 8,000 law enforcement agencies enrolled will once again be able to ask for tracked vehicles, bayonets, and grenade launchers.

According to McGreevy, who goes by the handle @Ohwhiss on Instagram , the flight was part of a relatively unprecedented sortie by the 146th Airlift Wing based at Channel Islands Air National Guard Station, which is connected to Naval Air Station Point Magu . The flight was apparently part of a ‘fini-flight,’ which is a rite of passage for a pilot that is retiring from military service. The mission, which included six C-130Js, flew out over the Channel Islands, which are the namesake of the unit’s home base, and then flew inland to northern California, near Lake Tahoe, before returning back to Point Mugu. McGreevy hiked up a steep trail to get the awesome shots you are about to see. Note that the orange paint on a couple of the ‘Herky Birds’ denotes their use for firefighting duty with the MAFFS system.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a scrubbed attempt on May 27th, SpaceX’s Demo-2 mission has successfully put two American astronauts, Robert Behnken, 49, and Douglas Hurley, 53, into orbit. It marks the first time in nearly a decade that America hasn’t relied on Russia to ferry its personnel to and from the International Space Station (ISS). That came with a hefty price tag from Moscow, costing roughly $86M per seat using evolved variants of the Soyuz system that dates back many decades. SpaceX’s much newer partially reusable Falcon9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule combination is more than competitive in price even though it is so young. The rocket began its ascent at 3:22 pm local time at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Next, it will have to dock with the Harmony module on the ISS. Both astronauts will stay onboard the station for weeks before returning back to earth in the Crew Dragon capsule. As such, this is a relatively long test mission, with each major evolution having its own risks and challenges. The collective joy of a successful launch could not have come at a more needed time as the United States grapples with a global pandemic and outrage over the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police Officer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 5, 2020",Customs And Border Protection Reaper Drone Appears Over Minneapolis Protests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection Predator B drone , also known as the Reaper, is presently orbiting around Minneapolis, Minnesota. The city has been in the grips increasingly violent protests in recent days over the killing of resident George Floyd while he was being arrested by members of the Minneapolis Police Department earlier this week. George Floyd, an African American, died on May 25, 2020, after Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on his neck for at least seven minutes. Police were in the process of arresting Floyd over his alleged attempt to use counterfeit $20 bills at a nearby deli. Chauvin was subsequently fired and has now been taken into custody on charges of murder . This incident has touched off protests against racially motivated policing, as well as rioting, in various cities across the country and has further inflamed tensions arising from similar incidents elsewhere . The violence in Minneapolis has become especially pronounced, with one group notably setting fire to the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct building last night after officers evacuated. Journalists and plane spotters using online flight tracking software first noticed the drone flying in a hexagonal route around the city at around 20,000 feet on May 29, 2020. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has around eight Predator Bs in various configurations, all of which are unarmed. This agency had acquired 10 of these unmanned aircraft by 2012, but lost one in an accident over the Pacific Ocean in 2014 and another in a crash at Grand Forks Air Force Base just earlier this month. The Predator B, which drone maker General Atomics makes, is part of a family of unmanned aircraft that also includes the U.S. Air Force’s MQ-9 Reapers . The drone’s callsign, CBP 104, identifies it as one of CBP’s older Predator B types, which are configured for overland surveillance. The primary sensors on these drones are electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras in a turret under the nose, though they can also capture still imagery using the Lynx synthetic aperture radar. They also have data links capable of sending this video and imagery back to control stations on the ground in near real-time. A briefing slide from 2012 describing the capabilities of CBP 104 and the other five Predator Bs that agency operates in this overland surveillance configuration. CBP also has three more Predator Bs in other configurations., CBP Other avialable data indicates that this particular unmanned aircraft is operating from Grand Forks Air Force Base. CBP Predator Bs typically fly from this base to conduct patrols along the U.S.-Canadian border. Another slide from the 2012 CBP briefing describing the Predator B mission in the United States and the Caribbean Sea and mentioning the use of Grand Forks Air Force Base as an operations center for flights along the US-Canadian border., CBO The unmanned aircraft’s ability to stay in the area for up to 21 hours at a time would make it an ideal asset for persistently monitoring the protests and rioting across Minneapolis. It could help law enforcement personnel best focus their resources in response to developments they might not otherwise be able to see and to generally document the situation as it continues to evolve. The exact authority that CBP is operating under in order to support state and local officials is unclear. The agency does have controversial authority to conduct various activities within the United States inside a 100-mile-deep buffer area along the country’s borders, but Minneapolis is outside that defined area. A 2013 edition of the National Guard Bureau’s Incident Awareness and Assessment Handbook, which covers manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft across the U.S. government that could be made available during various domestic contingencies, does not specifically touch on general domestic unrest. However, this document, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, does list CBP’s Predator B as assets that could be called upon to help in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters, as well as terrorist attacks. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has already activated the state’s National Guard to help with the response to the situation in Minneapolis. The entry on the Predator B from the 2013 edition of the National Guard Bureau’s Incident Awareness and Assessment Handbook., National Guard Bureau via FOIA National Guard Bureau via FOIA Regardless, this would not be the first time aerial surveillance assets have been employed in response to protests and rioting in the United States, though. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation notably employed manned aircraft to conduct persistent surveillance missions over Baltimore, Maryland during the protests in the wake of the police killing of Freddie Gray . The Maryland Army National Guard also made RQ-7B Shadow unmanned aircraft available as part of its support to state and local authorities in response to that situation, dubbed Operation Baltimore Rally, though it’s unclear if they were employed to monitor the protests. The author previously obtained this information via the Freedom of Information Act. National Guard aviation assets may be available again for use over Minneapolis now. A low-quality scan of a briefing slide showing Maryland Army National Guard aviation assets available to support Operation Baltimore Rally as of March 4, 2015., National Guard Bureau via FOIA The use of persistent aerial surveillance for law enforcement purposes has long been a controversial topic. Civil liberties advocates say these and other mass surveillance activities violate rights to personal privacy and undermine constitutional protections against unlawful searches . CBP’s deployment of one of its Predator Bs over Minneapolis is almost certain to further fuel that debate. Depending on how the situation in the city, as well as other locations across the country that are now experiencing protests and rioting in response to the killing of George Floyd, we may well see other aerial surveillance assets employed, as well. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 4:20 PM EST— The Predator B appears to have left the area after being overhead for a little over an hour. Also, the original version of this article stated that Minneapolis was outside of CBP’s 100-mile-wide border buffer area. Other reports have said that, based on how the distance from an “external boundary” is measured , it is actually within that zone. This story has been updated to reflect this incongruity. Update: 5:20 PM EST— CBP 104 has now moved to an area much closer to the Canadian border, where it appears to be conducting a more routine surveillance mission. Update: 6:45 PM EST— It now seems conclusive that Minneapolis is indeed outside CBP’s 100-mile-wide buffer area, regardless of how the distance is measured and this story has been updated again to reflect that. Update: 10:15 PM EST— CBP has given a statement to Law & Crime confirming that the Predator B was sent to support the response to the protests in Minneapolis at the request of an unspecified federal law enforcement agency. The same agency subsequently decided the drone was no longer necessary, after which it departed the area and returned to Grank Forks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",B-1B Bombers Fly With Ukrainian Flankers and MiGs Over The Black Sea For First Time Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a scene that was probably unthinkable when the B-1B first entered service in the 1980s, a pair of the bombers flew together with Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets for the first time ever during a training mission over the Black Sea earlier today. Polish MiG-29s and Romanian MiG-21 Lancers , as well as F-16 Vipers from both of those countries, also escorted the bombers during their long-range flight all the way to and from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The two bombers from the 28th Bomb Wing conducted the so-called Bomber Task Force mission over the Black Sea region on May 29, 2020. The Air Force’s B-1B fleet, as a whole, has recently stepped up this kind of long-range training in both Europe and the Pacific region as part of a concept larger called Dynamic Force Employment, which aims to make these kinds of activities less predictable and more flexible to better deter potential adversaries and reassure regional allies and partners. The dramatic increase in these missions, which are now occurring on a routine, if irregularly scheduled basis, follows a seemingly abrupt end of routine bomber deployments to the island of Guam in the Pacific as part of the Continuous Bomber Presence mission, which The War Zone was first to report . “Bomber Task Force missions to Europe demonstrate [a] commitment to our allies and partners all while providing a clear deterrence message to any adversary,” Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, the service’s top command in that region, said in a statement following this latest long-distance bomber mission. “The integration of our strategic bomber presence across Europe proves that the U.S., alongside any ally or partner, stands ready to deter, and if needed, can employ these capabilities together.” A Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet, in the foreground, flies with a pair of B-1B bombers over the Black Sea region., Ukrainian Ministry of Defense A pair of Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrums and an Su-27 Flanker fly behind the B-1Bs., Ukrainian Ministry of Defense “The Bomber Task Force missions demonstrate to our NATO Allies, including our newest member – North Macedonia – that these strategic missions enhance the readiness and training necessary to respond to any potential crisis or challenge around the globe,” Air Force General Tod Wolters, head of U.S. European Command, which oversees all U.S. military operations in the region. “The integration and interoperability with our NATO Allies during these missions, be it aerial tanker support or fighter escorts, are indelible actions that show the Alliance is as strong as I’ve ever witnessed.” Three Polish F-16C/D Vipers, the foreground, and a pair of MiG-29s, in the background, fly in formation with the B-1B bombers., USAF USAF Romanian MiG-21 Lancers fly with the B-1Bs., USAF A Romanian F-16C Viper flies with the B-1Bs., USAF The aerial refueling tanker support that General Wolters mentioned was critical to the long-range mission. Air Force KC-135R tankers flying from both RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom and Incirlik Air Base in Turkey helped the B-1Bs get to and from the Black Sea. In another first, a Turkish KC-135R also refueled the bombers. Other unspecified NATO aerial refueling tankers provided fuel to the escorting fighters at various points, as well, according to the Air Force. A Turkish KC-135R tanker., Alan Wilson via Wikimedia This particular Bomber Task Force mission was certainly an impressive display of the ability of NATO air arms to work together and a reflection of how they might operate as a coalition during a real crisis or other contingency. The inclusion of a Turkish Air Force tanker is notable in of itself given how cool relations are between Washington and Ankara, as well as between the Turkish government and the rest of NATO, are at present over a host of issues . Conducting the flight over the Black Sea, especially together with fighters from Ukraine, which is not a member of the North Atlantic Alliance, is also a particularly strong signal to Russia. The Black Sea region has been the scene of significant friction in the air and at sea between the American and Russian militaries since the Kremlin illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and subsequently began directly supporting separatists in that country’s eastern Donbass region . U.S. military flights around the Crimean peninsula have been a major point of contention . Last year, a B-52 bomber notably made a run straight at it during another long-range bomber training mission. The U.S. government has also shown an increased willingness to approve sales of advanced, lethal military hardware to Ukraine, most importantly Javelin anti-tank missiles , under President Donald Trump’s Administration. The American military continues to engage regularly with its Ukrainian counterparts , too. This Bomber Task Force flight over the Black Sea also comes just over a week after B-1Bs flew a similar mission over and around the Baltic Sea region, another common point of tension between the United States and Russia. That mission also took the bombers over Sweden , another non-NATO ally that has moved closer to the Alliance in recent years, for the first time ever. Swedish Gripen fighter jets , as well as Norwegian F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , escorted the American aircraft in that instance. A quartet of Swedish Gripen fighter jets, at right, flies with a pair of B-1B bombers on May 20, 2020., USAF Four Norwegian F-35 Joint Strike Fighters fly in formation with the B-1B bombers during their long-range training mission on May 20, 2020., USAF Video has since emerged of a Russian Flanker intercepting a B-1B recently over the Baltic. It’s not clear if this interaction took place during the Bomber Task Force Mission in that region last week or if it occurred as the bombers were heading to or from the Black Sea region today. On May 22, another B-1B made an unprecedented flight into the Sea Of Okhotsk in the Pacific region, a body of water surrounded by Russian territory on three sides where American military aircraft generally don’t venture. This is yet another example of how the U.S. military has been employing bombers, together with the new Dynamic Force Employment model, to challenge potential adversaries. All told, the use of long-range B-1B bomber sorties as part of the Dynamic Force Employment concept has gotten much more attention for the signals it has been sending to China , as well as Russia , in the Pacific in the past month or so since the end of the Continuous Bomber Presence mission on Guam. These latest sorties to the Black Sea make clear that the U.S. military is intent on using these missions to show its resolve in potential hotspots around Europe, as well. Update: 3:55 PM EST— The Russian Ministry of Defense has now said that its Su-27P and Su-30SM Flanker fighter jets intercepted the B-1Bs in international airspace over both the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea during the May 29 Bomber Task Force Mission. It’s unclear if the video footage it released it from the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea intercepts.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 27, 2020",Taiwan Wants Land-Based Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles To Counter Growing Chinese Naval Power,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwanese authorities say that they are looking to buy ground-launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles and mobile launchers to augment the island’s coastal defenses. This announcement follows reports that China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy might be gearing up for a first-ever naval exercise featuring both of its aircraft carriers . Chinese naval forces have been steadily and significantly growing in recent years, in general, which has already prompted the Taiwanese military to seek a variety of new and improved anti-ship capabilities . Taiwanese Deputy Defense Minister Chang Che Ping informed lawmakers on the island about the plans to acquire the land-based Harpoons during a committee meeting on May 28, 2020. Reports had first begun to emerge earlier this month that the Taiwanese military could be looking to buy these missiles. Chang did not say what type of Harpoons the Taiwanese military was looking to buy for the coastal defense role. Previous reports had indicated that the missiles would likely be Block II variants. Taiwan’s Air Force already has air-launched Block II AGM-84L Harpoons , while its Navy has submarine-launched UGM-84Ls . The Air Force also has older air-launched AGM-84 variants, while the Navy’s Kee Lung class destroyers and Chi Yang class frigates , ex-U.S. Navy Kidd and Knox class ships, respectively, both have the ability to fire older surface-launched RGM-84 variants. A Taiwanese Air Force F-16A/B Viper fighter jet carrying, among other weapons, two AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles. , Chiang Ying-ying/AP It’s not clear what vehicle the Taiwanese military expects to use as the mobile launch platform, either. Chang did say that part of the reason there is a desire to acquire the ground-launched Harpoons, despite having land-based versions of the indigenously developed Hsiung Feng II and III anti-ship missiles , was that the American weapons would offer greater mobility. The coastal defense versions of the Hsiung Feng II and III employ a tractor-trailer-mounted launcher. The tractor is derived from a commercial truck design and the entire system would certainly have quite limited off-road mobility. A Taiwanese Navy truck-mounted launch capable of firing both the Hsiung Feng II and III anti-ship missiles., 玄史生 via Wikimedia It’s worth noting that the Danish military, the only one to date to field a coastal defense version of the Harpoon, seen in the video below, also used a commercial derivative truck design as the launch platform. The Danes retired those systems in 2003. However, a land-based Harpoon launcher mounted on a vehicle such as an Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), a U.S.-made heavy tactical truck that the Taiwanese Army already operates and has employed as the base for a rocket artillery system in the past, would give the weapons added flexibility. This would be especially valuable in the event that established road networks become unavailable during a major attack from the mainland. Being able to rapidly relocate the launchers, even to more austere areas, would also make it easier to reposition them in response to new developments, something that could easily happen given China’s ability to attack the island from all directions, as well as help shield them from counterattacks. An early version of Taiwan’s Thunderbolt-2000 rocket artillery system, which used a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) chassis., via thinkdefence.co.uk Still, it’s not entirely clear why Taiwan would not just pursue an improved launch vehicle for its Hsiung Feng IIs and IIIs, especially given the fact that the latter of these weapons is supersonic. The Harpoon, even in its most advanced variations, is a subsonic missile. Still, as noted, Harpoon is already in Taiwanese service. It is also a combat-proven weapon that the manufacturer, Boeing, still actively supports and is in use with dozens of other operators around the world, including the United States . Boeing also continues to develop upgraded versions with additional capabilities, such as the newer Block II+ variants . These feature an improved GPS receiver and flight control system that allows for more precise navigation to the general target area, after which the missile’s active radar seeker takes over. That seeker means it can find its target even in poor weather and at night, too. These updated weapons have a two-way data-link that allows it to be retargeted while in flight, as well. You can read more about the Block II+ and other Harpoon developments in this past War Zone piece . Acquiring additional land-based coastal defenses would certainly be in line with other anti-ship efforts it is pursuing already. Last year, authorities on the island announced that the next batch of Min Chiang class stealthy catamaran corvettes for the Taiwanese Navy would have configured with a heavy emphasis on naval mine-laying. That service is also set to receive a new class of dedicated high-speed minelayers . The Taiwanese military certainly has a general need for anti-ship capabilities, given the expanding size and strength of the Chinese Navy. Deputy Defense Minister Chang’s confirmation of the Harpoon plans notably comes as China’s two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong , are reportedly training with other ships and aircraft in the Yellow Sea ahead of their next deployments. Satellite imagery has confirmed that Shandong is indeed in the Yellow Sea. There are also reports that Shandong will head to the South China Sea for exercises after these preparations. There is a possibility that Liaoning could follow. Both ships could pass through the Taiwan Strait on their way south, which would certainly be a signal to the government on Taiwan. A dual-carrier drill, something that requires a significant amount of resources to conduct and that China has never done before, would send its own clear message about the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s capabilities to potential adversaries, including the United States, far and wide. All of this also comes as friction between authorities in Beijing and those in Tapei has spiked following the inauguration of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen last week. Tsai won her second term earlier this year and has announced plans to further distance the island from Beijing. The People’s Republic of China sees Taiwan as integral to its national territory and threatens regularly to use military force to prevent it from declaring full independence. The United States, Taiwan’s principal ally, does not officially recognize the government in Taipei, but has pledged to continue to work with it and help provide for its defense, including through arms sales, until there is a formal final agreement between it and Beijing over the island’s status. Tsai, who first took office shortly before U.S. President Donald Trump, has cultivated a close relationship with the current American Administration and has already secured unprecedented arms deals , including the purchase of new Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets . Deputy Defense Minister Chang told Taiwanese legislators that, if the U.S. approves the sale and does so quickly, the country could start receiving new land-based Harpoons in 2023. Given Tsai’s ties with the Trump Administration, combined with support from pro-Taiwan members of Congress, all of who could be motivated by the current state of affairs between Beijing and Taipei, it’s possible that the process could get expedited.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 28, 2021",Stealth Missile Marks On F-15Es All But Prove They Dealt Final Blow To Al Baghdadi’s Compound,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A dozen F-15E Strike Eagles belonging to the 389th Fighter Squadron, the Thunderbolts, based at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho are heading home from their rotational deployment to Jordan, stopping over at RAF Lakenheath in England on the way. For over half a year they have been supporting coalition operations over Iraq and Syria, and the combat the jets and their crews saw while executing those missions have manifested themselves via weapons markings on the aircraft’s nose area. Two of the jets that landed at Lakenheath had silhouettes of stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) among the numerous other bomb symbols. We only know of two times that JASSMs have been employed in combat. The first was during coalition cruise missile strikes on Syria in 2018. In that case, the B-1B was the delivery system. The other time these weapons were used in anger was as part of the raid that killed supreme scumbag and ISIS founder Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, which took place soon after the Thunderbolt jets arrived in Jordan last October. Shortly after the raid, we surmised that the delivery platforms for the JASSM strike were F-15Es out of Jordan. These images appear to largely confirm that. Aviation Photographer Kevin Bell was at RAF Lakenheath to catch the Thunderbolts making the pit stop on their way back to Idaho on May 27th, 2020. After photographing the jets, he noticed the special mission marks on two of them, tail numbers 87-0173 and 87-0170. The JASSM marking is just above the Air Force roundel, which is partially obscured by the F-15’s maneuvering air intake. , Kevin Bell You can see the two JASSM markings more predominantly on this jet, which sit above a remarkable number of bomb silhouettes. , Kevin Bell A close up of both jet’s nose art and weapons markings. , Kevin Bell The jets also had some pretty unique nose art painted on them, a practice that has become something of a rite of passage for Strike Eagle personnel that deploy to Jordan. The F-15E itself has become a staple at Jordan’s Muwaffaq Salti Air Base , having exclusively served as America’s go-to multi-role fighter with quick access to southern Syria and western Iraq while continuously deployed there. As such, they have taken part in some of the most crucial missions in the region , including the Al Baghdadi raid and multiple sorties defending the forward operating base used by American forces and its Syrian allies at At Tanf. When it comes to the Al Baghdadi mission, the F-15Es provided yet another layer of destructive force applied to the compound that housed him and goons, wiping it from the face of the earth so that it couldn’t become a shrine to the unique form of depraved hatred he built his ill-fated caliphate on. A test launch of a JASSM from an F-15E. , USAF The use of stealthy cruise missiles seemed like an odd weaponeering choice at the time the raid was announced, but as we have constantly stated over the years, American manned fixed-wing tactical aircraft do not often venture into western Syria due to the convoluted situation with Russia, Syria, and now Turkey, all using the airspace for their own various goals. Russia’s S-400 missile batteries at its air base south of Latakia are also a key reason for manned assets to avoid the area. U.S. drones, on the other hand, orbit over the area regularly. Other factors also likely played into the choice to use the stealthy cruise missiles, such as bomb damage assessments from initial strikes. If the compound was not destroyed to a satisfactory degree, it may have prompted the order for the Strike Eagles to launch the missiles sometime after American forces had cleared out of the area safely. Why risk more aircraft when you don’t have to, especially when so much attention was now focused on that area? Moreover, all the other assets that would be required for a direct bombing mission, including search and rescue and airborne early warning and control aircraft, and much more, would not be needed for a standoff follow-on missile strike. The use of JASSM would also provide more data for what is still a young and hugely promising missile system that had just seen its first combat use during the coalition missile strikes Syrian sites a year and a half prior. We summed up many of these thoughts in our original coverage that followed the raid . JASSM during a test. , USAF Regardless, that makes these F-15Es, some of the oldest in the fleet, somewhat historic aircraft. Even the names on the jets that go along with their nose art—”Checkmate” and “Boogeyman”—could be a cryptic reference to the Al Baghdadi mission. With all that in mind, with these images, it is all but outright officially confirmed that F-15Es did indeed execute the JASSM strikes on Al Baghdadi’s compound.

Still, the fact that there were indeed MiG-29s at the base just a couple of days prior to a MiG-29 mysteriously appearing in Libya is strong evidence that suggests these were the jets, especially because they don’t show up in any satellite images just before or after the May 18th image. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Over the weekend, The War Zone also reviewed recent satellite imagery of every air base in Libya capable of hosting the MiG-29s aside from two that were unlikely candidates in the first place. We also ordered an up-to-date image of Al Jufrah Air Base where the MiG-29 was spotted just days earlier. We saw no sign of any MiG-29s at the base or any other, nor any unusual logistical operations, but that doesn’t mean the jets weren’t there. They would likely be stored in hardened aircraft shelters, even if the shelters are damaged like so many are in Libya, as Turkey’s drone war on behalf of the sitting government in Tripoli has taken a major toll on strong man Khalifa Haftar’s forces. Fourth-generation fighters deployed by a major power to the country to better support his forces and to quell Turkey’s drone onslaught against them would be a major target for that same drone force. In other words, a MiG-29 is not something you want to leave out in the open where it would be vulnerable to overhead attack. They are also imminently identifiable as foreign as Libya never flew the type. Last week, reports emerged that said MiG-29s were in Libya and that the aircraft had arrived alongside heavy transports. In addition, the sitting government in Tripoli’s Foreign Minister claimed that they came from Russia via Syria. Still, these were unverified reports—that is until we saw the satellite image of the MiG-29 at Al Jufrah Air Base. One very odd part about the original claim is that there hadn’t been MiG-29s deployed to Russia’s Syrian air base in well over two years . In fact, the type has largely left front-line Russian Air Force service overall. Thomas Newdick , Editor of Air Forces Monthly magazine, gave The War Zone an idea of the current state of the MiG-29 in Russian service: ‘Currently, the Russian Aerospace Forces’ MiG-29 fleet is in a fairly parlous state. In fact, the type survives with only one frontline unit, and that’s based outside of Russian territory, at Erebuni in Armenia. Otherwise, the type is limited to service with training and test units – plus the Strizhi display team – and the type has never been subject to a mid-life upgrade. Instead, resources have focused on the Sukhoi Flanker family of heavyweight fighters; first through upgrade and then through new acquisitions. For a period, Russia operated more capable MiG-29SMT jets, kicked off when a squadron of these jets were rejected by an export customer, Algeria. The advanced SMTs served with the prestigious 14th Fighter Aviation Regiment at Kursk, but were then withdrawn in 2018 – after being deployed for a brief cameo in the Russian campaign in Syria. They were replaced by Su-30SM multirole fighters. Future prospects for the land-based Fulcrum in Russia don’t look great – only six examples of the all-new MiG-35 have been purchased to date, despite official hopes for a significant order. It’s expected these will be delivered before the end of this year – perhaps to the Strizhi display team.” The MiG-29SMT features a number of upgrades, including more fuel in its enlarged dorsal spine and an aerial refueling probe, among other systems upgrades. It can also carry external fuel tanks. , Carlos Menendez San Juan/wikicommons So, if Russia has decided to make the unprecedented move to drastically increase support for Khalifa Haftar’s forces by deploying relatively advanced fighters to Libya, the MiG-29 really isn’t Moscow’s most obvious choice. On the other hand, if the idea is to do this indirectly, via some sort of shadow force—” little green jets” if you will—Russia has plenty of surplus Fulcrums available to send to Libya. If this is the case, or if Russia just decided to formally commit the largely retired type to the cause, the question would be how did they get there? Outside of the small stable of MiG-29SMTs that Russia has, and its navalized MiG-29KRs and a few MiG-35s in testing, Russia’s Fulcrums don’t have aerial refueling capability. It is nearly 1,300 miles between Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria and Al Jufrah Air Base in Libya via a straight line. It seems that an actual real-world route would have been on the extreme periphery, if not squarely outside of a Russian Air Force Fulcrum’s organic ferry range—aside from the MiG-29SMT. So, either those jets stopped somewhere for gas along the way or they were somehow able to make that long journey without refueling or an advanced aerial refueling capable type is now deployed to Libya. A direct line between Russia’s air base in Syria and Al Jufrah Air Base is nearly 1,300 miles. , Google Earth Is it possible that this is some sort of bizarre coincidence and the Fulcrum spotted in Libya belongs to someone else? Yes, but the dates lining up just right and the relatively uncommon type being in the exact place—Russia’s air base in Syria—at just the right time would seem quite unlikely. If that is the case, then what MiG-29s were at the base in Syria last week and why were they there? It is possible that Syria’s own beat-up Fulcrum fleet may have paid Russia’s base a visit, but that would have been a rare move. Maybe Russia was delivering a fresh batch of surplus MiG-29s to the Syrians, but once again, this would be a very odd coincidence and there are no reports of Moscow doing so. A combat test of one of Russia’s newer MiG-29 derivatives is another possibility, but that also seems like a reach considering the timing of the Libyan mystery. Still, it is possible. Could it be that the aircraft came from another country and stopped in Syria for training before heading to Libya? That is highly doubtful and also unprecedented. So, yes, it is possible that this is some strange coincidence and maybe the aircraft migrated into Libya from another place regardless of if Russia has a hand in it or not, but this imagery makes that far less plausible than before. Russian MiG-29., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikicommons If Russia did indeed send MiGs and presumably aircrews to Libya to help realize Haftar’s stalled dream of gaining a hold over all of his country, it would be a huge escalation on their part. Yet we have seen this before. When things got dicey for another strongman who is friendly with Moscow and whose country is strategically placed in an area of great interest to Russia, the Kremlin stepped in with its airpower to help turn the tide. It has been brutally effective in Syria, so why not Libya? Meanwhile, it seems that a quartet of Su-24s may have been identified in Libya, as well, and they are also likely of Russian origin. This time they are located in the northeastern portion of the country at Al Khadim Air Base, a key forward-deployed airpower location for foreign powers that are actively backing Haftar. In the past, this has been limited to lower-end close air support and reconnaissance aircraft, so the potential arrival of Russian Su-24s is a huge deal. Also, positioning the Su-24s to the east makes sense as they have a substantially greater combat radius than the MiG-29 and can reach out into the western part of the country with relative ease. Note, the temporary hangars seen in the image above are 80 feet deep. The Su-24 is 74 feet long. Libyan MiG-23s are still being used in the civil war. Those aircraft are 55 feet long. It is fairly likely given those dimensions that we are indeed seeing Su-24s here. The grey paint scheme matches the one used by the Russian Air Force. Russian Su-24MR Fencer. , Papas Do/Wikicommons If indeed Russia in flowing high-performance tactical airpower into Libya, as all this evidence appears to suggest, it would signify a huge leap in the internationalization of the Libyan conflict and the potential for it to become far more volatile. Russia’s powerplay would also make sense as Haftar’s forces have stated that they are going to launch an unprecedented air war against the Government of National Accord’s forces. When this was originally proclaimed, it seemed puzzling. How could they do this with their existing airpower resources? The addition of MiG-29s and Su-24s from Russia would definitely answer that question. It also raises two key new questions, as well: If Russia has deployed these aircraft to Libya, what other military hardware will arrive next and what will the backers of Haftar’s enemy, namely Turkey, do in response? UPDATE: Just hours after we published this report, U.S. Africa Command has confirmed that Russian tactical aircraft have been deployed to Libya. Here is their official release: U.S. Africa Command assesses that Moscow recently deployed military fighter aircraft to Libya in order to support Russian state-sponsored private military contractors (PMCs) operating on the ground there. Russian military aircraft are likely to provide close air support and offensive fires for the Wagner Group PMC that is supporting the Libyan National Army’s (LNA) fight against the internationally recognized Government of National Accord. The Russian fighter aircraft arrived in Libya, from an airbase in Russia, after transiting Syria where it is assessed they were repainted to camouflage their Russian origin. “Russia is clearly trying to tip the scales in its favor in Libya. Just like I saw them doing in Syria, they are expanding their military footprint in Africa using government-supported mercenary groups like Wagner,” said U.S. Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander, U.S. Africa Command. “For too long, Russia has denied the full extent of its involvement in the ongoing Libyan conflict. Well, there is no denying it now. We watched as Russia flew fourth generation jet fighters to Libya — every step of the way. Neither the LNA nor private military companies can arm, operate and sustain these fighters without state support — support they are getting from Russia.” Russia has employed state-sponsored Wagner in Libya to conceal its direct role and to afford Moscow plausible deniability of its malign actions. U.S. Africa Command assesses Moscow’s military actions have prolonged the Libyan conflict and exacerbated casualties and human suffering on both sides. “The world heard Mr. Haftar declare he was about to unleash a new air campaign. That will be Russian mercenary pilots flying Russian-supplied aircraft to bomb Libyans,” Townsend said. U.S. Africa Command assesses that Russia is not interested in what is best for the Libyan people but are working to achieve their own strategic goals instead. “If Russia seizes basing on Libya’s coast, the next logical step is they deploy permanent long-range anti-access area denial (A2AD) capabilities,” said U.S. Air Force Gen. Jeff Harrigian, commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa. “If that day comes, it will create very real security concerns on Europe’s southern flank.” Russia’s destabilizing actions in Libya will also exacerbate the regional instability that has driven the migration crisis affecting Europe. According to their assessment, Russia is going the ‘little green planes’ route as I coined earlier, repainting the aircraft and having semi- ‘sheep-dipped’ pilots fly them. This is a huge deal and the strategic implications, as I noted in my closing paragraph in regards to the question of what weaponry will descend on Libya next, are absolutely huge. Also, if Russia really tries to make this a Wagner-like affair, this will also be a huge escalation in the level of weaponry Russia’s state-sponsored mercenary group is equipped with. Apparently, the U.S. military had reconnaissance aircraft off the Syrian coast peering at Russia’s base as the planes took off for Libya. U-2s and P-8s are usual visitors to this area and both types have flown missions in recent days there. The images of the departure were likely taken by a U-2 . It appears that a P-8 also got video of one of the Fulcrums in the air at some point. The other image may have come from a drone, such as an MQ-9 Reaper , or a fighter’s targeting pod.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2020",Close-Up Images Emerge Of Unmarked MiG-29 Fighters At Russia’s Air Base In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged on social media of unmarked MiG-29 Fulcrums parked at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria last week. The War Zone was first to confirm that these jets had arrived at that Syrian base before they they headed on to Libya, surreptitious movements that U.S. Africa Command has since released additional information about this week. Those aircraft, as well as other combat jets, are now in a position to support forces aligned with rogue Libyan general Khalifa Haftar, who has been fighting for years against the country’s U.N.-recognized government. The pictures offer a clear look at one unmarked Fulcrum and the tail of a second one is also visible in the background. The areas of their tails where national insignia, such as the red star of the Russian Air Force, are typically painted on MiG-29s are clearly painted over. The jets also lack any other discernable markings. The jet that is the main focus of the pictures appears to be a variant in the MiG-29S series, which are generally identifiable based on the extended strakes leading forward from each of the twin tails. It’s not otherwise clear whether this might be an upgraded variant within that series, such as the MiG-29SM . MiG has also crafted a number of customer-specific configurations based on the MiG-29S pattern. The example in Syria does notably lack the extended dorsal hump found on the advanced MiG-29SMT variant , though. The unmarked MiG-29 at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria., via @200_zoka A closeup of the nose of the MiG-29. The tail of a second unmarked Fulcrum is visible to the right., via @200_zoka The pictures are also definitely from Khmeimim, but the exact date they were taken is unconfirmed. The social media posts , which first began to appear late yesterday , say the photographs are from May 20. The first evidence of MiG-29s at Al Jufrah Air Base in Libya was from a satellite image taken on May 19. U.S. Africa Command did say that the Fulcrums, as well as other combat jets, including Su-24 Fencers, flew to the Libyan base over the course of multiple days. Satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained showed MiG-29s had arrived at Khmeimim by May 18 and indicated that all of those jets had departed by May 25. The aircraft we can see in the picture from Khmeimim is also in a ferry configuration with two drop tanks and no other stores. This, plus the other features of the jet we can see, matches up with imagery, seen below, that U.S. military aircraft grabbed of unmarked MiG-29s heading to Libya, which U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) released this week . AFRICOM AFRICOM The various social media posts that included the pictures from Khmeimim also claimed that some number of the Russian MiG-29s were also turned over to the Syrian Air Force. There is no evidence to substantiate this, but it would make sense that the regime in Damascus would be looking to get newer Fulcrums to supplement or supplant its existing examples. The Syrian Ministry of Defense recently released videos giving up-close looks at some of its MiG-29s, the state of which was extremely poor, as The War Zone previously reported . A screengrab from an official Syrian Ministry of Defense video showing one of that country’s MiG-29s in very poor condition., Syrian Ministry of Defense capture Russia has offered no explanation of the MiG-29 movements themselves. “If the warplanes are in Libya, they are Soviet, not Russian,” Viktor Bondarev, who heads up the Defense Committee in the upper house of Russia’s Duma, or parliament, and who was also the commander of Russia’s Aerospace Forces between 2015 and 2017, said on May 27, implying that they came from another country. He further dismissed the imagery and other details that AFRICOM has released so far as “stupidity,” according to The Associated Press . However, it’s clear that Russia has sent MiG-29s to Libya and the images taken on the ground at Khmeimim of the unmarked jets only further underscores the preposterousness of Bondarev’s denials.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 3, 2020",Air Force Unveils First Test Of Arsenal Plane Concept And New CLEAVER Munition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force conducted a test earlier this year of a palletized munition concept to launch new stand-off precision-guided munitions from its airlifters, allowing the service to relatively quickly turn them into weapons trucks, as necessary. This has also prompted important discussions within the service about command and control issues and other operational considerations that would be involved when rapidly shifting cargo aircraft into a strike role. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) revealed the test , which took place at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah on Jan. 28, 2020 in cooperation with Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), in a press release on May 27, 2020. Air Force Major General Clinton Hinote, the Deputy Director of the Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability (AFWIC) office, offered additional details about the project during an online chat that the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute hosted on the same day. Aviation Week’s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone Steve Trimble was kind enough to curate some of Hinote’s comments and post them on Twitter . This also a concept that has been around in various forms for decades and that the Air Force had publicly announced, by way of a contracting notice in February that you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , that it was looking to explore again. “This successful [demonstration] is evidence of our commitment to evolve innovative weapons concepts and enhance our partnership with AFSOC to meet the needs of the National Defense Strategy,” Air Force Colonel Garry Haase, head of AFRL’s Munitions Directorate, said in the May 27 press release. “CLEAVER represents a different approach to launching large numbers of long-range weapons, which will bring a new dynamic to the high-end fight.” CLEAVER stands for Cargo Launch Expendable Air Vehicles with Extended Range and the Air Force has described this previously unseen air-launched munition as an unpowered “long-range, high precision weapons [to] destroy moving and non-moving targets.” Two CLEAVER munitions on a single pallet exit the back of an Air Force Special Operations Command MC-130J Commando II special operations transport during the January test at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah., USAF The sole picture we have of the CLEAVER munitions so far shows that it has four tail fins and streamlined design that is visually similar in some respects of the AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb. The JSOW has pop-out wings to help them glide across extended distances, but it is not clear if CLEAVER has this feature. The new design is an in-house Air Force development from AFRL’s Center for Rapid Innovation (CRI), which has now transitioned the project to the Munitions Directorate. During the test at Dugway in January, an MC-130J Commando II special operations transport from the 27th Special Operations Wing, which is based at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico, dropped two pallets, each with two CLEAVER munitions, along with a third pallet with two additional unspecified “simulated munitions.” The exact method of deployment is unclear, but it appears that the pallet, also known as a Combat Expendable Platform (CEP), falls into a vertical position with the help of a parachute after leaving the aircraft and then releases the munitions via some form of remote or pre-set triggering mechanism. An MC-130J Commando II airdrops a Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) during an unrelated exercise. , USAF AFRL decided to work with AFSOC and use the Commando II for the test given the latter command’s decades of experience with dropping large munitions from the back of its MC-130 special operations transports, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Today, these aircraft are the only platforms certified to employ the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) bomb, which, to date, has been used in combat only once , in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar Province in 2017 against ISIS’s franchise in that country. An MC-130E Combat Talon special operations transport drops the last 15,000-pound-class BLU-82/B bomb, the predecessor to the GBU-43/B, in 2008. The bomb is seen here separating from its pallet and the CLEAVER munitions likely fall away in a similar fashion after launch., USAF An MC-12W Liberty intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft from the Oklahoma Air National Guard’s 137th Special Operations Wing also supported the test as a chase plane, capturing still and video imagery and making real-time observations about the drops. There are already plans for additional demonstrations involving more CLEAVERs, as well as “powered vehicles, and full-up vehicles with optional warhead and terminal guidance,” according to AFRL. Some sort of powered weapon, such as a cruise missile, would give an aircraft employing the palletized munitions concept true standoff range, something that would be very important in a major conflict against a near-peer adversary with a capable integrated air defense network. It would also drastically complicate an enemy’s defense planning. AFRL’s description of the warhead and guidance systems as “optional” also points to CLEAVER being a modular design. If true, this might meant it could potentially accommodate other payloads, including non-kinetic ones, such as electronic warfare jammers . AFRL’s press release also mentioned an ultimate goal to utilize a palletized munitions system to deploy a swarm of “network-enabled, semi-autonomous weapons” that “accompanies remotely piloted aircraft and fighter jets in combat missions.” The Air Force has already been working for a number of years on networked munitions concepts as part of the now-canceled Gray Wolf program and the current Golden Horde effort . A test article that Northrop Grumman developed for AFRL’s Gray Wolf program., USAF What’s interesting is that this test predated, and almost certainly informed, AFRL’s Air Force Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) office’s request for information regarding potential palletized munition concepts, or “ Bomb Bay In A Box ,” for Air Force airlifters in February 2020. That contracting notice also made mention of future experiments, though it’s not clear how this might be related to AFRL’s plans for more demonstrations together with AFSOC. “What we see is that no matter how big our bomber force is , the capacity that the Joint Force needs is always more and more,” Major General Hinote said during the Mitchell Institute talk. “So this is why we think that there’s a real possibility here for using cargo platforms, to be able to increase the capacity of fires.” It’s also unclear how this might feed into the Air Force’s long on-again-off-again relationship with similar concepts, typically referred to as “arsenal planes,” which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Most recently, in April, General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), had said he was not in favor of converting airlifters, even on a temporary basis, into strike platforms as a flexible and low-cost means of supplementing his command’s bombers. Ray instead said he was in favor of a new clean-sheet design to fulfill that mission. We now know that the January test had already raised some significant questions within the service by that point about how it might actually employ armed airlifters in combat and who would control them. As it stands now, Air Mobility Command oversees the vast majority of the Air Force’s cargo-carrying fleets, with AFGSC serving the same purpose for traditional bombers and Air Combat Command being responsible for smaller combat jets, among other aircraft. This existing command and control structure “actually works against our effectiveness,” Hinote noted. “Some sort of extremely streamlined command and control is going to be necessary.” Hopefully, now, more information will begin to emerge about this very interesting CLEAVER munition and AFRL’s other continuing work on palletized munition systems. After decades of still-ongoing debate within the Air Force, the service does finally appear to be moving ahead with this concept. Update: 5/28/2020— AFRL’s SDPE office has told Breaking Defense that it conducted a total of five test flights between January and February related to the palletized munition concept, including ones in cooperation with Air Mobility Command utilizing a C-17A Globemaster III airlifter from the 412th Test Wing. Unfortunately, there are no specific details about the other four test flights. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 29, 2020","China’s Largest Base Has Replicas Of Taiwan’s Presidential Building, Eiffel Tower","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has made massive investments in modernizing its military over the better part of the past three decades and has established new and improved research and development and training bases to support those efforts . The People’s Liberation Army has fully embraced the idea of utilizing highly realistic facilities to prepare its forces for the sorts of environments they’d be likely to fight in during future conflicts, drawing significant lessons from the experiences of the U.S. military and those of its allies. The Zhurihe Training Base in remote Inner Mongolia is the largest of these sites and notably features a huge full-size mockup a portion of downtown Taipei, the capital of the island of Taiwan, including highly elaborate recreations of its Presidential Office Building and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There’s also a cloverleaf highway interchange, a mock airfield and, bizarrely, a replica of France’s Eiffel Tower. Zhurihe, also known as the Zhurihe Combined Tactics Training Base, is China’s largest training base by physical size. Observers have compared it, together with its adjacent training ranges, to the U.S. Army’s Fort Irwin in southern California and that base’s associated sprawling National Training Center (NTC). The NTC is home to a large number of diverse facilities that also give the Army room to conduct large scale unit exercises covering a wide variety of combat scenarios. As with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at the NTC, Zhurihe also has its own dedicated units to play the role of enemy forces during drills. These are known as the “ Blue Army ,” a play on the Western term “Red Force” to refer to Opposing Forces during exercises. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) first established Zhurihe in 1957 , primarily as a tank training base. Four decades later, Chinese authorities decided to transform it into a multi-functional “first-class” facility that would prepare its forces for “hi-tech battles” of the future. China’s military leaders had closely watched the U.S. military lightning victory over Iraq during the First Gulf War in 1991 and already started to question the adequacy of the equipping and training of their own units. In 1996, then-U.S. President Bill Clinton’s sent a pair of carrier strike groups to sail through the Taiwan Strait in response to a major crisis between authorities in Beijing and on the island, which is seen as a critical event that contributed to China’s subsequent decision to initiate a massive military modernization effort across the board, which included the expansion of Zhurihe. By the mid-2000s, Zhurihe’s facilities had significantly expanded in size and scope, with a heavy emphasis on features that would be used to prepare forces for what the U.S. military calls Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT). By the end of 2014, it had further grown to include the Taiwan-related structures, as well as other features to support larger exercises, including an associated operational air base with a more than 9,000-foot-long runway to the northwest and a huge railhead to allow the rapid movement of vehicles, heavy weapons, other equipment, and personnel to and from the site. All of this is visible in high-resolution satellite imagery of the area that The War Zone recently obtained.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Zhurihe’s main administrative center, which includes a full military hospital and barracks facilities, is at the northern end of the base. This is one of a number of areas that have seen substantial expansion over the past two decades. It’s interesting to note that there are no less than 20 basketball courts near the barracks. Despite its Western origins, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People’s Liberation Army, in particular, have actively promoted basketball for decades , with the popularity of the sport notably surviving the Cultural Revolution. As a result, Chinese military bases are curiously easy to identify by the presence of basketball courts.

It also has six more basketball courts in its own not insubstantial administrative and barracks area. Construction of this air base was in its early stages in 2011 and was still ongoing in 2013. Between the hangars, the helipads, and the space on the base’s apron, there is a lot of room for tactical aircraft and helicopters to support fully integrated combined-armed training.

It’s not clear what this facility’s purpose is, but most of the structures inside appear to have garages, meaning it could be used to store particularly sensitive vehicles, such as transporter erector launchers for ballistic missiles. It might also serve as storage for equally important weapons, such as nuclear warheads. Alternatively, it almost has the look of a military prison or a place where very important officials could flee to in a crisis.

In the Taiwanese capital, the L-shaped building, which is the Taipei First Girls Highschool, is caddy-corner to the Presidential Office Building. A similar structure at the Chinese base is instead positioned directly across from the building similar to the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs., Google Earth Some observers have also suggested that the highway interchange could look similar to those, seen above, near Taichung Airport, which also serves as a military air base for Taiwan’s Air Force and is situated in the western coast of the island. However, the interchange at Zhurihe is very generic and symmetrical in shape and could serve as a useful stand-in for any such road feature., Google Earth The Tapei section is one of the most elaborate urban training areas that we here at The War Zone are aware of. By itself, the recreation of the Presidential Office Building, a structure that is some five-stories tall with six-story high corners and a large central tower nearly 200 feet tall, is likely the largest of its kind anywhere in the world. Beyond its functional purpose, Taiwan’s Presidential Office Building also holds important historical significant force both the island and mainland. Japanese colonial authorities built it between 1912 and 1919 and severely damaged during World War II. It was restored under Nationalist rule between 1947 and 1948. Between then and 2006, it was also referred to as Chieh Shou Hall, which Chieh Shou translating to “Long live Chiang Kai-shek,” in reference to the long-time Nationalist leader. In many ways, the structure reflects the island’s continued de facto independence from the mainland and its general history of it being outside of Beijing’s control. As such, it’s hard not to interpret the mock structure at Zhurihe as a particularly ominous sign of the Chinese government’s intentions to bring Taiwan back into its orbit. Taking control of Taiwan’s seat of power during an actual invasion would certainly be a top priority. The fact that China has invested heavily in actually trains on doing so against a full-scale mockup is quite troubling, although such a practice isn’t unheard of. North Korea has a full-scale replica of South Korea’s Blue House that it trains on. A still image of the assault on the mock Presidential Office Building that also emerged in 2015., Chinese State Media The real Presidential Office Building in Taipei. , Photo by CEphoto/Wikicommons Further to the south, beyond Zhurihe’s Taiwan-related structures, is a mock air base, the initial iteration of which was completed between 2013 and 2014. At that time, it had a runway around 3,900 feet long and two separate aprons, as well as various small structures. In 2017, extensions were made the runway at both ends, bringing it to around 10,105 feet. Gates are now in place that can close off these additions from the main portion of the runway and there are a number of more austere aprons along the northern end. This simulated air base would be a very valuable asset to have in order to help People’s Liberation Army units train to assault and seize control of enemy airfields. There are also three medium-size helicopters, two twin-engine turboprop transports, a single four-engine turboprop transport, and an airliner type jet aircraft to provide added realism. Some of these aircraft, especially the airliner, could provide space for specialized units to train to respond to hijacking and VIP protection scenarios , as well. The extended runway also means that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force could land larger aircraft, such as the Y-20 airlifter , directly at this site for training purposes and fly in newer and bigger planes to use as training hulks.

Constructed sometime around 2010, it predates the Taipei section and the mock airstrip. The scale replica Eiffel Tower at Zhurihe as of Feb. 11, 2020., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The tower under construction in 2010., Google Earth The tower could be in use as a structure to support antennas or aerials and would offer a good field of view for line-of-sight communications in the area. The satellite imagery from February shows what appears to be a large wire linked to an upper section that could provide a hard link between it and a nearby structure. It also appears to serve as an elevated view platform for commanders, Chinese VIPs, and dignitaries from foreign militaries observing exercises at Zhurihe. There appears to be four major platforms at different heights on the tower. It could even be used as a training aid for scaling large lattice structures.

Still, the exact motivation behind the design of the structure isn’t clear, but what is clear is that China likes to make replicas of iconic structures. It’s also worth noting that Zhurihe isn’t the only place where the People’s Liberation Army has built realistic approximations of potential enemy facilities to train on. In 2006, it emerged that the Chinese military had built a full-size air base in the country’s northwestern Gansu Province modeled after Taiwan’s Ching Chuan Kang Air Base at Taichung airport to serve as a bombing target for the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. The mock version of Taiwan’s Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in Gansu., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Taichung International Airport and the colocated Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in Taiwan., Google Earth In the first half of the 2010s, the People’s Liberation Army also built a host of large-scale simulated targets in the Gobi Desert for its rocket forces to fire ballistic missiles at during training and testing. These sites included mock airfields, hardened aircraft shelters, piers, and even the outlines of large warships, some of which appeared to mimic American facilities and assets at various bases in Japan. The construction of the Taipei section at Zhurihe and the targets in the Gobi came around when the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping was beginning to show signs of a more aggressive foreign policy, especially with regards to the country’s claims over the bulk of the South China Sea . That remains a major point of contention between Beijing and other countries in that region, as well as much of the international community, including the United States , in particular. In addition, in late 2014, Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, which has promoted the idea of declaring full independence from the mainland, also won a landslide victory in local elections. In July 2015, Chinese state television broadcast a segment , part of which is seen below, that briefly showed troops assaulting mock Presidential Office Building at Zhurihe, which was widely seen as a signal to Taiwanese officials. In 2016, Tsai Ing Wen, then head of the DPP, won Taiwan’s presidency, which has led to steadily escalating tensions between authorities on the island and the mainland. Officials in Beijing had branded Tsai an “ independence extremist ” and have repeatedly threatened military action should authorities in Taipei attempt to formally break away from the rest of China. She has also cultivated a very close relationship with President Donald Trump and his administration, securing unprecedented arms deals , including for new Block 70 F-16C/D fighter jets . One has to wonder whether we might soon see new activity at Zhurihe’s Taipei section as friction between Beijing and Taipei has flared even more significantly since Tsai won a second term in January. Last week she announced plans for “ constitutional amendments ” that might indicate a new push toward formal independence. Chinese authorities have, unsurprisingly, condemned the moves. “We will not accept the Beijing authorities’ use of ‘one country, two systems’ to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo,” Tsai said in a speech at her inauguration on May 20, 2020. “This democratic process [of constitutional amendments] will enable the constitutional system to progress with the times and align with the values of Taiwanese society.” Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen walks with other officials ahead of her inauguration ceremony on May 20, 2020., AP “We will show no tolerance for any secessionist act and foreign interference,” Ma Xiaoguang, the spokesperson for the People’s Republic of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said that same day in response . “The DPP … has unilaterally destroyed the political foundation for peaceful development between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. … National reunification is inevitable as the Chinese nation marches toward its great rejuvenation and cannot be stopped by anyone or any force.” Though the general language of these threats is hardly new, there are concerns that more serious confrontation could be in the offing, especially given months of more tense interactions between Chinese and Taiwanese military aircraft and ships . In addition, Beijing has been more actively working to wedge Taiwanese officials out of international organizations, especially in regards to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chinese government appears to be using the current state of affairs around the world, where most of its primary opponents, such as the United States, are focused heavily on battling COVID-19, to pursue aggressive foreign policy activities elsewhere, too. Officials in Beijing are looking to enact a new national security law that would effectively strip Hong Kong’s unique semi-autonomous status . The enclave has already seen months of on-and-off-again protests in response to previous efforts to curtail certain freedoms in the past year or so. China has triggered an unprecedented standoff along its border with India, ostensibly in response to Indian military construction, with unconfirmed reports that thousands of Chinese troops may now be encamped in Indian territory, as well. The Indian government has downplayed that highly fluid situation, saying that they are pursuing a peaceful resolution via official channels. A similar situation in that region in 2017 did ultimately end following diplomatic efforts between the two countries. All told, the Chinese government under Xi appears to be entering the 2020s more assertive than ever in response to threats and challenges, real and perceived, domestic and foreign. This can only increase the emphasis within the People’s Liberation Army on staying prepared for major conflicts and other contingencies. As such, Zhurihe will remain an essential training area, if not become more important, given its array of unique and specialized mock facilities, especially those related to Taiwan. Zhurihe has, understandably, been a topic of interest for many years now. Here are some additional links to other earlier overviews and analysis that we referred to while researching this story.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 6, 2020",Russia Now Has At Least 14 Combat Jets In Libya As Satellite Images Reveal New Details,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s top command for operations in Africa says that Russia has sent at least 14 combat jets to Libya and that Russian military pilots are flying them. It has also released additional satellite imagery shot last week showing two MiG-29 Fulcrums at Al Jufrah Air Base in the center of that country. This comes a day after it first revealed evidence that the Kremlin had sent the aircraft to bolster forces fighting on behalf of strongman Khalifa Haftar against Libya’s U.N.-recognized government. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) Tweeted out the new imagery and information on May 27, 2020. The satellite images are dated May 20, a day before the first reports began to emerge that Russian MiG-29s, as well as Su-24 Fencers, had touched down in Libya. “Over multiple days in May, Russian MiG 29s and SU-24 fighters departed Russia. At that time, all the aircraft have Russian Federation Air Force markings,” one of the Tweets reads. “After they land at Khmeimin Air Base in Syria, the MiG 29s are repainted and emerge with no national markings.” “They are flown by Russian military members & escorted by Russian fighters based in Syria to Libya, landing in Eastern Libya near Tobruk for fuel,” another Tweet continues. “At least 14 newly unmarked Russian aircraft are then delivered to Al Jufra Air Base in Libya.” US AFRICOM US AFRICOM The satellite images show various supporting equipment, including at least one APA-5 generator truck , used for starting aircraft engines on the ground, also in place at Al Jufrah. Some of this equipment is seen clustered around one of the hardened aircraft shelters at the southern end of the base. The War Zone had previously noted that MiG-29s and any other Russian aircraft were likely concealed in those structures for their protection, especially given the threat of strikes from armed Turkish drones. Further satellite imagery from private intelligence firm ImageSat International that was shot on May 23 shows other developments at Al Jufrah that appears linked to the MiG-29 deployment. This includes the construction of a small motor pool near the hardened aircraft shelters that the Fulcrums are using and the erection of a new radar, which could help with basic air traffic control tasks, as well as improve general situational awareness of the skies in the vicinity, as operations at the base increase. AFRICOM’s description of the pilots as “Russian military members” is interesting given that U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, the command’s top officer, had described them as “Russian mercenary pilots flying Russian-supplied aircraft to bomb Libyans” in an official press release on May 26. This further points to Russia utilizing what we at The War Zone are calling “ Little Green Planes ” with, at best, semi-sheep-dipped pilots and support personnel in Libya. This is well in line with the Kremlin’s previous employment of “volunteer” ground forces in Ukraine, the first of which that appeared in Crimea in 2014 were dubbed “ Little Green Men ,” as well as nominally independent private military contractors, who have strong links to Russian intelligence agencies and senior Kremlin officials, in that country and in Syria, among other locales . Wagner, the best known of the private military companies, has been operating in Libya alongside Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) since around 2018 . The LNA has its main hub in the eastern city of Tobruk and has also received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, among others . It has been fighting a civil war against the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which resides in the internationally-recognized capital Tripoli. Turkey has stepped up its involvement in the conflict in the last year or so and has become the GNA’s main ally . The new detail that the Russian combat jets made stops in Tobruk before continuing on to other locations in Libya also fills in an important gap in the previously available information. It is around 1,300 miles from Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria to Al Jufrah in Libya, which is largely beyond the maximum range for many MiG-29 variants. It was not previously clear how the aircraft would have been able to make the hop without the benefit of aerial refueling or landing and refueling somewhere. Tobruk, in the far northeastern corner of Libya, situated less than 80 miles from the Egyptian border, is around 725 miles from Khmeimim, a much more manageable trip for the MiG-29s. From Tobruk, it’s around 510 more miles to Al Jufrah. It’s less than 165 miles from Tobruk to Al Khadim Air Base, where other satellite imagery suggests at least some of the Su-24s have deployed. A map showing a straight line between Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, at far right, and Al Jufrah Air Base in Libya, at far left, with Tobruk in between. Al Khadim Air Base, situated to the west of Tobruk, is also shown. This also highlights how it is a relatively straight shot from Khmeimim to Tobruk to Al Jufrah., Google Maps All told, Russia seems to have intervened in Libya in a new and big way that will have significant ramifications for the conflict going forward. The Kremlin’s immediate impetus seems to have been to stabilize the position of Haftar, a strongman friendly to Moscow, just as it did in Syria on behalf of Bashar Al Assad in 2015, which also started with a major infusion of combat aircraft. The LNA has suffered a number of serious defeats and other setbacks against Turkish-backed GNA-aligned forces in recent weeks. In the past few days, there have been indications that LNA forces, including Wagner mercenaries, have been evacuating from the city of Bani Walid, situated some 90 miles southeast of Tripoli, and moving further southeast toward the greater Al Jufrah district. This would make good sense as it would put them closer to the added protective air cover that the Russian jets can now provide from while operating from the air base in that region. However, it seems unlikely that Haftar, who rejected a Russian-Turkish brokered ceasefire deal in January, has given up his designs on taking over the country. Last week, the LNA also promised to launch an unprecedented air campaign against the GNA and allies, including Turkish forces in Libya. With Russian airpower behind Haftar’s aims, the conflict is likely to escalate even more now. What that might mean if Turkey’s troops, or ships offshore, were to come under fire remains to be seen, but a flare-up in Syria earlier this year shows that officials in Ankara are unlikely to back down in pursuit of their own geopolitical aims. NATO member Turkey’s response to Haftar gaining substantial aerial might be in the form of Russian tactical jets may be to insert its own high-performance fighter aircraft into the conflict, which would set the stage for one remarkably complex and volatile proxy war right on NATO’s doorstep.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery has emerged showing at least one MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet at an air base in Libya under the control of forces aligned with rogue general Khalifa Haftar . This follows reports that six MiG-29s, as well as a pair of Su-24 Fencer combat jets, had recently arrived to join Haftar’s Libyan National Army, or LNA. If true, this could represent a major escalation in the conflict in that country and it comes amid an exchange of threats between Haftar’s group and Turkey, the latter of which supports the United Nations-recognized Government of National Accord, or GNA. Just this week, GNA-aligned forces also routed elements of the LNA in the western portion of the country, recapturing a major base along with various weapons and other equipment. On May 21, 2020, Brian Castner, a weapons investigator on Amnesty International’s Crisis Team, posted on Twitter a satellite image taken two days earlier of Al Jufrah Air Base, which situated in the center of Libya, that showed a MiG-29 Fulcrum being towed by a truck along the base’s main taxiway. The War Zone is already securing its own satellite imagery of this base to try to further confirm how many of these fighter jets, as well as any other aircraft, may be there.

Bashagha also claimed that a pair of Russian Su-35 Flankers had escorted the jets, at least on a portion of their journey. It’s worth noting that Libya, as a whole, is subject to an international arms embargo, but the United Nations has repeatedly found supporters of the GNA and the LNA violating those prohibitions . The GNA’s primary benefactor, at present, is Turkey , while Haftar’s LNA, which has its main hub in the eastern city of Tobruk and controls much of the rest of the country, enjoys support from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt , among others. Where this newly arrived MiG-29, or any of these other reported arrivals, came from originally, and who might be operating them, is unclear. “It wasn’t clear whether those were refurbished jets that had belonged to Haftar’s airforce or additions to his fleet,” Bloomberg ‘s story said, but Libya has never before received MiG-29s of any kind from any source. The Aviationist noted that there had been unconfirmed reports of six Russian MiG-29s flying to Syria by way of Iran, along with a Tu-154 passenger transport, and that these aircraft could have continued on to Libya. Russia’s Tu-154s are similar in function to its Il-62Ms, which have been a typical support aircraft for similar kinds of deployments elsewhere in the world in recent years. Russia has also been a major support of Haftar’s LNA in recent years and has reportedly already sent mercenaries to bolster the Libyan strongman’s forces on the ground. Last week the Записки охотника Telegram Channel said that a Russian Tu-154 aircraft landed in Iran's Hamadan Airbase as a stop over as it flew from Russian to Syria, and it was escorted by 6 MiG-29 fighters. Presumably, these are the same fighters. 70/ https://t.co/rWWaHEmjnX — Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 21, 2020 Additional reports, also unconfirmed, said that Belarus, a long-time Russian ally and a country that has a history of supplying aircraft to controversial regimes and countries under international arms embargoes, such as Syria , might have supplied the jets. It’s also worth noting that there were reports in 2016 that Egypt, as well as Sudan, had provided combat jets to the LNA, helping to replace combat losses and general attrition due to limited maintenance capacity across its already small and diverse fleets after years of conflict. The Egyptian Air Force, which has flown direct combat operations in Libya in support of Haftar in the past, also operates advanced versions of the MiG-29M . not sure if russians, my sources are talking about belarussian 9.13, so Mig 29s, probably the version upgraded by ARP558 which looks similar to the SMT but without the dorsal tank — Secretdifa3 Akram Kharief (@secretdifa3) May 21, 2020 The full scope and origins of the LNA’s apparent aerial reinforcements are not clear, nor is whether Haftar’s forces are actually operating them or if a third party, such as Russia or mercenaries that Moscow or someone else has supplied, will be flying them. The appearance of a MiG-29 at Al Jufrah would fit with recent remarks from Saqr Al-Jaroushi, head of the LNA’s Air Force, that the “largest aerial campaign in Libyan history” was imminent and that Turkey’s forces in the country would be “legitimate targets.” Turkey has been ever-more directly embroiled in Libya’s civil war since at least May 2019 , supplying the GNA with a variety of armored vehicles and heavy weapons, including Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, as well as advisory support. A Turkish TB2 carrying various precision guided munitions., Turkish Presidency of Defence Industries TB2s played a decisive role in the GNA’s recapture of Al Watiya Air Base , which is situated to the west of Tripoli, earlier this week. GNA forces and their Turkish allies notably destroyed or captured eight Russian-made Pantsir-S1 mobile point air defense systems that the UAE had supplied to Haftar’s LNA in the last year or so. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lp6KeIQ0XD0 It’s also interesting to note that Turkish drones decimated Syrian forces, including a number of Panstir-S1s, during a relatively brief skirmish in that country in late February that spilled over into March. The Syrian and Libyan campaigns have both been seen as underscoring previous anecdotal reports that questioned the Pantsir-S1’s capabilities, as well as highlighting Turkey’s increasing unmanned aircraft capabilities . With the loss of Al Watiya, Haftar’s forces have been decidedly put on the offensive and whoever may have supplied the new tranche of combat jets is undoubtedly looking to help ensure they don’t lose any more ground. Positioning the aircraft at Al Jufrah would put them within range of GNA controlled territory in the western portion of the country and help keep them shielded from counterattacks. Trips to Tripoli and back from the base could be at the edge of the combat radius of the MiG-29s depending on the variants in question. The Fuclrums are also capable of air-to-air combat, so they might not necessarily be tasked with conducting ground strikes and might instead go hunting for the GNA’s own varied combat aircraft and the Turkish drones. Regardless, Turkey’s government has already responded in kind to the LNA’s threats. “If Turkish interests in Libya are targeted, we will legitimately target the elements of the coup plotter Haftar,” a statement from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared. There are unconfirmed reports now that Turkey may be considering deploying its own combat aircraft to Libya, as well as ground forces. Turkish and GNA officials did conclude an agreement last year, which Turkey’s parliament subsequently approved, which included provisions for Ankara to send troops to the country. There have been numerous reports since then that the arrival of a major Turkish contingent is imminent, but so far, the deployments seem to largely be limited to special operations forces, intelligence operatives , and various supporting elements. Turkish Navy warships have been patrolling off the coast . In addition, Turkey has facilitated the deployment of a significant number of militiamen from Syria to Libya to fight on behalf of the GNA, as well as the curious construction of a so-far-unused airstrip bizarrely located inside a residential development just outside of Tripoli. MiG-29 Fulcrum., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikicommons There is a definite possibility that the conflict is about to escalate again now and draw in the GNA and LNA’s respective benefactors even more directly. At the same time, Russian officials announced earlier on May 21 that it had already been in contact with the Turkish counterparts and that both countries were calling for a ceasefire . Moscow and Ankara similarly brokered a deal to end Turkey’s campaign against forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad in March. It is worth noting, however, that the two countries had worked to get the GNA and the LNA to agree to ceasefire deal earlier this year. Haftar rejected that proposal , instead choosing to launch his latest failed offensive to try to capture Tripoli. All told, it remains to be seen what the full extent of the LNA’s aerial reinforcements actually is and whether they are a prelude to a new and more serious burst of fighting or if they will provide a deterrent effect against the GNA that leads to at least a temporary pause in the conflict.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 27, 2020",Armed Russian Fighters Fly Dangerously Close To U.S. Navy Patrol Plane Over The Mediterranean,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released a video and images showing two fully-armed Russian Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jets flying dangerously close to one of its P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes over international waters in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea today. The incident comes after U.S. Africa Command issued a press release, along with images, some of which a P-8A appeared to have captured, showing Russian combat jets making their way to Libya to reinforce mercenaries and other forces fighting there on behalf of rogue general Khalifa Haftar, something The War Zone had already been investigating in depth. The Navy says that two Su-35s intercepted and flew on either side of the P-8A over a period of 65 minutes. The U.S. Sixth Fleet, which oversees American naval operations around Europe, including in the Mediterranean, said that there had also been two other unsafe intercepts in the general area in April. The full Navy press release is as follows: “For the third time in two months, Russian pilots flew in an unsafe and unprofessional manner while intercepting a U.S. Navy P-8A Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft in U.S. Sixth Fleet, May 26, 2020.” “On May 26, 2020, a U.S. Navy P-8A aircraft was flying in the Eastern Mediterranean over international waters and was intercepted by two Russian Su-35 aircraft over a period of 65 minutes. The intercept was determined to be unsafe and unprofessional due to the Russian pilots taking close station on each wing of the P-8A simultaneously, restricting the P-8A’s ability to safely maneuver.” “The unnecessary actions of the Russian Su-35 pilots were inconsistent with good airmanship and international flight rules, and jeopardized the safety of flight of both aircraft.” “While the Russian aircraft was operating in international airspace, this interaction was irresponsible. We expect them to operate within international standards set to ensure safety and to prevent incidents, including the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (INCSEA). Actions‎ like these increase the potential for midair collisions.” “This incident follows two unsafe interactions in April, over the same waters. In all cases, the U.S. aircraft were operating in international airspace, consistent with international law, with due regard for safety of flight, and did not provoke this Russian activity.” One of the Su-35s, with three R-77 air-to-air missiles and a single R-27 air-to-air missile, with the black fins, visible., USN The second Su-35, with an R-73 air-to-air missile visible., USN The two Su-35s flying together., USN Unsafe and unprofessional Russian intercepts of American aircraft are not necessarily uncommon, both around Europe and elsewhere around the world . They’re so routine that the Navy had even developed dedicated camera pods for its EP-3E Aries II intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft to capture evidence of similar altercations. However, the time of this incident, coming soon after the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) statement regarding Russian MiG-29s and other combat jets heading toward Libya, makes it particularly notable. As we mentioned at the start of this article, one or more P-8As were very likely responsible for capturing some of the evidence of those aircraft making their way to the North African country by way of Syria. The multi-role maritime patrol jets spend a lot of time flying racetrack patterns off the Syrian coast where Russia’s air base is located in the war-torn country. From there perch they can monitor Russia’s actions at the base and around the Eastern Mediterranean. A Navy P-8A Poseidon., USN The already convoluted civil war in that country has become more complex in recent months as Turkey has expanded its involvement in the conflict, something you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . The Turkish government has become the primary benefactor of the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been fighting for years against strongman Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA). The LNA enjoys support from Russia , as well as the United Arab Emirates and Egypt , among others. Haftar recently suffered a major defeat , which appears to have prompted the Kremlin to rush additional reinforcements in the form of advanced combat jets to help the LNA. There are also concerns that this deployment could have broader impacts on regional security, in addition to leading to a worrisome escalation in Libya’s civil war. “If Russia seizes basing on Libya’s coast, the next logical step is they deploy permanent long-range anti-access area denial (A2AD) capabilities,” U.S. Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa, had said as part of the AFRICOM statement on the Russian combat jets earlier on May 26. “If that day comes, it will create very real security concerns on Europe’s southern flank.” This latest intercept in the Meditteranean certainly seems to be a response at least to the U.S. military’s efforts to monitor Russia’s activities in the region and especially in regards to the country’s deepening involvement in the ongoing conflict in Libya.

In the first video, the stealth fighter careens down the catapult track at what seems like a bizarrely slow velocity before sinking totally below the rising bow of the ship. A moment later the jet appears again climbing away to safety. It is one heck of a tense clip to watch! The other video has a view from below the bow of the ship, showing the F-35C skimming above the waves before clawing its way into the air. The videos were posted by RCAF_Pilot on Instagram , who notes that this was part of testing for the F-35C program, in which the minimum catapult energy for a safe launch was assessed. We have not confirmed this, but he notes in his post: Good thing we have test pilots for this! Something you don’t see everyday…low energy catapult launch! That sink is scary, but it was a part of the test plan. The folks at PAX River needed to find the lowest amount of energy that the catapult needed in order to safely launch an F-35C…they definitely found it! Through a smart build up and mitigation the test professionals go where others don’t. … Watch the waters part because of the engine exhaust!! Here’s the last video, low energy catapult testing, from the front of the ship camera view. You can tell from this angle that the aircraft got close to the water. Remember though, this was a part of the testing and the team had prepared for this moment.

The definition of “you gotta’ be shittin’ me?!’ It is worth noting that the F-35 pilot never selects afterburner throughout the launch, which would also point to this being test, not a dreaded and unforeseen ‘cold cat-shot’ during other operations (see below for an example). We also know that it was taken aboard a Nimitz class supercarrier as the catapult is clearly steam-powered. That must have been one hell of a ride!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2020","Venezuela Sends SAMs, Rocket Artillery To Caribbean Outpost As Iranian Tankers Get Closer (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Venezuelan military has sent a contingent of forces, including at least one of its Russian-made Buk-M2E surface-to-air missile systems, as well as BM-21 Grad and BM-30 Smerch artillery rocket launchers, to conduct exercises on the island of La Orchila off the country’s coast in the Caribbean Sea. This propaganda show of force comes as the regime of dictatorial President Nicolas Maduro has pledged to escort five Iranian tankers carrying approximately 1.5 million barrels of gasoline safely into port in Venezuela, vowing to block any attempts by the United States to seize the ships on the high seas. Video and pictures of the Russian-made weapon systems on Isla La Orchila first emerged on May 22, 2020. Maduro subsequently announced the drills during a televised meeting with top military commanders in Caracas. He further framed them as part of a broader effort, dubbed Bolivarian Shield , to improve the country’s ability to respond to any foreign aggression, which officially began in February. “We witnessed military exercises … on the island of La Orchila, with the test of the most precise missile systems for the defense of waters and coasts,” Maduro said. “We were testing the Russian Buk missile, absolute precision …, a powerful missile.” Ship spotters, using online tracking software, had already noticed the Venezuelan Navy’s AB Los Roques , a Dutch-built Damen Stan Lander 5612 logistics support craft, make a curious trip to the island on May 18 under escort from the first-in-class patrol boat AB Guaiqueri . The Los Roques has a landing craft style drop-down ramp at the bow and a large open cargo area in the middle that could easily accommodate heavy military vehicles, such as the Buk-M2E , BM-21 , and BM-30 . That the Venezuelans sent the Guaiqueri along to escort it makes it even more likely that it delivered these vehicles to La Orchila for this snap exercise. This show of force appears to be very limited and it’s unclear how these forces might at all contribute to deterring any attempt to detain the Iranian tankers heading toward the country. La Orchila, which has served primarily as a presidential retreat in recent years, is around 100 miles northeast of Venezuela’s capital Caracas and has no facilities on it for the tankers to offload their fuel there. It is home to a small military outpost with a single runway and limited dock facilities, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . A satellite image of La Orchila as of February 2020. The single runway at the island’s small military outpost is visible toward the western end., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The Buk-M2E is a medium-range surface-to-air missile system and has a maximum engagement range, under the best conditions, of just under 30 miles. Venezuela’s longer-range S-300VMs, which it also bought from Russia, are notably absent and have been in a questionable state of readiness in recent years, in general. There were reports last year that the Kremlin was trying to help the Venezuelans rehabilitate their S-300VMs, among other advanced Russian-supplied weapons. One of Venezuela’s Buk-M2Es on parade in 2014. , Cancillería del Ecuador via Wikimedia A transporter-erector-launcher associated with Venezuela’s S-300VM surface-to-air missile systems at the same event., Cancillería del Ecuador via Wikimedia The BM-30s can fire its 300mm rockets out to around 56 miles, but those weapons, as well as the shorter-range BM-21s with their 122mm rockets, are unguided and ill-suited for engaging maritime threats. It’s not clear how forces on La Orchila would even spot potential targets out to sea, to begin with. The video below Venezuela’s BM-21s and BM-30s in action during an exercise in 2014. The Venezuelan armed forces do not have any land-based anti-ship missiles, which would pose a greater potential threat to any American warships that might be in the area and posied to board any of the Iranian tankers. They do have a limited number of Russian-made air-launched Kh-31s for their Su-30MK2 Flanker fighter jets and may still have some Franco-Italian Otomats for the Mariscal Sucre class frigates and Federacion class fast attack craft . Of course, the deployment does reflect how the Venezuelan military might look to defend the strategic island itself from any attack in the future, unrelated to the approaching Iranian tankers. La Orchila could be an attractive initial staging location for a potential adversary looking to invade Venezuela, something Maduro’s regime regularly says the United States is preparing to do, though there is no hard evidence to support those claims. However, Maduro did just recently face a bizarre botched coup attempt, which a former U.S. Army green beret, Jordan Goudreau, helped organize. You can read more about that embarrassingly amateurish affair in detail in this past War Zone explainer . Whatever the exact motivations, the entire exercise seems primarily intended for domestic audiences and to bolster the image of Maduro’s regime, as has been the case with other notable demonstrations the country’s martial power in the past. If it was truly meant to be a deterrent of any kind, it’s not clear if it has had the intended effect, with the U.S. Navy’s Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship USS Detriot also appearing in international waters just off Caracas yesterday. It remains to be seen whether or not the United States, or any of its regional allies and partners, decides to make an attempt to detain any of the Iranian tankers or otherwise block them from reaching Venezuela. The governments in Tehran and Caracas are both subject to an extensive array of sanctions, especially on their respective petroleum industries, and specifically target Iranian oil and gasoline exports, among others. A Pentagon spokesperson told Fox News on May 21 that they were “not aware” of any planned operation to stop any of the tankers, but that could very well change on short notice, if the public affairs office were even to be informed beforehand. Typically, the U.S. military does not comment on ongoing or potential military operations. In April, the U.S. military did launch a new counter-narcotics operation in the region, focused primarily on Venezuela, which means there are additional forces in the region that are well suited to conducting surveillance of target ships and launching visit, board, search, and seizure operations. “We’ve got it [Venezula] surrounded, it’s surrounded at a level that nobody even knows, but they know,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on May 20. “We are watching to see what happens.” The five Iranian-flagged tankers – the Clavel , the Forest , the Faxon , the Fortune , and the Petunia – began to leave Iran last week . The lead tanker, Fortune, is now around two days away from arriving in Caracas. Sanctions and years of political and economic instability have led to an acute gasoline shortage in Venezuela, which also comes as the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the country. Even just blocking the gasoline deliveries from Iran could put new pressure on Maduro’s regime, which has been locked in a protracted dispute for more than a year now with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who the United States supports. This could increase the incentive for the U.S. government to act. At the same time, blocking the gasoline could increase hardships on average Venezuelans, which Maduro already routinely blames on outside forces, including the actions of the United States, and hand the government in Caracas a propaganda victory. The U.S. government has already had to deal with the fallout from a recent and bizarre botched coup attempt that a former U.S. Army green beret, Jordan Goudreau, helped organize, an embarrassing amateurish affair that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone explainer . Two other Americans are now in Venezuelan custody and the U.S. government is investigating Goudreau. This incident may also be tied to an equally curious and still largely unexplained altercation in March in which a Venezuelan patrol ship sunk itself after ramming into an ice-capable cruise liner. Seizing or otherwise interfering with the movement of the Iranian tankers would very likely prompt some form of retaliation from the regime in Tehran. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) did follow through with a threat to seize a British-flagged tanker in response to the impounding of the Grace 1 last year. The IRGC has also been implicated in a host of maritime incidents in the past year or so, including, most recently, harassing U.S. Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf in April. That incident prompted that service to issue a new public notice this week warning about the inherent risks of these kinds of alternations. Iranian forces and their proxies in the Middle East also regularly launch attacks on American military and diplomatic posts , as well as targeting U.S. allies and partners , in that region. All told, it’s unclear what course of action the United States might pursue now with regards to the approaching Iranian tankers. By every indication, though, the Venezuelan forces on La Orchila are unlikely to play any meaningful role in what comes next. Update: 6:15 PM EST— The Venezuelan military has released video footage of the exercise on La Orchila that shows that the stationary tanker served as the target for the BM-21 Grads and BM-30 Smerchs. There is no indication that the rocket launchers were able to sink the ship and the video clip shows how inaccurate the rockets would be against such a target at even modest ranges and when it’s not moving. Another video clip also shows that some of the Venezuelan military’s Russian-made Pechora-2M surface-to-air missile systems, as well as 23mm Zu-23 anti-aircraft guns, also took part in the drills, which appears to have included live-firing the missiles against small drones. P-18 and Low Blow radars were also present. Observers noted that footage of troops using 9K338 Igla-S Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) appeared to be old and unrelated to the exercises on La Orchila. Update: 7:40 PM EST— Geolocation of the videos now indicates that only the BM-21s and BM-30s actually went to La Orchila. The Buk-M2Es and Pechora-2Ms were deployed to the Paraguana Peninsula, which is situated much further to the west in Venezuela’s Falcon State.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 28, 2021",One Of The Marine Corps’ Most Elite Units Has The Most Solemn Of Missions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we remember and thank the men and women who made the greatest sacrifice of all for their country on this Memorial Day, there are a few jobs within the U.S. military in which most days are their own mini-Memorial Days. One of them is the Marine Corps Body Bearer. They act as a rock of stoic stability in a sea of emotion and grief for families and friends who have lost a loved one. It seems like a nearly impossible job. Seeing so much tragedy on a regular basis. But for the elite team of Body Bearers, it is an absolute honor and one that requires focus and strength—both mentally and physically. The excellent videos below explain just what goes into this solemn position and how hand-selected Marines prepare to execute what is basically a no-fail mission. With just six men instead of usual eight carrying a coffin, they are unable to flinch or show any sign of fatigue or emotion. The USMC describes just how important and elite the role of the Body Bearer is, stating : “Company B is home to the Marine Corps’ Body Bearer Section. This elite unit, though small in number, is comprised of hand-selected candidates, who through the crucible of Body Bearer Ceremonial Drill School, honed their minds and bodies to recreate themselves into members of the most elite funeral detail in the United States’ Armed Forces. The primary mission of the Body Bearer section is to perform flawless funerals for Marines and Marine family members at Arlington National Cemetery and abroad. Additionally, the Body Bearer section is responsible for flawlessly executing a myriad of other ceremonial commitments that include: participating in Presidential, state and joint service funerals, manning the saluting battery of Marine Barracks Washington to render honors to dignitaries, and performing wreath-laying ceremonies across the National Capital Region. The family is the most cherished and important entity for the Body Bearer Section; flawless funerals are the standard the Section maintains for itself to show to the family the love and respect we have for our fallen Marines and the honor we take in being “the last to let you down”. For this reason, the road to becoming a Body Bearer is one of the most arduous paths one can take in the Marine Corps. Earning the right to perform the most solemn duty in the Marine Corps is an experience that will humble even the most prepared Marine. Marines in Ceremonial Drill School will be required to demonstrate the character and resolve to progress through the strict training regimen, the bearing to keep one’s composure no matter the circumstances, and progress from a physical strength and conditioning perspective to bear the weight of Marines’ caskets for our fallen heroes and their loved ones. Ceremonial Drill School is a self-paced program, meaning students will progress as quickly or slowly as their mental and physical faculties will allow. The average time it takes to create a Body Bearer typically ranges between six and twelve months. Earning the title of a Marine Corps Body Bearer is not the light at the end of the tunnel for students, however. Once earning Black and Gold, Body Bearers fight complacency by continuing to improve their strength, perfect their craft in the ceremonial drill they perform, and must continue to perform flawless funerals on a daily basis. This billet is not for everyone. Marine Corps Body Bearers serve as a tangible, physical manifestation of the institution that our fallen brothers and sisters have poured their hearts and souls into fortifying.  As such, the mental, emotional, and physical toll this responsibility exacts from the Body Bearers as well as Ceremonial Drill School students is immense. That being said, the honor and pride the Body Bearer Section takes in caring for Marines the way they do is one of the most gratifying experiences of their lives.” It really is amazing the dedication and fortitude of the Marines that do this job. Being faced with such sorrow so regularly and being able to compartmentalize it is something that seems superhuman. With that in mind, I am certainly greatful for the USMC Body Bearers and especially for all our fallen heroes that require their services.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 5, 2020",I Couldn’t Wait For The Future After Watching Beyond 2000 As A Kid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There probably hasn’t been a better time than now to escape within our own minds to simpler and frankly more optimistic times. Thinking of all the pop culture influences that were impressed upon me growing up, one weekly science magazine show was absolutely must-watch TV for me. It had a sense of mystery and cutting-edge intrigue about it, and the presenters and production were really fantastic, pulling in various personalities from around the tech world to showcase different technologies that could become staples in the millennium to come. It felt like truly an international affair. And that opening theme and sequence—unforgettable. It made you want to warp into a future that simply couldn’t come fast enough. That show was Beyond 2000. From what I understand, the show, which originated from Australia, had a remarkably long run under various monikers. It started off in 1981 as Towards 2000 , then became Beyond 2000 in the mid-1980s. It ran under that name with one multi-year hiatus until it was canceled in—you guessed it—1999. Apparently, it came back again in 2005 under the name Beyond Tomorrow , but I don’t remember it. And yeah, once again, that opening and soundtrack. It stuck with you! It’s amazing how something like that still lingers in your head after all these years. I remember clicking on to Discovery channel as a kid and seeing two versions, an earlier one that had more live-action scenes and a later one that relied heavily on CGI, which looked pretty damn slick for television of the time period. The hour-long show covered all types of future-tech topics, with a heavy dose of transportation-related segments. Everything from maglev trains to virtual reality to renewable energy to advanced robotics to cutting-edge defense tech was featured. The quality of the segments was great and included on-location, in-depth looks at what were mostly experimental technologies, some of which have come to fruition in the two decades since the original run of the show ended. In fact, for all the Popular Science hyperbole of the pre-internet age, Beyond 2000 was remarkably grounded and well-curated. Memories can be a generalizing enigma, but what I remember most is watching a smart dude with a mustache and an Australian tech reporter lady showing me all the fantastic stuff that was just around the corner. In an age when everything wasn’t available at our fingertips via a robust internet, this was heady content. The show was one part dreamer’s toybox and one part hard science reporting on the coolest topics around. For the techie, this was appointment television—if you missed it, there was no on-demand option, and good luck hitting the right episode on reruns. Looking back, it’s so interesting to think how much power even a syndicated cable show like this actually had at shaping technological expectations. How many young people were influenced by one of its segments? I think plenty. Some of those segments that have survived online make you realize just how long it takes to realize a technological dream. Decades have passed between when some of these concepts were presented in a developmental state and they have just now matured into a usable consumer state. Then there are some ideas that were just a bit too ambitious for the tech and marketplace realities of the time. Failure is the mother of innovation as they say. Regardless of where many of the ideas presented on Beyond 2000 ended up, this show, and others like it, certainly gave us great hope and excitement for the future. Today, we are maybe a bit too well informed to buy into some of the most overtly wide-eye concepts floating around. While that may be a good thing overall, it certainly doesn’t help with coalescing an optimistic view of technology like we once had, for better or worse. I would argue that every day is something like a Beyond 2000 episode for all of us now, but often in a darker sense. Things are moving so fast now and technology is so deeply integrated into our everyday lives that what is just around the corner often seems like not such a great thing. This is especially true in a brave new era where the discussion is turning to the possibility that the intelligent machines will destroy their makers in the end. As such, looking back and reviewing clips from Beyond 2000 is welcomingly reminiscent of a more innocent and optimistic time when it came to mankind’s relationship with technology and the possibilities that it would usher in a grand new millennium.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 29, 2020",B-1B Bomber Made Bold Flight Into The Sea Of Okhotsk That Is Surrounded By Russian Territory,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In something of an unprecedented move, according to aircraft trackers, a B-1B bomber on a global airpower mission flew into the Sea of Okhotsk on Thursday, a large bay-like body of water that is surrounded on three sides by Russian territory. The flight was the most provocative, so far, of a series of very long-range missions that the B-1B fleet has headed up after the Continuous Bomber Presence on the Pacific island of Guam was shuttered after 15 years. In its place is a new strategy for heavy bomber power projection to the Pacific Theater, dubbed Dynamic Force Employment, which is far less predictable than what came before and seemingly more aggressive in nature. A press release about this latest sortie doesn’t detail the one bomber’s detour into Russia’s backyard, but it does talk about how varied and long these missions are becoming, as well as the strategy behind them: In continued demonstration of the U.S. Air Force’s dynamic force employment model, two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancers flew from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and conducted training in Alaska and Japan May 21. In Alaska, the B-1s were joined by F-22s and F-16s out of the 3rd Wing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, to conduct a large force employment exercise in the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex. The crews then flew southwest to Japan where they completed familiarization training in support of U.S. European Command objectives. The bombers then continued south in the vicinity of Misawa, Japan integrating with the USS Ronald Reagan and a P-8 Poseidon to conduct Long Range Anti-Ship Missile training before returning to Guam. The B-1s and Airmen are currently deployed to Andersen AFB from 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, 7th Bomb Wing, Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, as part of a joint U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and U.S. Strategic Command Bomber Task Force (BTF). “These missions demonstrate our ability to hold any target at risk, anytime, and anywhere,” said Lt. Col. Ryan Stallsworth, 9th EBS commander. “The training value of these sorties is irreplaceable…our team conducted large force exercise training around Alaska with U.S. Air Force fighters, we conducted multiple standoff weapons training events, as well as integrated with U.S. naval assets along the way. From a readiness perspective, it is hard to think of a more valuable training sortie.” … “These missions make the DoD more ready, more lethal, and flat out stronger,” Stallsworth continued. “Our aviators are getting the chance to coordinate and practice time-sensitive target drills in the Pacific.” … “These types of sorties, with multiple training events, are not planned in a vacuum or stove-piped,” Stallsworth said. “These sorties effectively exercise our Department of Defense integration muscles [and] require multiple Combatant Commands to effectively plan and communicate, in order to synchronize effects in multiple domains.” The War Zone was the first to report on the ending of the Continuous Bomber Presence mission on Guam and the initial long-range flight that would soon become a common activity as the Air Force shuffled its strategic posture in the region. Since then, bombers have circumnavigated Japan, flown deep into the South China Sea, and have also made shorter duration deployments to Guam. This is in addition to missions to Europe . In recent memory, the closest they came to Russia’s domain in the Pacific was a trip across the Bering Strait and down along the Kamchatka Peninsula, that was until Thursday’s flight into the Sea of Okhotsk. Google Maps Although the B-1B’s close air support mission has made all the headlines over nearly two decades of the Global War On Terror, the aircraft’s ability to carry large amounts of standoff munitions, namely stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and their Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) cousins, are a larger focus of these missions today. Laying sea mines is another key capability that is coming back to the forefront of the bomber mission. So, whether it’s attacking highly defended surface or ground targets over long distances or denying enemy fleets access to key waterways, the B-1Bs pose a major threat to America’s adversaries in the region. In the future, hypersonic weapons will likely be added to the B-1B’s arsenal, as well. As such, flying into the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk is an ominous reminder of these capabilities and that real-world training is being executed to prepare crews to implement them during a peer state conflict. B-1B loaded with JASSMs on Guam. The pictures were a clear message intended to America’s top adversaries in the region. , USAF It isn’t clear what Russia’s response was to this mission or if the B-1B was intercepted and escorted during its time in the area, but less than a day after that mission took place, the Russians have launched their own long-range patrol near Alaska, according to our plane tracker friends. That event is ongoing, but ones like it are hardly rare these days. Oriana Pawlyk of Military.com recently talked to an official from Global Strike Command about this overall shift in bomber deployments. They mentioned that they are gathering data on the new strategy and that the Continuous Bomber Presence mission could be revived in the future. For now it’s all about the less predictable Dynamic Force Employment concept that we have discussed in depth in the past. Be sure to check out Oriana’s full article here . After years of supporting operations in the Middle East and beyond, the B-1B fleet became notoriously run-down , but after some time spent giving it much needed TLC, it is beginning to be able to surge again. The fleet overall is set to be cut substantially in the coming years as part of a plan to consolidate the beleaguered force . It will be interesting to see if the force can continue to bear the brunt of the long-range Dynamic Force Employment strategy going forward. Regardless, the Air Force is projecting power throughout the Pacific Theater and beyond like never before. We will just have to wait and see where they turn up next.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2019",The Amphibious Warship USS Portland Has Shot Down A Drone With Its New High-Power Laser,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The San Antonio class landing platform dock USS Portland has successfully knocked down a small drone using its new laser directed energy weapon. The ship was first spotted with the system installed as it left its homeport in San Diego California in December 2019, which The War Zone was first to report . The U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet announced the test of Portland ‘s laser weapon, which is formally known as the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) Mk 2 Mod 0, on May 22, 2020. The test itself took place on May 16 at an unspecified location in the Pacific Ocean. The service described the event as “the first system-level implementation of a high-energy class solid-state laser,” but did not say if this was the first time that the ship has actually fired the weapon. “The Solid State Laser Weapons System Demonstrator is a unique capability the Portland gets to test and operate for the Navy, while paving the way for future weapons systems,” Navy Captain Karrey Sanders, Portland ‘s commanding officer, said in a statement. “By conducting advanced at sea tests against UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] and small crafts, we will gain valuable information on the capabilities of the Solid State Laser Weapons System Demonstrator against potential threats.” The mounting configuration of the laser aboard USS Portland . , SUNDIEGOLIVE.COM CAPTURE The weapon being moved from Northrop Grumman’s facility in Redondo Beach before it was installed aboard the USS Portland in San Diego., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Northrop Grumman developed the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 for the Navy as part of the Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program and delivered it to San Diego for installation on Portland in late 2019, something The War Zone was also first to report . The service had announced that the San Antonio class ship would be the first to carry this laser weapon back in 2018 and had originally planned to conduct the first at-sea tests by the end of September 2019. USS Portland fires the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 on May 16, 2020., USN The Navy expects the 150-kilowatt class LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 to primarily provide ships with an additional line of defense against unmanned aircraft and small boat swarms . The laser can also act as a dazzler, blinding optical sensors and seekers. The full system can use its own integrated full-motion video cameras, which are used to track targets and aim the weapon, to conduct surveillance, as well. The SSL-TM program is just one of four active programs that the service is working on as part of the Navy Laser Family of Systems, which will hopefully serve as stepping stones to more powerful and otherwise capable laser weapons in the future. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey is also now equipped with what looks to be an initial version of the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system, another naval directed energy development that The War Zone was first to report on and that you can find out more about in this past piece . USN It’s worth noting that this is not the first time the Navy has installed an operational laser weapon system on a ship. The interim sea base USS Ponce carried the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System (LaWS) while deployed to the Middle East between 2014 and 2017. Northrop Grumman developed the LaWS, as well as the earlier Maritime Laser Demonstrator (MLD), both of which helped inform the development of the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0. Being in the 150-kilowatt class, the new laser weapon is significantly more powerful than the 15-kilowatt-class MLD and the 30-kilowatt-class AN/SEQ-3. “With this new advanced capability, we are redefining war at sea for the Navy,” the Portland ‘s Captain Sanders said. This successful test is certainly an exciting step forward for the Navy’s directed energy ambitions.

Full-scale manufacture of the variable-geometry bomber and missile carrier, which was developed toward the end of the Cold War , had ceased by 1995. After that, only a handful more were completed using existing components, before Moscow decided in 2015 to relaunch production in the upgraded Tu-160M form, primarily as an interim measure due to delays in the PAK DA new-generation bomber program. The first newly manufactured Tu-160M took to the air today, Jan. 12, at the factory airfield of the Kazan Aviation Plant, which is owned by Tupolev, the aircraft’s design bureau. Both those entities now come under the umbrella of the United Aircraft Corporation, UAC, part of the state-owned Rostec entity. The first newly manufactured Tu-160M at the Kazan Aviation Plant in the Republic of Tatarstan, western Russia., UAC According to a press release from UAC, the new Tu-160M was flown to an altitude of over 1,960 feet and was in the air for around 30 minutes. “The crew of test pilots of Tupolev PJSC performed maneuvers to check the stability and controllability of the aircraft in the air,” the statement added. UAC UAC The story of the Blackjack’s production relaunch began more than a decade ago, when Russia began work on the secretive PAK DA, expected to be a subsonic, stealthy, flying-wing design, to replace the current manned bomber fleet. This program has been dogged by delays and limited funding, and in 2015 the decision was made to resume series production of the Tu-160 and postpone the PAK DA. The decision to restart the Blackjack production line was announced by the Russian Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoygu, in April 2015, during a visit to the Kazan plant. A formal order for 10 new Tu-160Ms was then signed at the Kazan plant in January 2018, in the presence of President Vladimir Putin. At the time, the unit cost of each new bomber was put at around $270 million , and the first example was expected to be ready in 2021. Russian Aerospace Forces have declared a requirement for at least 50 new-build Tu-160M aircraft, although so far no further orders have been placed. 17 Tu-160s make up the current Blackjack fleet. Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, poses for a photo with employees at the Kazan Aviation Plant, January 25, 2018. , Alexei Nikolsky, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP Since the original Blackjack is long out of full-scale production, the effort to restart the line at Kazan has not been straightforward. In the meantime, however, the existing Tu-160 has been subject to an upgrade program, emerging as the Tu-160M. At one point, the new-build aircraft were to be designated Tu-160M2, to differentiate them from the modernized aircraft. In the event, the commonality between the older, upgraded jets and the new batch means they are both (somewhat confusingly) designated Tu-160M. With that in mind, the new Tu-160M that took to the air today should actually be very similar to the modernized Tu-160M, the first example of which — named Igor Sikorsky — took to the air in February 2020. The Tu-160M configuration introduces a completely new mission system and avionics . The original radar is replaced by the new NV-70M, while the crew is now provided with a cockpit equipped with digital displays, in place of the previous analog instruments. The flight control system, navigation equipment (which combines an inertial navigation system, astronavigation, Doppler navigation radar, satellite navigation receiver, and computer) and communication suite are also new. For self-protection, the Tu-160M introduces an all-new defensive suite, and there is also a new reconnaissance system, although we do not know exactly what that includes. We would imagine it is referring to a new electronic support measures (ESM) suite. A major hurdle in returning the Blackjack to production has been the requirement for new engines, with production of the original Kuznetsov NK-32 turbofan, the most powerful combat aircraft engine on earth , long having ceased. In its place, the company has developed the modernized NK-32-02, which also incorporates improved internal aerodynamics and more efficient cooling. This results in reduced fuel consumption, which Tupolev claims can increase the Tu-160M’s range by 13 percent. Flight test of an upgraded Tu-160M fitted with the new engines began in November 2020. In addition to these major issues, the production restart has also required Tupolev to digitize the design documentation of the aircraft and resume advanced vacuum-welding techniques for specific titanium components. The effort has also required the establishment of a new cooperative relationship between different industrial enterprises to ensure the required metallurgy, mechanical engineering, and instrument-making techniques are available. “Tu-160 is one of the largest and most high-tech projects in the aviation industry,” UAC General Director Yuri Slyusar said in a statement . “The implementation of this program required not only the renovation of production facilities but also the creation of a fundamentally new digital environment for working on the project. A number of aircraft design bureaus participated in the preparation of digital documentation for the project. The fundamental importance of today’s event is that the new machine has been completely rebuilt from scratch. The systems and equipment in the new machine have been updated and modernized by 80 percent.” The first new-build Tu-160M., UAC “We have restored the full production cycle of the Tu-160, but already in the M modification, using modernized engines, modernized aircraft control systems, navigation systems, and weapons control systems,” explained Denis Manturov, Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. “The modernization of the Kazan Aviation Plant played an important role in restoring the production of unique aircraft: the equipment of the shops, the flight test base was updated, the world’s largest installation for electron beam welding and vacuum annealing of titanium was put into operation. Today we see significant prospects for the Tu-160 platform: further development will make it possible to use it for new types of weapons, including promising ones.” It’s unclear what new weapons Manturov was referring to, but there are several possibilities. Among the munitions known to be in development for Russia’s heavy bombers is the Kh-SD, expected to be a subsonic missile that uses the same guidance system as the Kh-101 cruise missile now in service, but with a smaller airframe incorporating low-observable features. The result would provide the Tu-160M (and other aircraft ) with a weapon in the same class as the U.S. AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM . The Kh-BD is planned as the next-generation long-range cruise missile for the Tu-160M and other bombers and is expected to be based on the existing Kh-101 and Kh-102, ensuring the possibility of internal carriage in the Tu-160M. Reportedly, the Kh-BD should offer 50 percent more range than the basic Kh-101, which would enable it to hit targets at around 3,700 miles. Then there is the Kh-MTs, which is being developed under the GZUR hypersonic weapons program. This effort is being pursued by the Tactical Missiles Corporation and the Raduga design bureau and is reported to be based around a ramjet-powered missile that can attain a speed of Mach 6, with a range of over 900 miles when flying in a high-altitude profile. Although a handover date for the first new-build Tu-160M has not been published, the Russian Aerospace Forces will no doubt be looking forward to receiving their first genuine new-build bomber equipment since the mid-1990s. The Tu-160’s service history with Russia has been turbulent, to say the least, with most of the fleet being left on Ukrainian soil after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Eventually, eight Tu-160s were purchased by Russia from Ukraine, while limited production yielded another six examples completed at Kazan between 1992 and 1995. After that, using incomplete aircraft that had been left at the factory, three additional Tu-160s were finished and rolled out at Kazan in 1999, 2006, and 2017.

Official plans now call for the new Tu-160Ms to remain in service until the 2050s or even the 2060s, by which point the ultimate fate of the PAK DA should be clear. Update, 2.15 PM PST: The first official video of the maiden flight of the initial new-build Tu-160M has been released. The video has been published by the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda, and shows the swing-wing bomber beginning its flight-test program at a snowy Kazan Aviation Plant. TV Zvezda also noted that the commander of the Long-Range Aviation branch, Sergei Kobylash, announced earlier this month that the first two new-build Tu-160M aircraft would be delivered to the service in 2022.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Bomblet Dropping Drones Are Now Being Used By Cartels In Mexico’s Drug War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Extraordinary video footage has emerged reportedly showing a bomblet-dropping drone being used by one of Mexico’s increasingly well-armed drug cartels to attack one of its enemies. While we have reported previously about these groups using small quadcopter-type ‘suicide drones,’ each carrying a single explosive device , this is our best look at a drone acting as a bomber of sorts for cartel purposes. The video is filmed from the drone’s own camera. With the drone hovering over an enemy camp, several small munitions are seen being dropped through the trees, while multiple people targeted below run for their own protection. At least three separate explosions appear to set part of the camp ablaze before the second part of the video also records the crash of the drone, as it rapidly loses control and spirals to the ground. A report from the Quadratín Michoacán news channel yesterday includes the same video and notes that alleged members of the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), or Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which is primarily based in Jalisco state, western Mexico, bombed “at least two towns in Tepalcatepec with drones.” The municipality of Tepalcatepec is in the southwestern state of Michoacán, which borders Jalisco to the north and west. The two towns that were attacked are identified as El Bejuco and La Romera. The locations of the two towns that were reportedly attacked by drones, plus the nearby city of Tepalcatepec, within the municipality of the same name. , GOOGLE EARTH A map of Mexico showing the locations of the states of Jalisco and Michoacán., GOOGLE EARTH The same news channel says that the video first appeared on social networks and that the attacks have also been corroborated by local residents, although the status of any casualties and the extent of the damage is unknown. Quadratín Michoacán reports that the drones were “immediately shot down,” although it’s clear that at least one managed to deliver a number of munitions, and it can’t be confirmed if the drone we see crashing in the video was indeed brought down by groundfire or some other counter-drone device or even a malfunction. The drone strikes appear to be connected to the ongoing efforts of the drug lord and leader of the CJNG, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho , to take control of Tepalcatepec from the rival United Cartels. On Monday, alleged CJNG gunmen raided El Bejuco and La Romera, the two towns later reportedly hit by drone strikes. A wanted poster of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho, offering $10 million for information leading to his arrest., U.S. Department of State Perhaps not coincidentally, it was in Tepalcatepec that a previous cache of explosive-laden quadcopters — two dozen in all — thought to belong to the CJNG was discovered by a civilian self-defense militia in July 2020. These drones were reportedly found in a car that had been abandoned by cartel hitmen. One of the armed quadcopter drones reportedly captured in Tepalcatepec in July 2020., VIDEO CAPTURE VIA MEXICO NEWS DAILY In the July 2020 incident, the bombs attached to the drones consisted of plastic containers filled with C4 charges and ball bearings to act as shrapnel. The munitions dropped by the drone in the latest video appear more sophisticated, cylindrical in shape, and apparently fitted with some kind of tailfins to improve their accuracy. Notably, the latest drone type is able to deliver multiple munitions, allowing different targets to be attacked during the same flight, while the earlier types identified so far contained only one explosive charge and were designed to fly one-way missions. This same general improvized bomblet-dropping drone capability first appeared during the Battle of Mosul in Iraq back in 2017 and has since become far more widespread in war-torn locales. At the time, we pointed out how the capability would be a game-changer and how it would proliferate quickly to other conflicts and criminal organizations. You can check out that report here. Prior to that, quadcopters with explosives thought to belong to the CJNG were recovered in the city of Puebla, in the state of the same name, southeast of Mexico City, and subsequently elsewhere, in May 2020. The history of armed drones in the hands of the cartels goes back even further, to at least 2017. An earlier type of armed drone, based on a quadcopter, captured during a raid on the cartels in 2017., Mexican Federal Police Based on this limited evidence, it seems that CJNG’s ability to employ weaponized drones is very much still intact and its capabilities have even been improved through this latest, more sophisticated design. We have discussed the background to the CJNG before , but since its emergence in 2009, it’s become responsible for the movement of approximately one-third of all drugs from Mexico into the United States and has also sought to establish footholds in Europe and Asia. As well as drones, the CJNG can call upon a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and equipment. These include camouflaged trucks, pickups, and SUVs, some of them armed with mounted weapons and equipped with add-on armor. Its personnel are also heavily armed and provided with military-style tactical gear. Some examples of their equipment are seen in this video: Intriguingly, there are also reports that the CJNG previously made use of small, manned aircraft to drop improvised explosive devices on members of the Tepalcatepec self-defense militia. This tactic was apparently dropped after the Mexican government expanded its air surveillance in the region. The Mexican military is notably well equipped in this regard, with a variety of surveillance aircraft ranging from airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) platforms to adapted executive aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles outfitted with signals intelligence (SIGINT) equipment and other sensors. However, the detection of small drones like those so far used in the CJNG attacks is a much tougher proposition. A Mexican Air Force Embraer R-99 AEW&C aircraft. The type has been used to detect manned aircraft operated by the drug cartels., Zahpo75/Wikimedia Commons Using a drone to deliver munitions is not a huge leap for the CJNG, or other cartels, which already make extensive use of unmanned systems to both transport drugs and carry out surveillance . And, as we have seen in plentiful other examples , creating small bomb-carrying drones , especially those based on an off-the-shelf quadcopter or hexacopter design, is not necessarily a significant challenge. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has described a mobile counter-drone capability as an “ emerging requirement ,” and such is the proliferation of the threat that the U.S. military is now working hard to field effective countermeasures to small, bomb-carrying drones. These technologies include jammers , as well as directed-energy weapons, involving both lasers and high-power microwave beams. The use of small munitions-carrying drones by a cartel, albeit a notably well-equipped one, provides further evidence, as if it were needed, of the threat posed by these kinds of weapons. In the future, we are only likely to see more such drones in the hands of both non-state actors and regular military units.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Sep 27, 2022",Spaceship-Like Electric Aircraft ‘Alice’ Prepares For Its First Flight In These Awesome Images,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Eviation’s out-of-this-world-looking all-electric aircraft Alice was out in the open this week as it underwent engine testing leading up to its first flight. According to its manufacturer, the “world’s first all-electric commuter aircraft” could take to the skies after just several days’ more testing. Alice was spotted this week at Arlington Municipal Airport (KAWO), north of Seattle, Washington, where it performed engine testing in preparation for upcoming high-speed taxi tests. Aviation photographer Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren of JDL Multimedia snapped some great images of Alice as it went about its ground-testing preparations, which The War Zone subsequently obtained. Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, JDLMultimedia Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay told FLYING Magazine on Monday that while the company doesn’t want to commit to a first flight date yet, he feels they are only “five to six [nice weather] testing days away from starting the flight campaign.” According to Global Aviation Resource, however, the tests did not go well. The site reported that the plane’s second engine refused to start during this week’s test, triggering a shutdown of the first engine. Bar-Yohay released a video on Twitter of a separate low-speed taxi test conducted in December 2021 featuring a caption that compared Eviation’s efforts with the Wright Brothers’ first powered flight in 1903. An early configuration of Alice made its first appearance at the Paris Air Show in 2019, at which time the company claimed the aircraft could reduce carrier maintenance and operating costs by up to 70%. Eviation’s all-electric aircraft features a fly-by-wire system made by Honeywell and is powered by high-energy-density batteries that feed two tail-mounted 640-kilowatt magni650 motors manufactured by MagniX that push five-bladed propellers, which will hopefully give the plane a maximum cruise speed of 250 knots. In its ‘ commuter’ configuration , seen in these recent engine tests, the aircraft can accommodate nine passengers and a crew of two. Eviation is also planning an ‘ executive’ configuration that seats six passengers in larger, more luxurious seating, and a “cargo” configuration that includes forward and aft doors offering access to a 450-cubic-foot, temperature-controlled continuous cargo bay. Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, JDL Multimedia Alice is designed to boast a maximum range of 440 nautical miles and carry a maximum payload of 2,500 pounds. Alice’s total maximum take-off weight is 16,500 pounds, and its service ceiling is around 32,200 feet. The company claims Alice requires just 30 minutes of charging time per flight hour, meaning it could be recharged while unloading and loading cargo or passengers. The now-refined Alice airframe features a T-tail, high aspect ratio straight wings with winglets, and unique front-facing propellers mounted on nacelles that attach to the aircraft’s empennage via aft-mounted pylons. The aircraft’s domed-shaped fuselage features a sleek, highly elongated design giving Alice an almost spaceship-like appearance. The overall design is clearly highly optimized for efficiency, something every electric aircraft will need to strive for in order to overcome the technology’s current limitations. Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, JDL Multimedia Global logistics firm DHL announced a provisional order for 12 Alice cargo craft last year, writing that the company had “found the perfect partner with Eviation” with whom they can “take off into a new era of sustainable aviation.” Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay said the order fits with the company’s “audacious goal to transform the aviation industry and create a new era with electric aircraft,” claiming that the agreement shows “the electric era is upon us.” The CEO told CNBC that Alice could fit into existing logistics route networks, enabling a “nearly seamless” transition to electric aircraft for parcel and cargo operators. It’s too early to tell if the “electric era” is truly upon us just yet, but some market analysts predict the electric aircraft market could total close to $10 billion by 2027. That may be conservative if Alice, which represents a huge leap forward, is successful in delivering on its promises. Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, JDL Multimedia Dozens of other aerospace manufacturers, including the biggest ones in the business, are developing or funding their own electric aircraft designs. Airbus currently has a variety of all-electric demonstrators in its portfolio and has conducted a number of successful flights including one across the English Channel in 2015. Boeing and JetBlue funded the all-electric aircraft startup Zunum Aero in 2017, but that venture resulted in nothing but lawsuits . In 2020, Cessna flew an all-electric version of its 208B Grand Caravan in a 30-minute demonstration, although that aircraft was so heavily modified to fit its lithium batteries and cooling systems aboard that passengers could not even fit inside. “Yeah, I couldn’t fit a person in that aircraft. There was not even an attempt to put the batteries in a more convenient place,” MagniX CEO Roei Ganzarski said about the flight . “This specific eCaravan was designed as a flying testbed.” While the FAA has yet to certify any electric propulsion systems, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the world’s first in 2020 : the Pipistrel Velis Electro , a two-seater designed for daytime pilot training. The Danish Armed Forces have already signed up to lease two Velis Electros , which are being used for pilot training as part of a study into more environmentally friendly aircraft fleets. The Pipistrel Velis Electro., Wikimedia Commons/Airjuice Photography There are doubts about how widespread the use of electric aircraft could be in the near future, given the limitations on energy density in today’s battery technologies. The types of batteries being eyed for electric aircraft contain a small fraction of the energy by weight that aviation fuel has, meaning electric aircraft are still strictly limited to shorter flights of a few hours or less. While there are some new battery technologies on the horizon that could hold promise, we likely won’t see transcontinental electric flights just yet. Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, JDL Multimedia Still, electric air travel has to start somewhere. Even if all-electric commercial aircraft are limited to shorter commuter routes and cargo flights for the first several years ( or longer ), industry experts and private aerospace firms could gather valuable data that should help further refine the technology and develop the infrastructure necessary to support electric aircraft. The Eviation Alice used in recent engine tests., Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, JDL Multimedia And really, Alice represents much more capability than just ‘starting somewhere.’ If electric-powered flight takes off and rapidly evolves anywhere near as fast as we have seen in the electric car space, it could totally revolutionize aviation. This is especially true for general aviation, which has struggled to grow its ranks due to the high financial barrier to entry and increasing operational costs of general aviation aircraft. In other words, electric fixed-wing aircraft could usher in a renaissance of sorts for private aviation. What it could do for the commercial side of things may take more time, but it could become equally if not even more impactful in that space. There are also major military applications for some of this technology, as well. With this in mind, the success of Alice could be a big springboard into mainstreaming electric aircraft, and judging by these shots of the design in the flesh, it sure looks the part of a technological revolutionary.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 31, 2022",Mystery Surrounds FAA Order To Halt All West Coast Air Traffic After North Korean Missile Launch (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the afternoon of Monday, January 10, 2022, at around 2:30 PM PST, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop order to all planes, at least in the western United States. The temporary pause on all movements to and from airports included aviators being ordered to land and lasted roughly between seven and 20 minutes before it was lifted and services returned to normal. There has so far been no explanation given for this action. In this vacuum of information, some are connecting the highly peculiar event to another ballistic missile test launch out of North Korea, the second in less than a week , that traveled 435 miles from its launch point, impacting relatively far out into the sea of Japan. One pilot flying into Yuma told The War Zone they were alerted to what controllers called a “national ground stop” and ordered to land before it was lifted. On a Reddit/ATC thread , controllers were discussing the puzzling ground stop, which appears to have been contained to just the western United States. Some commented that they had not seen anything like it since 9/11. There was also an image that supposedly shows the flight slips with the ground stop orders on them that our friend @OSINTTechnical has reposted, as you can see below. We cannot confirm their authenticity at this time. There are a large number of clips going around of radio calls to aircraft giving them orders related to the ground stop, some citing a national security event: As it sits now, we cannot confirm that the North Korean launch did indeed spur this nearly unprecedented move by the FAA, but the timing is highly suspect. Initial reports indicate that the missile was launched at 2:27 PM PST (7:27 AM Korea Standard Time), almost simultaneous with the ground top order. Strategic Command executes emergency protocols whenever a potentially hostile ballistic missile launch is detected and only has moments to make decisions as to who to alert and how to respond. You can read all about this in our previous article linked here. If the North Korean missile test was miscategorized as a possible threat, even if briefly, there may be new protocols in place since the rogue Kim regime achieved ICBM capability to alert the FAA and issue a halt on operations. It’s also worth noting that this was likely another test of either a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle or a maneuvering re-entry vehicle (MaRV) , the latter of which would also travel at hypersonic speeds. Yonhap News states this test projectile reached Mach 10, double the velocity of the hypersonic threshold. Both hypersonic weapons concepts are built to evade missile defenses, but North Korea has not tested or displayed anything but short-range hypersonic vehicle capabilities, not ones that would even come close to threatening the U.S. homeland. Tracking and categorizing non-traditional hypersonic threats is a major hurdle the Department of Defense is working to overcome , and at great cost . The chronic ambiguity surrounding North Korea’s missile capabilities and testing initiatives doesn’t help the situation, either. So, could the launch have triggered precautions that were later rescinded once more about the missile’s path and other flight characteristics become known? Or was this some sort of blatant mistake? While automation is certainly a part of such a fast-moving, quick reaction strategic process, this could have been simple human error spurred by the missile test. On the other hand, it could have absolutely nothing to do with it at all and was just a coincidence. It’s not like we haven’t seen similar screw-ups before. What’s so strange is that for such a high-profile and peculiar event, there has been absolutely no messaging from the FAA about it. The War Zone has reached out to the FAA for an explanation. We will report back as soon as we learn more. Author’s note: A special thanks to our friend @OSINTTechnical for the heads up! Update, 10:15 AM EST: When contacted by The War Zone this morning, U.S. Strategic Command’s public affairs office declined to confirm or deny whether North Korea’s latest missile launch was treated, even for a brief time, as a threat to the United States, or whether or not it was otherwise related to the FAA ground stop order. They directed to the FAA as the most appropriate point of contact for our queries. Update, 10:55 AM EST: The U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) did not issue an alert over North Korea’s missile launch, or for any other reason, leading FAA to order the ground stop order, a spokesperson for the command told The War Zone , refuting a story that had been published earlier today by CNN . Update, 1:05 PM EST: The FAA has finally issued a statement about the ground stop order, which is as follows: As a matter of precaution, the FAA temporarily paused departures at some airports along the West Coast on Monday night. Full operations resumed in less than 15 minutes. The FAA regularly takes precautionary measures. We are reviewing the process around this ground stop as we do after all such events.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan has lost one of its recently upgraded F-16V fighter jets , the aircraft crashing into the sea. The incident comes just weeks after the type was declared fully operational with the Republic of China Air Force, or ROCAF, an event that you can read about in detail here . According to the Rescue Command Center, helicopters and ships are now involved in the effort to try and locate the pilot, while training on the type has reportedly been suspended , although the full extent of the grounding order is currently unclear. The video below, released by the Coast Guard, shows part of their response to the accident: The F-16, a single-seater, reportedly crashed at 3:26 PM local time today, coming down in the sea off Dongshi, around 14.5 miles west of Chiayi Air Base, in the west of Taiwan. The jet apparently had departed the base around 30 minutes earlier, for a routine training sortie over the Shuixi coastal range. This reportedly involved firing the aircraft’s onboard 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon to strafe training targets on the ground. The location of Chiayi Air Base in the west of Taiwan., GOOGLE EARTH A satellite view of Chiayi Air Base., GOOGLE EARTH The aircraft in question, with the serial number 6650 and assigned to Chiayi’s 21st Tactical Fighter Group, was originally delivered to the ROCAF as an F-16A, sometime in the late 1990s . It had since been upgraded to F-16V standard, as part of a wide-ranging modernization that’s underway for the Taiwanese F-16 fleet. The same jet is also seen at the top of this article, photographed during a drill at Chiayi on January 5 this year. The ROCAF is the first F-16 operator anywhere in the world to field combat-capable F-16Vs. In Taiwanese service, the updated jets are also referred to as the F-16A/B Block 20 MLU. The F-16V is considered the most advanced fighter in the ROCAF inventory, and the declaration of full operational capability (FOC) with the service at Chiayi last November came with significant fanfare, including a visit to the resident 4th Tactical Fighter Wing by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen in the cockpit of an F-16V at Chiayi Air Base., AP/COPYRIGHT 2021 Ironically, that event had been postponed partly as a result of a number of earlier accidents involving ROCAF aircraft. This, combined with the COVID pandemic, led to delays in marking FOC. Previously, Chiayi had marked the initial operational capability milestone with an announcement in March 2021, after which active training began on the jets. As of last November, it was reported that 64 of Taiwan’s F-16s had been upgraded. We have discussed the scope of the work in the past, suffice to say it represents a considerable advance for the 1980s-era F-16A/B fleet and includes the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), with an active electronically scanned array (AESA), providing much-increased detection and engagement ranges, as well as enhancements in reliability. The Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 SABR radar installed in an F-16., U.S. Air Force Original plans called for the ROCAF to receive 144 F-16Vs, all produced via conversion of existing F-16A/B jets, but this number was later reduced to 141 through attrition to the existing Viper fleet. Today’s accident will further reduce that total to 140 jets. It has, however, been a very protracted journey getting to this point. Taiwan’s plans to upgrade its F-16s date back over a decade, after the Obama administration turned down requests for new-build F-16s. The U.S. Congress was first notified of a planned Foreign Military Sale for an F-16 upgrade back in September 2011, then valued at an estimated $5.3 billion. After Lockheed Martin won a $1.85-billion contract for the upgrade work in October 2012, the project was dealt a blow when the U.S. Air Force abandoned its parallel Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES) program to upgrade its own F-16s, forcing Taiwan to take on additional test-related costs. After the first two F-16Vs were upgraded by Lockheed Martin in the United States, where a first example flew in October 2015, further work has been handed in Taiwan by the Aerospace Industry Development Center (AIDC). Upgrade work is now scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023. The importance of the F-16V to the ROCAF has only been emphasized by recent operations by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in airspace around Taiwan as well as by rapid developments in China’s own fighter fleets. An idea of the scale of the task presented to the ROCAF can be seen in the increase in PLA activity in the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone , or ADIZ, last year. According to the Financial Times , since September 2020, China has sent military aircraft into the ADIZ for an average of 20 days each month. In one spike over just four days last October, no fewer than 149 PLA aircraft entered the ADIZ in different waves. The upgraded Viper is poised to bring a host of new weapons to the fleet. Expected to be added to the F-16V are the AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation ( HARM ) missile for defense suppression, the AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon ( JSOW ), and the Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response ( SLAM-ER ). The SLAM-ER adds an especially powerful long-range precision-strike capability, with a range of 170 miles. Aside from the F-16s, the ROCAF has a frontline fighter fleet that includes 55 French-supplied Mirage 2000-5s and 129 locally built F-CK-1 Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF). In the future, the ROCAF is set to gain more F-16s, in the shape of 66 new-build Block 70 F-16C/D jets . The previous Trump administration approved the sale of these jets, which have a similar general configuration to the F-16V, as part of efforts to expand the U.S. government’s relationship with Taiwan. The package is worth an estimated $8 billion.

The F-16V, however, presents a compromise here, with advanced equipment being added to existing airframes. The loss of an aircraft so soon after the declaration of FOC is a blow to the ROCAF, although for now hopes rest on the safe recovery of the pilot. The incident also continues an unhappy period of attrition for the service, marking the sixth aircraft loss since the beginning of 2020. Previous incidents involved an F-16A in late 2020, while pair of F-5E fighters crashed into the sea last year after an apparent mid-air collision. While there is nothing to suggest that these accidents are in any way connected, or reflect underlying issues within the ROCAF, their timing is unfortunate, to say the least, as the service finds itself stretched to respond to the high tempo of PLA aircraft activity over the Taiwan Strait. We will continue to update this report as more details become available. Update, 12:15 PM PST: As the search for the missing pilot of ROCAF F-16V serial 6650 continues, some further details about the mishap have emerged. The pilot at the controls of the jet was Capt. Chen Yi, who had joined the ROCAF in March 2020 and had almost 322 hours under his belt, more than 60 of which were in F-16s. The ROCAF say they lost contact with the jet at 3:26 PM local time — just three minutes before it reportedly impacted the sea. There was no mayday call or sign of a parachute and the jet is said to have banked sharply before impacting the Taiwan Strait at high speed. These details were confirmed by Maj. Gen. Liu Hui-chien, an air force inspector general, at a news conference today. “As it’s now edging into night, the search and rescue situation is quite challenging,” Maj. Gen. Liu said. He also confirmed that rough seas were making rescue efforts harder. A series of photos showing these efforts have also been released by the Taiwanese Central News Agency (CNA) and are posted below, including flares illuminating the skies: CNA CNA CNA CNA Maj. Gen. Liu also revealed that serial 6650 was involved in a previous incident last September when the landing gear was mistakenly retracted, although it only sustained minor damage on that occasion. A report in the Wall Street Journal confirms that, as of this evening, all ROCAF F-16s have been grounded as a safety precaution.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2021",Undersea Cable Connecting Norway With Arctic Satellite Station Has Been Mysteriously Severed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An undersea fiberoptic cable located between mainland Norway and the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean has been put out of action in a still-mysterious incident. The outage on the subsea communications cable — the furthest north of its kind anywhere in the world — follows an incident last year in which different cables linking an undersea surveillance network off the Norwegian coast were severed, a story that we covered in detail at the time . The latest disruption involves one of two fiberoptic cables that enable communications between the Norwegian mainland and Norwegian-administered Svalbard that lies between the mainland and the North Pole. The outage occurred on the morning of January 7, but was first widely reported yesterday. The extent of the damage is not clear from the official press release from Space Norway, the country’s space agency, which maintains the cables primarily in support of the Svalbard Satellite Station (SvalSat), but it is significant enough that it is expected to require the services of an ocean-going cable-laying vessel. The Svalbard Satellite Station atop the mountain of Platåberget on the island of Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway., Bjoertvedt/Wikimedia Commons In addition to the SvalSat facilities, the fiber-optic cables provide broadband internet to Svalbard. The SvalSat site consists of more than 100 satellite antennas on a mountain plateau and is the largest commercial ground station of its kind. Being located between mainland Norway and the North Pole means that SvalSat is in much demand with operators of polar-orbiting satellites, being one of only two ground stations from which data can be downloaded from these types of satellites on each of the Earth’s rotations. Space Norway, which operates the undersea cables, confirms that the second is still functioning normally, but the loss of the first means there is now no redundancy available until repairs can be made. The location of the disruption is in the Greenland Sea, between 80 and 140 miles from the town of Longyearbyen on Svalbard, the largest inhabited area on the archipelago. According to Space Norway, the affected cable is on part of the seabed that slopes down from 980 to 8,800 feet. This is why a cable-laying vessel will be needed to conduct the repairs, the difficulty of which will also be dependent on the depth of the damage section and the potential for poor weather. A map showing the respective locations of Longyearbyen on Svalbard and Andøya in northern Norway., GOOGLE EARTH Known as the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, the dual communication cable runs between Longyearbyen and Andøya in northern Norway, each stretching more than 800 miles. The Cable Innovator was one of the cable-laying vessels involved in laying the Svalbard Undersea Cable System., Nsandel/Wikimedia Commons Beyond that it is damaged, what happened to the cable is otherwise unclear at present. When cables that were part of the Lofoten-Vesterålen (LoVe) Ocean Observatory were severed last year, suspicion in some quarters fell upon the Russian government, which certainly has the means to do so . “Something or someone has torn out cables in outlying areas,” Geir Pedersen, the LoVe project leader, said in a press statement last November. It was reported at the time that more than 2.5 miles of fiber optic and electrical cables had been severed and then removed. In total, LoVe uses more than 40 miles of cables in the Norwegian Sea. Cables for the LoVe ocean observatory are prepared for deployment in May 2020., LOVE OCEAN OBSERVATORY Large parts of the missing cable in the LoVe incident were subsequently located “a good distance away from where it was originally located,” according to Norway’s state-operated Institute of Marine Research, or IMR. The reason for the severed cables in the LoVe Ocean Observatory is still unclear, but the IMR is pursuing the matter with the Norwegian police. Now, Space Norway says it will examine what was responsible for the outage on the Svalbard Undersea Cable System. At the same time, Norway’s Ministry of Justice and Public Security says it’s also following the situation closely. As for the likelihood of deliberate sabotage on the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, this remains a possibility, as in the case of the LoVe Ocean Observatory cables. The military value of the cables, and moreover of the SvalSat facility, is another potential reason for an espionage or sabotage mission. Although Svalbard itself is a designated demilitarized zone, there have been persistent suggestions — including from Russia — that SvalSat facilities on the archipelago are used to download data from military as well as commercial satellites. This is despite the fact that this would constitute a violation of the treaty that governs the demilitarized zone. The investigation will likely include an effort to identify any ships or submarines that were active in the area in question around the time that the disruption was first reported. However, if a vessel was involved in deliberately tampering with the cable, it may have been operating without its transponder activated, meaning it would not have been broadcasting its positions to the Coast Guard or other agencies. That does not mean the vessel would have been invisible by any means, but it could have gone about its mission with less chance of scrutiny. The inner workings of the Svalbard cables themselves could yield useful technical details, for anyone wanting to develop a similar system, for example. There is also the possibility that a rival power may wish to understand exactly what if any military-related data passes from satellites to the SvalSat facility, for onward transmission. This opens up the possibility that the damage could have been the result of failed undersea espionage operation to tap the cables or otherwise extract valuable data. Beyond all this, the cables simply lie in an area that is of strategic significance to both Norway and Russia. It is a particularly vital passageway for Russian naval vessels, including surface ships and submarines, which use it to proceed from their bases in the northwestern part of the country out into the Atlantic. Determining whether or not any undersea network in this region has the ability to monitor those movements would be of great interest to the Russian Navy and the country’s intelligence agencies. Just as was the case with the LoVe Ocean Observatory cables, there could be a more innocuous explanation as to the damage to the Svalbard cable, perhaps an accidental entanglement with a vessel or as the result of deep-sea dredging during natural resources exploration. Sign warning vessels to avoid snagging a fiber-optic cable on the coast of Svalbard., Bjoertvedt/Wikimedia Commons However, the location of the incident, in the approaches to the increasingly strategic Arctic region may again lead to the suspicion that Russia may have played a role in the outage. As well as a spike in underwater activity by Russia in this area, the country is also busily establishing or reactivating military garrisons and airbases, including a growing number of forward-located airfields in the High North. The Russian Navy has also been involved in establishing underwater sensor networks and other infrastructure , including nuclear reactors on the seafloor. After all, Norway has previously accused Russia of interfering with and otherwise aggressive actions toward its sensor and communications networks. In 2018, the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) disclosed three separate instances in which Russian aircraft flew mock attack profiles against a secretive radar station in the north of the country. In 2017, the same agency blamed Russian jamming for disrupting cell phone and GPS services, due to electronic emissions during a military exercise. The Vardø radar installation and its Globus II array , which Raytheon originally built for the U.S. Air Force, were reportedly subject to mock Russian air attacks in the past., MICHAEL NARTEN/PICTURE-ALLIANCE/DPA VIA AP The Russian Navy does have the capability to investigate and disrupt undersea cables. Last year, for example, the survey ship Yantar was operating off the Atlantic coast of Ireland . This vessel is known to carry deep-sea submersibles and sonar systems and has been suspected of covert operations involving undersea cables. It is often spotted operating in waters where cable lines are known to run down below. Russia also operates a range of special mission submarines, as well as unmanned underwater vehicles of various types, which could potentially be equipped to both cut and tap cables. Among the most capable of these is the nuclear-powered midget submarine Losharik , which is also understood to be particularly tricky to detect and monitor, and that you can read more about here . Howevr, Losharik has been laid up since suffering extensive damage in a fatal fire in 2019. Russia does still have other similar special-mission boats available , as well as large mothership submarines that can are suitable for bringing them covertly to and from a mission area. Once again, we have no evidence that this latest incident was related to Russian activity, but it does provide another reminder of the vulnerability of undersea cables and other infrastructure, whether to interference by hostile powers or not. Ultimately, a single submarine could pose a significant asymmetric naval threat, with the loss of a single cable having a disproportionate impact on a country’s information warfare capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2022",Kazakhstani Troops Caught Wearing Unsanctioned Blue U.N. Peacekeeping Helmets During Crackdown,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Authorities in Kazakhstan have drawn new criticism over their crackdown on anti-government protesters after pictures emerged showing members of the country’s security forces wearing blue helmets emblazoned with the acronym “UN.” The United Nations has since expressed concern over the use of personnel wearing these helmets, who are assigned to U.N.-backed Kazakhstani peacekeeping unit, for internal security missions. U.N. and Kazakhstani officials have both confirmed that the international body has not sanctioned any peacekeeping mission in the country, though a Russian-led security bloc has been in the process of sending thousands of troops to this Central Asian country ostensibly for that purpose. Vladimir Tretyakov, a photographer working for Kazakh news outlet Novosti Kazakhstana , took the photographs of members of this dedicated peacekeeping force, known as the Kazakhstan Battalion (KAZBAT), manning checkpoints in the country’s largest city of Almaty on Jan. 6, 2022. That was a day after the largest protests in years against Kazakhstan’s dictatorial regime, triggered by a hike in state-subsidized fuel prices and further exacerbated by other long-standing grievances, morphed into major civil unrest across the country. A KAZBAT member with a PK-type light machine gun standing in the hatch of a U.S.-made 4×4 Humvee light tactical vehicle in Almaty on Jan. 6, 2022., Vladimir Tretyakov/NUR.KZ via AP KAZBAT members were seen in the pictures, seen above and below in this story, armed with Soviet-designed AK-series assault rifles and PK-type light machine guns , as well as riot control grenades. The exact type of grenades is unclear, but the box personnel are seen grabbing them from appears to be marked either or RG3-60KD or RGZ-60KD in Cyrillic. A similar-looking RGK-60KD grenade , which contains a flash-bang stun element and a chemical irritant, can be found on the website of Rosoboronexport, Russia’s official state arms broker. A close-up of a box of riot control grenades seen in one of the pictures of KAZBAT members deployed on the streets of Almaty during the recent unrest., Vladimir Tretyakov/NUR.KZ via AP An RGK-60KD riot control grenade., Rosoboronexport At least one U.S.-made 4×4 Humvee light tactical vehicle is seen in the photographs, as well. This is not the first time these vehicles, which were provided as part of American military aid packages years ago, have reportedly been employed to help quell civil unrest in the country. Personnel from KAZBAT, which was first created in 2000, have trained with U.S. military personnel , as well as those from other NATO member countries , in the past, among others, as part of ensuring that force is properly qualified to support U.N. missions. KAZBAT personnel in Almaty. A U.S.-made Humvee is seen in the background., Vladimir Tretyakov/NUR.KZ via AP “We have conveyed our concern to the Permanent Mission of Kazakhstan on this issue,” a U.N. spokesperson told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ( RFE/RL ), a U.S. government-funded media outlet in response to questions about the pictures, according to a story published today . They also made clear that this organization has not authorized a peacekeeping mission in Kazakhstan. “United Nations troop and police contributing countries are to use the UN insignia only when they are performing their mandated tasks as UN peacekeepers, in the context of their deployment within a United Nations peacekeeping operation as mandated by the UN Security Council,” that same spokesperson added in their statement. RFE/RL separately reached out to a representative of Kazakhstan’s armed forces in Almaty, who said these individuals had been deployed without any official sanction from the United Nations and with the mission of “guarding strategic objects, airports, and governmental buildings.” That same individual said that half of KAZBAT is in Kazakhstan, while the other half is currently deployed to Libya. That latter point appears to be a mistake on that spokesperson’s part, confusing Libya for Lebanon, where Kazakh peacekeepers have been working alongside their counterparts from India since 2018. There is no U.N. peacekeeping mission in Libya at present, though the international body does maintain a political mission in that country. Whether or not any KAZBAT personnel are still supporting internal security operations in Almaty or anywhere else in Kazakhstan is unclear. It’s also not clear whether putting these troops on the streets with their blue helmets was some kind of attempt to falsely suggest that the United Nations was involved or simply a reflection of a haphazard rush to deploy additional security forces. The members of this battalion, which are drawn from the country’s airborne forces, would certainly be among the better trained, equipped, and paid members of Kazakhstan’s military, and have been deemed more effective and politically reliable as a result. The video below shows KAZBAT personnel during riot control training as part of the U.S.-led Exercise Steppe Eagle 2014. Separately, thousands of troops from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), of which Kazakhstan is a member, started flooding into the Central Asian country last week ostensibly on a ‘peacekeeping mission.’ Some of the Belarusian ‘peacekeepers’ now operating in Kazakstan under the authority of the CSTO also appear to be from a unit created to support missions approved by the U.N. and other international organizations, who wear an insignia that incorporates elements of the United Nations logo. A member of Belarus’ specialized peacekeeping company in Kazakhstan wearing an insignia that incorporates elements of the United Nations logo., Belarusian Ministry of Defense A full-color patch with the insignia of Belarus’ Peacekeeping Company., Dzmitry Rabikhin/Creative Commons via RFE/RL This is the first time ever that the CSTO has launched any such intervention and Russia and its other member states have sent various types of armored vehicles , as well as electronic warfare systems , among other seemingly more combat-oriented assets, to support the operations. The Russian Ministry of Defense said a key objective of these deployments was freeing up Kazakh state security forces from having to man checkpoints and otherwise perform other static security tasks so that they could take a more active role in putting an end to the unrest. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1LCoBXthUGw The Office of Kazakhstan’s President, Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev, declared today that order had been restored in the country, despite reports of continued sporadic clashes. At the time of writing, Kazakh authorities have acknowledged the deaths of 164 people, including a four-year-old girl and other civilians, as well as members of the state security forces, and that thousands more have been injured. Last week, President Toqaev said he issued a shoot-to-kill order against what he branded as groups of “bandits and terrorists.” Before that, a state police spokesperson had said that “dozens of attackers were liquidated” in the government’s response to the protests, though the exact definition of “liquidated” in this context remains unclear. Officials also say that thousands of people have been arrested in relation to the violence. Otherwise, much of what actually touched off this unrest in Kazakhstan, and what the future of the country’s regime might be at this point, remains murky. Kazakh officials, as well as those from other CSTO countries, have implied that foreign actors, or at least those based overseas, such as dissidents living in self-imposed exile , helped foment the situation. No evidence has been provided to substantiate those claims, but Toqaev is now describing what happened as an attempted coup . At least one self-styled rebel group has emerged, but their actual capacity to wage resistance against the government remains unclear. There have been other reports that suggest the violence might actually reflect a power struggle within the regime. Toqaev notably stripped his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled the country from 1990 until 2019, of a key role as the protests grew in what had seemed to be a concession. There were reports that Nazarbayev had fled into exile, which Toqaev’s regime has denied . Former Prime Minister Karim Massimov, who had also previously been in charge of the National Security Committee (NSC), the country’s successor to its branch of the Soviet-era KGB intelligence and internal security agency, was arrested today on suspicion of treason. Three other state security officials reportedly died today , one from a suicide, another from a heart attack, and the last from falling out of a window. Why the CSTO decided to respond to Toqaev’s request for assistance within a day, despite having rejected all requests for help from other member states in the past, remains equally unclear. Russia certainly has significant military, economic, and other interests in Kazakhstan. It is clear, whatever the exact reasoning for the intervention might have been, that the Kremlin viewed this as a particularly sensitive situation in a country that is of significant geopolitical importance along a large stretch of its southern border. Putin has now declared the CSTO’s response to be a major victory for the bloc and specifically said that it prevented a so-called “color revolution” in Kazakhstan. This is a common reference to various popular uprisings around the world in the past two decades or so, including in countries that had been part of the Soviet Union or otherwise in its sphere of influence, which often led to the unseating of pro-Russian governments. This includes the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, a country where fears have been growing for months now about the potential for new large-scale Russian military intervention . “Of course, we understand the events in Kazakhstan are not the first and far from the last attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of our states from the outside,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said today , speaking remotely with the heads of state of the other CSTO members, including Toqaev. “The measures taken by the CSTO have clearly shown we will not allow the situation to be rocked at home.” Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with the leaders of the CSTO member states on Jan. 10, 2022., Alexei Nikolsky, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP Putin said that Russian and other CSTO troops will remain in Kazakhstan as long as necessary to ensure anti-government elements, who he described as “terrorists, criminals, looters and other criminal elements,” were suitable dealth with. Kazakh officials have said that the bloc’s forces could start to leave as early as next week , but it remains to be seen if all of the troops, especially Russian forces, will actually depart the country. What impacts the upheaval, together with the subsequent government crackdown, might have now on Kazakhstan’s relationship with the broader international community, such as the future of KAZBAT’s involvement in U.N. peacekeeping missions, remains to be seen. President Toqaev’s regime, at least for the time being, certainly seems to be on a more stable footing. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 26, 2021",This Footage Of Jet-Powered Coyote Drones Obliterating Other Drones Is Incredible,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Raytheon released incredible new footage today of its Block 2+ Coyote drones engaging a number of unmanned aerial vehicles in a downright impressive undated demonstration. The video shows 4×4 M-ATV -based and fixed palletized launch systems firing the Coyotes, which then spectacularly defeat a variety of fixed-wing unmanned vehicles at different altitudes. The video, shared to YouTube today, shows the Raytheon Coyotes defeating a number of fixed-wing drones during testing at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona last year. The blast-fragmentation warheads on the Coyotes explode with a ring-shaped blast pattern radiating out from their longitudinal axis, producing quite the fireworks show. Two of the clips in the 1:40 video feature captions declaring the demonstrations were of a “High Altitude Test” and a “Low Altitude Test.” According to the video’s title, Raytheon claims this system “proves counter-UAS effectiveness against enemy drones.” Another shows a purely hit-to-kill engagement where the Coyote impacts the drone without exploding. A still of a Coyote defeating an unmanned aerial vehicle., Raytheon via YouTube In the description accompanying the video, Raytheon says the demonstrations took place in cooperation with the U.S. Army’s Integrated Fires and Rapid Capabilities Office (IF/RCO) during a “10-day summer test period.” The company stated the Coyotes’ palletized launcher system seen in the footage featured a KuRFS precision targeting radar, while the launcher seen aboard an Army M-ATV-based M-LIDS launcher used a Ku-720 mobile sensing radar system. These fire control systems cue the drones to intercept their targets. The palletized version seen in the footage would be able to be transported and deployed in forward operating areas or even aboard large ground vehicles or surface vessels, enabling a wide variety of platforms to have their own short-range air defenses . A Coyote destroys an unmanned aerial vehicle., Raytheon via YouTube The Coyote is a small, tube-launched UAV with a flexible launch system capable of being installed on a wide variety of platforms including unmanned underwater vehicles or unmanned surface vehicles. Earlier versions of the Coyotes were propeller-powered and resembled fixed-wing aircraft with pop-out wings and twin tails. These types were intended primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance roles. The Block 2 Coyotes have a much more missile-like configuration and feature four maneuverable control surfaces in their tail sections. A rocket motor gives these newer Coyotes their initial thrust, after which a small jet turbine takes over. This particular propulsion and control scheme is said to give the Coyote 2s a “ dogfight-type of capability ” according to Raytheon, making it capable of engaging highly maneuverable targets. A Raytheon spokesperson told The War Zone that the Block 3 Coyotes, meanwhile, feature a more traditional UAV design with wings similar to the original Coyote Block 1. Some version of the Coyote was forward deployed to an undisclosed location aboard the Marine Corps’ Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) Counter-UAS system, which is M-ATV-based, but it’s unclear how widespread its usage has been or if that particular system is still in use. As of June 2021, the Army was planning to send its own M-LIDS featuring the Raytheon Coyote to an unnamed forward location in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility . This is particularly interesting given that separate video footage appeared online earlier this week that shows two ‘suicide drones’ being shot down as they approach Ain Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, which hosts U.S. forces. A Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, which is armed with a 20mm Vulcan cannon, brings down one of the explosive-laden unmanned aircraft. An unknown physical interceptor explodes near the other drone. The interceptor in that video footage, seen in the Tweet below, is visible briefly flying at a relatively low speed and with a level flight profile that is very reminiscent of the Coyote’s mode of operation as seen in Raytheon’s newly released footage. The explosive pattern of that unknown interceptor, and the proximity at which it detonates to the target, are also somewhat similar to what we have now seen with regards to the Coyote Block 2+. While there’s been no official statement that suggests the Coyote was used in this particular interception, the Pentagon has yet to release any details about which system was used in the Al Asad engagement. The War Zone reached out to the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more information about this incident, but has not yet received a response. A targeting drone explodes after being engaged by a Coyote., Raytheon via YouTube As the footage released by Raytheon today shows, the Coyote is a capable counter-unmanned aerial system (cUAS) platform, making it well suited for the types of engagements seen this week in Iraq. In addition to cUAS roles, the Department of Defense has also envisioned the interceptor drone acting as a loitering munition or “ low-cost cruise missile .” The Coyote is also capable of swarming operations and can be equipped with non-kinetic cUAS payloads such as those used in a summer 2021 demonstration at Yuma Proving Ground, also conducted with the Army’s Indirect Fires and Rapid Capabilities Office. It’s unclear if the footage released today was taken at the same demonstration. The Coyote is quickly proving itself to be a capable platform, able to carry out a variety of mission roles. As for the Coyote Block 2+, we likely we’ll see more of the diminutive jet-powered drones in future deployments given how vital cUAS and short-range air defense systems are becoming to maintaining air superiority .

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2021",USS Abraham Lincoln’s American Flag Got Tangled-Up In Its Radar As It Left On Deployment (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We often report of the increasingly gargantuan flags Navy ships fly when entering or leaving port . While they look amazing and are a great source of morale and pride for crews, apparently, at least in some cases, they can also cause some issues if their deployment doesn’t go just right. A video has emerged showing that the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln had an unusual incident of sorts as it left San Diego, California on Monday. The ship’s crew can be seen hoisting a large American flag over the carrier’s island. Before it gets all the way up on the line, it gets tangled up with the vessel’s rotating AN/SPS-49 radar. Our friends over at @WarshipCam on Twitter posted footage of the incident, seen below, which came from user @cjr1321 , earlier today. Lincoln sailed out of San Diego on Jan. 3, 2022, on what is a historic deployment , the first-ever in Navy history involving a carrier commanded by a female officer. Capt. Amy Bauernschmidt became the ship’s commanding officer in August 2021. It’s also the first carrier deployment of Marine Corps F-35Cs. The video shows the basics of what happened relatively clearly. As the flag began to be raised, the radar’s feed horn snags it. As the radar continues spinning, the flag progressively wraps more and more around its base. The spinning eventually stops, though it’s not clear if the flag was physically preventing it from doing so or if it was shut down. The AN/SPS-49 is one of a number of radars installed on Nimitz class carriers and is a two-dimensional, long-range L-band air search type. It is a complement to the ship’s AN/SPS-48 three-dimensional, long-range E/F-band air search radar. The video below shows the AN/SPS-49 on the decommissioned Iowa class battleship USS New Jersey , which is now a museum ship. It’s unclear if there was any significant damage or other impacts from this incident. In the video, the radar is seen still stationary as the carrier passes into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California, but it is hard to see if the flag is still wrapped around the base. The AN/SPS-48, which had been rotating earlier on, is also stopped at that point. Powerful military and even some civilian ship radars are often switched off as a general rule when close to shore due to safety and health concerns . The War Zone has reached out to the U.S. Navy for more information about exactly what occurred. One reply to @WarshipCam’s posting of the video on Twitter pointed out that if the flag was not eventually raised as the carrier left port that this might have raised concerns among any particularly superstitious sailors on board. Regardless, the Navy’s Nimitz class carriers are to set to eventually receive an upgrade to their radars that could eliminate any possibility of this incident repeating itself. These ships are expected to receive Raytheon’s new, vastly more capable AN/SPY-6(V)2 Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) in the coming years, which will replace their AN/SPS-48 and possibly the AN/SPS-49, as well. You can read more about the capabilities of the EASR, which is an advanced active electronically-scanned array (AESA) type, here . Hopefully, the flag incident was resolved quickly and without issue and Abraham Lincoln has been able to have an otherwise uneventful start to its historic cruise.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Aerospace Forces’ Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback strike aircraft, also known by its nickname ‘Hellduck,’ is pretty much an anomaly among military aircraft in production today, with a mission profile that’s close to unique and in many ways a hangover from the Cold War. One aspect that’s notably impressive about the platypus-nosed jet is its ability to carry a staggeringly large amount of fuel for a tactical jet, leading to some potentially very long-range missions, even without aerial refueling. It truly is the king of the fast jets when it comes to how much gas it can lug into the air. While the Su-34 is, at the DNA level, a member of the Flanker family of fighters, and while it retains a secondary air-to-air capability, its direct origins are as a dedicated strike aircraft — or a tactical bomber in Russian terminology. Studies for a strike-optimized development of the Su-27 Flanker began as early as 1977, with the aim of using as much of the fighter’s airframe as possible but combining it with specialized navigation/attack avionics. Su-34 shot from below showing its massive external fuel tank., Pavel Adzhigildaev With the production of the Su-24 Fencer variable-geometry strike and reconnaissance aircraft in full flow, the strike Flanker remained a low priority until 1986, when what was then known as the Su-27IB ( Istrebitel-Bombardirovshchik , or fighter-bomber) was launched. This would incorporate the Sh141 attack radar that was being developed for the stillborn Sukhoi T-60S strike aircraft, a much bigger aircraft that was closer in concept to the Tu-22M Backfire . With that decision, the Su-27IB, later redesignated the Su-34, was earmarked as the successor to the Su-24 under the program codename Furor. The aircraft retained much of the Su-27’s airframe, and its engines, but incorporated a much-revised forward fuselage with side-by-side seating for the pilot and the navigator/weapons system operator in an armored compartment. Other major changes included an enlarged tail ‘sting’ projecting out from behind the engines. A Su-34 taxis at Voronezh Air Base. Note the fuel tank in the tunnel between the engines., Dmitry Chushkin/Wikimedia Commons The aircraft that the Su-34 was intended to replace, the Su-24, was often described in the West as being a Soviet counterpart to the F-111. In reality, in terms of its range, it was far closer to the Tornado IDS . Flying at low level and at 745 miles per hour, with two drop tanks plus weapons, Soviet war planners expected the Su-24 to have a combat radius of only around 370 miles, according to information from Russian aerospace researcher and historian Stefan Büttner. In a nuclear strike role, with two freefall bombs, the operational combat radius was expected to be increased to around 480 miles. In a time of heightened tensions , Su-24s would have been moved from their bases in Poland and Hungary would have been forward-deployed to East Germany and Czechoslovakia. A former Soviet, now Russian, Su-24M strike aircraft during a visit from its Polish base to Berlin, for the ILA aerospace exhibition, in June 1992., Rob Schleiffert/WIkimedia Commons While the range of the Su-24 was sufficient to hit targets around 90-180 miles behind the front line, it compared poorly to the F-111. Strategic Air Command’s FB-111 , for example, could carry a pair of AGM-69 Short-Range Attack Missiles (SRAM), plus four drop tanks, and achieve an operational radius of 1,800 miles. This shortfall was likely in mind when it came to developing the Su-34. The Su-27 was already well-served when it came to fuel capacity, with five internal tanks containing up to 20,700 pounds of fuel. The original fighter Flanker had no provision for external drop or inflight refueling but still boasted an impressive range — 2,300 miles when flown ‘clean’ at high altitude. Su-34s practice night refueling in the Southern Military District: In the Su-34, the internal fuel load was increased to 25,130 pounds — 26,676 according to some sources — and there was now a retractable inflight refueling probe on the port side of the nose. Despite this new capability, unrefuelled range remained of paramount importance, since in the Soviet era (and still today), aerial refueling tankers were assigned to the Long-Range Bomber branch and were not an organic part of tactical aviation doctrine. On top of this, the Su-34 also has provision for up to three drop tanks, each containing 793 gallons, or equivalent to 5,286 pounds of fuel per tank. These are the same PTB-3000 drop tanks that can be fitted under the fixed portion of the Su-24’s wing and each carries more than the total internal fuel load of an F-5E fighter (4,516 pounds) and just roughly 1,700 pounds shy of the internal fuel volume of the F-16 (7,000 pounds). In the case of a Fullback flying in a ‘three-bag’ configuration, adding all these fuel reserves together provides a grand total of 40,988 pounds of fuel — or 42,534 according to some sources. That is roughly the equivalent of fueling up 400 cars with 17-gallon fuel tanks or six F-16s’ internal fuel tanks. By contrast, the U.S. Air Force’s current long-range tactical strike specialist, the F-15E , carries a total of 35,550 pounds of fuel (including three external tanks plus conformal fuel tanks ). A ferry range of 2,485 miles is possible for the Fullback, marking a huge advance over the Su-24, and allowing the Su-34 to make very long-range deployments, covering almost half the length of Russia. The ferry range is, in fact, very similar to the F-15E, which the Air Force states can reach 2,400 miles — again with the help of conformal fuel tanks plus three external fuel tanks.

The jets have conformal fuel tanks fitted and each carries two external drop tanks., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Tony R. Tolley More importantly, the Su-34 can achieve a range of 1,864 miles when carrying six 1,100-pound bombs, four air-to-air missiles, and auxiliary tanks, and when flying at high level. Flying a sea level with the same load, the aircraft can still cover an impressive 1,087 miles, based on data published by Russian aerospace expert Piotr Butowski . Increase the weapons load to 8,800 pounds and the Su-34, flying at low level, can reach targets within a range of 373 miles. That grows to 684 miles when flying at high level. A schematic diagram showing weapons and stores options for the Su-34, including fuel tanks at the bottom., TOSAKA/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS In practical terms, this means that while the Su-24 was anticipated to strike targets 90 to 180 miles behind the front line in a very high-threat environment, the Su-34 can hit objectives over 300 miles behind the front line. This is, after all, still the Fullback’s primary mission, cutting off forward troops from supplies from the rear, by targeting lines communications as well as command-and-control hubs and depots. As it is, the Su-34 has, so far, been employed on very different kinds of tasks, during Russia’s campaign in support of the Syrian Assad regime, launched in September 2015. During this conflict, Su-34s have mainly carried fairly small weapons loads, with external fuel tanks rarely employed. A typical load during the early days of the campaign comprised just two satellite-guided 1,100-pound KAB-500S bombs or a handful of dumb bombs. A Su-34 at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, armed with two KAB-500S bombs., Russian Ministry of Defense The Fullback has so far only been used in combat in Syria, but should Russia launch a new campaign of offensive operations over Ukraine, it’s likely that Su-34 units would be heavily involved. And, thanks to their prodigious range, Fullback units from bases much further afield in Russia would be able to make a significant contribution too.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia will modernize its land warfare capabilities under a roughly $2.5-billion deal that will provide its army with 75 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, together with armored support vehicles. The decision, announced today, continues a significant spending spree on behalf of the Australian Defense Force (ADF), including plans to introduce nuclear-powered attack submarines , as well as hypersonic weapons and advanced air combat drones . The new Abrams tanks are being procured under the Main Battle Tank Upgrade, formally known as LAND 907 Phase 2, while the Combat Engineering Vehicle (LAND 8160 Phase 1) will deliver 29 M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicles, 17 M1074 Joint Assault Bridge Vehicles, plus an additional six M88A2 Armored Recovery Vehicles, joining 13 already in service. The U.S. government approved the sale of these new vehicles to Australia via Foreign Military Sales channels in April last year. The M1A2 SEPv3 main battle tank as selected by Australia., U.S. ARMY The M1A2 SEPv3 — or System Enhancement Program version 3 — was developed by the U.S. Army to address lessons learned during fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom and it rectifies space, weight, and power issues, as well as enhancing overall survivability. Specific changes include increased electrical power, vehicle health management systems, the Israeli-made Trophy active protection system , integrated counter-improvised explosive device ( IED ) protection, a new auxiliary power unit, and embedded training aids. The U.S. Army describes it as is “the most reliable Abrams tank ever produced.” In terms of armament, the SEPv3 adds a ‘smart’ gun that can fire programmable munitions, using an ammunition datalink. There is also a new Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station ( CROWS ) that combines a sensor suite with a machine gun. The M1A2 SEPv3 represents an advance over the Australian Army’s current M1A1 (AIM) variants, 59 of which were acquired second-hand from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps in 2006. These superseded Cold War-era Leopard 1s. It’s reported that the M1A2 SEPv3 will replace the earlier vehicles directly, although previous plans had included enlarging the overall Abrams fleet to 90 tanks . The original approval from the U.S. State Department noted that “the M1A2 SEPv3 Main Battle Tanks will upgrade the current Australian fleet of M1A1 SA tanks with no changes to Royal Australian Armored Corps force structure.” Australian Army M1A1s are currently operated by three Armored Cavalry Regiments in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Townsville. An Australian Army M1A1 Abrams fires its main armament during live-fire training for Exercise Exercise Gauntlet Strike at Puckapunyal Military Training Area in Victoria., Australian Department of Defense “The M1A2 Abrams will incorporate the latest developments in Australian sovereign defense capabilities, including command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems, and benefit from the intended manufacture of tank ammunition in Australia,” Australia’s Minister for Defense, Peter Dutton said. “The introduction of the new M1A2 vehicles will take advantage of the existing support infrastructure, with significant investment in Australian industry continuing in the areas of sustainment, simulation, and training.” “Teamed with the Infantry Fighting Vehicle, Combat Engineering Vehicles, and self-propelled howitzers , the new Abrams will give our soldiers the best possibility of success and protection from harm,” Dutton added. While the M88A2 Armored Recovery Vehicle is already established in Australian Army service, the M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle and 17 M1074 Joint Assault Bridge Vehicle will provide new capabilities for the ADF. The M1150 is used primarily to clear mines and explosives and the M1074 provides a vehicle-launched bridge that allows assault force vehicles to cross rivers and other water obstacles. The M1150 and M1074 are based on the M1 Abrams chassis, while the older M88A2 uses a bespoke chassis first developed in the mid-1960s and drawing upon earlier tank designs. The M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle., U.S. ARMY The M1074 Joint Assault Bridge Vehicle., U.S. ARMY Meanwhile, the Infantry Fighting Vehicle mentioned by Dutton is part of a separate program , LAND 400 Phase 3, which aims to acquire up to 450 new tracked armored vehicles to replace the Australian Army’s veteran M113 armored personnel carriers. Contenders for the new IFV are the Rheinmetall KF41 Lynx and Hanwha’s AS21 Redback. Overall, Canberra is putting significant resources into overhauling the Australian Defense Force’s land capabilities as it reconfigures to face the challenges of potential future conflict in the Asia Pacific region. “The main battle tank is at the core of the ADF’s Combined Arms Fighting System, which includes infantry, artillery, communications, engineers, attack helicopters and logistics,” said Lt. Gen. Rick Burr, the senior officer in the Australian Army. The Australian Chief of Army, Lt. Gen. Rick Burr AO, DSC, MVO., Australian Department of Defense “The M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams protection, accurate and lethal fire, mobility and situational awareness cannot be delivered by any other platform,” Burr concluded. “There are no other current or emerging technologies — or combination of technologies — that can yet deliver the capability currently provided by a main battle tank.” Plans call for the first of the new armored vehicles to be delivered to Australia in 2024, with initial operating capability planned for the following year. While the new Abrams and supporting armored vehicles have been billed by the ADF as an essential element to its land combat capability, some have questioned whether heavy armor of this type is best suited to Australia’s potential requirements in the Asia-Pacific region . https://youtube.com/watch?v=D8sF7RHZAhI Investing now in its land warfare capabilities suggests that Canberra is pivoting back to the Australian Army after having funded big-ticket programs covering air warfare, maritime platforms, and missiles, in recent years. Programs such as the F-35 stealth fighter , new air warfare destroyers and submarines , and hypersonic missiles are clearly intended to enhance the ADF’s ability to counter potential Chinese military actions in the Asia Pacific, but the role of heavy armor in scenarios such as this is perhaps less clear. As for other contingencies, it’s notable that neither the Australian Army’s existing M1A1 tanks nor the previous Leopard 1s, were ever deployed on operations, remaining unused during campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. The now-retired Australian Army Leopard 1 tank., Australian Department of Defense The utility of tanks for Australia remains a subject of intense debate , but the new M1A2s and their support vehicles are just part of the Australian Army’s ongoing modernization effort, which stresses heavier, tracked armored vehicles rather than lighter armor optimized for rapid deployment and mobility. On top of the approximately $2.5 billion being spent on the tanks and support vehicles, Canberra expects to pay between $13 billion and $19 billion on Infantry Fighting Vehicles under LAND 400 Phase 3. The candidates in the running for this are also notably large and heavy vehicles, each Lynx weighing up to around 48.5 tons, while the Redback tips the scales at around 46 tons. A winner in this competition is likely to be announced later this year. A Hanwha AS21 Redback (left) and Rheinmetall KF41 Lynx (right), during LAND 400 Phase 3 user evaluation trials at Puckapunyal Military Area, Victoria., Australian Department of Defense The Chief of Army, Lt. Gen. Burr states: “Because of their versatility, tanks can be used in a wide range of scenarios, environments, and levels of conflict in the region. This system is the only part of the ADF that can successfully operate in medium to high-threat land environments.” However, the kind of armor-heavy Australian Army that’s now in the works is arguably not best-suited to counter-insurgency campaigns, let alone the types of urban warfare that have become much more common in recent years, and which have posed a particular challenge for tanks. So heavy is the SEPv3 version of the Abrams that not only is it impossible to transport it using the ADF’s existing amphibious landing boats but there are reportedly also significant parts of northern Australia — where much military training takes place — that are too swampy and the roads too rudimentary to support the new tanks. The Trophy active protection system alone is said to add around 5,000 pounds of weight, with an overall weight, in combat, of 73.6 tons. An M113 armored personnel carrier roles off a landing craft during a beach assault in Queensland, Australia, while taking part in Exercise Talisman Sabre 2021., Australian Department of Defense It’s also questionable to what degree tanks would be likely to play a role in any kind of military campaign in the Asia Pacific theater involving China, with most credible scenarios more likely to be dominated by air and sea platforms, as well as missiles. In the United States, meanwhile, efforts are being made to return to the concept of a light tank to provide additional firepower for airborne and dismounted infantry brigades, as part of developing a doctrine that’s based on a potential conflict with a ‘great power’ adversary like China or Russia. It’s also possible that Australia’s move to reconstitute its Abrams fleet is something of an interim action, enhancing current capabilities until a viable successor to the M1 emerges. The new M1A2 SEPv3 is, as Declan Sullivan of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think-tank describes it, “fast, powerful, reliable and overkill and overweight for Australia’s needs, with little room to maneuver for future developments.” The new fleet of tanks is expected to remain in service until sometime around the 2040s, after which Australia might reappraise its armored requirements and perhaps start to look at a doctrinal shift. This might involve lighter tanks and fighting vehicles, or even unmanned or optionally manned platforms. By then, defense planners in Canberra are also likely to have a better idea of the kinds of threats that the ADF is likely to face in the Asia Pacific region, and what role will best be played by ground forces and armor.

If you were unfortunate enough to scroll around your social media channels this weekend you probably realized that it was one that featured some truly bizarre catastrophes . But the one that happened this afternoon just after 2 PM local time near Whiteman Airport in Pacoima, California really takes the cake—or the locomotive in this case. A Cessna 172, registered N8056L, made an emergency landing (or lost control while landing) and ended up on railroad tracks between Osborne Street and San Fernando Road next to the airport. The injured pilot was pulled from the stricken Cessna by police and bystanders just an instant before a Metrolink train plowed through the aircraft, shattering it and sending pieces of it flying. LAPD has posted absolutely chilling bodycam footage of the rescue, which came in just the nick of time: Other videos from the scene are also remarkably dramatic, like this one from Luis Jimenez , who goes by @ComposerLuis on Twitter, among others: The pilot was rushed to the hospital and it isn’t clear at this time what condition they are in, but the fact that they made it out alive is something of a miracle in itself.
