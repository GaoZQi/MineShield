By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Air USA, a private contractor that offers “red air” adversary support , is buying up to 46 soon-to-be-retired F/A-18A/B Hornets from the Royal Australian Air Force. Last year, the U.S. Air Force hired the company , along with six others, under a massive multi-billion dollar training support contract. The Australian Department of Defense announced the “disposal” of the jets on Mar. 5, 2020. Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel at RAAF Base Williamtown will be responsible for preparing the aircraft for their transfer to Air USA . Williamtown, which is situated just north of the city of Newcastle, is home to three of the four remaining Australian F/A-18A/B units, No. 3 and No. 77 Squadrons and No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit, the latter of which is responsible for training pilots on the type. No. 75 Squadron is based at RAAF Base Tindal in Australia’s Northwestern Territory. “The work to prepare these aircraft and components for sale will provide 24 direct industry jobs while Air Force transitions from the Classic Hornet to the F‑35 Joint Strike Fighter,” Melissa Price, Australia’s present Minister for Defence Industry, said in a statement . “Apart from the jobs directly supported by the work at RAAF Base Williamtown, more defense industry jobs are expected to be created across Australia through repair and overhaul work on aircraft servicing components.” She also said that the deal to prepare the jets, which could take between three and four years in total to complete, would provide job certainty for those workers. Australian Department of Defense via AAP Medianet Beginning in 1981, Australia ordered a total of 57 single-seat F/A-18As and 18 two-seater F/A-18Bs from American aviation company McDonnell Douglas, which later merged with Boeing. Four of these jets were subsequently lost in crashes over the years. Of the remaining 71 Hornets, Australia agreed to sell 25 to Canada in 2017. Canadian authorities decided to buy these jets to supplement the Royal Canadian Air Force’s own CF-18 Hornet fleet as an interim solution while the country continued to look to acquire an all-new fleet of fighter jets, a saga that you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The U.S. government, which still exercises export controls over the jets, approved that deal the following year. Australian Department of Defense It’s unclear if Air USA has formally agreed to buy all of the RAAF’s remaining 46 F/A-18A/Bs. The War Zone has reached out to the company already for comment. Regardless, the RAAF is steadily retiring the F/A-18A/B Hornets as it continues to acquire new stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . At present, Australia has received 20 F-35As out of a total order of 72 aircraft. The Australian Department of Defense does say that Air USA plans to use the aircraft it does receive for air combat training in the United States, which could include sorties as part of the huge adversary air support deal the U.S. Air Force concluded last year . That entire multi-part contract was worth an estimated $6.4 billion, though the exact amounts that each of the seven firms who got hired actually received is unclear. Air USA isn’t the only one to have made plans to acquire additional combat jets in preparation to meet the requirements of this contract. Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) and Draken both purchased second-hand fleets of French-made Mirage F1s, while the latter company bought an additional number of ex-South African Cheetahs , a Mirage III derivative. TacAir bought a group of former Royal Jordanian Air Force F-5E Tiger II jets, which it then upgraded into its F-5AT Advanced Tiger configuration. As of January, Top Aces was still in the process of taking delivery of 29 F-16A Viper fighters from an unknown source, possibly Jordan . F/A-18A/Bs would certainly offer a TacAir a different kind of capability from the other aircraft in its fleet , which includes Franco-German Alpha Jets , Czech L-59 Albatrosses , and BAE Hawks . All of these are much lighter jets than the Hornets. The company also has a small number of Soviet-era MiG-29UB Fulcrums . There’s no word on how much Air USA’s purchase of ex-RAAF Hornets is set to cost, but the aircraft could need significant additional upgrades to their systems and basic structure before they can begin flying adversary air sorties. As noted, these jets first entered service in the 1980s and may have limited flight hours left in them unless they receive a major structural overhaul. Australian Department of Defense A 2018 report from the Office of the Auditor General of Canada said that the country’s Department of National Defense had determined would need at least a billion U.S. dollars just “for spare parts and upgrades to the structure and avionics and electrical systems” on the 25 aircraft it acquired from the RAAF. This figure did not include “any combat capability upgrades,” requirements that Air USA would not necessarily share with an actual air force. Still, Air USA’s acquisition of even some of the RAAF’s F/A-18A/B Hornets would definitely make it one of the most capable private air forces in the world. We will report back as soon as we get more information about the purchase.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last December, The War Zone reported on a bizarre instance where Planet Labs’ satellite imagery showed a dozen mystery objects sitting in front of and/or poking out of one of the rows of hangars at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada. After reviewing years of daily imagery from Planet Labs, such an event appeared unprecedented. Since the December 6th occurrence, it hasn’t happened again, that is until Monday, March 2nd, 2020. For key information on the first sighting of this kind, comparative and high-resolution images, as well as critical background information, including historical context about Tonopah Test Range Airport and its very unique tenants , make sure to read our past report linked here . In imagery we obtained exclusively from Planet Labs, their three-meter resolution Planet Scope imaging satellites picked up what appears to be a number of objects sitting in front of, or at least poking out of, the same dozen hangars as before. Some of the objects appear to be quite large, with the morning light casting their shadow. On the north-end of Tonopah’s long hangar-filled ramp, referred to by those who have worked on the base as ‘canyons,’ what are very likely three Air Force Special Operations Command CASA CN-235s sit. These aircraft, along with contractor-operated ones, are regular visitors to this part of the base. You can compare these aircraft to the shadows cast by some of the objects in front of the hangars. The CN-235s are roughly 70 feet long. Planet Scope image of Tonopah Test Range Airport taken on March 2nd, 2020 at around noon local time.

In this case, it occurred on a Monday morning just after noon local time. It’s also worth noting that rehabilitation of Tonopah Test Range Airport’s main runway continues, with a section of its southern end undergoing a major overhaul. This limits the usable runway length. In addition, the air terminal used by “Janet” airliners on the south side of the base is also under construction. This has led to the Janet jets parking on the north side of the main ramp, between the ‘white’ and ‘red’ hangar clusters, where the F-117s, small and large Air Force transport, and flying testbed activity occurs. When we posted our original article, we were wondering if this would be caught on satellite again, and if so, how long it would be until it occurs again. The answer appears to be roughly three months. As to what these objects are, we do not know, although we talked about the possibilities in our previous piece . Regardless, seeing so much activity in satellite imagery at the usually remarkably quiet, but sprawling base is intriguing, to say the least.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2020",Watch A Russian Il-76 Cargo Jet Bomb Targets And Strafe Them With Its Tail Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian military recently conducted a curious training exercise in which some of its Il-76MD cargo aircraft bombed mock targets and strafed them with their 23mm tail guns. It’s an unusual capability , especially for a modern air force, but one that Russia has demonstrated before. It’s not clear, however, how effective the lumbering airlifters might be in employing these tactics in an actual operational scenario. The Russian Ministry of Defense released a video from the exercise on Mar. 2, 2020. Il-76MDs from the Russian Air Force’s 12th Military Transportation Aviation Division, based at Migalovo Air Base near the city of Tver, conducted the drills. Migalovo is just over 100 miles northwest of Moscow. The exercise included dropping unguided 100-pound class P-50T practice bombs during the day and at night, according to the caption of the official Russian Ministry of Defense video. The Il-76MDs could carry up to four of these bombs on a pair of pylons under each wing, outboard of the engines. During the day, the Il-76MDs carried out level bombing runs while flying at an altitude of just over 13,120 feet. At night, the aircraft dropped their bombs from just under 1,970 feet. The strafing runs using the two twin-barrel GSh-23 23mm cannons in the tail of each Il-76MD took place at much lower altitudes. The Il-76MDs have a large and heavily windowed navigator’s positions on the underside of the nose. The aircraft’s crew used existing navigation and aiming equipment, typically employed during parachute and aerial cargo drops to aim the P-50Ts, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The P-50Ts create both a flash and a smoke signature when they hit the ground. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that some of the bombing runs were meant to reflect tactics wherein Il-76MDs would use illumination or smoke bombs to mark landing zones or targets ahead of airborne operations or airstrikes. However, other bombing runs, as well as the strafing, was supposed to be practice for actually using the Il-76MDs to conduct their own strikes on hostile targets. This actually isn’t the first time the Russian Air Force has done this. Russia made a point of announcing that it would begin training its Il-76MD crews to carry out these missions, and would be stationing crews capable of loading bombs onto the transports at bases such as Migalovo, in 2015. “The task of the pilots is to carry out autonomous landing in an unprepared and unfamiliar area in the rear of the simulated enemy,” Russian Air Force Colonel Igor Klimov said at the time, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency . A P-50T practice bomb under the wing of an Il-76 during a similar exercise in 2015., Ilyushin However, the ability of at least some of the Russian Air Force’s Il-76MD fleet to carry the underwing pylons appears to have predated this and is a distinctly Soviet feature. Other Soviet-era airlifters, including the An-26 twin-engine turboprop, can also be fitted with pylons for weapons, if desired. In the early years of the fight against ISIS, the Iraqi Air Force was a particularly prolific user of its An-32 transport planes, a derivative of the An-26, as bombers. India has also modified a number of its An-32s to drop bombs , including via a system that personnel can install in the main cargo bay, which sends bombs falling out of the rear cargo ramp. An Iraqi Air Force An-32 transport aircraft carrying an unguided bomb., Iraqi Air Force The general idea of using transport planes, or even militarized airliners , or modified versions thereof, as bombers dates back to before World War II . In the years leading up to that global conflict, and in its early stages, this made good sense as these aircraft were typically the largest and longest range types available with the greatest overall payload capacities. Expediency and necessity meant the practice continued for decades after World War II ended. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force notably used C-130s to drop massive bombs , ostensibly to clear landing zones for helicopters, though they sometimes used them to devesting effect against enemy forces. Special operations MC-130s dropped 15,000-pound class BLU-82/B bombs , or “Daisy Cutters,” over Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991 and Afghanistan during the open phases of the Global War on Terror following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In Iraq, the bombs were primarily used to clear minefields, while the U.S. military used them to target cave complexes in Afghanistan. In both cases, the huge weapons were also employed in part because of their psychological effect. The Air Force dropped the last BLU-82/B during a training exercise in 2008. A US Air Force MC-130E Combat Talon special operations transport from the 919th Special Operations Wing drops the last BLU-82/B Daisy Cutter bomb in 2008., USAF The last BLU-82/B hits its mark., USAF The Air Force has adopted the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), or “Mother of All Bombs,” to replace the BLU-82/B. The MOAB has a total mass of 21,600 pounds and, to date, has been employed just once , in 2017, against terrorists belonging to the ISIS franchise in Afghanistan. Its massive size means that it still takes an MC-130 to drop it. The newest AC-130 versions in Air Force service now, the AC-130W Stinger II and AC-130J Ghostrider variants, are also capable of employing more typical precision-guided bombs and missiles, in addition to their gun armament. There were reports in 2019 that Russia was also considering converting An-12 turboprop cargo planes into a similar gunship configuration, but there has been no further news on that front since then. Still, beyond highly specialized weapons such as the MOAB, or Russia’s “ Father of All Bombs ,” which also reportedly requires a cargo aircraft such as the Il-76 to employ, the idea of using cargo aircraft as more traditional level bombers has largely disappeared from the doctrine of major air forces around the world. The Russian Air Force is certainly the most prominent to continue actively training airlifter crews to carry out these missions. How effective these tactics might actually be in a real combat environment is debatable, as well. Dropping unguided bombs while flying along at above 13,000 feet, or even just 2,000 feet, is not a particularly discriminate or precision affair. Il-76MDs carrying out these kinds of strikes might be able to suppress enemy forces around a landing zone, but would not be able in any way to reliably destroy them. There is no indication that the Il-76MDs are configured to employ precision-guided munitions or that there are plans to modify the airlifters to do so in the future. Precision-guided munitions remain in relatively limited use across the Russian Air Force, as a whole . The Kremlin has been criticized for years for using actual combat aircraft, including purpose-built Tu-22M bombers , to drop dumb bombs, especially over populated areas. There were similar concerns that Iraqi An-32s, and the Iraqi military’s use of helicopters to carry out level bombing runs from higher altitudes, posed a greater risk to civilians than to ISIS terrorists. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SkJZr49dkOA A U.N. report on Mar. 2, directly accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Syria by using these tactics and there is significant evidence that the Kremlin is deliberately carrying out indiscriminate strikes as it supports Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s brutal battle against anti-regime forces. Assad’s forces stand accused of similar crimes, including using Russian-made Mi-17 transport helicopters to drop now-infamous improvised “ barrel bombs ” over opposition-controlled cities and towns. All of this calls into question the actual combat utility of employing Il-76MDs as bombers in even low-level conflicts. In addition, the Il-76MDs would be very vulnerable platforms for these kinds of operations, especially during low-level strafing runs, in all but the most permissive environments. Small countries, as well as non-state actors, have steadily shown their ability to acquire and field surprisingly capable surface-to-air missile systems, in recent years. The proliferation of both shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS , and longer-range systems has been particularly pronounced in Syria , where Russia is heavily engaged, and Yemen . All told, the countries that have actually employed cargo aircraft as bombers in recent years seem to have done so more out of necessity than a clear military utility. Russia may continue to train its Il-76MD crews to carry out these operations, but it remains to be seen if they will ever put these tactics to use operationally.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 3, 2020",USS America Is Flying A Giant Captain America Flag While On Patrol In The Pacific,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The amphibious assault ship USS America , the first in her class, is on patrol in the Pacific with a full deck of Marine airpower , including F-35Bs , and a hull full of Marines and their gear. One thing that caught our eye in recent photos of the ship at sea is the massive flag she is flying above her island superstructure—one that depicts the symbol on Captain America’s iconic shield. Captain America was created during World War II by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon. The Axis Powers-fighting character, who also went by his non-superhero name Steve Rogers, embodied the best of America at a dire time in the country’s history. In the years and decades that followed, the patriotic hero remained a staple in the Marvel Comic universe before being catapulted back to the top of America’s consciousness via Marvel Studios’ hit film Captain America: The First Avenger. From the beginning to today, Captain America has remained the country’s iconic patriotic supersoldier , Fair Use/Wikicommons/Marvel Studios The Avengers-related movies went on to be ultra-successful, with the final installment—at least for now— Avengers: Endgame, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. So, Captain America serves as a very unique bridge across many generations and between the U.S. military’s own past and present. Captain America rose back to being a top pop culture icon with the launch of Marvel Studios’ reboot of the classic character., Marvel Studios Captain America’s shield, which is where the iconic roundel logo comes from, was near-indestructible and the super soldier’s primary weapon. With all this in mind, aside from the American flag, it’s hard to think of a more exciting and broadly relevant symbol for USS America’s sailors to rally around than this one. The ship carries-on the torch of other fighting ships named America. From her immediate predecessor, the Kitty Hawk class carrier USS America (CV-66) that was decommissioned in 1996 and eventually sunk , to the first ship-of-the-line ever built for the Continental Navy, the illustrious name has manifested itself aboard the current USS America in creative ways beyond the Captain America flag. Her forward RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) launcher’s cell doors are adorned with the stars and stripes. The ship’s naval aviation crest that is painted across its island, which normally is gold in color, is also filled with an American flag motif. Sailors man the rails as the amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA 6) arrives at Sasebo, Japan., USN USN Suffice it to say, the crew takes special pride in manning the ship that carries its country’s name. With a little help from Captain America’s iconography, that pride and exceptionalism are taken to a whole new level. USS America and her escorts are currently plowing the waters of the Gulf Of Thailand as they take part in exercise Cobra Gold. Her sister ship, USS Tripoli (LHA-7) , was just delivered yesterday , and the first of the remodeled America subclass, USS Bougainville , is well under construction. I don’t think those ships will get the same superhero treatment as America though.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",Air Force Boss Alludes To Work On New Top Secret Air-Launched Anti-Ship Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s top officer cryptically told members of Congress at a public hearing today that the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, or LRASM , was the only anti-ship munition he could discuss with them in an unclassified setting. This would mean that the service is pursuing other classified weapons in this weapons category. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Mar. 3, 2020. The main purpose of the hearing, at which Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett was also present, was to explore issues with the service’s already controversial budget proposal for the upcoming 2021 Fiscal Year. As such, the testimony and question and answer period covered a wide range of topics, including the state of the troubled KC-46A Pegasus tanker program and readiness of the rest of the Air Force’s tanker fleets . However, when asked about anti-ship weapons, Goldfein was tight-lipped, according to Air Force Magazine ‘s senior editor Rachel Cohen. “@GenDaveGoldfein says LRASM is the only anti-ship munition he can talk about in an unclassified setting,” she Tweeted out during the hearing. It’s unclear exactly what Goldfein meant by his comments since there is at least one other unclassified air-launched anti-ship weapon, the Quickstrike-ER air-dropped naval mine, that the Air Force is working to integrate into its arsenal. There are a number of new sea and ground-launched anti-ship missiles , as well as non-missile anti-ship weapons , in development elsewhere in the U.S. military that are also publicly acknowledged. A briefing slide showing just showing the multitude of new publicly known Navy missile programs, highlighted in yellow, including types intended for the Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) role, which refers to engaging hostile ships, or attacking targets on land and at sea. This, of course, does not include other anti-ship missile developments elsewhere across the U.S. military or work on non-missile anti-ship weapons , such as the Quickstrike-ER air-dropped naval mine., USN The obvious implication is that there is at least one air-launched anti-ship weapon program that the Air Force is involved in that remains classified. We know that the Navy has at least one top-secret sea-launched anti-ship missile, called Sea Dragon , in development now. It is possible that the Air Force is looking at an air-launched derivative of this weapon. A mockup of Lockheed Martin’s Revolutionary Approach To Time-critical Long Range Strike (RATTLRS) sea-launched high-speed cruise missile, which may be related to the present Sea Dragon program., ONR Goldfein might have also been referring to an anti-ship-focused version of one of the air-launched hypersonic weapons that the Air Force is presently developing. Lockheed Martin has mentioned the possibility of developing a maritime strike derivative of its Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept hypersonic missile, or HAWC, in the past. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), together with the Air Force, is leading the HAWC program. An artist’s conception of a HAWC variant for the US Navy that could have maritime strike applications., Joseph Trevithick Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone also pointed out that there is evidence of at least two classified hypersonic programs. Trimble first reported on the existence of the HACM and HCCW projects in July 2019. To date, there is no official definition for either of these acronyms. Whatever Goldfein was referring to specifically, it’s not surprising that there are advanced air-launched anti-ship weapons in development in the classified realm. The U.S. military as a whole has been increasingly focused on the prospect of a major maritime conflict , especially in the Pacific region , in recent years. Last year, the Air Force successfully integrated the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), the one weapon Goldfein did acknowledge, onto its B-1B Bone bombers ahead of schedule. LRASM has also entered service on the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . That service is now looking to add it to the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane’s arsenal. With anti-ship capabilities only set to become more important in the near future, it will be interesting to see if we learn any more about what the Air Force, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, has been developing in the shadows.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 13, 2024",Boeing Reveals Its Contender To Be The Army’s Future High-Speed Armed Scout Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After weeks of teasers offering fleeting glimpses of the design, Boeing has finally revealed its entry for the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. This project aims to fill the gap left by the early retirement of the service’s OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopters. The service plans to eventually replace nearly half of its AH-64 Apaches with the winner of the FARA competition, as well, making this effort particularly significant for the Chicago-headquartered aviation company, which makes those existing helicopters. The new Boeing design , which the company does not appear to have its own name for at present, is a compound helicopter with a single six-bladed main rotor, a canted four-bladed tail rotor, and four-bladed pusher prop in the rear. A single General Electric T901 engine, with its air intake on the right side of the fuselage, is the primary source of power. The Army selected the T901 last year as the winner of its Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) and the service plans to use it first to re-engine AH-64s and UH-60 Black Hawks. “We’re offering more than a helicopter – we’re offering an affordable and fully integrated system for the Army, the mission and the future,” Mark Cherry, the Vice President and General Manager of Boeing’s Phantom Works advanced design division, said in a statement on Mar. 3, 2020. “We’ve blended innovation, ingenuity and proven rotorcraft experience with extensive testing and advanced analysis to offer a very compelling solution.” “What we have here is a conventional helicopter configuration with a propulsor on the tail,” Shane Openshaw, Boeing’s FARA program manager, also told FlightGlobal . “So there’s a clutch in the drive train, behind the intermediate gearbox that drives the tail rotor, that adds the power to the configuration.” Openshaw further explained to FlightGlobal that configuration of Boeing’s FARA entry would allow the helicopter “to maintain airspeed during maneuvers that would cause other helicopters to lose airspeed.” The company says that its design will be able to meet the Army key performance requirement of being able to hit a top speed of 180 knots. So far, Boeing has offered more limited additional details about its FARA design. The press release says that it includes “a modular, state-of-the-art cockpit with a reconfigurable large area display and autonomous capabilities.” A pilot-optional capability, possibly with the ability to conduct semi-autonomous operations, has been a key Army requirement since the program began . Boeing Boeing Internal munitions bays on either side of the lower fuselage, along with a 20mm rotary-barrel cannon in a turret under the nose and nose-mounted sensor turret are also visible in the newly released concept art. “The fly-by-wire design leverages more than 65 years of rotorcraft experience, proven advanced and additive manufacturing technology, and product commonality driving down risk and costs,” Boeing added in its press release. Boeing’s FARA entry is the company’s first clean sheet helicopter design since it partnered with Sikorsky to develop the stealthy RAH-66A Comanche in the 1990s. The RAH-66A was supposed to replace the Army’s OH-58s, but the service canceled that program in 2004 amid delays and cost increases. A number of subsequent efforts to supplant the Kiowa Warriors also failed before the decision was made to simply retire them without a direct replacement in 2014. One of the Army’s now-retired OH-58D Kiowa Warriors., US Army The FARA design may have some stealthy features, but that clearly wasn’t the primary design driver, which it was with Comanche. The general cockpit and fuselage shape are also somewhat reminiscent of McDonnell Douglas’ Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) concept, which it developed together with Bell during the 1980s. Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas, which was also the original developer of the AH-64, in 1997. However, the LHX concept had a thrust-vectoring anti-torque system in the tail boom, similar to Hughes Helicopters’ No-Tail Rotor (NOTAR) system, rather than a traditional tail rotor. McDonnell Douglas had acquired Hughes Helicopters in 1984. The LHX design also lacked a pusher prop. A scan of concept art of the McDonnell Douglas-Bell LHX concept., McDonnell Douglas In many respects, Boeing’s design is closest in general configuration to that of Lockheed’s Cold War-era AH-56 Cheyenne . The Army canceled that project as a result of a mix of mishaps, technical problems, and political machinations, in 1972. Boeing has also been experimenting recently with a compound derivative of the AH-64, which would also feature a single main rotor and a traditional tail rotor coupled with a pusher prop. The design concept also featured extended stub wings for an added boost in lift at higher speeds, something the company’s FARA proposal notably lacks, at least in its present configuration. A wind tunnel model of Boeing’s compound AH-64 derivative., Boeing When it comes to Boeing’s new FARA entry, the fly-by-wire system promises to make it more docile. This, in turn, should allow it to do things its predecessors in similar configurations simply couldn’t. Boeing’s FARA design also seems aimed at offering a lower cost, lower risk alternative to some of the other competitors. Among the current entrants, it sits somewhere between the complexity of Sikorsky’s advanced Raider X compound helicopter and the greater simplicity offered by Bell’s traditionally configured Invictus . Boeing The Army hopes to pick designs from two companies to advance to the next stage of the FARA program by the end of this month. After the downselect, the service is looking to begin testing actual prototypes by 2023 and begin fielding the final design it picks by 2028. Right now, Boeing is competing against Bell, Sikorsky , a team consisting of AVX Aircraft and L3 , and another one that includes Karem Aircraft , Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. The company has secured a number of significant military contracts in recent years, including the deal to build the U.S. Navy’s future MQ-25 Stingray drone tanker , the contract to build the U.S. Air Force’s new T-7A Red Hawk jet trainer, in cooperation with Saab , and the winning bid to supply new MH-139 Grey Wolf helicopters , in partnership with Italian firm Leonardo, to replace the Air Force’s aging UH-1N Twin Hueys . As noted, for Boeing, the FARA competition is extremely important since the winning design is set to fundamentally alter the structure of the Army’s armed helicopter fleets for years to come and is directly tied to the divestment of AH-64s, one of the company’s flagship products. The company does stand to lose the most of any of the competitors, but also has the benefit of decades of close cooperation with the service through the Apache program. US Army AH-64 Apaches., US Army We will undoubtedly be hearing more about Boeing’s submission soon as the service gets closer to picking just two designs to go head-to-head for the final contract.

The service previously only said its goal was to adopt a successor to the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior light scout helicopter with the new types and these new details raise questions about the exact future of the Apache fleet in general. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley first alluded to the plan in a response to a question about what the service calls the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program while testifying before Congress on Mar. 26, 2019. Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor and our friend Steve Trimble was able to get more details from Milley’s spokesperson and was kind enough to share them on Twitter, before reporting first on the new developments himself. “The FARA will only replace Apaches in our heavy attack reconnaissance squadrons and this represents about half of the Apache fleet,” the spokesperson said. “The FARA will not replace Apaches in the Attack Reconnaissance battalions.” This is a major shift from the previously stated plan of simply looking for a follow-on platform to perform the same light scout missions as the OH-58D, the very last of which the Army retired in 2017 . This had seemed like an additive requirement. With more 700 AH-64s in various configurations spread across its active-duty component and the Army National Guard, the service now says it is looking to replace close to 350 of those aircraft with the future FARA design, starting within the next decade. AH-64 Apaches., US Army The Army first announced plans for a “Competitive Prototype” fly-off to find a FARA rotorcraft – the service hasn’t said it is looking for a specific configuration, such as a compound helicopter or a tilt-rotor – in June 2018 . The service’s goal is to be able to reach initial operational capability with whatever design it picks by 2028. “We’re looking for an aircraft that, without going into specific requirements or classifications, essentially goes further, can see further, can acquire specific targets further and can engage at greater ranges than current exist, and has greater legs – can fly further with a greater payload of weapon systems,” Milley explained on Capitol Hill. “We’re already moving in that direction with research and development and the development of prototypes.” The Army has otherwise given few details about its requirements for the FARA, which it has also described as a “ knife-fighter .” The service has said that the rotorcraft will have to be able to fly faster than 230 miles per hour. It will also need to be able to operate in high-risk contested environments full of enemy air defenses, which would presumably require features to reduce infrared and radar signatures, as well as dense urban environments. A robust electronic warfare suite and the ability to fly in a pilot-optional mode are also must-haves. You can read more about the general concept, based on the information available, here . The S-97 Raider compound helicopter has long seemed the design best positioned to take the lead in the FARA program. Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, planned from the beginning to make the design capable of unmanned operation. The S-97 is particularly attractive given how mature the design, which is an outgrowth of technology Sikorsky first demonstrated in 2008, is already. A demonstrator has been flying since 2015 and a second prototype is now in flight testing. The Army is considering other designs , too. Whatever design the Army might choose as the winner of the FARA competition, using these rotorcraft to replace some of its AH-64s could result in a major hit to Apache-maker Boeing’s market share. As it stands now, its best customer is talking about outright retiring or at least displacing half of its helicopters from their current mission. There have already been serious questions about whether the AH-64 platform will be able to remain relevant, especially in a high-end conflict environment, through 2048, when the Army plans to retire the very last of the gunships. The Army expects to be integrating significant upgrades into its latest AH-64E Guardian variants through 2026. These include updates to its fire control and targeting systems, improved data sharing and fusion capabilities, better sensors, a more robust ability to work directly with unmanned aircraft, and more, which you can read about in more detail here . Separately, Boeing is in the process of developing a compound helicopter derivative of AH-64E, which will feature a greater top speed and better fuel economy over existing Apaches. So far, the Chicago-headquartered aircraft company hasn’t officially said who might be looking to buy this advanced Apache, though the Army seems to most obvious choice, or if it plans to enter this design into the FARA program. But the Army’s now-stated plan to replace the Apaches in roughly half of its units beginning around 2028 raises additional questions about what will happen to those helicopters afterward. Though the FARA will supplant them in the Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons, the Army might not necessarily get rid of the AH-64s from those units entirely. The Army only began creating the “heavy” Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons with AH-64s in the first place to try to mitigate the loss of its 340 OH-58Ds. In 2014, the service decided to retire the Kiowa Warriors without purchasing a specific replacement as a controversial budget-cutting measure . However, the service didn’t buy 340 additional Apaches in order to build these “new” squadrons. It created them in no small part by reorganizing existing AH-64 units, including yanking a significant number of the gunships from Army Reserve and National Guard units , which caused a major outcry both within the Guard and in Congress when the plan became public in 2014. As of January 2018 , the Guard, across all states, had just 72 AH-64s in four understrength battalions. The Army Reserve stopped flying them altogether in 2016 . AH-64E Apaches assigned to 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment during a training exercise., US Army At the same time, using the FARA to replace the AH-64s in the Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons raises additional questions about how the Army envisions using its future rotorcraft and what sort of mix of the two platforms it might actually operate going forward. If the Army existing AH-64-equipped units  – Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons and Attack Reconnaissance Battalions – seem confusingly similar, that’s because they are. We’ve reproduced their respective mission sets, which are near identical, below, straight from the latest official Army Aviation manual . The order the missions appear in does reflect the different priorities of the two units, but the Army insists that both unit types are fully capable of performing all of the listed functions. The mission sets for the Attack Reconnaissance Squadron, at left, and the Attack Reconnaissance Battalion, at right., US Army At full strength, both units have 24 Apaches. The most significant difference is that Attack Reconnaissance Squadron also includes a dozen RQ-7 Shadow unmanned aircraft. The Attack Reconnaissance Battalion also includes a separate company of larger MQ-1C Gray Eagles . Apaches have worked together in manned-unmanned teams with the MQ-1Cs, but the drone companies also often operate independently. How capable the FARA is or isn’t at conducting the “attack” mission in the Attack Reconnaissance Squadron could present a greater challenge to the future of the Apache in general. The assumption is that any successor to the OH-58 would not have the capability to provide the same volume of fire as the AH-64, but this might not necessarily be the case. The Army’s abortive RAH-66A Comanche stealth helicopter was also supposed to be an OH-58D replacement and work in concert with AH-64s. But its “Reconnaissance Attack” designation was also reflective of the fact that it had provisions to carry a loadout very similar to that of the Apache, and certainly much heavier than that of the Kiowa Warrior, in a non-stealthy configuration, as necessary. Proposed loadouts for the RAH-66A Comanche, including one with 14 Hellfire missiles, just two shy of the maximum load that an AH-64 can carry., Sikorsky It’s hard not to see some shades of the Comanche in what we know about the FARA so far, in general. It’s also not surprising that the Army would not want to make this comparison given that the RAH-66A has since become a case study in procurement missteps and a prime example of the kinds of past mistakes the service says it is working to avoid making now. Further confusing matters about Army’s plans for the FARA, the service has also said it expects it to be an “ Echelon Above Division ” asset, at least initially. This suggests it would not necessarily be available to support smaller combat units and that more senior commanders would have discretion over how, where, and when to employ it, similar to the way the service’s specialized fixed-wing intelligence gathering aircraft operate. This is not at all how it employed the OH-58Ds in the past or how it understands the role of the AH-64-equipped Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons now. This 2015 briefing slide offers a good understanding of how the Army’s aviation assets fit into the different command echelons. The level marked here as “tactical” is the “Echelon Above Division” where the service says FARA will sit. Note that the AH-64, as well as the OH-58, are seen down at the brigade combat team (BCT) level., US Army With all this in mind, it remains to be seen just how many Apaches the Army actually retires and when. Any Apaches the service does ultimately declare as excess to its requirements between now and 2048 could easily go to U.S. allies and partners, some of whom are just starting to build their AH-64 fleets . Exactly what happens after 2018 appears to be open-ended, as well. “A future attack aircraft that replaces Apache could be a follow-on program for Future Vertical Lift,” Chief of Staff Milley’s spokesperson said, indicating that the service does not have a firm plan right now for how it expects to replace the AH-64 for good. The Army had initially expected to replace the AH-64s as part of the up-coming over-arching Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, which has the goal of developing new rotorcraft to replace all of the service’s existing helicopters. An Apache replacement had been part of FVL’s medium segment , also referred to Capability Set 3, but the immediate focus there has since shifted there to acquiring a Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) to replace only the UH-60 Black Hawk family. The understanding is also that FARA is the path toward realizing an aircraft to meet FVL’s light segment. But if the chosen aircraft proves sufficient to take on certain roles the Apache had performed in the past, it is possible that the Army might decide to replace more its AH-64s with the new rotorcraft. The original contracting notice for the Competitive Prototype fly-off noted that the service might purchase up to 500 of these rotorcraft in the future. Regardless, the Army has now laid out a roadmap for a major restructuring of its armed reconnaissance rotorcraft units in the coming years and one that could mark the beginning of the end for the venerable AH-64 and could knock the Apache from its pole position of being the Army’s one stop shop for rotary-wing attack and reconnaissance capability.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 29, 2020",Watch A Su-25 Attack Jet Blast A Tu-16 Bomber Out Of The Sky With An Anti-Tank Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Well, this is an interesting one! Russia’s Zvezda military channel on YouTube posted a teaser video for its upcoming special on the Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot close air support attack jet. In it there is a clip showing a Frogfoot’s weapon system engaging a Tu-16 Badger bomber with one of its 9A4172 Vikhr anti-armor missiles. These weapons are usually used to kill tanks and take out other ground vehicles and targets, not for taking down strategic bombers, which makes this video especially fascinating and remarkably spectacular. The Vikhr missile is a relatively high-speed weapon that is traditionally mounted in packs of six or eight, mainly on KA-50 attack helicopters and Su-25 attack jets . It primarily uses ‘beam riding’ guidance via a laser designator that works in conjunction with television and infrared camera systems mounted in the nose of the aircraft. This combination allows the aircraft to make precision attacks on moving targets during both day and night. A heavily laden Su-25TM with eight Vikhr missiles under its wing., Kobel/Wikicommons Like some other anti-armor missiles, Vikhr does have a secondary anti-air capability. For most of these types of weapons, this mode is usually reserved for slow and low-flying helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, not lumbering nuclear-capable bombers. Vikhr’s extended range, out to nearly seven miles, and its high-speed, allows it to engage a bit faster aircraft under certain circumstances and specific engagement geometry. In this case, the bomber turned drone in question was configured with its flaps and gear down, so the flight profile was likely used to mimic a larger aircraft on approach to landing or early on during departure, where it is most vulnerable. Still, it seems like an odd and remarkably elaborate test to prove such a niche capability. Seeing the lumbering bomber get absolutely decimated by the Vikhr’s high-explosive anti-tank warhead is a sight to behold. The video does prove just how vulnerable such an aircraft is during its terminal phases of flight to a Su-25 or KA-50 ambush using Vikhr missiles, but these slower-flying attack aircraft would have to be the very unique position to spring such a trap in the first place. Such a target could potentially present itself opportunistically, as well. Using laser-guided air-to-ground projectiles in an air-to-air role is not a dead idea by any means. The Air Force just pitted an F-16 equipped with laser-guided rockets against an aerial drone. The concept could greatly enhance the magazine depth and flexibility of American and allied fast jets, especially those flying air sovereignty or other counter-air missions against lower-end threats. Regardless, the test shown in the video was well worth it because it provided us with a crazy video of a Badger taking a Vikhr to the rear left engine and wing-root, sending the bomber tumbling and consequently disintegrating in spectacular fashion as a result.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 17, 2020",Concerns About U.S. Military Supply Chains And Readiness Grow As COVID-19 Coronavirus Spreads,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Top Pentagon officials have said that the fallout from the spread of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus has not impacted U.S. military supply chains, but there are growing concerns that it could in the near future. Worries about what it could do the readiness of American forces abroad and at home are mounting as the virus continues to spread around the world , including inside the United States, where it has now caused six deaths and infected dozens more. On Mar. 2, 2020, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley told reporters during a press conference that there had been no such disruption, yet. However, the same day, Representative Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and the ranking member of his party on the House Armed Services Committee, highlighted the seriousness of this potential issue during a talk at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C. “It’s not just civilian businesses that are dependent upon products and components that come from China,” Thornberry noted. “To the extent … economic commerce is threatened, then, of course, it could relate to defense weapons and equipment.” “Obviously we want to get [the COVID-19] coronavirus contained [and] eliminated as fast as we can, but maybe we can also take this opportunity to use it as a wakeup call that being so dependent – whether you’re talking about military equipment or you’re talking about pharmaceutical components or whatever it is you’re talking about – being that dependent upon one country is not a good and healthy thing and we need to diversify our suppliers,” he added. Representative Mac Thornberry., Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA via AP Images Members of Congress, as well as the Pentagon itself, have been ringing alarm bells about the various risks posed by heavy dependence on China in the U.S. military’s supply chain, both for raw materials and processed goods, in general. A particular area of concern has been Chinese dominance in the extraction of rare-earth metals that are critical to the production of various modern electronic devices, including communications systems and computers. Efforts to find alternative sources of rare-earth metals, as well as otherwise reduce reliance on exports from China , are still very much in their infancy . These concerns are now much more apparent with the potential cascading impacts of slowed production in and exports from China due to COVID-19. Manufacturing output in the impacted areas of that country, such as Wuhan , where the virus first emerged in December 2019, has decreased so much, space-based sensors have noticed a near-total drop in pollution in the city. NASA It is very possible that the impacts of this slowdown simply have yet to be felt by businesses in the United States given the availability of existing supplies of various items in the chain. Supply chain concerns extend beyond resource extraction and production, and include possible disruptions in the transportation of items to their intended destinations , as well. It’s not hard to see the potential problems that the U.S. military could experience from a sudden lack of availability of a wide array of resources and processed items across supply chains. This would not necessarily be limited to military-specific items, such as weapon systems or ammunition, but could also impact the availability of critical day-to-day items, including food, water, fuel , and especially medicine and medical supplies. As COVID-19 spreads, these concerns will not stay limited to China, or even other foreign countries, especially if portions of the United States experience prolonged quarantine periods. At the time of writing, as of Mar. 2, the U.N. World Health Organization had confirmed 8,774 cases of the novel coronavirus in 64 countries outside of China. The WHO had counted 128 deaths in those nations. A chart showing the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of China since December 2019., WHO Both tallies are growing, especially as more people get tested, and these figures did not include six deaths in the past two days in the United States. All of those fatalities have been in Washington State, but cases of COVID-19 have spread well beyond that state . Per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and other official medical sources, there are at least 100 confirmed cases across the United States. So far, worldwide, the mortality rate for COVID-19 has been relatively low, but individuals who catch it can take weeks to recover, especially in severe cases that require hospitalization. Even if two percent of those who contract the virus die – two percent of the U.S. population, estimated to be around 330 million at present, is 6.6 million – even a fraction of this number could easily be a significant figure and the total number of people incapacitated could be higher still. Massive disruption in the U.S. military’s supply chain could directly impact the readiness of American troops, abroad and at home, to respond to crises, including fallout from the spread of COVID-19. The United States has already canceled one scheduled exercise with South Korea forces due to the rapid spread of the virus in that country. The U.S. military first case of COVID-19 was actually confirmed in a servicemember on a base in South Korea. On Feb. 1, U.S. Forces Korea, the top American command on the Peninsula, had already instituted various measures to try to mitigate the possible spread of the virus, including mandatory self-quarantine for 14 days for any individual returning from travel to China. A member of the US Army’s 56th Chemical Detachment inspects a site for mock biological warfare agents during an exercise in February 2020., US Army On Feb. 28, the Navy’s 7th Fleet, which is forward-deployed in Japan, has also seen a steady increase in COVID-19 cases, confirmed that it instructed all of its ships at sea to keep sailing for at least 14 days and to monitor for any signs that sailors might have contracted the virus. U.S. Central Command, which has an area of responsibility that includes Iraq, Lebanon, and other countries where U.S. personnel are based and the novel coronavirus is spreading, has instituted various restrictions on the movements of its personnel, as well. “We’ve issued a variety of memorandums and directives advising the force on how to deal with coronavirus,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley at the press conference on Mar. 2. “At the end of the last week, I did a deep dive with DoD civilian and military leadership, including all the service secretaries … to ensure the entire department is equipped for all scenarios short- and long-term, domestic and international.” US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, at left, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff US Army General Mark Milley, right, brief the press on Mar. 2, 2020., DOD There are limited details on exactly what steps the U.S. military has taken or plans to take with regards to supply chains and readiness, but it could include stockpiling of various items and contracting with domestic companies to ramp up production of certain products. As of last week, the U.S. government was already reportedly considering using the emergency powers available under the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to boost domestic production of protective clothing and masks, according to Reuters . “We have more than 40 million masks available today. We’ve contracted now with 3M. Thirty-five million more masks per month will be produced, and we’re also going to be working with other manufacturers,” Vice President Mike Pence said at a press briefing on Feb. 29, but did not mention the Defense Production Act or supplies for the U.S. military specifically. “The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response will be announcing today courses of action to increase the availability of masks, as well as prioritizing availability to high-risk healthcare workers, modifying guidance, and developing a whole-of-nations communications plan.” Still, even if the Pentagon mitigates the supply chain issues, thousands or hundreds of thousands of U.S. servicemembers sidelined due to catching the virus could have serious impacts on available forces to respond to potential crises around the world, which there are no shortage of at present. The need for individuals who might have been exposed COVID-19 to be quarantined in some fashion, including self-quarantine, even if they do not develop symptoms, means that these disruptions could readily occur even if the actual spread of the virus within the U.S. military ends up being low. While physical fitness and certain other things can be attended to under these constraints, advanced skill sets, such as flying planes , sailing ships , and operating other advanced systems, and preparedness for deployment on short notice, could suffer. Beyond simply impacting potential deployments, for contingency or other purposes, this could also prevent the scheduled rotation of forces already overseas back to the United States, forcing units to remain in place longer than expected. This could have its own cascading impacts on readiness, in general, as well as the training of new personnel . “The overall broad impact to the uniformed U.S. military is very, very minimal,” General Milley said at the Mar. 2 press conference. “It’s not to say it’s zero, but it’s very, very minimal.” This may be true now, but it’s unclear how long these conditions might last. Thankfully, the U.S. military does appear to be taking the situation seriously and will hopefully be able to take the steps necessary to mitigate any supply chain and readiness issues as much as possible while the spread of COVID-19 continues.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 5, 2020",Russians Tag Along With Assad’s Forces To Deter Turkish Strikes As Syrian Air War Heats Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The conflict in Syria has entered a new, dangerous, and uncertain phase as Russian troops have escorted forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad into the country’s hotly contested Idlib province . This comes a day after Turkey officially declared a major intervention in that region, shooting down multiple Syrian Air Force combat jets in its opening stages. Turkey formally announced the beginning of Operation Spring Shield in Idlib on Mar. 1, 2020. This came soon after the regime in Damascus attempted to declare airspace over the war-torn province a no-go zone for foreign military aircraft. The Turkish military quickly responded by shooting down two Syrian Air Force Su-24 Fencer combat jets, though it has not formally declared its own no-fly zone over the region. Turkey’s own domestically developed unmanned aircraft , as well as artillery in the region, launched withering strikes on Assad’s forces on the ground. It’s not clear how many Su-24s the Syrian Air Force still has on hand or what their availability looks like after years of conflict. Syria took delivery of 20 Su-24MK export variants from the Soviet Union in 1990 and acquired two additional examples from Libya later in that decade. A contract with Russia to upgrade 21 Fencers to the newer Su-24M2 configuration in 2010 implies that this was the size of the fleet at that time. The Syrian Air Force has reportedly lost at least eight Su-24s since 2012, but began receiving some replacement aircraft in 2017. Regardless, the loss of two more in one day, and the obvious risk that Turkey poses to the rest of Syria’s air arm, could significantly hamper Assad’s aerial capabilities. A Syrian Air Force Su-24., Syrian Air Force Beyond that, Ankara had already been prosecuting a devastating campaign against Assad in the wake of airstrikes that killed dozens of Turkish troops in Idlib on Feb. 27. Since then, Turkey has destroyed dozens of the regime’s armored vehicles and artillery pieces and killed thousands of its troops and militiamen. Ankara’s drones have been star players in this campaign so far, though Turkish Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jets and Turkish Army artillery have also been part of the operations. The Syrian government claims that its forces have been able to shoot down a number of Turkish drones over the course of the recent fighting. There has also been an explosion in the use of shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS, against fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and drones that the Syrian government, as well as its allies, have been operating. Just today, anti-regime forces announced that an Iranian-made drone had gotten shot down. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had threatened to launch this operation if Assad’s forces did not withdraw from Idlib following the Feb. 27 airstrikes, which Ankara blames on Damascus. Whether or not the Russians were actually responsible for those strikes remains murky . The Turkish government has ostensibly limited its massive retaliatory efforts entirely to the regime, including strikes on at least one of its air bases and facilities in Al Safira, which has served as a production center for its infamous barrel bombs and, at least prior to 2014, of chemical weapons . “Turkey does not take aim at either Russia or Iran in Syria. We are only destroying the elements of the [Assad] regime,” Erdogan said in televised remarks on Mar. 3, 2020. “I appeal to Russia and Iran once again. Turkey has no problems with these countries in Syria. We do not set sights on Syria’s territory. Nor do we have plans to gain a foothold there.” Russia has avoided any public involvement in the fighting in Idlib since Feb. 27, while Iran has threatened to retaliate against Turkish forces. On Mar. 1, the Russian Ministry of Defense did issue a statement saying that it could not “guarantee the safety of Turkish aviation in the skies of Syria.” At the same time, Moscow has already rejected Ankara’s previous calls to step aside in Idlib. On Mar. 2, the Russian military also sent forces to accompany Assad’s troops into the Saraqib. This city has been the scene of particularly heavy fighting between the regime and Turkish-supported anti-regime groups since the beginning of the Syrian government’s latest offensive into the province earlier this year. Russia’s deployment into the area is clearly meant to deter further Turkish air and artillery strikes. This can only increase the risk of mistakes and miscalculations, which in turn could cause a further serious escalation in the conflict. While Turkey and Russia have been able to avoid overtly fighting each other in northwestern Syria, including blaming what have very likely been at least some Russian airstrikes on Turkish positions in recent weeks on Assad, the size or significance of future incidents may simply be too big to explain away in this manner. The U.S. government has called the idea that the Syrian Air Force has the capacity to conduct meaningful and sustained operations in Idlib “laughable.” Fears of escalation have been a persistent concern in the region for years now and Russia and Turkey, together with Iran, first brokered a deal to designate Idlib as a neutral “safe zone” in 2017. Assad, with Russian support, moved to launch a major offensive into the province the following year as anti-regime forces continued to use it as a base of operations. This led to a ceasefire deal in 2018, known as the Sochi agreements after the Black Sea resort town in southern Russia where the negotiations took place. Turkey was subsequently allowed to establish dozens of observation posts ostensibly to monitor compliance with that arrangement. “We know that under the Sochi agreements from a year ago, it was the Turkish side which was required to ensure a regime of inactivity by these terrorist elements,” Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s top spokesperson, told reporters on Mar. 1. “Unfortunately, Turkey has not fulfilled these obligations, and the terrorists went on the offensive against Syria’s armed forces.” For the moment, Russia and Turkey do appear invested in finding a way to end the present crisis in a way that serves both of their interests, though not necessarily those of Assad. Russia’s main goals in Syria center on continued access to geopolitically strategic naval and air base facilities on or near the country’s Eastern Mediterranean shores. The Turkish government also continues to see Russia as a valuable partner of convenience in blocking the aspirations of various Kurdish groups that are operating with the backing of the United States in northeastern Syria. Putin is undoubtedly interested in being able to continue selling Turkey advanced weapons , cooperating with it economically , and otherwise pulling its government away from the West . Highlighting the complexities of Russian-Turkish ties, despite the very serious situation in Idlib, Turkish and Russian troops continue to conduct joint patrols on the other side of the country. Despite reports that authorities in Ankara might have been considering it, they have not closed off the Bosphorus Strait, which links the Black Sea the Mediterranean, to either Russian or Syrian ships. Russia also recently conducted a surveillance mission without issue over Turkey under the Open Skies Treaty and Turkey is now set to do the same over Russian territory. Most importantly, Erdogan and Putin are still set to meet on Mar. 5-6, during which the two leaders could agree to yet another arrangement regarding Idlib. For his part, the Turkish president, who has been moving closer toward Russia’s sphere of influence in recent years, has also made strong appeals to NATO for support over the crisis. This is despite Turkey’s frosty relations with the other members of the alliance, especially the United States, over a host of issues, including its purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems , which got the Turkish military ejected from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, and its unilateral intervention into northeastern Syria last year. So far, the offers of support seem to have been primarily rhetorical. The U.S. government has offered more tangible assistance, which could include intelligence sharing or logistical support. However, American officials have said there will be no deployments of troops to northwestern Syria or of Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries to boost Turkish air defenses. It seems highly unlikely that any other NATO member would be interested in placing itself in a position where there could be a need to shoot down Russian military aircraft. “We call on the Russian Federation to immediately ground its warplanes,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft had said at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Feb. 28, though there remains no indication that the United States is looking to take any action to enforce that demand. “And we call for all Syrian forces and their Russian backers to withdraw to the ceasefire lines first established in 2018.” In the meantime, fighting continues in Idlib, which has also become the scene of a major humanitarian catastrophe . Turkey has also stopped preventing Syrian refugees and other migrants from seeking to cross by land or sea into Europe, especially Greece , in what appears to be an effort to force European nations to support its policies by leveraging anti-immigrant fears. What happens in the coming days, ahead of Erogdan and Putin’s meeting, could have a significant impact on the trajectory of the Syrian conflict. If those talks fail to produce a new deal of some kind, the danger of escalation, intentional or otherwise, will only continue to rise.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has revealed what appears to be a previously unknown unmanned aircraft concept, called Defender, that is capable of air-to-air combat and mid-air refueling. The company says that its primary mission would be to protect “high-value airborne assets,” such as airborne early warning and control aircraft, standoff reconnaissance planes , and aerial refueling tankers . Concept art of the drone appeared online a day after news broke that the U.S. Air Force is seeking to abruptly halt purchases of MQ-9 Reapers, one of the firm’s flagship products, something we at The War Zone noted would very likely lead to the disclosure of new potential business opportunities. The official Twitter account of General Atomics’ Aerospace Systems division, or GS-ASI, posted an artist’s conception of the Defender on Feb. 27, 2020. The Tweet included hashtags for the Air Force Association’s 2020 Air Warfare Symposium, but at the time of writing, there does not appear to have been a major announcement about the project. “Capable of protecting the @USAF’s high value airborne assets (HVAA) in a contested environment makes the Defender a critical piece of the Future Force,” is all the social media post says. At least visually, the Defender appears to be derived from General Atomics’ submission for the Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone program, which lost out to Boeing’s design in 2018. The company did not build a flying prototype for its proposed design, but did do associated work on developing its powerplant and control systems . Some of that research and development was done using one of its existing stealthy Avenger/Predator C drones. An artist’s conception of General Atomics’ MQ-25 proposal., General Atomics Additional concept art of General Atomics’ MQ-25 proposal., General Atomics The Defender design in the artwork has a similar overall planform to the proposed Navy tanker design, but with the notable addition of an internal centerline weapons bay with large outward opening doors reminiscent of the ones of the Avenger/Predator-C.

An artist’s conception of Lockheed Martin’s Cuda missile., Lockheed Martin Another Defender is seen in the background of the artwork refueling via the boom on a KC-46A Pegasus tanker. This is exactly the kind of aircraft that General Atomics says the Defender would be well suited to protecting. There is little doubt that lumbering Air Force support and force-multiplier aircraft are seen as vulnerable in a peer-state conflict, where vast distances can be turned into contested airspace with the help of the enemy’s anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities. Fighter aircraft have a combat radius measured in hundreds of miles, usually roughly between 400 and 800 miles, with the F-15 being on the high-side of that spectrum, F-35 being right in the center, and aircraft like the F-16 and F/A-18 being on the lower end the spectrum. Regardless, the idea that these aircraft need to stay so close to aerial refueling assets in order to execute their mission and return home to do it again is becoming increasingly problematic. The same can be said for the need to keep assets like airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) and other large surveillance aircraft within a couple hundred miles from the primary battlespace those fighters will operate in. Alert-tasked F-22 Raptor and E-3G Sentry at Elmendorf AFB in Alaska. , USAF Developing more survivable tankers is one possible answer, or at least part of an answer, to this issue. This can be realized through low-observable (stealth) design and/or electronic surveillance, networking, and electronic warfare equipment. Nobody has talked about this issue more than The War Zone . You can read much more about it first here , and then here and here . Another potential answer, or part of a cocktail of solutions to solve the problem, is to give tankers and other large support aircraft a loyal wingman drone that can act as a sentinel of sorts, providing an organic, rearward line of defense for these assets. This appears to be what General Atomics is going after with the Defender concept. A drone with high endurance, aerial refueling capability, and the speed needed to keep up with tankers, AEW&C, strategic reconnaissance, other support aircraft, and in some cases even bombers, would provide a persistent inner anti-air screen for these assets. Battle management personnel on one of the aircraft in these formations could direct the drones to investigate and engage aerial threats via a semi-autonomous, point-and-click, desktop-like command interface. The drones themselves would not have to rely on satellite beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) data-links under such an arrangement as highly-reliable and jam-resistant line-of-sight data-links between the drones and the aircraft controlling them would be sufficient for this type of communications and command and control architecture. Even if BLOS connectivity was used and someone from thousands of miles away were to control the drones, it’s still possible to use one of the tankers or other support aircraft’s wide-band satellite links to do this, instead of each drone being connected by their own onboard satellite link simultaneously. In other words, a localized unmanned protection concept for these vulnerable aircraft also simplifies the communications architecture needed to execute such a concept. America’s tanker trio… For the time being. , USAF Taking the human out of the cockpit would also provide better ease in executing very long-range escort missions that can be harsh on fighter aircrews. Whereas the person manning the control console on a tanker or AEW&C aircraft can swap out with another crewman in order to go get rest, fighter crews have no such option. They can’t even stand up and stretch out in the cockpit. They also require constant refueling. The aerial threat is certainly tangible enough for these large aircraft as China, and to a degree, Russia, have focused on designing capabilities and tactics that exploit America’s short-range tactical airpower ‘Achilles heel.’ China’s long-range and stealthy J-20 fighter poses a substantial threat to these assets—it was designed specifically to do so —as do new very long-range air-to-air missile capabilities that China is developing . As such, the Defender concept makes sense, especially seeing as fighter aircraft will already be taxed to the limit just trying to prosecute an air war, let alone being dragged over thousands of miles to protect a formation of tankers and other support aircraft. Even at the relatively short-ranges involved in Desert Storm, throngs of fighters needed aerial refueling to accomplish their missions. Nothing has changed in that regard in the 30 years that have come and gone since this conflict aside from the tankers becoming ever more vulnerable and less plentiful. , National Archives Even with fighter screening, playing in someone else’s A2/AD backyard means numerical superiority for the enemy. A fighter can carry only so many missiles or engage so many targets at once. Having a secondary counter-air inner screen may not just be relevant, it may be essential. The aircraft providing that inner screen can also be adapted and equipped specifically to do so in ways fighters can’t. Defender-like aircraft could also presumably prosecute pop-up threats on the surface of the earth using standoff munitions, but this would likely be a secondary capability, with naval-based air defense threats posing the biggest danger. These drones can also carry unique sensor combinations aloft and help feed that information into the larger data-network situational awareness and targeting ecosystem. China’s J-20., Xinhua/Li Gang via Getty Images A Defender-like drone would likely be equipped with an AESA radar , radar homing and warning reciever/electronic support measures, missile and approach warning system, and an infrared search and track system (IRST). This would give the aircraft four layers of organic target and situational awareness gathering data—both of an active and passive nature—that could be used not just to engage potential threats, but to have a formation of support assets avoid them as needed. The IRST would be essential as it is the best early warning tool for detecting stealthy aircraft and long-range missile launches. Additionally, and maybe more importantly, a Defender could also provide electronic warfare self-escort support for the aircraft under its protection. Their operator would also benefit from all the information being piped into the network from combat aircraft operating forward over the battlespace and other surveillance assets. These same aircraft could also eventually be equipped with a laser system capable of shooting down incoming missiles and even working to deny enemy aircraft the ability to advance on these high-value assets. This concept is already in development, as are hard-kill systems that are capable of shooting down missiles with smaller missiles. This could actually be what we are seeing by the portrayal of the Cuda-like missile in General Atomics’ concept art. By pushing sensors and weapons onto a combat drone airframe, it would mean that each tanker or other support plane wouldn’t need its own defensive suite, which would not be useful for nearly all missions outside of combat ones against a peer-state. In other words, those systems would be costly dead weight flown on those aircraft daily in peacetime and on operational missions that don’t venture near contested airspace. So, by fielding a Defender drone force to protect strategic aerial assets, the many aircraft that make up that large fleet of those assets would not have to all be equipped with these expensive subsystems, or some combination of them. These savings could help offset a portion of the costs of fielding a Defender fleet. The Air Force will retain hundreds of aging KC-135R tankers for years to come. , USAF One thing General Atomics’ Defender concept does not have is a high-degree of low-observability (stealth). As a result, this does make it another target along with the tankers. But considering the tankers are already a target, the advantage of a low-observable escort aircraft is somewhat limited, but not irrelevant. These Defender drones would be less survivable than a low-observable alternative and would be less capable of dynamically countering enemy air-to-air fighters. In exchange, they would likely offer efficiency, easy adaptability, greater payload flexibility and depth, and potentially a lower cost, both in terms of acquisition and operation. Considering their proposed mission set is solely to protect high-value assets, that doesn’t sound like a terrible trade. Then again, if there were large numbers of multi-role, stealthy, unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) in the Air Force’s fleet, why exactly would this separate design be justified? It may bring some payload advantages, such as the ability to easily integrate a laser system, and range efficiencies to the table, but any UCAV is already going to have a combat radius that is a multiple of its fighter counterparts. A single UCAV design could work on its own, in a swarm, as a loyal wingman to a manned fighter, or as a loyal wingman for large high-value assets. With this in mind, if anything else, the Defender concept highlights yet another glaring application for a large, multi-role, low-observable UCAV force. Still, a design that is more of a sensor and weapons truck focused on protecting the inner sanctum around high-value aerial assets as they steadily draw great contrails across the sky is certainly an intriguing proposition.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 20, 2020",Turkey Strikes Back And Calls For No-Fly-Zone After Its Troops Die In Syria Airstrikes (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkish officials have called for a no-fly zone over Syria and say they consider forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad to be legitimate targets. This follows the death of at least 33 Turkish troops, and the wounding of another 32, in airstrikes in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib , where Russian warplanes have been heavily engaged. This prompted massive retaliatory strikes from Turkey. Russia, Assad’s principal ally, has, in turn, accused Turkey of violating the terms of ceasefire deals regarding that area stretching back to 2017 . A recent surge of fighting between Turkish-backed groups and the regime has already raised fears that a broader regional conflict may be emerging. This most recent escalation in the violence began on Feb. 27, 2020, with the airstrikes that killed the Turkish troops in Idlib. The Turkish Ministry of Defense says that it responded during the night of Feb. 27-28 with its own air and artillery strikes on 200 Syrian regime targets across the northwestern portion of the country. Turkey claims that it destroyed five helicopters, 23 armored vehicles, 23 artillery pieces, one Buk-M1-2 medium-range surface-to-air missile system, and one Pantsir-S1 point defense air defense system. It also said that it killed 309 of Assad’s troops. It’s unclear if all of these strikes occurred last night or if this tally might include strikes from earlier in the month. There were unconfirmed reports that Turkey attacked Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base outpost and it possible that anti-Assad forces launched their own attacks as the Turkish strikes were ongoing. There has little further reporting on this, increasing the likelihood that Syrian militant groups were responsible, if anything happened at all. Turkey, together with its local partners, has been attacking regime ground and air forces for weeks now, including with armed drones , as it seeks to stem the offense in Idlib. The Turkish government has stepped up deliveries of heavier weaponry, including armored vehicles and howitzers , to various Syrian militant groups opposed to Assad, as well. Turkey’s increasing intervention in the conflict has also included the deployment of a larger number of license-made Stinger shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS, as well as the reported deployment of vehicle-mounted systems employing the same short-range heat-seeking missile. MANPADS have brought down a number of Syrian helicopters in recent weeks. There is evidence that actual Turkish military personnel may be the ones employing them and that they may have also been trying to shoot down Russian, as well as Syrian, combat jets. Of course, MANPADS have been a feature in the Syrian conflict for years now , as well. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that “every Syrian government unit” was a “legitimate target” during a phone call between the two leaders on Feb. 28, 2020. Earlier this month, Erdogan had threatened a massive response against Assad if any Turkish troops died in strikes in Syria. Before this large number of Turkish troops died in the airstrikes yesterday, more than a dozen of them had already been killed in the fighting in Idlib since the beginning of February. “Millions of civilians are being bombarded by air for months now. Infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, is being targeted by the regime systematically,” Fahrettin Altun, the communications director for the Turkish presidency, who also called for the international community to establish a no-fly zone, wrote on Twitter on Feb. 28. “A genocide is happening slowly before our eyes. Those with conscious [sic; conscience] and dignity must speak up.” The Kremlin’s official statement on Erdogan and Putin’s call says that the Russian President expressed “Serious concern about the escalation of tensions in Idlib.” It said he had also called for greater coordination between the Turkish and Russian defense ministries. Erdogan and Putin shake hands during a meeting Berlin over the conflict in Libya in January 2020., Aleksey Nikolskyi / Sputnik  via AP Russia “did all it could to ensure [the] security of Turkish service members,” Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s top spokesperson, told reporters later on Feb. 28. He further implied that the Turkish troops would have been fine had they confined themselves to their observation posts in Idlib. Turkey established 12 of these sites following a ceasefire deal with Syria and Russia in 2018. The three countries had already agreed to designate the province as a “de-escalation zone” the year before, this had failed to stop fighting between Assad’s forces and militants. “None of these Turkish servicemen either suffered or came under threat at these posts,” Peskov said . “The tragic deaths of Turkish troops occurred at the places of offensive operations by terrorist formations, among which, incidentally, there are numerous foreign mercenaries, including citizens of the former Soviet Union.” “The Turkish side did not report about the presence of Turkish forces there, despite our inquiries,” he continued. Turkish authorities have disputed this, saying that they did provide Russia with details about their force posture in Syria prior to the strikes. It’s important to note that who carried out the strikes that killed the Turkish troops and how remains somewhat disputed itself. The Turkish government has insisted that the Syrian air force conducted the airstrikes on its forces, but reports say that combat jets that only Russia flies in Syria were also seen overhead at the time. Any airstrikes that occurred after dark would have also been beyond the capabilities of Syria’s limited air assets. The Russian Ministry of Defense has said that Syrian artillery was to blame, according to Russian state media . It also denied that its forces were operating in the area at the time at all. “The Syrian Army has every right to respond to repeated ceasefire violations in the Idlib zone and suppress terrorists,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said on Feb. 28. “We cannot stop the Syrian Army from implementing the provisions of U.N. Security Council resolutions on the uncompromising fight against all forms of terrorism.” However, Russia’s air assets in Syria are infinitely more capable than those of the Syrian Air Force, which has suffered numerous losses over nearly a decade of conflict, including with other regional adversaries , and operates almost exclusively during the day. Video and pictures from observers on the ground show that Russian sorties simply outnumber those of their Syrian counterparts. Still, this would not be the first time Turkey has blamed apparent Russian airstrikes on Assad. Turkish officials also said that the Syrian Air Force was responsible for killing its troops in an incident on Feb. 20, despite evidence to the contrary. Fighting, including more airstrikes, has continued in Idlib, despite these various pronouncements and it’s unclear where the various parties will go from here. The Turkish government called an emergency meeting with representatives from its NATO allies on Feb. 28. Despite declarations of support for Turkey, none of the Alliance’s members, so far, appear to be moving to more actively support Ankara in the conflict. The official statement from NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg decried “indiscriminate airstrikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia,” but did not blame one party in particular for the deaths of the Turkish troops. It also called for de-escalation on all sides and a return to the provisions of the 2018 ceasefire deal. Turkey could conceivably attempt to enforce a no-fly zone over Idlib and other areas of northwestern Syria by itself. It could also keep combat jets, such as its American-made F-16 Vipers , on routine patrols on its side of the Turkish-Syrian border, poised to chase away any intruding aircraft or conduct more retaliatory strikes on short notice, as a deterrent. Both options do raise the risk of direct confrontations with Russia’s aircraft or air defenses in Syria. It’s certainly true that Turkey has not shied away from shooting down Russian, as well as Syrian, aircraft in the past, but there are some indications that authorities in Ankara might be more wary of being faced with the prospect of finding itself in a major aerial engagement without explicit support from its allies. It’s important to remember that Turkey has moved closer to Russia’s sphere of influence in recent years, too, including buying advanced weaponry from them in spite of protests from their NATO allies. In a clear sign that Turkey did not get the level of support it wants now from NATO, Turkish officials have effectively removed all restrictions on the movement of Syrian refugees and other foreign migrants out of the country and many of those individuals have already begun attempting to make their way westward into Europe. Erdogan has long threatened to weaponize these groups , tapping into growing European anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments and offering to keep them contained within Turkey in exchange for various concessions. This seems to be the exact calculus for the abrupt shift in Turkish policy now. Furthermore, last week, Turkey approached the United States about deploying batteries of Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to its southern Hatay province, which borders Idlib. This plan reportedly envisioned those air defense assets as presenting an additional deterrent to Russian and Syrian air operations across the border. Since then, the Pentagon has said it has talked with its Turkish counterparts about possible ways the two countries, together with the international community, can cooperate on Syria, but has yet to respond publicly to the request for Patriots one way or another. U.S.-Turkish relations have been strained over a number of issues in recent years, including Ankara’s decision to purchase Russian-made S-400 air defense systems , which resulted in Turkey’s Air Force getting booted from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, and its unilateral intervention into northern Syrian last year. “I hope that President Erdogan will see that we are the ally of their past and their future and they need to drop the S-400,” Kay Bailey Hutchison, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told reporters on Feb. 27. “They see what Russia is, they see what they’re doing now, and if they are attacking Turkish troops, then that should outweigh everything else that is happening between Turkey and Russia.” Turkey continues to refuse to get rid of the S-400s, which are slated to become operational in April . At which time it is possible that they could, ironically, deploy them to the border areas to challenge Russian and Syrian aerial activity, as well. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, who himself has a good relationship with Erdogan, has called for a no-fly zone in Syria, as well. Trump has called on Assad, and its Russian allies, to halt their offensive in Idlib, but he has repeatedly expressed his desire to disengage the United States from the Syrian conflict, too. It seems unlikely that the U.S. government, broadly, is interested in putting itself in a position where it would explicitly be threatening to shoot down Russian aircraft, either. Turkey’s military resources are also increasingly strained as Erdogan has pursued a more assertive foreign policy. While Turkish troops have been increasingly dying in Idlib, casualties are also mounting among the country’s forces in Libya, another expanding conflict that the War Zone has been following closely . It’s also worth pointing out that while Turkey and Russia appear to be embroiled in low-level conflict in northeastern Syria already, the two countries continue to conduct joint military patrols along a buffer zone in northeastern Syria. Ankara and Moscow both see these operations as essential to their respective agendas of keeping Kurdish groups in check and challenging a dwindling American military presence in that region. A collapse in Turkish-Russian ties would upend all that, something that neither side seems interesting in allowing to happen. Preparations are now underway for a meeting between Erdogan and Putin over Idlib in March. At the same time, neither Assad nor Turkey seems inclined to back down over control of Idlib, the last major bastion of anti-regime forces in northwestern Syria. As the fighting continues the risks of further errors in judgment and miscalculations, ones that might be too big to simply explain away by blaming the regime in Damascus, will only increase. As noted, there is evidence that Turkish forces on the ground have been trying to shoot down Russian combat jets, as well as Syrian military aircraft and helicopters. This, in turn, raises the possibility of an overt confrontation between Turkey and Russia, which could quickly spiral into a larger regional conflagration. UPDATE: 9:40pm EST A U.S. State Department official has told reporters that the United States is now looking at ways to support Turkey with regards to the situation in Idlib, but that there are no plans to send any U.S. troops or Patriot surface-to-air missile systems. When it comes to the Patriots, the official said that there were simply none of these air defense systems available at present for such a deployment, an issue that The War Zone had previously noted might come up. The U.S. government could look to increase intelligence sharing or at providing logistical or other non-combat support to Turkey. In addition, the State Department official did not specifically blame Russia for the airstrikes that killed the Turkish troops in Idlib on Feb. 27. However, they did say the idea that the Syrian Air Force was making any meaningful contributions to the air campaign in Idlib it was “laughable.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Force Munitions Air-To-Ground"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2018",Navy Instagram Tells China “You Don’t Want To Play Laser Tag With Us” After Pacific Incident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s official Instagram account has issued a curious warning of sorts informing the Chinese military that it doesn’t want to “play laser tag” with it in the future. This comes a day after reports emerged that a People’s Liberation Army Navy destroyer had aimed a laser beam at a Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flying in the Philippine Sea earlier this month. The Navy has now confirmed that the incident in the South China Sea took place on Feb. 17, 2020, and that it involved a P-8A from Patrol Squadron 45 (VP-45), which is headquartered at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in Florida. This particular aircraft is forward-deployed to Okinawa, Japan, and was flying approximately 380 miles west of Guam when it encountered the Chinese warship. The Navy did not identify the ship in its press release, but other reports say that it was most likely the destroyer Hohhot , which carries the pennant number 161 and is the newest addition to the Type 052D Luyang III class. The service said that no one was injured in the incident, but that it was assessing the Poseidon for potential damage. “#ICYMI [in case you missed it] The Chinese Navy recently pointed a laser in an unsafe and unprofessional manner at a #USNavy P-8A flying in airspace above international waters,” the Navy’s Instagram post adds. “These acts violate the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea, a multilateral agreement reached at the 2014 Western Pacific Naval Symposium to reduce the chance of an incident at sea.” An aerial picture of Woody Island , one of China’s largest island outposts in the South China Sea, with the text “Meanwhile, in the South China Sea” and an inset showing what appears to be a laser light show or lasers accompanying a music concert, accompanied the social media post . The laser image is a free “rave” computer desktop background available online . Instagram Screencap It’s important to remember that the Navy has said that a destroyer lased the P-8A, not a ground-based system on one of China’s island outposts. Woody Island is also more than 2,000 miles, and across the Philippines, west of Guam, reinforcing that this image is not directly related to the actual incident in any way. One of Patrol Squadron 45’s (VP-45) P-8A Poseidon patrol planes in Thailand for Exercise Cobra Gold on Feb. 26, 2020., USN The first part of the Instagram post sounds like an implied threat, but there’s no indication of what the Navy might be prepared to do in response to future laser incidents. The service is increasingly installing laser weapon systems of its own, including dazzlers to blind or confuse enemy sensors or optical guidance systems, on various types of ships , which could lead to “laser tag” in the future. Despite the otherwise light-hearted nature of the social media post, these attacks can be potentially very serious. The Navy said that the laser employed in this recent incident with the P-8A in the Philippine Sea was also not even visible to the naked eye and was only seen through one of the aircraft’s sensors. Depending on the power of the laser in question, it could temporarily blind an aircraft’s crew or cause permanent eye damage, as well as cause damage to optical sensors. Even temporary blindness or partial blindness could be very disorienting and dangerous for pilots. The U.S. military says a Chinese laser fired from the country’s outpost in the East African nation of Djibouti did injure the crew of a U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo aircraft during another incident in 2018. As the Instagram post implies, encounters with Chinese lasers have also become extremely common in hotly contested South China Sea and not just for the U.S. military. The Australian military reported being in the receiving end of laser incidents on multiple occasions last year. Australian authorities said that Chinese fishing boats, possibly members of the country’s quasi-military Maritime Militia, also known as the “ Little Blue Men ,” rather than warships like the Hohhot were responsible. The Type 052D Luyang III class destroyer Hohhot ., China Military Online The Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea, or CUES , which 21 countries have agreed to abide by, including China and the United States, expressly prohibits this kind of activity. Unfortunately, it is not a legally-binding treaty and there are no hard enforcement mechanisms for violations. The Pentagon and the Chinese Ministry of Defense had also previously signed a memorandum of understanding meant to prevent these kinds of altercations. Unfortunately, China has taken an increasingly aggressive stance when it comes to asserting its expansive territorial claims over the South China Sea, which are not internationally recognized, since CUES came into effect in 2014. Beyond lasers, U.S. military aircraft in the region have also been in the receiving end of electronic warfare attacks and aggressive intercepts over the years. Potentially dangerous encounters haven’t been limited to aircraft, either. In September 2018, the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 052C Luyang II class destroyer Lanzhou almost collided with the Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Decatur in a particularly dangerous incident at sea. This latest laser incident in the Philippine Sea comes as the Navy continues to conduct so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrols (FONOPS) close to Chinese island outposts in the region to challenge Beijing’s territorial claims. American warships and aircraft have also been performing similar missions through the increasingly tense Strait of Taiwan . While the Navy may be tired of ‘playing games’ with its Chinese counterparts in the region, as long as the United States and China continue to challenge each other’s very presence, it seems likely that this kind of “laser tag,” among other things, will continue.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2020",Elon Musk Says Era Of Fighter Jet Is Over And F-35 Should Have Drone Competitor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elon Musk was the star attraction over at the Air Force Association’s Air Warfare Symposium in Florida this week. This afternoon he sat down for an incredibly frank and fascinating interview session in front of an audience of symposium attendees. Most of the discussion was about space and space-launch capabilities, but the dialogue strayed off into a number of interesting areas. The most of which resulted in some raw words about the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the procurement strategy that underpinned it, what it’s competitor should be, as well as where the future of air warfare lies. Considering the crowd is made up of service and defense industry personnel, many which have a direct stake in the F-35 program and the future of tactical airpower, taking on the Air Force’s prized gold-plated fighter program was bold to say the least, as was his response on how the age of fighter jets dominating the sky is over. When asked about competition, Musk stated: “I think competition is a good thing. It may seem at times that we should focus our efforts on one system rather than divide them and have two competing systems. Like, not to cause controversy, like, in my opinion, Joint Strike Fighter… There should be a competitor to JSF… I know it’s a controversial subject, but, you know, it’s not good to have one provider. It’s good to have competition where that competition is meaningful and somebody can actually lose…” In a Tweet reply to Aviation Week reporter Lee Hudson, Musk clarified what he thought the competitor to the Joint Strike Fighter should be. He stated: “The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that’s remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it.” When asked about his thoughts on the future of warfare in the air domain, Musk gave another incredibly frank answer: “For the air domain… things are definitely going to go into, kind of… locally autonomous drone warfare… is where the future will be… It’s not I want the future to be this, this is what the future will be, autonomous drone warfare… At a local level… I can’t believe I am saying this because this is dangerous, but this is simply what will occur. Drones locally will be autonomous, but I think we still want to retain the authority to damage or destroy anything that isn’t an autonomous drone. Keep the authority back there with a person in the loom. The fighter jet era has passed. It’s drones.” Probably the most important theme of this site and my work over the years was largely summed up by Musk. If you want an extremely in-depth background on this issue, how advanced air combat drones that were once the most promising technology since the jet engine largely disappeared and why that is a huge problem, as well as a history on the subject and more, read my expose linked here . The fighter jet era of airpower is, at the very least, in its twilight. The Air Force has been reluctant to embrace that reality to an incredibly frustrating degree. Musk’s bold statements, regardless of how informed they truly were, could help make an impact on this absolutely critical aspect to America’s national security. Watch the entire interview below.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 17, 2020",NASA Airstrip Deep In The Mojave Desert Has Been Turned Into A Military Drone Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hidden away in the desolate mountains of the Mojave desert, NASA has been operating an expansive space communications and research complex since almost the very beginning of the Cold War-era Space Race. The historic and isolated locale is also home to an unassuming airstrip that runs alongside a dry lakebed. It has long caught the eye of The War Zone as a particularly ideal location for a drone base, and, as it turns out, this once austere runway has been quietly transformed into exactly that. Goldstone Airport, also known by the abbreviation GTS, sits at an altitude of 3,038 feet and has a single runway that is approximately 6,000 feet long. It is situated within NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) along Goldstone Dry Lake. The entire complex is located to the northeast of Barstow, California and the airport is approximately 13 miles northwest of the center of the U.S. Army’s Fort Irwin, which oversees the nearby National Training Center , one of the service’s premier training facilities. The GDSCC is itself within the bounds of Fort Irwin and the NTC. The area and its various facilities take their name from Goldstone, California, a gold-mining ghost town in the vicinity. Imagery of Goldstone Airport that The War Zone obtained exclusively from Planet Labs shows that, at least as of Feb. 12, 2020, it had one large permanent hangar, as well as a separate ramp with a semi-permanent clamshell-type hangar and a single sunshade. What appears to be a pair of MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones are out in the open near the sunshade. It’s worth noting that the imagery has a minor alignment processing error, which creates a small offset discrepancy between the stitched-together satellite images that make up the scene.

The NTC, which first opened in 1980, encompasses an area covering more than 1,000 square miles and provides ample room for large and highly complex wargaming. These exercises typically take place before a large Army unit deploys overseas. A US Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle., General Atomics Space Race Origins NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) is situated within the boundaries of Fort Irwin and the National Training Center, but the drone base within its confines is a relatively new addition. The airfield had previously supported the deep space communications site’s operations. The Army began building the first space communications antenna at Goldstone, an 85-foot wide Cassegrain type , in 1958 to support the Pioneer space probe program. The service’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory was in charge of the program. That same year, the United States created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which subsequently took control of the JPL and the Pioneer Deep Space Station, also known as DSS 11. A basic map of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. Goldstone Airport is listed as “Airstrip (Military Training Area).”, NASA By the time DSS 11 began operations, the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union was in full swing. The Soviets had stunned the world in 1957 when they launched Sputnik, the first-ever man-made satellite in orbit around the Earth. The U.S. government was determined to catch up, launching the first Explorer satellite in January 1958. Between 1958 and 1960, NASA also launched 10 Pioneer space probe missions, the bulk of which were to the Moon, though one was also sent to orbit Venus. DSS 11 provided a critical link to these probes. A second wave of launches, 9 in total, one of which was destroyed in a launch failure, occurred between 1965 and 1978. These probes studied the Sun, Jupiter, Venus, and general weather patterns in space. NASA only decommissioned DSS-11 in 1981 and stopped monitoring the remaining Pioneer probes altogether in 1992. Artwork depicting one of the Pioneer probes., NASA In the intervening years, DSS 11 also supported a wide array of other NASA space programs, including the Viking space probe and lander missions to Mars and Voyager deep space probe missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The Viking and Voyager missions were all launched in the 1970s. The Pioneer Deep Space Station also had a role in the Apollo manned missions to the Moon. Beyond Pioneer NASA operations at Goldstone also grew significantly in the decades after the construction of DSS 11 and the beginning of the Pioneer program. In 1959, the complex gained its second site, DSS 12, or Echo, which initially supported the balloon satellite communications program of the same name with another 85-foot Cassegrain antenna. The Echo antenna was also employed as a radio telescope and gave NASA its first radar imagery of Venus. A static inflation test of one of the 135-foot diameter Echo balloons at a facility in Weeksville, North Carolina in 1961. Individuals observing the test, as well as a station wagon, are visible at the bottom for scale., NASA In 1962, NASA built a new 85-foot antenna at the Echo site with an hour angle-declination (HA/DEC) drive system that was better suited to supporting deep space missions. The existing antenna had an azimuth-elevation drive system intended for tracking objects closer to Earth, such as the Echo balloons. The DSS 11 antenna also had an HA/DEC drive system. As a result, workers moved the azimuth-elevation drive system-equipped antenna from DSS 12 to a new site, which became known as Venus or DSS 13. HA/DEC drive system-equipped antenna at DSS 12., NASA The antenna at DSS 13, which had originally been in place at DSS 12., NASA The year after the construction of the new antenna at the Echo site and the creation of the Venus site, NASA embarked on a project to build a significantly larger and more powerful antenna. Work on DSS 14, also known as Mars, with its massive antenna, nearly 230 feet wide, was finished in 1966 and immediately began supporting the Mariner missions to Mars. DSS 14 eventually became the first node in NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN), which consists of three similar antennas, the other two of which are in Australia and Spain. The Signal Processing Center, also known as SPC 10, was and still is collocated with DSS 14 and serves as the central data collection point for the Goldstone complex. The personnel there also remotely control all the other antennas across the facility. The construction of DSS 16 and 17, both of which NASA built in what became known as the Apollo Valley or just Apollo, came soon after DSS 14’s completion. The Apollo antennas, the first of which was finished in 1966, were both specifically intended for the manned space missions of the same name, including the Apollo 11 mission , the first to bring humans to the surface of the Moon. DSS 16., NASA During the 1970s and 1980s, NASA continued to upgrade the various sites at Goldstone, including the conversion of the existing 85-foot antennas to 111.5-foot designs. It also built a new 111.5-foot antenna with an azimuth-elevation drive system, known as DSS 15 or Uranus, within the complex in 1984. DSS 16 also began supporting the Space Shuttle program in the 1980s. DSS 15., NASA Between 1992 and 1996, NASA erected three new 111.5-foot Beam Waveguide antennas in the Apollo Valley for deep space communications and research, which became DSS 24, 25, and 26, known collectively as the Beam Waveguide Cluster. “This design uses five precision radio frequency mirrors to reflect radio signals along a beam-waveguide tube from the vertex of the antenna to the equipment room in the pedestal located below ground,” according to NASA . By moving “weather-sensitive electronic equipment underground” this “pedestal allows for easier repair, maintenance, and upgrades.” Two of the three Beam Waveguide Cluster antennas at Goldstone., NASA A briefing slide showing how the Beam Waveguide antenna functions., NASA The very last of the sites at Goldstone, known as DSS 27 and 28, and collectively as the Gemini Constellation, were originally built for the Army, but came under the control of NASA in 1994. These sites both have 111.5-foot Beam Waveguide antennas similar to those in the Apollo Valley. Initially, these antennas supported the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) program, which NASA conducted with the European Space Agency. Today, DSS 27 is part of the Deep Space Network, while DSS 28 has taken on a purely educational role as part of the Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GVART) project. GVART focuses on cultivating interest in radio astronomy among grade school and high school students. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iNM4Qip9eeM Today, DSS 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 27 are all inactive. Buildings at DSS 12 now house administrative offices. DSS 13 has been repurposed for research and development activities. DSS 14, 24, 25, and 26 all continue to support NASA’s Deep Space Network mission. The complex still helps track dozens of spacecraft across the solar system, including the various Mars rover missions. You can find a full list of the programs it presently supports here . Goldstone Airport’s NASA years Throughout all of the expansions and additions at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC), Goldstone Airport offered a valuable way for Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) personnel and contractors to make both routine and emergency trips to the remote complex. Since its founding in 1936, the official address of JPL’s headquarters has been in Pasadena, California, though the bulk of its main campus is now technically inside the limits of the city of La Cañada Flintridge. The straight distance between JPL and GDSCC, which lies to the northeast, is around 110 miles, but the actual distance by ground transport, at least as of 1977, was approximately 175 miles. The distance between Burbank Airport, where NASA staged many of the flights, and Goldstone Airport is around 115 miles. In its 1978 Fiscal Year budget request, NASA asked for $150,000 to extend the runway at Goldstone airport from 4,760 feet to 6,000 feet and widen it from 60 feet to 100 feet to better support these activities. Paved turnarounds and a small ramp at the north end of the runway were also part of the request, which Congress ultimately approved. Details about NASA’s expansion of Goldstone Airport from its Fiscal Year 1978 budget request., NASA “There is a constant requirement for JPL technical personnel to travel to Goldstone on routine or emergency projects for short periods of time,” an official budget document explained. “Consequently from 25 to 100 people are flown to and from Goldstone Daily.” These upgrades brought the runway at Goldstone to its present dimensions. They remained the extent of major improvements there for decades. Transfer to the Army It’s not entirely clear when NASA officially transferred control of Goldstone Airport to the Army. As of 2005, it was still using it for flights to the GDSCC. David Acton, a Ball Aerospace engineer who worked on the Deep Impact mission , which sent a probe to study the comet Tempel 1 that year, arranged for a tour of the complex for himself and a number of others. A NASA Beechcraft King Air flew them to Goldstone from Burbank. A NASA Beechcraft King Air aircraft collects David Acton and other members of the tour group at Goldstone Airport in 2005. The sparseness of the airstrip at the time is noticeable., David Acton via the University of Maryland However, in October 2014, the Army activated Company B , 229th Aviation Regiment at Goldstone Airport, marking the beginning of the drone training mission there. Early that same year, in its budget request for the upcoming 2015 Fiscal Year, the service asked for $45 million to build the new 52,100-square-foot hangar and associated infrastructure for Company B. The unit originally operated out of temporary structures. US Army US Army US Army Despite its training focus, Company B actually deployed for combat operations in Afghanistan in support of the U.S.-led coalition there in late 2015, with the idea that it would take up residence at the new facilities at Goldstone when it returned. The Army broke ground on the hangar and associated construction in January 2016. Satellite imagery showing the construction of the new Army complex at Goldstone, as well as Company B, 229th Aviation’s temporary facilities, sometime after January 2016., Bing Maps Bing Maps One can see in the recent satellite imagery of Goldstone that the runway is marked “UAS,” the abbreviation for “Unmanned Aircraft Systems.” This would indicate that it is only approved now for use by unmanned aircraft, which could preclude any further fixed-wing shuttle flights to the airport by the Army, NASA, or anyone else without some sort of prior approval and coordination. Helicopters could still potentially fly to and from the airport. With its new facilities at Goldstone Airport, Company B continues to fly training missions in support of activities at the nearby National Training Center. The airstrip is an ideal location for drone operations due to its remote location, combined with the general nature of the rest of GDSCC, which significantly reduces the amount of potential outside signal interference. This is one of the reasons why JPL decided to construct its space communications systems and radio telescopes in this area in the first place. Company B has also remained available for operational deployments, as necessary. In November 2017, the unit deployed to Iraq supporting the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS. One of Company B, 229th Aviation Regiment’s MQ-1Cs in Iraq in 2018., US Army Goldstone’s isolated location could also make a good place for testing more sensitive upgrades for the Gray Eagle or new, advanced unmanned platforms. In addition to its primary mission as a training facility, the NTC also supports various test and evaluation activities. With its space race origins, Goldstone Airport and the rest of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex has had a fascinating history already. That lineage has taken a new twist with the Army moving in and creating a key drone base out of the once very basic airstrip. The little remote base now looks set for years of further use supporting Army drone activities at the nearby National Training Center.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 7, 2020",Abrupt End Of Air Force MQ-9 Reaper Buys Points To New Focus On Survivable Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request shows the service expects to buy its last 24 MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft systems this year, with production basically ending next year with a total of 337 of drones delivered. It was originally thought that production would wind down over the next half-decade, with a total force of 363 MQ-9s being delivered. This potential change has a number of implications. Firstly, it would be an unwelcome and abrupt change for General Atomics, who builds the Reaper. Secondly, it points to a new and somewhat long-awaited reality in which the Air Force prioritizes survivability of its unmanned combat aircraft in order to be able to have them take a more central role in a conflict against an advanced peer-state foe. Air Force Magazine published an article about the uncertain fate of the MQ-9 production line on February 26th, 2020. In it, the General Atomics’ Chris Pehrson, Vice President of strategic development for the company, explained the peculiar situation, stating: “The abrupt shutdown of the production line without a transition plan does jeopardize the [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] enterprise… You’ll see impact eventually, when combat lines have to be reduced or … the assets aren’t there for training… We’re actually going out about 22 months ahead of delivery and procuring the long-lead item parts, … whether it’s [satellite communication] equipment or engines, … to negotiate the best prices and get the best deals for the government… Having the rug pulled out from under your feet at the last minute kind of disrupts all your supply chain investments that you’re making… If they stop production today, say, that’s going to have an immediate impact on … the composite manufacturing team, but as time moves on, that impact is going to ripple throughout the whole labor force… We’ll have unemployment or a layoff situation in certain skill sets if we don’t find a way to fill this decreased demand immediately with some other new product or new capability.” MQ-9., USAF Clearly, this is not good news for General Atomics’ unmanned aircraft division. They have other programs underway, namely the SkyGuardian derivative of the Reaper . The multi-mission SkyGuardian is modified to be able to fly in controlled airspace around normal air traffic and has a host of enhancements, including a 40-hour endurance and 50,000-foot ceiling. But still, the end of the legacy Reaper line would also mean an end of dominating the remotely piloted aircraft procurement space within the Air Force. Currently, the MQ-9 serves as the backbone of the Air Force’s combat drone fleet. SkyGuardian in flight., General Atomics It also comes as the company just built a huge new complex at its ever-expanding El Mirage flight test base, located just a handful of miles northwest of its Grey Butte master production facility. This new facility , which includes a 120,000 square-foot hangar, is said to have been built in part to support the SkyGuardian program, but it seems remarkably large for just that purpose.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Currently, SkyGuardian is on order with Royal Air Force under the Protector RG Mk1 name. Belgium has also purchased some of the aircraft and the RAAF could also put in an order. General Atomics sees the potential for sales to a number of other countries for various missions , as well. As it sits now, the Navy is only planning on buying two MQ-9s for the Marines in Fiscal Year 2020, down from three originally, and has cut the rest of the plan for more Marine Reapers. They had planned to buy another three in 2021. This also comes as the Air Force’s contractor-operated orbits—a term used to describe an area where unmanned aircraft can have a persistent presence overhead—are set to get cut, as well. Overall, the flying force’s number of orbits at any given time, each of which is usually made possible by a team of four aircraft and their support crews—is planned to be cut from 70 to 60. An MQ-9 that General Atomics owns and operators under contract to the US Air Force taxies toward the runway at Miroslawiec Air Base in Poland in March 2019., USAF The Army’s MQ-1C Grey Eagle , a derivative of the Predator/Reaper family, is also nearing the end of its production run. The Army is buying just nine of the aircraft in Fiscal Year 2020 and none in 2021. The MQ-9 series is also used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which still refers to them by General Atomics’ original name for the type, Predator B . NASA has operated two different derivatives for scientific missions , too. According to Air Force Magazine , General Atomics wants its smaller customers to switch over to the SkyGuardian for new orders as it would mean having only one type in production and those customers would benefit from its enhanced abilities and lower sustainment costs. A US Customs and Border Protection MQ-9. , DHS This proposed move is further evidence that the Air Force is coming to terms with the fact that it needs aerial platforms that are survivable in a peer-state conflict. The MQ-9 is a very capable unmanned sensor and weapons ‘truck,’ but it is relatively slow and vulnerable to enemy air defenses, even those belonging to non-state actors . Everything from air-to-air missiles to electronic warfare systems to defensive air-to-ground weaponry has been eyed as possible ways to give the MQ-9 a bit more survivability over the modern battlefield. But even with these additions, the aircraft’s applications become far more limited if operations in contested airspace become a reality. MQ-9 fitted with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile. , USAF As our readers know all too well, the Air Force was rapidly pursuing a more autonomous, faster, and far less detectable unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) as far back as the early 2000s. By the end of that decade, what seemed like the biggest leap in air combat capability since the jet engine went from being on the tip of the Air Force brass’s tongue to being scrubbed from all the force’s official plans and literature. It was sas if the concept of a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) never even existed. Whether those initiatives were pushed into the classified realm or were abandoned altogether is not entirely clear, but either way, their public absence is a major issue that has huge implications on America’s national security. You can read all about this bizarre situation, its ramifications, and the history of UCAVs in this past special feature of ours . Boeing’s X-45C was quite promising, but it’s capabilities fell on deaf ears within the USAF. Is this because other classified programs were more advanced or that the service largely abandoned the concept for questionable reasons. Either way, it is an issue., Boeing It has gotten to a point where America’s adversaries are pursuing the technology openly, as well. Whatever the case may be, geopolitical factors and the changing realities of air combat seem to have finally forced the Air Force’s hand to invest in survivable air combat drones, or at least begin to migrate what exists in the darkness into the light and scale up those initiatives substantially. General Atomics is aware that this potential seachange could drastically impact their military drone portfolio and the company is investing in figuring out what it has to offer next. “Think of them as a next-generation, what the MQ-9 does today, but it can do it in a less-permissive environment,” Pehrson told Air Force Magazine. “There aren’t any formal requirements yet. This is kind of building something in anticipation of what the requirements will be.” Air Force Magazine notes that Pehrson wouldn’t say if General Atomics has prototypes of a potentially new and more survivable design, but he did say that the concepts are newer than the Company’s Q-11, otherwise known by the Predator-C or Avenger . Predators A, B, and C, otherwise known as the Predator, Reaper, and Avenger. , General Atomics First flown in 2009 and further developed into a larger and more refined airframe, the Avenger, which has low observable (stealthy) features, never really caught on with a major customer. Still, a number of them were built and have seen action in both Afghanistan and Syria. The extent of those operations remains unclear , but its more survivable nature was likely leveraged for certain operations. Overall, the Q-11’s operations outside of the testing environment have been largely secretive. It is possible that a small fleet of these aircraft is flown in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency. Still, the Avenger clearly didn’t go far enough in terms of low observability and survivability with regards to facing a well-equipped peer-state with a dense integrated air defense system, so what comes next from General Atomics will likely be a substantial step beyond the Avenger’s capabilities in certain respects. On the other hand, it could be so cheap to procure that it is optionally expendable. The promising potential of lower-cost, but still somewhat survivable drones, which can also operate alongside manned aircraft, certainly is another factor, as are higher, faster, and longer-ranged weapons and sensor ‘trucks.’ The company could leverage its work on the MQ-25 program to come up with niche solutions that may not depend on the capability to penetrate enemy airspace necessarily, as well. We’ll just have to wait and see. A loaded up MQ-9 overseas. , USAF Seeing that the company lost the MQ-25 Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) contract with the Navy, and the fact that their “bread and butter” products that have long sold so well with the DoD may no longer be procured, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems is in a unique position in which it has to reorient itself to recapture some of this business. One would be foolish to count them out. The firm largely wrote the book on remotely piloted aircraft combat operations. They won’t go quietly into the night as competitors, such as Lockheed Martin, Kratos, and others, swoop in and grab the torch out of their hands. Who knows, their big new facility at El Mirage may hold some secrets already in the works to see that this doesn’t happen. It’s also important to note that Congress still has to approve the Air Force’s wish to end Reaper production early and the MQ-9s already in the inventory will serve for decades to come in very important ways. Beyond anything else, the end of production of once the Air Force’s cornerstone remotely piloted vehicles, ones that were designed to lord over the battlefield in permissive airspace, is a budding sign that the service is finally coming to its senses when it comes to the need to invest big in stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles and other survivable drone platforms.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 7, 2020",Air Force Names New HH-60W Rescue Helicopters After The “Jolly Green Giants” Of Vietnam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has officially nicknamed its new HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopters as Jolly Green IIs. This moniker is a direct reference to the Vietnam War-era HH-3E Jolly Green and HH-53B/C Super Jolly Green combat search and rescue helicopters that saved the lives of countless downed American aircrews during the conflict in Southeast Asia. Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett announced the HH-60W’s new name at the Air Force Association’s 2020 Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida on Feb. 27, 2020. The Air Force first hired Sikorsky, now a part of Lockheed Martin, to develop the Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH), which is a derivative of the U.S. Army’s UH-60M Black Hawk, in 2014. The HH-60W flew for the first time in 2019 and the Air Force awarded the first low-rate initial production contract for 10 helicopters that year. Sikorsky recently received a second contract low-rate production contract for 12 more Jolly Green IIs, valued at approximately $500 million. As recently as January , the service’s public plan had been to purchase up to 113 of these helicopters to replace all of its existing HH-60G Pave Hawks . It now says that it will only acquire up to 108 of the Jolly Green IIs. “Reviving the Jolly Green name honors our combat search and rescue crews past and present. Those who operate this aircraft will embody the motto, ‘These Things We Do, That Others May Live,’” Barrett said. “In the hands of our Airmen, this aircraft ensures the rescue community can perform their duties better than ever.” “Performing combat search and rescue and personnel recovery operations for the joint force is what the HH-60W is built to do,” Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein added. “The Jolly Green II gives us extended range and better capability.” An artwork depicting a pair of HH-60Ws together with a logo reflecting their new nickname, Jolly Green II., USAF Goldfein has a very personal perspective on the value of combat search and rescue capabilities. In 1999, a Serbian S-125 surface-to-air missile system shot him down while he was flying an F-16C Viper fighter jet over that country as part of Operation Allied Force . He ejected and was subsequently rescued by a NATO combat search and rescue helicopter. Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Barry Kamhoot and retired U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Wayne Fisk were also present at the ceremony. Kamhoot was one of the first HH-3E pilots and also flew HH-53B/Cs during the Vietnam War, becoming “a trailblazer within the rescue community,” according to the service. An HH-3E refuels somewhere over Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War., USAF An HH-53B lowers a pararescueman into the jungle below during a combat search and rescue mission during the Vietnam War., USAF Fisk is credited with being the first to unofficially nickname the HH-3Es “Jolly Green Giants” because of the “green feet” the helicopter’s tandem landing gear wheels would leave in the grass when they touched down to make rescues. The moniker was also a reference to the well-known mascot of the Green Giant frozen food brand. The HH-3Es eventually officially received the name “Jolly Green” and the HH-53B/Cs became “Super Jolly Greens.” Jolly Green Giant artwork on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force., USAF These nicknames also helped identify them as unique variants distinct from their Navy and Marine Corps cousins. The Air Force’s earlier CH-3C/E helicopters were technically nicknamed Sea Kings. This was because they were derivatives of Sikorsky’s original S-61 design , which the Navy had first adopted a variant of as the SH-3A Sea King . Similarly, the Navy and Marine Corps were first to adopt variants of Sikorsky’s larger and more powerful H-53 series , nicknaming them Sea Stallions, which carried over to the initial examples that the Air Force acquired. US Air Force CH-3Es, such as the one seen here, were also employed during the Vietnam War in the combat search and rescue role. These helicopters, officially nicknamed Sea Kings, can be seperated from later HH-3Es by their lack of an inflight refueling probe and sponson-mounted fuel tanks., USAF The Air Force chose to use developmental program names as the official nicknames for the combat search and rescue helicopters that followed, the HH-53 Pave Lows and HH-60G Pave Hawks. The Pave Lows were heavily employed for special operations missions, as well, and were redesignated as MH-53s before their retirement in 2008, at which time they were replaced by CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors. It’s also interesting to note that the HH-60W is the first H-60 derivative to not use “Hawk” in its official name. The effort to replace the HH-60Gs, the first of which entered service in the 1980s and which are in increasingly desperate need of replacement, has been a saga that you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone stories . In the interim, the Pave Hawks have continued to provide valuable combat search and rescue support for U.S. military operations around the world. An HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF The ceremony where the Jolly Green II name was announced also served as an opportunity to honor personnel from the 41st and 48th Rescue Squadrons who had rescued four American special operators and two members of an unspecified partner force during an operation somewhere in East Africa. Two HH-60Gs, using the call signs Jolly 41 and Jolly 42, had taken part in that mission. Though the Air Force described this operation as “ recent ,” the description it offered matches many the known details about a rescue mission in Southern Somalia in 2018. You can read more about that incident in this past War Zone story . “Our combat search and rescue force saves lives on the battlefield and during natural disasters,” U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command, also said after the announcement of the HH-60W’s new name. “The HH-60W Jolly Green II will ensure our rescue professionals continue to succeed.” The Air Force is continuing to test and evaluate the HH-60Ws and is hoping to field the first operational examples this year.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana hosted a meeting of two legends earlier this month. Retired NBA Hall of Famer and 14-time All-Star Karl Malone visited the base and got fly in the cockpit of one of the 2nd Bomb Wing’s venerable B-52H bombers , even taking the controls for a period. Malone , who is a Louisana native, spent Feb. 5 and 6 at Barksdale as part of a tour and public relations event. In addition to the B-52 flight, he had a chance to meet with various Air Force personnel, offer thoughts on leadership, and even give some pointers to the base’s intramural basketball team. Check out a bit of the Mailman’s B-52 adventure in the video below: Malone retired from the NBA in 2005 after a 20-year career, the bulk of which was spent with the Utah Jazz. He also played a single season with the Los Angeles Lakers and represented the United States in two Olympics, including as a member of the famous “ Dream Team ” at the 1992 summer games in Barcelona, Spain. In addition to his many appearances in the All-Star game and his induction into the Hall of Fame in 2010, Malone continues to rank second in career points scored behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He also holds the records for both career free throws made and attempted. Karl Malone at Barksdale Air Force Base in February 2020., USAF All told, the pilots and airmen at Barksdale were undoubtedly honored and excited to meet him and maybe play a little basketball with him, but the B-52 flight seems to have been among the high points for Malone himself. “I used to come out to the base, sit outside the gate, pull over to the side of the road and watch the planes go overhead,” he said in an official interview . “I’ve seen them from the ground and have seen them flying over,” he continued. “But to be inside a B-52 and see its capabilities, it’s surreal.” The Air Force didn’t just drop him into the cockpit, either. Barksdale’s 2nd Operational Support Squadron helped Malone get ready for the flight, including fitting the 6-foot-9 retired power forward with the proper flight equipment. They also gave him basic training on how to get out of the aircraft or eject in case of an emergency.

He also had 96th and 343rd Bomb Squadron shoulder patches. The 343rd is an Air Force Reserve unit that is assigned to the 307th Bomb Wing, which is also based at Barksdale and aligned with the active-component 2nd Bomb Wing.

The “60” in the serial number represents the fiscal year in which the Air Force purchased the aircraft, three years before Malone, who is now 56, was born. Karl Malone stands next to a B-52, with the serial number 60-0062, nicknamed Cajun Fear., USAF At present, the Air Force is expecting to keep flying B-52s, the last of which rolled off Boeing’s production line in 1962, at least until 2050 . The aircraft is set to receive a host of upgrades to improve its capabilities and general performance, including new radars and engines . The service also sees them as the primary platform for carrying an array of future hypersonic weapons . In addition, the B-52s will also continue to be an important component of the aerial portion of America’s nuclear triad and are slated to carry the future stealthy Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) nuclear-armed cruise missile. The bombers are no longer certified to carry nuclear gravity bombs. “I haven’t wiped the smile off of my face,” Malone said of his chance to fly in one of the 2nd Bomb Wing’s B-52s and his tour of Barksdale. “After spending these last two days with these Airmen, and I know it’s cliché, but I’m proud to be an American.” Karl Malone inside the cockpit of a B-52., USAF Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",The Air Force And SpaceX Are Teaming Up For A ‘Massive’ Live Fire Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As space continues to play an increasingly important role for the United States armed forces, the Department of Defense has been also increasingly engaging with the private aerospace and communications sector to develop and implement solutions that better help it confront emerging warfighting challenges. Just last week, Air Force acquisition chief William Roper told reporters at the Pentagon that the Air Force and SpaceX will conduct an event on April 8, together with other branches of the U.S. military, that will see SpaceX Starlink satellites link up with multiple armed forces systems in a “massive” live fire exercise. “SpaceX has been a great industry partner for us ,” Roper said. “They are very excited and we are excited to learn more about their satellites through the demonstration.” The demonstration will reportedly involve shooting down a drone and a cruise missile and will take place at several different sites including Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The massive tests will also include ground forces, submarines, ships, and a variety of space-based assets. SpaceX’s potentially game-changing Starlink concept involves launching large volumes of satellites – dozens at a time – that circle the earth providing broadband data-connectivity. You can learn all about Starlink and its novel operating concept by watching the video below. Wow! This Is What SpaceX's Starlink Satellites Look Like in the Night Sky https://t.co/UQBvYJmC2a pic.twitter.com/v116CC5lVW — SPACE.com (@SPACEdotcom) May 25, 2019 Roper also told reporters that the Air Force is in talks with Virgin Orbit to provide support for the exercise to better evaluate “on-demand” launch capabilities. Virgin Orbit has previously partnered with the U.K. Royal Air Force to provide launch capabilities for small satellite constellations and is on contract with the Air Force to conduct a first-of-its-kind launch from Guam later this year. The live fire exercise will be part of a larger test of the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a new communications ecosystem designed to enable Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), allowing U.S. forces and allies to coordinate military operations in real-time across all domains, such as sea, land, air, space and cyber operations. The system was first tested in December 2019 with mixed results . Roper said that his “hope for this event, unlike the first event, is that we have an equal measure of things that fail for things that succeeded.” Air Force Magazine quoted Roper as saying he wanted a “ 50-50 split between success and failure ” in this latest test, enabling developers to better work the kinks out of the new satellite-based system. During a less extensive test of the system last month, Starlink satellites connected with an AC-130 gunship. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launching 60 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on May 23, 2019, 1st Lt Alex Preisser, USAF Roper has also said that the new ABMS system will not only help replace the aging, rickety fleet of E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) command aircraft, but also add new capabilities that leverage the latest in machine learning , or artificial intelligence, to better predict what types of information users want from the system and more prominently push that information to them. “We’ve come so far in ABMS that we realize that it’s bigger than just replacing the capability that JSTARS provides,” Roper said last week. “If you get ABMS right, you’ve just built the military’s ‘internet of things.’ That’s super exciting.” This isn’t the first time SpaceX and the Department of Defense have joined forces. The company has launched a number of DoD payloads into orbit. Most notably, in early 2018, it launched a secretive experimental spacecraft named Zuma. Zuma’s mission and operator remain unknown, but we know it was built by Northrop Grumman and officially designated USA 280. Shortly after Zuma’s launch, murky reports began circulating that the spacecraft had been lost during the final stages of its insertion into orbit, although there remain some doubts about those claims as there is the possibility that Zuma was intended to remain hidden once in space . Both Northrop Grumman and SpaceX have refused to confirm or deny anything about the status of Zuma due to the secrecy surrounding the spacecraft. The military wants to leverage advance computing and networking to dominate the battlespace of the future. Here Maj. Jerry Jones and Capt. Monica Holmes demonstrate the Command Post Computing Environment at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, June 5, 2018. CP CE will feature a simplified user experience by combining warfighting functions into a common user interface, reducing the training burden on Soldiers and accelerating the integration of new capabilities. Core CP CE common infrastructure functions will provide chat, a standardized map, message centers and an extensible data model., US Army The pivot to using smaller satellites is part of the DoD’s larger strategy to ensure control over the new high ground: outer space. America’s most prominent adversaries have been launching what appear to be “ killer satellites ” in recent years and developing other anti-satellite capabilities , forcing the U.S. to examine new strategies for protecting its own critical space-based capabilities. Last month, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper gave a joint press briefing with French Minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly – the top defense official in a country that is presently planning to put defensive weapons in space –  in which Esper claimed that it is this direct escalation by Russia and China that has pushed the U.S. to begin militarizing space : “I would just add that our – our nations have been in space for many, many years. It’s just been recently that both China and Russia pushed us to the point where it now became a warfighting domain.” “As a result, the United States has stood up Space Command and just recently, Space Force, to make sure that we can preserve space as a global commons. It’s important not just to our security, but to our commerce, our way of life, our understanding of the planet, weather, you name it. So it’s very important that we – we now treat it that way and make sure that we’re prepared to defend ourselves and preserve space.” Launching constellations of smaller data-linked satellites could be a means of countering the threat posed by anti-satellite weaponry or “killer” satellites. Rather than having all your space eggs in one space-based basket, distributing those resources among multiple, smaller satellites could ensure operational communications, targeting, or surveillance capabilities even if individual satellites are defeated. They could also be more easily replaced if they are lost. To that end, just this month General John Raymond, Chief of Space Operations for the newly created U.S. Space Force and Commander of U.S. Space Command , signed an initiative for Enterprise Satellite Communication ( SATCOM ), which will “enhance integration between the military and private sectors” and “enable warfighters with the ability to transition between their networks and terminals to alternate resources with little or no disruption.” You can read the entire scope of this enterprise vision here . Space Force’s envisioned SATCOM infrastructure will enable the creation of an automated enterprise-wide situational awareness/common operational picture (SA/COP)., SPACEFORCE.MIL Still, some have questioned whether smaller or commercial satellites are sufficiently robust to handle military missions and be resistant to various threats. At the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium in April 2019, then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson raised a number of these concerns. “Launching hundreds of cheap satellites into theater as a substitute for the complex architectures where we provide key capabilities to the warfighter will result in failure on America’s worst day if relied upon alone. The analysis shows that,” Wilson said. “Increasing the number of satellites helps. But numbers alone are not enough. The study also found that space missions that are not well aligned with commercial, low-Earth orbit satellite are actually better off staying where they are or making other changes to protect themselves.” Former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., USAF Wilson also stated ominously that a show of force in space might be necessary to deter America’s potential adversaries from conducting attacks on American space assets, underlining there are space-based capabilities still unknown to the public or America’s competitors: “There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence. That capability needs to be one that’s understood by your adversary. They need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty. How confident are they that they know everything we can do? Because there’s a risk calculation in the mind of an adversary.” Others have alluded to the possible need to show our adversaries what the U.S. can actually do in space to deter future aggression, as well as better inform the U.S. public about the nature of the emerging threats in orbit. As far as we know, neither move has come to pass. Hopefully, we will learn more about this upcoming expansive live-fire exercise and how SpaceX’s budding Starlink network will play into it, as well as some information about how well ABMS performs, once it has completed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 16, 2020",General Warns Of Aerial Tanker Shortage As Air Force Looks To Retire 13 KC-135s And 16 KC-10s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of U.S. Transportation Command has publicly challenged the U.S. Air Force’s assertion that it can retire 16 KC-10A Extender and 13 KC-135R Stratotanker aerial refueling tankers in the coming fiscal year without having a major operational impact. This comes as the Air Force says that it hopes Boeing, the manufacturer of the troubled new KC-46A Pegasus tanker, will have devised an acceptable strategy for fixing critical issues with those aircraft, especially with the Remote Vision System that boom operators rely on, which are preventing them from taking part in actual combat and other contingency operations. U.S. Army General Stephen Lyons, the commander of Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), made his position clear in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 25, 2020. The general had also outlined his points in a letter containing his so-called “Unfunded Priority List,” a wishlist of things the command wants if Congress makes additional funding available, which he sent to the House Armed Services Committee on Feb. 20. Breaking Defense was first to report on that letter. “We believe [these planes] must be retained,” General Lyons told Senators . Retiring the KC-10As and KC-135Rs before the KC-46As are truly capable of performing their key aerial refueling mission does create a “dip in operational capability.” He added that the Pegasuses were “not usable” in their present configuration for actual operational missions. “Aerial refueling is USTRANSCOM’s number one unfunded priority,” Lyons had explained in his letter to the House Armed Services Committee. The Air Force’s desire to retire the KC-10As and KC-135Rs in the 2021 Fiscal Year “creates a capacity gap with significant impacts to Combatant Command daily competition and wartime missions, and negatively impacts senior leader decision space for mobilization when confronted with a crisis.” The section on aerial refueling from TRANSCOM’s Unfunded Priority List letter to the House Armed Services Committee., TRANSCOM via Breaking Defense Lyons wants Congress to “buy back” the tankers that the Air Force has proposed retiring in the 2021 Fiscal Year and insist on a “year-by-year review” of any future tanker retirement plans “based on KC-46 progress.” Transportation Command has estimated that it would cost $110 million to keep the 16 KC-10As and 13 KC-135Rs flying for another year. TRANSCOM’s overall view of the situation stands in stark contrast to the Air Force’s view that the plans it outlined in its 2021 Fiscal Year Budget proposal presented an “acceptable risk” to its overall aerial refueling tanker capacity. The service has also insisted that its decision to continue buying KC-46As will allow it to meet a Congressionally-mandated fleet of 479 tankers in total, despite acknowledging the limited capabilities that the Pegasuses offer in their present form. A KC-46A refuels an F-16C Viper fighter jet during a test., USAF “So the risk we take in the – the capacity for tankers essentially is what we consider acceptable risk, given that we never go below the 479 total tankers available, and it allows us to – even though we’re – we don’t have full capability on the KC-46 yet, it allows us to continue to do the testing that we want to do so when we complete those fixes in the – in the tanker that we’re fully able to – to make those fully mission capable and get started immediately,” Air Force Major General John Pletcher Air Force Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller, told reporters during the rollout of the service’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget request on Feb. 10. The KC-46As still suffer from a number of critical issues and there have been persistent problems with Boeing’s quality control during the production of the aircraft. The biggest issue, in terms of operational capability, remains the poor functionality of the tanker’s much-touted Remote Vision System (RVS), a saga that The War Zone has been following closely in recent years . In a traditional aerial refueling tanker equipped with a boom, a boom operator lies in the rear of the plane and steers it into receiving aircraft. On the KC-46A, the boom operators sit in the main cabin and use the RVS, which consists of an array of cameras at the rear of the tanker, to perform this task. The RVS’s video feeds offer a hybrid 2D-3D view and the boom operators wear special glasses to get the full effect, similar in broad strokes to what one might experience watching a 3D movie in a theater. Testing exposed a litany of problems, including a lack of depth perception raising the risk of the boom hitting the receiving aircraft. You can read more about the full extent of the RVS troubles in these past War Zone pieces . Boom operators on a KC-46A wearing their special glasses., USAF Boeing agreed last year to completely overhaul the system at its own expense, but has yet to present a proposal that the Air Force believes will adequately solve the problem . The service hopes the company will have an acceptable solution ready next month , but it will still take years to fully develop and test it and then integrate it onto the aircraft it has already received. As of December 2019, Air Force units had taken delivery of 30 KC-46As, all of which will need the upgrades. The service wants to buy another 15 Pegasuses in the 2021 Fiscal Year. Growing concerns about tanker capacity could also open the door for Congress to push the Air Force to look harder at whether contractors could provide additional non-combat tanker capacity to help free up remaining KC-10As and KC-135Rs for operational deployments, something the War Zone has discussed in depth in the past. TRANSCOM has been looking into this as an alternative for meeting its aerial refueling requirements for months now and the U.S. Navy has already been using private tankers to support test and training missions for years. No matter what, it had already seemed very possible that the Air Force and Congress were on a collision course over the service’s desire to retire the tankers, as well as dozens of other aircraft and drones , in the next Fiscal Year. With TRANSCOM’s head openly saying that sending 16 KC-10As and 13 KC-135Rs to the boneyard next year will have significant negative operational impacts, this seems all but inevitable now. The Air Force may already be backing down. Lyons indicated that the service had agreed to retain 28 “legacy” tankers. It’s not entirely clear if that means keeping the bulk of the 29 aircraft it had wanted to retire in the next Fiscal Year or if this is in reference to slowing future tanker retirement plans. TRANSCOM’s top officer promised to come back and fully brief legislators on the new plan in the near future, at which time the actual plan for the Air Force’s tanker fleets in the 2021 Fiscal Year may become clearer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 3, 2018","Photos Surface Of The Army’s Crazy 1,000 Mile Range Supergun Concept: Here’s What We Know","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army recently, and apparently inadvertently, offered a look at new concept art and models relating to a massive artillery piece that could have a range of 1,000 miles or more. The design concept has features that are reminiscent of the Cold War-era efforts such as the Army’s M65 “Atomic Annie” 280mm cannon and the modified 16-inch naval gun employed in the U.S.-Canadian High Altitude Research Project, or HARP. It also has a general look that wouldn’t be out of place in the G.I. Joe universe . Last week, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), part of what is now called the Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), which is itself subordinate to the service’s new Futures Command, released pictures on its social media accounts of a visit by Major General John George and his staff. These include images that included details about what is officially known as the Strategic Long-Range Cannon (SLRC). Major General George is presently head of CCDC. At the time of writing, all of the pictures from his tour of ARL appear to no longer be available official pages, but copies showing the concept art, models, and poster with basic SLRC details are now floating around online. “Penetrates and dis-integrates enemy A2/AD [anti access, area denial] defenses to create windows of opportunity for exploitation by the Joint Force,” the SLRC poster reads. “Platform is comprised of a weapon, prime mover, and trailer, [and] projectile and propelling charge capable of delivering massed fires at strategic ranges for multi-domain operations.” US Army US Army US Army US Army The poster also lists the following four “key points”: “Range: Beyond 1000 miles” “Crew: 8 Personnel Per platform” “Quantity: 4 Platforms Per Battery” “Transportability: Sea and Air” For comparison, the Army’s standard 155mm M777 towed howitzer takes five people to operate and a maximum range of 25 miles when using M982 Excalibur precision-guided shells. The new 155mm M109A7 self-propelled howitzer has a crew of four and can hit targets out to around 19 miles with rocket-assisted shells. The poster does not offer any other hard requirements for the SLRC, such as the diameter of the cannon, the length of its barrel, the weight of the system or its ammunition. The poster does show at least a notional configuration for the weapon. This includes the cannon on a “platform” that a prime mover – an 8×8 Oshkosh M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) tractor is depicted on the poster – would bring to a particular location. Personnel would then disconnect the platform from the trailer, which consists of a detachable gooseneck and connects to the tractor, and a six-wheel trailing section. The weapon would then be employed from this fixed location. An M1070 HETS tractor., US Army This is similar, though not identical to the configuration of the 280mm M65 cannon , better known as Atomic Annie because of its primary mission to fire nuclear artillery shells. The M65 was mounted on a platform that was transported to the firing position suspended between two specially designed Kenworth 4×4 tractor trucks. The vehicle in front was designated the M249 and the one in the rear was the M250 and drivers operated both independently in a manner similar to a tiller-truck fire engine . The Atomic Annies, which weighed just over 83 tons, not including the Kenworth prime movers, entered service in 1955 and were ultimately deployed to West Germany, South Korea, and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The Army withdrew them from service in 1962. The SLRC itself, based on what can be seen in the concept art and models, is a very large bore weapon. The rear portion of the barrel, where the firing action would be, is nestled inside a cage-like structure. This is at least visually similar to the framing around much of the 16-inch HARP gun. In the 1960s, the United States and Canada conducted a variety of experiments using this gun, as well as other smaller designs, as part of research into low-cost methods of sending objects into space. Canadian engineer Gerald Bull was primarily responsible for the 16-inch gun, which the U.S. Army crafted under his direction, in part, by combining the barrels from two 16-inch naval guns. During testing, the system received a barrel extension and, in its final configuration, was approximately 120 feet long and weighed almost 100 tons. What remains of the 16-inch HARP gun, abandoned in Barbados., Brohav via Wikimedia Bull, however, saw the system’s potential as a weapon and continued to pitch the idea of a supergun to countries around the world for decades after the HARP program ended. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ultimately hired the Canadian to develop what became known as the Babylon Guns . The first of these was the “Baby Babylon,” a purely experimental test gun. A larger “Big Babylon,” which was to have been an operational weapon, was never finished. Unknown assassins murdered Bull in Brussels, Belgium in 1990 and it is believed that either the Israeli or Iranian intelligence services had him killed over his relationship with the Iraqi government. British customs seized sections of the Big Babylon’s massive barrel and Iraq’s abortive invasion of Kuwait and subsequent defeat at the hands of a U.S.-led coalition in 1991 brought the project to an end for good. Sections of the unfinished Big Babylon are now on display at the Royal Armories Museum at Fort Nelson in Portsmouth, United Kingdom., Geni via Wikimedia Some have also pointed out that the Army’s present view of the SLRC also looks a lot like the G.I. Joe Thunderclap long-range cannon. This fictional weapon, with a pair of detachable tracked prime movers, one at the front and one at the back, is itself clearly inspired in part by the M65. Unlike Thunderclap, the SLRC, at least in concept, is very real. The Army first announced that it was considering this weapon system in 2017, as part of the release of an over-arching vision for vastly improving artillery capabilities across the service. You can read more about that broader plan in this past War Zone piece . There is a certain logic to the SLRC, in theory, at least, as well. This is hardly the first time someone has considered building a “strategic” range artillery piece. During World War I, the Germans built massive rail-transportable guns and employed them in France, including against the French capital, where they gained the nickname “ Paris Guns .” The Nazis crafted another long-range artillery system, the V-3 , the least well known of Hitler’s so-called “ vengeance weapons ” during World War II. Unlike the Paris Guns, the V-3 employed multiple propelling charges that detonated in sequence as the projectile passed down the barrel, creating an effect much like that of a rocket motor rather than a traditional gun, where all of the propellant is detonated at once. In general, ground-based artillery systems can also be very flexible, especially compared to combat aircraft. They are more responsible and can more readily shift attention from one target to another, provided it is within range, have a greater magazine depth, and can operate in poor weather that could hamper the effectiveness of aircraft and helicopters in some circumstances. As the Army notes, this could make the SLRC valuable for busting through A2/AD defenses, which can be very threatening to both aircraft and missiles. It could also help “dis-integrate” them by destroying critical nodes, such as surface-to-air missile launchers, radars and other ground-based sensors , and command and control centers, opening up paths for follow-on air and missile strikes or otherwise creating safe routes into hostile territory for friendly forces on land or at sea. The desired range of 1,000 miles or more would make the weapons even more useful in distributed operations, including across the wide expanses of the Pacific, where such a gun could potentially be fixed in place on one island and be able to engage threats on others across a broad area. Being readily transportable by sea or air, as the poster at the Army Research Laboratory indicated was a requirement, would allow the service to readily position guns in strategic locations during an actual conflict. A briefing slide showing an overview of planned US Army artillery systems, as well as certain threat systems, as of 2017. At that time, the Strategic Long Range Cannon was referred to as Strategic Strike Cannon Artillery., US Army It still remains to be seen whether the SLRC will ever come to fruition. The Atomic Annies had a maximum range of just 20 miles and the HARP gun’s longest shot was 110 miles. The Paris Gun could hit targets up to 41 miles, while the V-3’s maximum range was just over 100 miles. Bull’s unfinished Big Babylon’s estimated range was “over” 450 miles. It’s certainly possible, if not highly probable, that advanced ammunition designs, including those with supplemental rocket motors or ramjet propulsion , could help the SLRC reach the 1,000-mile mark. The SLRC poster that Major General George saw at the Army Research Laboratory did show a notional shell, but without any detail as to what features it might have. The concept art also displayed a light green section at the bottom of the projectile that could point to some sort of supplemental propulsion system. It would also undoubtably have a precision guidance system. There are also questions about how the Army would go about actually getting the targeting information the gun crews would need to hit non-known fixed targets out to 1,000 miles or more. However, the service is already looking at a variety of stand-off methods, including air and space-based concepts . US Army The biggest question may simply be whether the Army will continue to see the SLRC as a useful expenditure of time and resources as time goes on, especially now that the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , between the United States and Russia is gone. The INF had prohibited both countries from developing and fielding ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. A long-range supergun would have offered a land-based capability to engage targets at extended ranges, but that was also treaty compliant, something that is a moot point now. The U.S. military is now exploring both ground-launched cruise missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles , as well as ground-launched hypersonic weapons and railguns that can also strike targets over relatively long distances. What we do know is that the Army is still very much considering the SLRC as part of its future artillery plans, but we’ll have to wait and see whether or not this supergun turns out to be any more tangible than the G.I.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 6, 2020",Internal Air Force Emails Show Confusion And Concern Over Colorado’s Mystery Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In December 2019 and January 2020, the plains of rural northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska were the epicenter of a series of sightings of what were widely described as unidentified drones. Despite the media attention these sightings received and the speculation that they were related to the security forces responsible for protecting intercontinental ballistic missile silos scattered throughout the region, military bases in the area denied that the drones were theirs. While the mystery of the drones’ operator or operators remains unsolved, a series of internal emails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act reveal just how serious the drone reports were taken by the 90th Security Forces Group and the public affairs office at F.E. Warren Air Force Base. The emails are heavily redacted, but they at least shed some light on the confusion even the base experienced at the hands of this seemingly unsolved mystery. In late December 2019, The War Zone was among the first outlets to report on the somewhat bizarre story of fleets of unidentified drones operating in the airspace above northeastern Colorado and western Nebraska. There was a sense of near-panic as law enforcement agencies were inundated with scores of reports of these drones, prompting the creation of a task force that included the FAA, federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI, and sheriffs from multiple Colorado counties. Eventually, the State of Colorado sent one of its well-equipped surveillance planes to hunt for the drones. Since then, however, reports of suspicious drone activity have dropped significantly , according to the Colorado Department of Public Safety and Nebraska State Patrol. Despite the large effort and the mobilization of Colorado’s infrared camera-equipped aircraft, nothing conclusive was identified and, to date, no one has come forward to claim responsibility for the drone activities. That doesn’t mean that the case is closed, however. Douglas D. Johnson , a volunteer researcher operating in affiliation with the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU), recently obtained emails through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which catalog the internal communications of the public affairs office at F.E. Warren and the 90th Security Forces Group regarding the spate of drone sightings. The 90th Security Forces Group provides security both for F.E. Warren and the 150 Minuteman III Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) operated by the 90th Missile Wing . The heavily redacted emails can be read in their entirety here .

Warren Air Force Base., Wikimedia Commons Johnson filed two separate FOIA requests for all official correspondence to and from Jon Carkhuff, a public affairs officer and/or spokesman associated with F.E. Warren Air Force Base, and all official correspondence to and from the headquarters staff of the 90th Security Forces Group that contain any of the following terms: drone, drones, counter-drone, counter-drones, unmanned aerial system, unmanned aerial systems, UAS, counter-UAS, unidentified aircraft, unidentified aerial, unidentified flying, unknown aircraft, UFO, and anomalous. The FOIA requests were for communications ranging from December 15, 2019, through January 18, 2020. The requests were filed on January 18, 2020, and were fulfilled on February 14. Many parts of the communications Johnson received are redacted, including the names of the participants in the email chains in which the mystery drones and the base’s response to media inquiries about them are discussed. In an exchange about how to respond to an early media inquiry, an unknown sender writes “We need to ensure he doesn’t feel like we are hiding anything.” On the next page in the same release, after a statement “we do not know the origin of the drones,” one writer inserts the hashtag “#aliens.” As the FOIA documents show, public affairs staff at F.E. Warren would eventually release an official press statement on January 17 after receiving input from Major General Ferdinand ‘Fred’ B. Stoss III, commander of 20th Air Force, the part of Air Force Global Strike Command responsible for overseeing the entire ICBM force. The final version of the statement that was released states definitively that F.E. Warren was not responsible for the drones: We can confirm that the drones spotted in Colorado and Nebraska are not from F.E. Warren Air Force Base and are not affiliated in any way with the United States Air Force. We have provided this information to the FAA, FBI, and state and local authorities, as they investigate this matter. The drones have not posed a threat to any of our sites, facilities or operations. F.E. Warren AFB does conduct counter-UAS training within the confines of the installation, however, any drones spotted outside of the installation are not part of our fleet. Aside from discussions and drafts pertaining to the production of that official statement, the FOIA releases contain entire emails that are redacted and seem to have once contained nothing but images of drones taken by eyewitnesses. The only images not redacted are a series taken by a Nebraska State Trooper. Much of the content in the FOIA releases is redacted. , Douglas D. Johnson Still, despite being heavily censored, the emails reveal that many at F.E. Warren were just as confused by the mystery drones as the public was. Questions And Confusion Surrounding Drone Sightings In one email contained in the F.E. Warren public affairs office FOIA release, the palpable confusion of staff can be detected in the fact that there seems to be no agreement on who might be responsible for the drone sightings. “[Redacted] — understand you’re part of the FBI TF [task force] looking at this? Pls send me an update,” the email reads. “This is becoming a bigger deal. What’s our PA [public affairs] play here right now WRT [with regards to] this (ongoing drone) effort?” In another email sent on January 2, 2020, an unknown sender notes the bewilderment the region experienced at the height of the drone panic: Hey colonel: Northeastern Colorado is in a tizzy about drone sightings. They all seem clustered in an area that has quite a few Minuteman sites. Do you know if security forces is playing with UASs [unmanned aircraft systems] up there? An email within the 90th Security Forces Group FOIA release dated January 8, 2020 states that the drones are “100000000000% not us.” “I’ve seen some articles pointing the finger as us [sic],” the sender writes, “but I can definitely say this is not our team.” Even the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) got involved with the drone mystery. AFOSI is military law enforcement and investigative agency that reports directly to the Secretary of the Air Force whose stated mission is to “identify, exploit and neutralize criminal, terrorist, and intelligence threats in multiple domains to the Air Force, Department of Defense and U.S. Government.” Its stated capabilities are to detect threats, conduct investigations, and “protect secrets.” A 90th Security Forces Group email dated January 6, 2020, adds that the sender will “defer to [Redacted] on this one since AFOSI is the lead agency on the FEW [F.E. Warren AFB] side for this issue.” In a separate email within the FOIA release from the public affairs office at F.E. Warren, it is written that the AFOSI would send a representative to the closed-door task force meeting held on Jan. 6 in Brush, Colorado. US Air Force Security Forces airmen protect part of a missile field during a training exercise., USAF Several of the emails in the 90th Security Forces Group FOIA release mention AF/A10, the office of the U.S. Air Force Air Staff that oversees Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration. “AF/A10 reached down asked for confirmation that we (AFSGC) [Air Force Global Strike Command] are not flying the drones in question,” one email reads. In one of the stranger exchanges found in the 90th Security Forces Group release, a participant in the email chain writes that some eyewitness reports state that the drones were dropping what appeared to be “potatoes” and that the Perkins County Sheriff’s Office collected some of them for analysis: Sheriff’s deputies are responding and seeing the drones as well. They reported seeing a “mothership” 6’ in diameter flanked by 10 smaller drones (some fixed wing, some not). When deputies follow the drones, they clock them at speeds of 60-70 mph. The drones also appear to be dropping or picking up things that look like “potatoes” [Redacted] The FBI in Colorado and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Omaha are currently looking into the sightings. Perkins County Sherriff’s [sic] Office has three of the potatoes frozen in storage and will likely transfer them to the FBI for analysis. The FAA is sending an agent to Colorado this upcoming weekend to help investigate and handle the news coverage. In an email dated January 2, someone else in the email chain added that “The “potatoes” have an agricultural purpose and are used by farmers with their large center pivot irrigation systems.” The Denver Post identified the “potatoes” as SOILPAM Tracklogs , a tool used to help fill the ruts left by wheels on large irrigation systems. An email about the strange “potatoes” reported by the Perkins County Sheriff’s Office., Douglas D. Johnson The War Zone reached out to both the Perkins County Sheriff’s Office and the FBI office in Denver for comment on these “potatoes.” The Perkins County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment, while the FBI issued the following statement: The FBI’s media policy prohibits confirming or denying an investigation unless in rare circumstances when publicity would help the investigation, such as in seeking a missing child or trying to identify a bank robber. The matter you’re inquiring about does not meet that exception, so it would not be appropriate to provide any details. Counter-UAS Operations At F.E. Warren And Minuteman Sites Throughout the email chains of both the 90th Security Forces Group and the F.E. Warren AFB public affairs office, there is significant discussion regarding counter-UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) operations . An email showing the confusion over possible counter unmanned aerial system operations., Douglas D. Johnson In an email dated Jan. 2, 2020, it is noted that the 90th Security Forces Group does indeed have a section dedicated to UAS operations and that “we have some for testing and training throughout the command.” The sender notes that “We can reach out to them to see if there are any concerns.” In a heavily redacted email dated Thursday, Jan. 9, 2020, with the subject line “Autonomous Base Defense System”, the sender discusses a capabilities demonstration (“capes demo”) at an unknown facility: Good morning sir, [Redacted] Since this capes demo they have continued to develop and field their systems. To that end, they just successfully completed a very high visibility demonstration at [Redacted] that is continuing to drive interest and deployment of the system [Redacted] as well as a one-month long combat validation deployment to [Redacted] that was so successful they are now deploying four additional systems in country on a permanent basis. The [Redacted] proposed Jan 15th to come to FEW [F.E. Warren] and provide a brief and answer any questions. I will work with your front office to get it on your calendar. On January 10, another message states that engineers from an unknown organization would be on base on Jan. 17 to lead a briefing on an unspecified autonomous base defense system: The lead engineer for [Redacted] will be briefing [Redacted] on Jan 17th @ 1030 in the Wing Conference Room on their autonomous base defense system and associated systems. The C-UAS section hit me up and said they were attending which is awesome however, this is less about actual blue force sUAS development and more about the system used to detect, track, classify, and identify the threat. [Redacted] Three days later, on January 13, another email “hot on the heels of the info [Redacted] distro’d…” includes a link to an October 2019 Defender Magazine article describing how Buckley Air Force Base outside of Denver, Colorado became the first Air Force Base in the continental United States to declare an operational anti-drone capability . The email then continues “He mentioned [Redacted] was one of the locations that was implementing the Det 24 C-sUAS capes. Interesting timing.” In the F.E. Warren public affairs FOIA release, an email dated January 2 mentions specifically a “Dedrone contract.” Dedrone is a manufacturer of counter-drone technology platforms featuring an open systems architecture, which “seamlessly integrates with a variety of sensing and threat mitigation technologies, enabling users to customize their platform and meet their specific needs and threat level.” Dedrone designs and manufactures radiofrequency sensors, radar systems, PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) cameras, and the DroneDefender , a rifle-like directed energy weapon designed to disable small drones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EQEKi8Uih6U In a Dedrone press release dated August 28, 2019, the company wrote that F.E. Warren was among six Department of Defense facilities chosen to test the Dedrone platform in June of 2018 as part of a Defense Innovation Unit, and “has been continuously testing, evaluating and using the capability for over a year.” According to solicitation documents , the contract was worth $27.5 million. However, the Single Source Justification documents for the contract notes that F.E. Warren uses an undisclosed number of other counter-sUAS systems and that “listing the other C-sUAS systems at F. E. Warren and their capabilities, or lack thereof, is classified SECRET//NOFORN.” The document adds that “no other system possesses similar capability” as the Dedrone system. Single Source Justification documentation for the Dedrone/F.E. Warren AFB contract., FBO.GOV In the F.E. Warren public affairs release, an email cited above dated Jan. 2, 2020 with a timestamp of 1:42 PM and the subject line “[Non-DoD Source] Quick question”, the author asks “Do you know if security forces is playing with UASs up there?” Another email sent at 3:54 PM that day with the subject line “Re: [Non-DoD Source] Quick question” states simply “I believe this is the Dedrone contract.” Since the senders and recipients for both emails are redacted, it’s impossible to ascertain conclusively if these two emails were a direct back-and-forth exchange, although the subject lines and timestamps seem to suggest they were likely related. We also have no idea what level of knowledge the recipient had about the system or its operations at the time. This exchange very well could have been merely an off-hand comment that had yet to be confirmed at the time. An earlier version of the base’s aforementioned official statement on the drone mystery which didn’t make the final cut contained the following text: The Air Force does have the ability to counter unmanned aerial systems to include non-kinetic options ranging in size from handheld technology to larger stationary and mobile systems that can be operated on the ground or in the air. Kinetic options to defeat UASs have also been fielded and deployed to Air Force Global Strike installations. F.E. Warren AFB does conduct UAS and counter-UAS operations, however, the drones spotted in Nebraska and Colorado are not part of our fleet. For operational security reasons, additional details about UAS operations or measures to counter hostile use of commercial off-the-shelf UASs are not releasable. Another part of the Email chain explains why certain parts were cut from the final press release: “[Redacted] wanted to scrub the third and fifth paragraphs. The third paragraph isn’t really relevant because no one is questioning our ability to counter UAS or what SOPs [standard operating procedures] we have in place to protect our assets from UAS. The main question is who those drones belong to. As far as the fifth paragraph, unless the reporters are asking about the measures in place to counter hostile use of UASs, we don’t see the value in adding that. That was his suggestion. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further. I can also run this by our JAG [Judge Advocate General] real quick and have it ready by COB [close of business].” In the last of the emails contained within the 90th Security Forces Group FOIA release, dated Jan. 16, the author mentions that some sightings could be due to what sound like Starlink satellites: Sir, BLUF [Bottom Line Up Front]: We have a high degree of confidence that the on-base visual phenomenon was not sUAS [small Unmanned Aircraft Systems] activity; it is likely this was a result of the [Redacted]. BACKGROUND: [Redacted]. It uses passive, library based RF detection capability in order to locate sUAS activity. It has a very high degree of accuracy and we have tested it extensively since June 2018. We receive regular hits of sUAS activity (daily) but nothing that is on the installation or over our specific area of interest. DISCUSSION: [Redacted] did detect some activity in the area but nothing near the installation (at least 3km away). These detections were not out of the ordinary. After reviewing the photography and doing some quick research, the pictures are consistent with [Redacted] satellites. The last launch was 6 Jan 2020 which contained 60 satellites. These satellites are visible by the naked eye as they trust [sic] to their parking orbit altitude of 550km which usually takes a few weeks; they look like a string of lights in the night sky. Based on hobbist satellite tracking website, a string of [Redacted] satellites were in the area last night. RECOMMENDATION: [Redacted] Starlink did, in fact, launch a Falcon 9 rocket containing 60 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 6, 2020. However, it’s difficult to believe that so many people, including law enforcement officers, could mistake strings of Starlink or other small satellites in orbit for low-altitude drones moving dynamically across the area. Still No Consensus On The Mystery Drones Despite the fact that these emails are heavily redacted and don’t conclusively solve the mystery surrounding the wave of drone sightings in Colorado and Nebraska, these FOIA releases show just how seriously these sightings were taken by officials and security forces at F.E. Warren Air Force Base. They also show that shortly after the drone sightings began, a C-sUAS briefing was given at F.E. Warren. It is unknown if that briefing was related in any way to the mystery drone developments. It’s important to note, too, that these emails are only a snapshot of what was happening behind the scenes at F.E. Warren. There may be and likely are many missing pieces beyond what is in these redacted emails. In-person meetings, briefings, and phone communications were all likely part of the base’s response to the drone mystery. The claims that the drone sightings were merely a mass delusion clearly seem to not be the case given the response by officials at F.E. Warren AFB and the reports they cite. The sightings were taken seriously enough that military institutions and federal agencies such as NORAD, USNORTHCOM, MAJCOM, AFOSI, the FBI, DHS, the USAF Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration Directorate, and the FAA were involved in investigating the sightings. “As you can imagine this activity has gained the attention of our Commander here at NORAD and USNORTHCOM,” one 90th Security Forces Group email from January 7 reads. “We are fully engaged as well with our FBI and DHS representatives here.” Elements of the 90th Security Forces Group during a training exercise., USAF Furthermore, had the sightings been merely a case of mistaken identity and perhaps public paranoia, then why would F.E. Warren so heavily redact images of suspected drones in this FOIA release? Of course, any time a spate of strange or unidentified object sightings in the skies occurs, it’s inevitable that curious would-be eyewitnesses misidentify objects due to confirmation bias. It’s likely that many of the alleged drone sightings were misidentified due to exactly this. Still, these FOIA releases and the level of redaction seem to suggest that at least some of sightings may have legitimately been due to some type of aircraft operating in the area that the Air Force isn’t comfortable disclosing any details about. From mysterious ‘potatoes’ of interest to sheriffs making detailed reports of drone swarms to redacted images of aircraft, we are left with more questions than ever. But at least it seems the Air Force was just as puzzled as we were with these bizarre events… Even if just for a little while. Thanks to Douglas D. Johnson and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) for providing The War Zone with these documents. Johnson is currently pursuing an appeal for certain redactions in the communications that were submitted as part of these FOIA releases, including the censored images.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2019",Crazy Video Out Of Syria Shows An Armored Personnel Carrier Brawling With A T-72 Tank,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video emerged this past weekend that shows Turkish-backed Syrian forces in a tracked armored personnel carrier jousting with and then ramming a T-72 tank belonging to forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. This incident occurred in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province and came just a day after an equally unusual road-rage incident between U.S. and Russian forces on the other side of the country. The video clip of the two armored vehicles, shot from a drone flying above, first emerged on social media on Feb. 22, 2020, but the actual altercation reportedly took place two days earlier. Observers of the Syrian conflict subsequently determined that the two vehicles had squared off in a field to the west of the town of Nerab in Idlib province. The vehicle that anti-regime forces are driving in this particular incident appears to be a Turkish-made ACV-15 , a derivative of the U.S. Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle (AIFV), a 1970s design based on the venerable M113 armored personnel carrier . That general area around Nerab had been the scene of heavy fighting at the time between Turkish-backed forces and the Syrian after the former launched a major offensive operation with Turkish support. This included both direct support from Turkish artillery units and the delivery of significant quantities of vehicles, including both ACV-15s and M113s, as well as weapons and other equipment from Turkey. The video of the brawl near Nerab starts by showing the T-72 tank on a stretch of road, apparently entirely by itself, engaging unseen targets. Right from the start, it’s important to note that a lone tank has limited situational awareness, especially if its crew is buttoned-up inside with the hatches closed, and can vulnerable to a number of threats. This is not the first time Assad’s forces have been seen utilizing armored vehicles in this manner and it can only reflect poor training and limited resources after years of conflict. Open-source investigations have shown that the Syrian Arab Army has lost hundreds of armored vehicles in combat since 2011. The focus of the video then shifts to the approaching armored personnel carrier. The Turkish-backed forces pass by the T-72 before there is any obvious reaction from the tank’s crew, suggesting that they might not have even been aware it was coming until it sped right by them. This further underscores how vulnerable a single tank in the open can be. After the armored personnel goes by, the tank starts up and the two vehicles find themselves circling each other in something of a curious dance. The tank then moves to get back on the road and retreat, with the anti-regime forces chasing after it. The armored personnel carrier then rams into the back of the tank and the two vehicles continue pressed up against each other for a short time. The Turkish-backed forces then disengage and go speeding off the road into the field and the video ends. It’s not clear who was controlling the drone that filmed all of this, but the footage bears the logo of Ebaa News Agency , a media outlet linked to the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham , or HTS. As such, it is very likely that HTS was videoing this altercation. It’s unclear what the crew of the armored personnel carrier hoped to achieve by charging at the tank in the first place. ACV-15s come in a variety of configurations , but the ones Turkish-backed Syrian groups have received appear to have open turrets with mounted .50 caliber M2 machine guns, which would not pose a significant threat to the T-72. They might have been looking to damage the tank in some way that would disable it. However, the ramming action, together with the drone videoing above, might also point to this being a failed vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attack. A number of terrorist groups have taken to filming suicide VBIED attacks using small drones for propaganda purposes. HTS, which splintered off from Al Qaeda’s franchise in Syria in 2017, has released similar videos in the past through Ebaa. HTS is also known to use armored vehicles as the basis for its VBIEDs. These designs offer the driver greater protection than even up-armored civilian vehicles, increasing the likelihood that they will successfully reach their target. This would not be the first time an HTS VBIED has failed, either. Whatever the crew of the armored personnel carrier was attempting to do, it does also highlight Turkey’s increasing involvement in the fighting in Idlib. Its recent decision to more aggressive and directly support various Syrian groups against Assad, as well as his Russian benefactors, in Idlib has threatened to expand the conflict in dangerous new directions. The Turkish government has publicly confirmed that a number of its soldiers have already died in artillery and airstrikes, some of which might have been Russian . However, authorities in Ankara have declined to blame Moscow directly for any of these deaths. The fighting in Idlib has already provoked a new humanitarian crisis . No matter how the conflict evolves continues to evolve in the coming days and weeks, the video of the armored vehicle duel near Nerab is another example of the often bizarre scenes that continue to emerge from the war in Syria, which remains complex and convoluted after nearly a decade of fighting.

Joe Copalman,"Posted on Feb 16, 2021",This Workhorse Huey Rescue Helicopter Flew President Reagan As Marine One In Its Previous Life,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For as long as I’ve been taking photos of aircraft , I’ve never really been a serial number tracking guy. Sure, after photographing aircraft from the same squadrons repeatedly over a number of years, you recognize things like a new pilot’s name painted on the canopy rail or bomb-shaped mission marks stenciled on the nose after an aircraft returns from a deployment, but I’ve never kept logs of the aircraft I’ve photographed or documented these changes. That’s just never been my thing. Last week, while searching for images of HMX-1’s fleet of ‘White Top’ Presidential transport helicopters for a book I’m writing about Marine Corps aviation in the 21st Century (due out through Harpia Publishing in late 2020 ), I came across a series of images depicting the squadron’s Bell VH-1Ns supporting President Ronald Reagan’s trip to Venice, Italy for the 1987 G8 Summit. Though HMX-1 retired the VH-1Ns in the early 1990s – putting them outside the period I am covering in my book – I’ve long been a fan of the ‘November’ model Hueys. Yes, they are ancient and underpowered, but to me, they are the best-looking UH-1 variant out there. Everything just looks ‘right.’ As I was browsing through the images, something familiar caught my eye: ‘158554’ I know that number. Back in June 2018, I visited MCAS Yuma on assignment for Air Forces Monthly magazine, as I had been assigned to write an article about Yuma’s Search and Rescue (SAR) detachment. At the time, Yuma SAR was – and remains – the last remaining operator of the ‘November’ model Hueys in the US Marine Corps, with four HH-1Ns providing search and rescue services across a 100-mile radius from Yuma. This area covers most of the Barry M. Goldwater and Chocolate Mountain bombing ranges used by military aircraft from all across the United States, as well as by allies like the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore, and others. Additionally, the Marines and sailors (all of Yuma SAR’s Search and Rescue Medical Technicians, or SMTs, are Navy Corpsmen) of Yuma SAR provide civilian search and rescue support for local, county, state, and federal law enforcement throughout that 100-mile radius from home plate. After a morning spent interviewing pilots, crew chiefs, and SMTs about Yuma SAR and its mission, I accompanied two crew chiefs into the rugged foothills north of Yuma, going as far as we could in a four-wheel-drive pickup truck before dismounting and – in the words of one of the crew chiefs – ‘Chevrolegging’ another half mile to a rocky canyon with a vertical face about five or six stories tall. Over the next hour, I shot hundreds of images of the Huey crew ‘rescuing’ two dummies known as ‘Rescue Randys,’ one dangling from the cliff being retrieved via a ‘short-haul’ hoist out of the canyon, and the other hoisted out of a shallow ravine and aboard the Huey after the SMT evaluated the dummy’s simulated injuries and rigging it for hoisting. In the days that followed, I transcribed over two hours of interviews and started going through the images from that day, trying to pick out the dozen or so I would be submitting to my editor at AFM to accompany my article.

I stared at that number for hours, through image after image, sorting the ‘yups’ from the ‘nopes’ from the ‘maybes’ for publishing. As I said, I’m not a serial number guy, but when I came across that image of an HMX-1 VH-1N landing on a grass field in Italy back in 1987, I immediately knew which aircraft that was. Marine Experimental Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) operated six VH-1Ns throughout the 1980s, both on the ‘green side’ doing test and evaluation work and on the ‘white side,’ complementing the squadron’s fleet of ‘white top’ VH-3D Presidential transport helicopters. Built by Bell specifically as VIP-configured VH-1Ns, HMX-1’s Hueys featured the aerodynamic ‘shell’ from the upper fuselage of Bell’s 214ST just forward of the rotor shroud to cover and air conditioning unit and a satellite communications antenna. Passengers accessed the cabin through a four-door configuration unique to the VH-1N in place of the large, rearward-sliding door on standard UH-1s. Seating received a massive upgrade as well, with the Huey’s bench-style seating being replaced by plush bucket seats. The cabin was completed covered in carpet, both for comfort and a degree of sound dampening from the whine of the twin Pratt & Whitney T400-CP-400 engines and the unmistakable “WHUMP-WHUMP” of the Huey’s two-bladed main rotor. A state-of-the-art for the time Sperry autopilot system rounded out the modifications that made these particular Hueys VH-1Ns.

The celebration was held aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) in 1985. , National Archives Just as the Presidential VC-25As operate under the callsign ‘Air Force One’ while transporting the President, individual ‘white top’ US Marine Corps helicopters are known as ‘Marine One’ whenever POTUS is aboard. The Hueys typically operated as Marine One aircraft either on short-notice trips inside the continental United States, for example, if the President needed to tour an area ravaged by a tornado or other natural disaster, or during overseas trips, as the Hueys were much easier to move via cargo aircraft like the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy without having to deeply reconfigure the aircraft for transport. The Marine Corps’ acquisition of the vastly more capable Sikorsky VH-60N ‘White Hawk’ in 1988 signaled the end of the VH-1N’s service as a Presidential transport. The final overseas mission for the Presidential Hueys occurred in July 1989, when President George H.W. Bush visited the Netherlands, relying on VH-1N 158554 for local transport. Following the end of the Hueys’ VIP mission, Bell Helicopter modified all six aircraft to HH-1N standard, stripping them of all the bells and whistles, restoring the bench seating and rearward-sliding cabin doors, and adding a rescue winch for hoist work. All six aircraft were subsequently assigned to bases on the west coast, providing SAR coverage for aircraft flying out of Naval Air Warfare Center China Lake, Naval Air Stations Fallon and Lemoore, and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Of the six, two were written off in crashes. Another was damaged in a hard landing but appears to have returned to flight to finish its career with HMLAT-303 ‘Atlas,’ a training squadron, at MCAS Camp Pendleton. Another retired from rescue duties with NAS Fallon’s ‘Longhorn’ SAR unit before being acquired by the Battleship Memorial Park museum in Mobile, Alabama, faithfully restored as a VH-1N in HMX-1 markings. The last two former VH-1Ns – 158554 and 158557 – remain on the active roster, assigned to Headquarters & Headquarters Squadron MCAS Yuma’s SAR unit. The missions the Marines and sailors of Yuma SAR perform range from responding to military aircraft mishaps and special operations free-fall parachute injuries, to finding lost hikers in the ‘dual-use’ areas of the ranges surrounding Yuma, to providing first aid to law enforcement officers and federal agents along the US-Mexico border, to rescuing injured boaters along the Colorado River, to providing air support for Yuma’s Military Working Dog training program. Some of the more bizarre call-outs include serving as an aerial ‘pathfinder’ for Boy Scouts lost in the maze-like marshes along the Colorado River, leading them back to the river itself. Another involved searching for two men who called authorities saying they were kidnapped and driven out to the middle of the desert, only to find them completely blitzed out of their minds on drugs in the middle of the desert not far from the car they had wrecked, miles from anything remotely resembling a road. The juxtaposition of all these missions with the Presidential pedigree of two of Yuma SAR’s four HH-1Ns intrigues and amuses me. Did President Reagan ever board one of his VH-1Ns thinking “Someday a drunk boater with a broken leg or a pair of drugged-out jacknobs are going to be taken to the hospital in this thing?” Of course he didn’t. Conversely, did any of the wounded or lost people rescued by Yuma SAR’s corpsmen ever know the flight that saved their lives was aboard one of President Reagan’s former helicopters? Probably not. But I love thinking about the storied lives of these aircraft and how, despite never seeing combat, they have a hell of a lot of interesting stories to tell. Yuma SAR and their HH-1Ns have officially been ordered to shut-down next month. The Yuma Airshow will be their final flight with the HH-1N.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The Navy Wants A Rapidly Deployable Version Of Its Cold War Era Submarine Monitoring Network,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is in process of developing a new, more rapidly deployable, fixed, persistent, deep water active anti-submarine surveillance system. This system would consist of large sonar arrays attached to buoys that ships could emplace in a particular spot in the ocean straight from inside a standard shipping container. This is just one part of a multi-tier effort that comes as senior naval officers continue to warn publicly about increasing worrisome submarine activity from potential adversaries, especially with regards to Russian subs operating more regularly off the coast of the Eastern United States. On Feb. 19, 2020, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) issued a notice on beta.SAM.gov, the U.S. government’s central contracting website, asking for white papers detailing possible options to meet the demands for what it is calling the Affordable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare Surveillance System, or AMASS. ONR’s goal is to eventually develop a “persistent, deep water, active ASW [anti-submarine warfare] system that can detect new emerging threat submarines at extended ranges.” The AMASS effort is still in the very early stages and ONR has offered only a limited number of desired capabilities so far. The notice on beta.SAM.gov says that the Navy wants the buoy to deploy the active sonar array automatically and be able to keep the entire system fixed in place in a particular area for a protracted period of time. The array also has to be sufficiently rugged to resist “deformation so as not to compromise sonar performance” as it sits in the underwater currents. As its name implies, “total cost of system should be affordable,” ONR notes. ONR’s requirements, such as they are known now, for the AMASS program., ONR Most interestingly, ONR is asking for proposals that involve buoys and attached sonar arrays that can fit inside a standard shipping container and that crews onboard could deploy straight from there into the water. This would certainly help reduce costs by enabling a wide array of ships to carry the AMASS sonar arrays and emplace them wherever necessary. This might include cargo ships or other auxiliaries assigned to the Navy’s Military Sealift Command or contractor-operated vessels . The Navy says that AMASS is intended as a supplement, not a replacement for “established Fixed Surveillance Systems (FSS) and Mobile Surveillance Systems (MSS).” The FSS refers to fixed deepwater passive sensor networks, the best known of which is the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). SOSUS, the first versions of which entered service in 1959, had already seen its military function diminished by the end of the Cold War and had become used increasingly for scientific research, a role that it continues to perform to this day. The Navy is tight-lipped about the exact scope and scale the latest iteration of its fixed anti-submarine surveillance system, but the service has expanded and improved its capabilities over the years to keep up with advances in submarine design and other technology. In addition, there have been upgrades to reduce the need for vulnerable physical undersea cables to send and receive information from the sensor nodes. The MSS component refers to ship-towed passive and active sonar arrays, also known as the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS). “SURTASS provides … long range detection [of submarines] and cueing for tactical weapons platforms or other vessels of interest,” according to the Navy . The system’s Low Frequency Active (LFA) sonar capability, which the Navy added in the late 1980s, “provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to assist in countering the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond,” according to the service . “The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.” A basic diagram showing the SURTASS system’s components., USN The Navy originally fielded SURTASS on its Stalwart class ocean surveillance ships, but then switched to catamaran-style vessels with the introduction of the LFA upgrade. After the end of the Cold War, the service substantially scaled back its plans for the SURTASS system. At present, the only ships equipped to employ the latest iteration of the SURTASS towed array, also known as the TB-29A Twin-Line Array, are the USNS Impeccable and the four ships in the Victorious class. Japan also operates three Hibiki class ocean surveillance ships, which are also catamaran types, equipped with SURTASS. The SURTASS-equipped Victorious class ocean surveillance ship USNS Able ., USN The FSS and MSS together, along with associated communications networks and other infrastructure, form the Navy’s Integrated Underwater Surveillance System (IUSS). AMASS is also only one part of a larger plan for a new family of Deployable Surveillance Systems (DSS). AMASS would fill the role of the DSS-Deep Water Active (DSS-DWA) component. Active sonar systems, such as the kinds ONR is seeking for AMASS program, detect threats by sending out pulsed soundwaves and then listening for the echoes as they bounce off objects in the distance. Passive sonars, as well as other passive sensor systems, such as hydrophones , simply allow operators to listen for telltale sounds belonging to submarines below the water or ships sailing above. Some sonar systems have both active and passive modes. The video below from retired Navy submariner Aaron ‘Jive Turkey’ Amick offers a more detailed description of the differences between active and passive sonar: https://youtube.com/watch?v=_S9wRl9zpw0 The issue with active sonars is that, by emitting the sound pulses, they alert opponents to their presence, giving them the opportunity to attempt to evade or avoid detection. It also makes them easy to detect and therefore vulnerable to hostile action. It’s not clear how a persistent active sonar system might work in practice, but it could only activate when passive sensors detect an object of interest. The Navy’s plans for the complete DSS family does also include a DSS Deep Water Passive (DSS-DWP) component, as well as a system that is “mobile” and can operate in both active and passive modes. It’s not entirely clear if the mobile component, also known DSS-MPAS, would be an array that ship would tow, as is the case now with SURTASS, or if it would be some sort of unmanned system capable of redeploying by itself. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had worked on distributed anti-submarine hunting system in the past, known as the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH), which would employ unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), dubbed Submarine Hold at RisK (SHARK), to persistently track hostile submarines after other sensors first detected them. DASH also included the development of the Transformational Reliable Acoustic Path System (TRAPS), which are fixed passive sonar nodes that sit on the seafloor. DARPA had also envisioned locating and tracking enemy submarines as a key role for the Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessel, which is now a Navy program. The Navy has also taken responsibility for TRAPS, has fielded it, and is now looking to integrate it into its plans for the DSS. It’s also interesting to note that the service says in its most recent budget proposal for the 2021 FIscal Year that it is employing unmanned glider-type UUVs to service TRAPS sensor “fields.” This might help further explain why the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy briefly seized one of these underwater drones in the South China Sea in December 2016. “Conduct risk reduction non-recurring engineering efforts associated with future DSS increment spirals including the feasibility of connecting TRAPs units via fiber optic cable to enable fewer gliders to service a TRAPs field,” the budget request says. “Reducing the number of gliders required will increase the security of TRAPs field and will reduce cost.” The Navy is asking for nearly $27 million for this and other work on the DSS program in the 2021 Fiscal Year. The service hopes to get the first limited-run production examples of the DSS-DWP system this year under a rapid fielding initiative. A decision on how to proceed with the DSS-DWA and DSS-MPAS components is scheduled to occur in the 2022 Fiscal Year. USN USN USN The primary goal of the entire DSS effort is “to provide flexible and responsive wide area surveillance to Theatre Anti-Submarine Warfare (TASW) Commanders worldwide” that is “designed to address operational gaps,” according to ONR. This makes sense given how vocal senior Navy officers have been about increasing submarine threats, especially from Russia and China. Both countries are working to expand their submarine fleets and are developing more advanced nuclear-powered and diesel-electric designs that are quieter and therefore harder to detect. You can read more about these growing concerns in-depth in these past War Zone stories . When it comes to monitoring this increasing submarine activity, the obvious immediate issue for the existing IUSS is that the fixed component is just that, fixed. At the same time, with only five SURTASS ships available, the mobile component can only monitor so many locations at once. The limited size of the SURTASS fleet, combined with restrictions on the use of the LFA sonar array, due to concerns about its impact on marine life, also makes the movement of those ships more predictable. This, in turn, makes those ships vulnerable to harassment, or potentially worse during an actual conflict. China’s quasi-military maritime militia, also known as the “ Little Blue Men ,” which routinely squares off with foreign ships in areas of the South China Sea that Beijing sees as its exclusive territory, notably made dangerous maneuvers around USNS Impeccable while she sailed in international waters near Hainan Island in 2009. China’s largest submarine base is located on the island’s southern tip. Approved SURTASS LFA operating aras in the North Western Pacific Ocean as of 2014., USN Approved SURTASS LFA operating areas in the Central North Pacific Ocean as of 2014., USN In 2017, the Navy began work on a program known as the Expeditionary Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System, or SURTASS-E, which “provides a SURTASS passive capability packaged into ISO-Vans [standardized shipping containers] for mobilization on Vessels of Opportunity (VOOs),” according to official budget documents , which also cover various other work on sustaining and modernizing the IUSS, as a whole. As such, SURTASS-E offers greater flexibility in that it could be installed readily on various ships, but also does not feature the active sonar capability found on ships equipped with the standard SURTASS system. In 2018, the Navy chartered an unknown vessel as part of the SURTASS-E Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation, and Demonstration (RPED) effort. That ship took this modular towed sonar system on its first-ever operational patrol in the Atlantic last year. The service is now asking for $6.2 million in its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year to “support system improvements to the base SURTASS-E RPED prototype capability based on operational feedback and COTF OT&E [operational test and evaluation] (via a Quick Reaction Assessment) findings, and to upgrade SURTASS-E RPED design to support military crew (MILCREW) manning.” USN USN USN USN USN In addition, SURTASS-E, while more flexible than SURTASS, still requires available ships, something the Navy is struggling to provide for basic operational requirements at present, and it still cannot remain in a particular place indefinitely. The complete DSS system, including AMASS, would offer a valuable added layer of capability that the service could deploy and then leave in place on-demand. DSS would also have the benefit of being less predictable, but far more capable and persistent than something like an array of air-deployed sonobuoys. All told, it’s clear that the Navy sees its existing fixed sensor arrays, as well as its available ship-towed wide-area sonar surveillance assets, as too limited in both capability and capacity to meet the demands of an increasingly challenging underwater military ecosystem that is emerging around the world. While the service doesn’t immediately plan to replace any of those maritime surveillance systems, its plans for the new Deployable Surveillance System show that it is working to take its anti-submarine monitoring capabilities in an exciting new and more flexible direction.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2020",MV-22 Osprey Rear Ramps And Carrier Aircraft Elevators Make For Great Fast Rope Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Marines on board the Navy’s newest amphibious assault ship, the first-in-class USS America , recently conducted fast rope training that made good of what space they have available at sea. Personnel from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) parked one of their MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor transports with its tail end overhanging the edge of one of America ‘s lowered aircraft elevators so Marines could drop down below. This particular Osprey also represents the latest Marine Corps configuration, which includes an expanded communications suite and upgraded defensive systems. America , with the elements of the 31st MEU embarked, is presently sailing in the South China Sea . Even at sea, the Marines need to keep their skills sharp in case of any potential contingencies, which includes training to fast-rope out of the back of their Ospreys. The concept of using a lowered aircraft elevator on an amphibious assault ship to create a well for this kind of fast-rope training is hardly new. It’s a routine practice that was already in use more than a decade ago when the Marines were still flying CH-46 Sea Knights , all of which have now been replaced by Ospreys. USN USN Doing this makes good sense, too, for honing basic skills, since the Osprey doesn’t even need to be airborne, which saves on fuel and maintenance costs . Of course, actually fast-roping from an MV-22B hovering in mid-air is a bit more of an intense experience, so it doesn’t completely remove the need for more advanced training. The pictures from this particular round of fast-rope training also offer a good look at an Osprey with a number of significant modifications that the Marines have been steadily adding to its MV-22 fleet in recent years. This MV-22B, which has the Bureau Number 168628 and is assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 (VMM-265), features a new satellite communications and data sharing system and a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system. The SATCOM system is known as NOTM-Airborne Increment II , which the Marine Corps began testing on the Osprey in November 2017. The service started fielding the system on its MV-22s in 2018. Tilt-rotors with NOTM-A Increment II installed are readily identifiable by the large dome on the top of the rear fuselage, which replaces a rear overhead hatch. The system provides robust beyond-line-of-sight connectivity to the ever more capable Ospreys. “It can take hours to fly to a location to complete a mission, and during that time, the situation on the ground can change significantly,” said Chris Wagner, then the NOTM program’s lead engineer at Marine Corps Systems Command, said in an official interview in June 2018. “If the situation on the ground changes, we can get updates to the Common Operating Picture, from reconnaissance assets to the commander enabling mission changes while en route,” U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Devin Licklider, then Marine Corps Systems Command’s Program Manager for Command and Control Systems, said in a separate interview at the time. The NOTM-A Increment II dome on MV-22B, Bureau Number 168628, is visible on top of the fuselage just behind the more traditional look circular black satellite communications antenna., USN This particular Osprey is also equipped with a variant of the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures system, or DoN LAIRCM. Different configurations of this system, which Northrop Grumman produces, are in service across the U.S. military on a variety of aircraft and helicopters . The installation on the MV-22B consists of various warning sensors positioned around the fuselage and two so-called pointer-tracker assemblies mounted on the lower side of the rear fuselage, one on each side of the tilt-rotor’s rear loading ramp. The point-trackers on Osprey from VMM-265 that Marines used for fast-rope training had red protective covers in place to shield them from the elements . The general configuration originated on the Air Force’s CV-22 special operations Ospreys and has finally made its way to the USMC’s MV-22 fleet. The system is designed to defeat heat-seeking missiles, including shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS , which are particularly threatening to helicopters and tilt-rotors when they are landing, taking off, or hovering close to the ground. The warning sensors detect the incoming infrared-homing threats and cues one of the pointer-trackers to engage it with a laser beam. The laser blinds and confuses the missile’s seeker head, causing it to wander off course. All told, the 31st MEU recent fast-rope training on board USS America combined a well-established technique for honing these skills while at sea with one of the Marine Corps’ most up-to-date Ospreys. It also looks like a heck of a lot of fun! Thanks to UK Defence Journal ‘s Twitter account for bringing the pictures from this recent fast-rope training to our attention.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2020",Bell’s Electrically-Powered Tail Rotor Tech Breaks Cover And It Could Be A Game-Changer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bell has been quietly flight testing a modified Model 429 helicopter with a new all-electric tail rotor configuration in Canada for months. This Electrically Distributed Anti-Torque system, or EDAT, offers improved efficiency and reliability, as well as a reduced acoustic signature and lower maintenance costs compared to traditional tail rotors. The Fort Worth, Texas-headquartered helicopter maker brought its EDAT work to the public’s attention when it posted a video montage of the experimental Model 429 on its social media channels on Feb. 20, 2020. However, the video’s caption says that this particular helicopter made its first flight on May 23, 2019. The flight testing has been taking place at Bell’s facility in Mirabel, Quebec. “In a nutshell, we removed all of the conventional mechanical anti-torque components – which is gearboxes, driveshafts, and tail rotor hub and blades – and replaced it with four electric motors and fans,” Eric Sinusas, Bell’s Light Aircraft Program director, said in an interview with Vertical magazine . “This is the first time anyone in the world ever done this, so the first step was just to make sure that it actually works – and yes it does work.” A standard Bell Model 429 has an exposed four-bladed tail rotor. All helicopters with a single main rotor require some sort of tail rotor or some other anti-torque system to counteract the force from the large main rotor on top spinning in just one direction. The EDAT-equipped helicopter replaces the Model 429’s standard tail rotor with four individual four-bladed electrically-powered fans. Each one has its own separate electric motor, provided by French company Safran. They are all built into the tail assembly, similar to helicopters with Fenestron tail rotors . In this configuration, they function as ducted fans. This modified helicopter’s two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207 turboshaft engines are linked to generators to provide the requisite power for the EDAT system. In a regular Model 429, the engines are linked mechanically, via driveshaft in the tail boom, to the tail rotor. Without that mechanical drive, EDAT relies entirely on a computerized fly-by-wire system to connect the controls in the cockpit to the tail rotors. What this means is that the helicopter can be more efficient than others with traditional tail rotors. Traditional tail rotors use variable pitch blades to alternate the amount of force they put out and in what direction it is flowing. EDAT’s four rotors have fixed-pitch blades that can spin either forward or backward. Bell says that this means its electrically-powered and controlled system can more precisely and dynamically change how much anti-torque force it’s putting out. “They are fixed-pitch blades and they’re changing rpm [rotations per minute] constantly,” Bell’s Sinusas told Vertical . “A single large fan or two medium fans are going to experience rotational inertia, so it is going to be less responsive,” he explained to Aviation Week . Having four fans instead of one single rotor also offers valuable redundancy, which in turn makes the helicopter safer to fly. Bell says that the EDAT system can provide sufficient anti-torque force even if three of the four electric fans fail. The modified Bell 429 helicopter with the EDAT system., Bell Bell says that the variable speed of the fans and their ability to operate at low RPMs whenever possible also reduces the helicopter’s acoustic signature, though they haven’t yet given specific figures. The information the company has collected so far “shows that it is significantly quieter than a conventional 429,” Sinusas said to Aviation Week . Lastly, eliminating the conventional mechanically-powered tail rotor would also help lower maintenance costs, by getting rid of the associated potential points of failure in the drivetrain and the tail rotor gearbox. This means maintenance crews wouldn’t have to perform regular inspections of those components or spend time replacing them. Operators wouldn’t have to keep those spare parts on hand anymore, either. Helicopter companies around the world have been working on electric tail rotors and other anti-torque systems for some time now, but Bell’s is the first to achieve flight, according to Aviation Week . It’s not clear how long the company has been working on this particular project, but it submitted at least one patent application regarding relevant technologies in 2017, approval of which is still pending. The accompanying documents include line drawings that show a variety of notional multi-motor configurations, including variations with ducted fans, as well as exposed rotors. A modified Bell Model 407 , rather than a 429, is depicted as the representative helicopter. USPTO USPTO USPTO USPTO The effort is primarily self-funded. However, Bell did receive grants from authorities in Ottawa in 2018, according to Aviation Week . The advantages the EDAT system offers could be valuable for civilian, commercial, and military helicopter operators alike. Everyone likes greater efficiency, added safety, and lower operating costs. The noise helicopters produce often provokes complaints from people living below high traffic routes and means that individuals can hear them coming from relatively far away. A reduced acoustic signature could mean fewer noise complaints for commercial and military operators, as well as help military helicopters better avoid detection during combat operations. Finding ways to reduce tail and main rotor noise has been a major issue in the development of stealthy helicopters . Bell says that customers’ requests for ways to reduce noise, in general, including for occupants, was a major driver in developing EDAT. The storied helicopter manufacturer states that the EDAT system, as it stands now, is still very much experimental and that it is already working to improve it. The company also views it as a pathway toward future helicopters and other rotorcraft with hybrid or all-electric propulsion. For example, it could help inform work on the Bell FCX-001 experimental helicopter concept, which the company first unveiled in 2017, also includes “electric distribution and motors to drive the anti-torque system.” However, the FCX-001 has a very different configuration for the EDAT-equipped Model 429, with the thrust-vectoring anti-torque system contained entirely within the tail boom that similar, broadly, to Huges Helicopters’ No Tail Rotor (NOTAR) configuration. “We have already had several optimizations and changes, just based on feedback from pilots, and it is much quicker to do than with a mechanical system,” Sinusas told Aviation Week . “We do see it as a stepping stone to the fully electric aircraft… We feel like it should make the certification paths for these technologies easier.” Whether EDAT actually sees widespread use or if it serves simply as a developmental milestone, it is hard to imagine how this concept doesn’t have the potential to change rotary-wing aviation as we know it.

Chris Harmer,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",I Almost Died Flying Into A Mountain Near Kobe’s Crash: Veteran Navy Pilot Explains The Risks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the most disorienting and dangerous things that can happen to a pilot during flight is inadvertently entering Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). While this is a known hazard and can be easily avoided by thorough preflight preparation and in-flight weather observation, it still occurs fairly regularly. Three weeks ago, it likely happened to the helicopter carrying retired NBA star Kobe Bryant and eight other people. That flight ended in tragedy with the death of all aboard. Twenty years ago, the same thing almost happened to me in the same area. My crew and I escaped that near catastrophe with our lives by the narrowest of margins. The reality is that it can happen to anyone, from the private pilot on a weekend recreational flight to the passenger-carrying helicopter pilot on a routine hop with a beloved sports star and his friends and family onboard to the most capable and well-trained military pilot. Here’s what we know about the Kobe flight and why it reminded me of my own brush with death. Doomed Flight There is a tremendous amount of confusing and even misleading information in the public domain about this tragedy and how helicopters are operated, in general. So, before I get to my own story of experiencing a very similar situation while flying HH-60H Seahawk helicopters in the Navy, let’s break it all down in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the circumstances surrounding the incident. What started out as a routine helicopter flight two weeks ago from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, to Camarillo Airport in Camarillo, California, ended in tragedy when the Sikorsky S-76 helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas, California. Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven other people died in the crash. While the final report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will not be completed for some time, there is enough evidence in the public domain and within the NTSB Aircraft Accident Investigative Update released on February 7th to make some informed observations about the incident. The helicopter involved in the crash. , NTSB In this case, the helicopter was single piloted on a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight plan. During the flight, the pilot observed weather conditions degrading and asked for and received permission to continue the flight under Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR), which we will discuss in detail in a moment. While the helicopter type, the Sikorsky S-76, is certified for flight in Instrument Meteorological Conditions, the operator of this specific airframe, Island Express Helicopters, had an operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that limited its operations to Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) only. In other words, while this individual S-76 helicopter may or may not have been capable of IMC flight, it was not authorized for it. Shortly before crashing, the helicopter appears to have inadvertently entered IMC and began maneuvering aggressively, possibly in an attempt to escape those conditions. Meteorological Conditions, Pilot Ratings, Aircraft Certifications, And Flight Plans In order to understand the sequence of events that led to the tragic death of nine people, we need to understand some basic terminology and regulations that describe meteorological conditions, pilot ratings, aircraft certifications, and flight plans. In terms of weather, there are two basic classifications of meteorological conditions that apply to flight operations. These are Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The parameters that determine these classifications are set by the FAA with respect to visibility, cloud ceiling, and separation from clouds, both vertically and horizontally, during flight. These VMC minimums vary according to the type of airspace that is being flown in. VMC and IMC are mutually exclusive conditions. At any given time, every major airport in the United States with a control tower operates under either VMC or IMC conditions based on actual local weather observations. In terms of operating aircraft, pilots are licensed, certified, and rated by the FAA in a number of different categories, like a private or commercial pilot or certified flight instructor. All pilots qualify under VFR conditions and may obtain an advanced instrument rating that authorizes them to fly in IMC. With respect to what type of weather that specific aircraft can fly in, each individual aircraft operating in the United States must obtain an airworthiness certificate before operating. Every aircraft, at a minimum, is authorized to fly in VFR conditions. In order to legally operate under IMC conditions, aircraft must have additional equipment, including heading indicator, attitude indicator, altimeter adjustable for barometric pressure, two-way radio, transponder, and specific navigation equipment. In general, the required navigation equipment varies based on the date of manufacture of the airframe. NTSB In terms of flight plans, any flight that goes into the FAA’s airway system must file an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan prior to takeoff, regardless of the weather conditions. Flights that do not use the FAA airway system should file a VFR flight plan. Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) is a unique category of flight clearance . It is used when an aircraft operating under VFR rules encounters weather that meets the criteria for IMC conditions, but where continued safe operation is possible under VFR rules. With the basic definitions and terminology of weather, pilot ratings, aircraft certifications, and flight plans in place, let’s consider what happened in this specific instance. Sequence Of Events Leading To The Crash We have a pretty good amount of detail on the sequence of events leading to the crash, especially with the help of the FAA’s preliminary report on the incident. Regarding the helicopter and pilot, we know that the mishap helicopter was single piloted and on a VFR flight plan. Ara Zobayan, the pilot of the helicopter, had commercial pilot, rotorcraft (helicopter), and instrument helicopter ratings . This means he was qualified to fly a commercial helicopter, with paying passengers, under IMC conditions on an IFR flight plan, as long as that individual helicopter and operator company was certified for flight in IMC. In this case, even though he personally was qualified to file and fly IFR flight plans, the company he worked for, Island Express Helicopters, was only authorized to file and fly VFR flight plans. This is not unusual. It is very common for helicopters to only operate in VMC conditions, on a VFR flight plan. A VFR flight plan simply requires that the aircraft remain clear of controlled airspace, unless in two-way radio communication with air traffic control (ATC) for a temporary transit through controlled airspace, and to remain clear of fog, clouds, rain, or any other weather condition that would obscure visual reference to navigational checkpoints on the ground. The vast majority of helicopter flights in the United States take place under VMC conditions, under VFR rules. The most direct route of flight from John Wayne Airport to Camarillo Airport is to head northwest over Los Angeles, then continue over the Santa Monica Mountains. This course would take the aircraft directly through Los Angeles International Airport’s (LAX) Class B airspace. Accordingly, the flight path would have to deviate to the east around that Class B airspace or follow an established VFR transition route through that airspace. This route of flight going near LAX and then over the Santa Monica Mountains to Camarillo had been used by Island Express Helicopters on a number of previous flights and the pilot Ara Zobayan had flown this VFR route the previous day. Regarding the weather at the time of launch, both fog and a low cloud layer were present which precluded the direct route of flight over the Santa Monica Mountains. The Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopter flight operations that morning due to fog and low clouds. One of the consistent local weather phenomena in Southern California is the presence of a marine layer of fog that can develop over the ocean and quickly moves inland. With poor weather reported and observed near the coast, the pilot reasonably decided to divert his route further inland, to the east. Rather than flying northwest over Los Angeles into fog and clouds, he flew to the east of downtown Los Angeles towards Glendale. NTSB After flying east of downtown Los Angeles, according to data posted on Flightradar24, the helicopter completed six holding turns over Glendale. Holding turns are used when a flight needs to delay its progress before continuing on course, and may vary in duration, altitude, and geometry depending on the location and reason for holding. The most common cause of holding turns is in response to direction from air traffic control to facilitate proper spacing and sequencing of flights. In addition to responding to direction from air traffic control to enter holding, aircraft may also initiate a request to enter holding. One of the most common causes of holding requests from aircraft to air traffic control is to avoid dangerous weather conditions. Based on transcripts posted on LiveATC.net and the NTSB update, the helicopter entered holding over Glendale in response to direction from air traffic control to facilitate traffic flow into and out of Hollywood Burbank Airport, located just northwest of Glendale. There is no indication in these transcripts that the weather had anything to do with the initial direction from air traffic control to hold and no indication that the pilot requested to hold. The final flight path of the helicopter including the holding turns over Glendale. , Flightradar24.com After completing holding turns in order to facilitate traffic flow, the pilot then requested permission from air traffic control to proceed through Burbank Airport airspace under the aforementioned SVFR rules. Because Burbank Airport is designated as Class C airspace, the weather minimums to operate under normal VFR flight rules are three statute miles visibility with aircraft operating at least 500 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and with 2,000 feet of horizontal separation from clouds. Based on air traffic control communication and the pilot’s request to fly through Burbank airspace under SVFR rules, we can conclude that the weather was below VFR minimums at that point. There is nothing inherently unsafe about flying in SVFR conditions, as long as the pilot is trained to fly in such conditions. Of course, flying in SVFR conditions does present a greater risk than flying in VFR conditions, which is why FAA regulations prohibit air traffic control from suggesting this option to pilots. If a pilot wants to fly in marginal weather below VFR, the pilot must initiate the request to air traffic control to fly in special VFR conditions. NTSB According to an audio clip of the radio communications between Zobayan and air traffic control posted online and from the NTSB’s recent update, as the pilot transited through Burbank Airport airspace he relayed his route of flight intentions to air traffic control. Based on that conversation, his intended route of flight was to follow Interstate 5 to the northwest of Burbank Airport, then California State Route 118 to the west, closer to his intended destination at Camarillo Airport. This route of flight allowed for an expeditious transit through Burbank Airport airspace and also kept the helicopter clear of Van Nuys Airport, which is located just west of Burbank Airport. Following major freeways and roads is a very common navigation technique used by helicopter pilots operating under VFR flight plans. After following Interstate 5 and State Route 118 around Burbank and Van Nuys airspace, the flight continued in a westerly direction towards Thousand Oaks. At that point, it was positioned for a relatively direct path further to the west to Camarillo. Unfortunately, that path had rising terrain both to the north and south and was experiencing degraded weather conditions. Shortly after that final radio communication, the helicopter turned sharply left, heading south, and then entered a steep rate of descent as it continued the left turn to nearly due east, and crashed into a hillside. At the time of impact, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transponder and radar data referenced by the NTSB update showed that the helicopter was in a left turn, descending at over 4,000 feet per minute and 161 knots immediately before impact. NTSB Regarding the weather at the time of the crash, the Weather Channel reported that clouds and fog were present. Shortly after the crash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department posted a picture showing a layer of fog or low clouds directly above the crash site. One eyewitness reported hearing the helicopter shortly before the crash, but could not see it due to the low cloud layer. Another eyewitness was hiking near the scene of the crash and reported seeing the helicopter emerge from the clouds in a descending and turning flight path immediately before crashing. Analyzing The Data For Causation In the early history of aviation, the vast majority of mishaps were caused by a mechanical malfunction. As aircraft design, manufacturing, and maintenance processes have improved in modern times, mechanical malfunctions have decreased as a causal factor for mishaps. According to the FAA, the vast majority of modern air mishaps are caused by human error . While we cannot conclusively state at this point that this crash was caused exclusively by pilot error, it is very plausible, if not probable, based on the information we have, that the pilot made a mistake by inadvertently flying into IMC conditions. Regarding the data showing the helicopter moving at 161 knots and descending at over 4,000 feet per minute at the moment of impact, these are well outside the normal operating parameters of the S-76 helicopter. There is simply no reason for a helicopter in IMC conditions, with passengers on board, to intentionally enter a rate of descent over 4,000 feet per minute and exceed the maximum cruising speed of the aircraft (155kts), especially when operating at low altitudes. As a comparison, the H-60 Seahawk helicopter, a high-performance military helicopter that I piloted for 20 years in the Navy, had a normal descent rate of about 500 feet per minute while on instrument approaches. In some circumstances, depending on airspeed, terrain, and other traffic in the area, the helicopter might have a decent rate of up to 1,000 feet per minute during certain maneuvers. Anything above that is outside the normal operating envelope, even if the aircraft is mechanically capable of higher rates of descent. The only time I experienced a 4,000 foot per minute rate of descent was during fully developed, power off autorotations or maximum performance powered descents, which only happen under very specific conditions requiring both high speed and high rate of descent. While it is extremely unlikely that this helicopter encountered a mechanical malfunction that required a fully developed, power off autorotation or a maximum performance powered descent, there are some technically plausible scenarios that could have caused this. The NTSB has ruled out catastrophic engine failure as a causal factor. In this context, this means NTSB has concluded the engines did not disintegrate in flight. With that said, it is possible that the helicopter suffered a dual engine failure without it being a catastrophic failure. Such scenarios are extremely uncommon, but they do happen. U.S. Airways Flight 1549, a fixed-wing Airbus A320 airliner, experienced a bird strike in flight which caused both engines to shut off, resulting in a forced landing into the water in 2009. You can see the NTSB animation and air traffic control recordings related to that mishap here . NTSB If this S-76 helicopter encountered a dual bird strike into the engine intakes, it is possible it suffered a dual engine flameout, the only response to which would be an autorotation. Such an engine failure would not necessarily result in immediately identifiable damage. Another possibility is contaminated fuel leading to a dual engine flameout, necessitating a fully developed autorotation. As far as powered maximum rate of descent goes, if a fire occurred in the cockpit or cabin, that would necessitate an immediate powered maximum rate of descent to find the first survivable landing zone. Because the post-crash fire consumed much of the helicopter wreckage, and because the helicopter was not equipped with a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) or Flight Data Recorder (FDR) “black boxes,” which might have contained evidence of an onboard fire, it will be more challenging for the NTSB to conclusively rule this possibility out. An onboard fire was the exact scenario that led to Swissair Flight 111, a fixed-wing McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airliner, crashing just off the coast of Nova Scotia, killing all 229 passengers and crew on board, in 1998. You can read the Transportation Safety Board of Canada report on that accident here . Flying in IMC presents no mechanical challenge to the helicopter. It doesn’t matter to the aircraft if it is flying in clear air or clouds. It is simply an issue of whether or not the aircraft is equipped with the proper instruments for flight in IMC conditions and whether or not the pilot is capable of flying on instruments with no external visual reference. Currency in training for these conditions is a factor as well. As far as loss of control of the aircraft by the pilot, that is a plausible causal factor. Operating in poor weather at relatively low altitude and with rising terrain on either side of the aircraft, it simply isn’t reasonable that the pilot intentionally entered an extremely high rate of descent at high speed during a course reversal (a rapid about-face in direction of flight). Based on all of these data points and my extensive experience flying helicopters in marginal weather conditions, all factors seem to indicate the pilot inadvertently entered IMC, then executed a sharp turn in an attempt to return to VMC conditions, shortly before crashing. This is not to say conclusively that the flight crashed because of the pilot error of inadvertently entering IMC. It is possible that the pilot entered inadvertent IMC, then suffered a mechanical malfunction that caused the crash. We won’t know the full cause of the crash until the NTSB finishes its final report, which may take up to 18 months. Accident Investigation And National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Shortly after the crash, the NTSB activated its “Go Team” and sent 18 accident investigators to the crash site. According to the NTSB , the purpose of the Go Team is to respond to the site of a major accident as quickly as possible. This team, working in coordination with local law enforcement, secures the crash site and starts the laborious process of collecting all the physical evidence at the scene. This is especially important if a mechanical malfunction was the cause of the crash. Modern investigative techniques and technologies are able to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether or not the main components of the airframe were functioning correctly at the time of the crash, but only if the crash site is secured from contamination and disruption. Following the recovery of the components, typically the airframe is rebuilt in a hangar so investigators can see the entire structure, or at least what is left of it. Without any help from the cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder (FDR) “black boxes,” the NTSB investigation will have to rely on data collected external to the aircraft, including air traffic control voice and radar recordings. While the crash occurred on an uninhabited hillside, numerous eyewitnesses observed the helicopter immediately prior to it entering IMC conditions, or heard it while it was in IMC conditions, and their statements will also be part of the investigation. Flight Data Recorders and Cockpit Voice Recorders that are hardened to survive crashes have become increasingly miniaturized and tailored to the airframes that host them. New models combine both functions in one box., YSSYguy/wikicommons Even without the black boxes, the wreckage of the helicopter may confirm or rule out the rather remote possibility of the aircraft suffering a mechanical failure prior to the crash. NTSB vs. FAA One issue that becomes readily apparent in the aftermath of this crash is the tension between the NTSB and the FAA. The former agency investigates and makes recommendations; the latter is responsible for actually implementing regulations. Based on earlier crashes involving S-76s, the NTSB had made several recommendations to enhance safety of flight, as well as assist in data collection as part of mishap investigations. Specifically, in an Aircraft Accident Report (AAR) resulting from an S-76 crash in 2004, the NTSB previously recommended that the FAA mandate installation of the Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) on all “existing and new U.S.-registered turbine-powered rotorcraft certificated for six or more passenger seats.” The FAA did not concur with this recommendation and it was never implemented. Additionally, the NTSB recommended as part of that same report that the FAA “require all rotorcraft operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 91 and 135 with a transport-category certification to be equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and a flight data recorder (FDR).” As with the recommendation for TAWS, the FAA did not concur with the recommendation to mandate installation of CVR or FDR. The S-76 that crashed with Kobe Bryant and other passengers on board was not equipped with TAWS, CVR, or FDR. Had the S-76 been equipped with TAWS, it may have helped the pilot maintain situational awareness with respect to the rising terrain on both sides of his aircraft. Had the S-76 been equipped with a CVR and FDR, the NTSB investigation would certainly be informed with more accurate data to determine the exact cause of this crash. An example of a TAWS system for helicopters: While the external data collected from air traffic control radar and radio logs helps, it does not record the multiple, minute details only available from data collection internal to the aircraft, such as pitch and roll attitude, power setting, control inputs, and much more. A CVR would add another layer of critical and far more nuanced evidence. All this would be accessible very quickly if the recorders were successfully retrieved from the wreck. While I take no position on whether the NTSB or FAA is correct on the issue of mandatory installation of TAWS, CVR, and FDR, I am confident that this high profile fatal accident will reignite the debate on what equipment should be mandatory onboard helicopters carrying paying passengers. NTSB works to examine and remove wreckage from the Santa Monica Mountains. , Photo by David McNew/Getty Images For now, we will just have to wait for the official NTSB report to find out exactly what caused the crash. Suffice to say it seems very likely that NTSB will apportion some fault to the pilot for entering IMC conditions. While that is a grievous error that likely played some role in the crash, it is also an error that many other experienced pilots have made. I know I did and it almost killed me, my copilot, and my two aircrewmen. Going Inadvertent IMC Is Easier Than You Think During a 20 year career as a Naval Aviator, I accumulated over 3,000 hours in H-60 Seahawk helicopters. On more occasions than I would like to remember, I inadvertently flew into IMC conditions. It happens more often than you might think, particularly in the Navy. For a variety of cultural reasons, Naval Aviators adhere to the motto of “if it is not expressly prohibited, it is allowed.” This can be a great standard for achieving operational excellence and mission accomplishment, but it is an inherently risky approach to flight planning and execution. In any case, the closest I came to crashing was due to inadvertent IMC, and oddly enough, it happened about 20 miles west of where Kobe Bryant’s helicopter crash occurred. It Was A Routine Flight To Practice Instrument Approaches While stationed at Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI) in San Diego as an Instructor Pilot (IP), I would occasionally fly students up the coast to Naval Air Station Point Mugu, which is right on the coast and about five miles due south of Camarillo Airport. The vast majority of our instructional flights took place between NASNI and Naval Outlying Field Imperial Beach, about 10 miles to the south, but for some syllabus flights, we would get the students out of the local area. On this particular flight, we were going to practice multiple precision and non-precision instrument approaches, so I decided to go up the coast to Point Mugu, which is far less congested airspace than San Diego. By definition, in order to fly instrument approaches, you have to be on an IFR flight plan, so we filed the flight plan, took off, and headed up to Point Mugu. Because airspace in Southern California is so congested, and because helicopters fly much slower than the fixed-wing commercial traffic that dominates the air traffic controllers’ workload, we typically would either request or accept non-standard flight routing to make it easier on air traffic control and ourselves. Our maximum speed in the helicopter was close to the minimum speed for most commercial airframes, so to avoid conflict with that traffic, we would occasionally file and fly point to point routing that was not part of the standard airway system. In this case, we filed to fly direct from NASNI to Naval Auxiliary Landing Field on San Clemente Island, direct from there to Naval Outlying Field San Nicolas Island and from there to Naval Air Station Point Mugu. It was a legal IFR flight plan, all over water with no conflicting traffic. Southern California air traffic control was happy to give us offshore routing to keep out of that beehive airspace. A Seahawk off Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego. , USN We flew up to Point Mugu and I planned on staying there for about an hour, doing about five precision and five non-precision instrument approaches. I figured with the good weather we could request short legs on our instrument traffic pattern. For the first seven or eight approaches, everything went like clockwork. It was a late Friday afternoon, there was no airborne traffic at Point Mugu, we were the only aircraft in the pattern, so we were getting short leg approaches and easy passes. When Complacency Sets In, Danger Is Close Behind I thought we were in for a quick wrap up to the flight, an easy transit back down the coast to San Diego, and a fun start to the weekend. As my thoughts wandered, I failed to notice that the marine layer of fog was building up from underneath the helicopter at the same time a cloud layer was descending from above. Point Mugu tower and approach control should have told us that the weather was degrading, but it’s possible they were not paying attention. We sure weren’t. There were no other aircraft in the pattern and our outbound legs were heading at 210 degrees, which took us almost directly into the setting sun before turning back on final to take the approach to runway 030. On our last approach, as we were flying the downwind leg directly into the sun, we couldn’t see squat. I assumed, incorrectly, that it was just the haze of flying into the sunset. In fact, we were entering IMC conditions and were completely unprepared for it. As we turned towards the final heading, now flying away from the sun and into darkness, I started to pick up that conditions were changing rapidly. NAS Point Mugu facing south with the nearby Santa Monica mountains clearly visible. , Google Earth For all the previous approaches, we could see the runway through the entirety of the approach. This time, we couldn’t see anything except the fog beneath us. In the five minutes since our last approach, fog had completely obscured our sightline to the airfield. At the same time, I saw a solid wall of clouds ahead of us. Since we were on an instrument approach and on an IFR flight plan, there was no problem flying into the cloud, but I had not done the IMC checklist. We had flown up to Point Mugu on an IFR flight plan, but since the weather was so clear, we had not actually configured the aircraft for flight in IMC conditions. From Unaware Of IMC To Unprepared For IMC When transiting from VMC to IMC conditions, there are a number of aircraft settings that need to be reconfigured. For example, the anti-collision lights need to be off. Having anti-collision lights illuminating inside a cloud and reflecting back into the cockpit can be disorienting and even vertigo-inducing. The pitot heat should be on anytime the aircraft is flying through visible moisture, whether rain, clouds, or fog. The pitot-static system provides inputs for many of the instruments required to fly safely in IMC conditions and if it accumulates water, it can malfunction. It seems like a small thing, but ice crystals in the pitot tubes leading to inaccurate airspeed indications was one of the causal factors of the Air France Flight 447 mishap, which involved a fixed-wing Airbus A330 airliner, in 2009. Seahawk cockpit and crew. , USN Once I saw we were about to go IMC, I took the controls from my student and directed him to configure the cockpit for IMC operations. As we entered the cloud, I realized our instrument panel lights were completely off. This is normal during daytime VFR conditions. You don’t need your instruments backlit if you can see them with ambient light, but given that I had just flown into a cloud, I needed my instrument backlighting turned on as soon as possible. My student copilot fumbled in the dark, couldn’t quite find the correct switch and instead inexplicably turned on his flashlight and shined it in my face, temporarily blinding me. I resisted the urge to beat him senseless and continued to fly the aircraft. That was the point where I first realized we were in serious trouble, flying in total IMC, with no instrument panel lights on, and this regrettable, avoidable, and potentially fatal situation was entirely my fault. Fortunately, we got the instrument panel lights on and equipment correctly configured and at that point I called air traffic control to cancel the approach and get vectors to establish back on my IFR flight plan to return to San Diego. I figured we could do our last required instrument approach or two back at NASNI. Controllers Are Human And Make Mistakes Too We canceled the approach and air traffic control acknowledged, but like us, the controller had not been paying attention and was unprepared to give us vectors to get out of the approach pattern and back onto our IFR flight plan. The controller instructed us to maintain runway heading and 500 feet altitude while he coordinated our return to San Diego. A word about altitude management: air traffic control clearances are always given in altitude with reference to Mean Sea Level (MSL). 500 feet MSL does not necessarily mean 500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). I knew this, but was about to get a very rude reminder of it. Another note about air traffic control. It was obvious with us being the only aircraft in the pattern on a lazy Friday evening that the controllers simply were not paying attention to us until the point where we canceled the approach and requested vectors offshore to get back on our flight to San Diego. At this point, we had flown several miles past the runway threshold, but we were still holding at 500 feet MSL, our last assigned altitude. I called air traffic control and asked for the status of our request for vectors back to San Diego. The controller told me to turn right to 180 degrees on the compass, otherwise known as south. All our previous turns for the practice approaches had been to the left, away from the Santa Monica Mountains, to a downwind heading of 210 degrees, exactly opposite of our final approach course of 030 degrees to runway 030. For some reason, this controller at this point lost situational awareness and turned us toward the mountains, which I could not see, because we were completely in the clouds. I knew the mountains were there, but, and there is no way to say this without sounding like an idiot, in the transition from VMC to IMC I simply forgot about them. As I rolled out heading 180 degrees I reacquired situational awareness of the existence of the mountains, but did not know where they were relative to my aircraft and thought we must be clear of them, because there is no way air traffic control would give me vectors at low altitude into rising terrain. The Grim Reaper Enters The Equation At this point, I knew something was wrong, but wanted to figure out what it was before I called air traffic control. As that thought went through my head, I saw my radar altimeter rapidly spinning down. Overwater, the radar altimeter and barometric altimeter should read more or less the same. In this case, my barometric altimeter showed stable at 500 feet MSL, but because I was flying into rising terrain, my radar altimeter showed a constantly decreasing altitude above ground level. In an instant, I realized what had happened. I knew I was flying straight towards a mountain and my radar altimeter was displaying the constantly decreasing separation between me and the rising terrain I was flying over. We were within five seconds at most of crashing, probably closer to three seconds, and the overwhelming emotion I experienced was not fear, but rage. How could I have been so stupid? Two options flashed through my mind. I could maintain heading and simply apply maximum power and try to execute a low speed, maximum performance climb to get over the mountains. This would have been the easiest option in terms of control inputs and aerodynamics. It would only have required a slight nose back adjustment to trade forward airspeed for vertical altitude, and application of maximum power. The other option was to roll into a maximum angle of bank turn, also at maximum power to turn away from the rising terrain. I took the turn option and rolled into a 45-degree angle of bank turn to the right, and applied maximum power. Rather than use the extra power to try to climb, I thought I had a better chance of avoiding the crash if I used the power to increase my rate of turn and tighten my radius of turn. As I did this, I heard a different controller from air traffic control radio me in a panicked voice to turn right immediately to avoid rising terrain. I did not acknowledge the transmission as I was already executing the turn and wanted my total concentration on completing a high angle of bank turn at maximum power in total IMC conditions. That’s a situation tailor-made to depart controlled flight and I knew my priorities were to aviate, navigate, then communicate. So I simply didn’t respond to air traffic control. Example of an air traffic control tower at a Naval Air Station, in this case, NAS North Island. , USN At the same time, as I rolled into the turn, I watched the radar altimeter continue to wind down and started its aural warning beep as we got within 100 feet of the ground beneath us. WIth 99 percent power set at a 45-degree angle of bank, the aircraft was at or near its maximum turn rate, but still, the radar altimeter continued to display the decreasing distance between the aircraft and the ground. It didn’t last more than three or four seconds, but it felt like forever as I saw the readout go from 100 feet above ground level to 80 feet and then 60 feet before showing a rapid increase in altitude, indicating we were now flying away from the rising terrain. I continued the turn past 270 degrees to 360 degrees for just a little extra peace of mind. I cross-checked my magnetic and electronic compasses to make sure I really was heading directly away from the mountains. They matched, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Alive And Headed Home Of course, I had traded one problem for another. Air traffic control had given me bad vectors, I initially accepted them, then of my own accord changed my route of flight to avoid the mountains. Now I was flying on a path directly between NAS Point Mugu and Camarillo Airport without vectors or altitude direction from air traffic control all while in total IMC. I keyed my microphone to call in just as yet another air traffic control chimed in and asked “Where are you going? What is your request?” I replied in a voice shaking with post adrenaline dump nervousness, “I just need vectors offshore to pick up my IFR flight plan back to San Diego.” Two minutes later we were overwater, heading directly for San Nicolas Island, then San Clemente Island, then San Diego. Enroute, I debriefed the crew on what had happened. I don’t think any of them realized how close we had come to crashing. I told them air traffic control had given us bad vectors and that I accepted those vectors because I had lost situational awareness of where the mountains were. The fog manifests seemingly out of nowhere and suddenly around the Santa Monica Mountains and especially near NAS Point Mugu., Ted Eckmann/UCSB.edu By the book, I should have filled out a safety report when I got back to San Diego. While I blamed myself, air traffic control also made some mistakes and I should have documented both sides of the problem. I didn’t make a conscious decision to not submit a safety report, I just didn’t do it. I think I was so stunned by the whole episode. By the time we got back to San Diego, to a nearly deserted hangar on a Friday night of a three day weekend, it just didn’t occur to me to do the right thing and document it. I was just happy to be alive. IMC May Be Unavoidable, But Should Never Be Inadvertent There is rarely an excuse for experiencing inadvertent IMC. Flying into IMC conditions may be unavoidable, but it should never be inadvertent. With that said, almost every pilot I know has made this same mistake at one time or another. I can’t say conclusively that the crash that killed Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and their friends was because the pilot, Ara Zobayan, inadvertently entered IMC conditions. I can say that when I did something similar, I had a vastly better set of circumstances to rescue me from the consequences of my poor decisions than he did. I had an overpowered and lightly loaded military aircraft that was equipped and certified to fly under complete IMC conditions. I trained regularly to fly in complete IMC conditions. I had a competent copilot to configure the cockpit instruments and give me verbal backup on my instrument scan, and I was under constant (if temporarily incorrect) air traffic control guidance to vector me to safety. Even with all those advantages, I came within a second or two of crashing into the side of a mountain not far from where Kobe’s S-76 did the same. While it may sound crazy to the average person that any licensed professional pilot could fly directly into conditions that they were not prepared for, the cold hard truth is that it is not uncommon. Every helicopter pilot who has flown long enough has experienced a similar situation or some other avoidable brush with death. It is the unadvertised nature of the job.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 12, 2020",Turkey Asks America To Send Patriot Missiles To Its Border As Its Troops Die In Syria Airstrikes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Turkish government has reportedly asked its American counterparts to deploy a pair of Patriot surface-to-air missile system batteries along its southern border with Syria. This news came amid the announcement of the death of two Turkish troops, and the wounding of five more, in an airstrike in northwestern Syria. The request is politically fraught from the start due to a number of factors, including an ongoing spat between Turkey and the United States in part over the former’s purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems and the risks of sparking a wider conflict if American air defenders were to shoot down a Russian combat jet. Bloomberg was first to report the Turkish request for U.S. Patriot batteries on Feb. 20, 2020. This comes as Turkish-backed militant in Syria, with direct support from Turkish artillery, have staged a major operation against forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad in the country’s northwestern Idlib province. Russia subsequently said that it had, at the request of Assad, sent Su-24 Fencer combat jets to conduct airstrikes on rebel positions. The Turkish Defense Ministry has blamed the Syrian government for the airstrikes that killed its troops. However, there is also evidence that the Russian Su-24s were responsible. Regardless, Turkey is now reportedly seeking the deployment of American Patriot batteries ostensibly to deter future airstrikes in areas under its de facto control in northern Syria and to provide an extra layer of protection for its own combat aircraft conducting retaliatory strikes, according to Bloomberg . At the time of writing, there has been no confirmation of the request from the U.S. government or any indication of how it might respond. It’s also not clear if Turkey asked the United States for the extra air defenses directly or did so through the mechanisms available to it as a member of NATO. The Turkish government has requested and secured the deployment of foreign Patriots, including from the United States, through the Alliance on multiple occasions in the past. The most recent instance began in 2013 when the Syrian government was actively employing Scud and other short-range ballistic missiles against rebels and there were fears that these could inadvertently land inside Turkey. Spanish Patriot batteries, which are older PAC-2 variants, are still deployed at Incirlik Air Base to this day under that mission. A Spanish patriot surface-to-air missile launcher in Turkey., Anadolu Agency If it were to happen, an American Patriot deployment would almost certainly consist of more advanced PAC-3 variants, possibly even including the latest PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors. It’s not clear where in Turkey they would necessarily be situated, but the U.S. military does have rights to use facilities near the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep, known as Site G , for contingency purposes and has based Patriots there in the past. Bloomberg ‘s report said that Turkey was seeking to position the air defense batteries in its southern Hatay province, which is wedged in between Syria and the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea. A map highlighting Turkey’s Hatay province. Gaziantep, where the US military has deployed Patriots in the past, and Adana, where Incirlik Air Base is located, are also visible in southern Turkey., Google Maps Whether or not the U.S. government acquiesces to Turkey’s request at all very much remains to be seen. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s close personal relationship with Turkey’s increasingly dictatorial President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the U.S. government as a whole remains frustrated with many of the country’s foreign policy decisions. Last year, the Pentagon ejected its Turkish counterparts from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program over Turkey’s decision to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems. The United States made several offers to sell Turkey Patriots instead of the S-400s both before and after it finalized the deal with Russia in 2017. This is an entire saga that you can read more about in these past War Zone pieces . Relations between Washington and Ankara are also strained over the latter’s decision to launch a unilateral military intervention into northern Syria last year. This operation was aimed primarily at removing U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces from a buffer area along the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkey and Russia subsequently arrived at an agreement , which saw Russian forces begin routine patrolling in this zone. This has caused increased tensions and spike in worrying altercations between U.S. and Russian forces in northeastern Syria, as well. Even if the Trump Administration was inclined to meet the Turkish government’s request, there are practical questions about whether there are American Patriots to send, at all. The U.S. military is presently locked in negotiations about sending some of these air defense systems to Iraq following unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes that targeted American troops in that country in January. However, due to the relatively small size of the U.S. Army’s overall Patriot force, this deployment, should it go ahead, could involve repositioning batteries that are now situated in Saudi Arabia guarding both military and civilian oil infrastructure. You can read more about these more logistical issues in this past War Zone piece . US Army personnel train with elements of a Patriot surface-to-air missile system at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar., USAF The deployment of Patriots to Saudi Arabia had already caused some backlash, especially after the Army had withdrawn them from a number of other Middle Eastern countries in 2018. Some have questioned whether it was a prudent use of U.S. military resources to protect Saudi oil fields while leaving U.S. troops undefended elsewhere in the region. A similar political reaction could easily emerge in response to any new deployment of Patriots to Turkey. There’s also the questions of what U.S. Patriot batteries would really be in a position to do in southern Turkey. While the U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets did shoot down a Syrian Su-22 combat jet in 2017, there’s no indication that the United States is eager to enter into a situation where it might be called upon to destroy Russian combat jets. The U.S. military has worked hard to avoid doing so in the past. It’s worth remembering that a Turkish F-16 Viper fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24 flying near the Syrian-Turkish border in 2015. By that point, Turkish aircraft had also shot down a Syrian Air Force MiG-23 combat jet and an Mi-17 helicopter . NATO Patriots deployed to Turkey were in no way involved in any of these shootdowns. There’s also no word on why Turkey’s own air defenses, including its new S-400 batteries, are not capable of providing suitable coverage along the border. There are now reports that the Turkish military will deploy the Russian-made air defense systems, but will continue to seek an American Patriot deployment, as well. Turkish-backed Syrian forces have also recently demonstrated their own ability to shoot down Syrian regime helicopters, at least, in recent weeks. Since the beginning of February, the rebels have brought down two Mi-17 helicopters with what appear to be should-fired man-portable surface-to-air defense systems, or MANPADS, which Turkey may have supplied. It’s important to remember that MANPADS have been a feature in the fighting in Syria for years now, as well. Any U.S. government association with current Turkish military activities in northwestern Syria, or those of Turkish-backed Syrian militants, no matter how tangential, would also risk drawing the United States into a broader conflict that may now be brewing in the country. Beyond the latest Turkish deaths from the airstrikes in Idlib, more than a dozen Turkish troops have already died in Syrian artillery strikes in the province since the beginning of February. Erdogan has also repeatedly accused Russia of not holding up its end of various agreements and over its inability or unwillingness to restrain Assad. Last week, he threatened to retaliate directly against pro-Assad forces if any more Turkish personnel died. “The regime, backed by Russian forces and Iran-backed militants, are continuously attacking civilians, committing massacres and shedding blood,”  Erdogan told members of his ruling Justice and Development Party on Feb. 12. “I hereby declare that we will strike regime forces everywhere from now on regardless of the [2018 safe zone] deal if any tiny bit of harm is dealt to our soldiers at observation posts or elsewhere.” Russia has, in turn, accused Turkey of breaching the 2018 agreement regarding Idlib, including with direct and indirect support for the most recent rebel offensive operation against Assad’s forces today. In addition to fire support from Turkish artillery units, Turkey has supplied various groups with armored personnel carriers, TOW anti-tank missiles , heavy artillery, and other weaponry. Trump and other U.S. government officials have offered rhetorical support for Turkey’s position in Syria regarding Idlib, but have also indicated that they will not intervene in any way. Trump himself has also pushed repeatedly for a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria. With all of this in mind, it hard to see how the United States could find it politically tenable to send Patriots to bolster Turkey’s defenses and run the risk of becoming inextricably involved in the new and rapidly evolving stage of the conflict in northwestern Syria that is now emerging.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details about the incident are still limited, but a video has emerged online showing a U.S. military M-ATV mine-resistant vehicle running a Russian Tigr armored utility vehicle off the road somewhere in northeastern Syria. The incident reportedly occurred relatively close to where American troops found themselves in a standoff a mob of civilians and militiamen aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad a week ago. Russian forces were also present during that altercation, which ultimately left at least one Syrian dead. A camera inside what appears to be a civilian vehicle also traveling along the same stretch of road captured the incident, which reportedly took place near the town of Qamishli, which is also near the Turkish border. It is unclear when exactly the events in the video actually occurred. The video shows a Russian convoy consisting of three vehicles, with the 4×4 Tigr leading a 6×6 Typhoon-K armored truck and an 8×8 BTR-series armored personnel carrier. This trio starts the video behind two American military vehicles, the aforementioned M-ATV and a MaxxPro MRAP mine-resistant truck. The vehicle carrying the camera drives alongside the Russians before squeezing in between them and the Americans to allow oncoming traffic to pass. The individuals filming the scene then begin to pass the U.S. military vehicles on the left. It’s not entirely clear why, but the Russian Tigr also makes to pass the Americans on the right at the same time, deliberately going offroad, and then wedges itself between the American M-ATV and the MaxxPro vehicles. The crew of the M-ATV responds by first attempting to block the Russians from passing any further and then drives them off the road. The two vehicles appear to actually hit each other at one point. A civilian bystander on the roadside is seen leaping out of the way of the Tigr just in time. The Russian and American vehicles then come to a stop as the vehicle carrying the camera drives by. Incidents between U.S. and Russian forces in northeastern Syria have been increasingly common for weeks now , though they have typically involved American troops block the movement of Russia’s forces. There have been some reports of more physical altercations , including a fistfight in January. This does appear to be the first known incident of Russian and American convoys actually duking it out on Syria’s roadways, which points to a serious escalation in tensions. It’s in some ways reminiscent of a spate of aggressive altercations between Russia’s combat jets and American planes in the skies over the country that seemed to subside two years ago. U.S. and Russian aircraft , as well as naval vessels , have had similar encounters elsewhere in the world since then, as well. A map showing various points of interest in northeastern Syria, including Qamishli, as well as zones of control as of January 2020., DOD Russia’s forces have been patrolling in the area, which was previously ostensibly under the control of U.S. forces and their local, predominantly Kurdish partners, since October 2019. Russia cut a deal that month with Turkey to move into the area following the start of a Turkish military intervention aimed at ejecting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces from a buffer zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. The Kremlin also claims that its troops were directly responsible for resolving the violent incident in the village of Khirbet Ammu, to the east of Qamishli, last week. The exact role Russian forces played in that incident remains unclear and video reportedly showing a Russian military policeman extolling the civilian mob to shout anti-American and pro-Assad slogans has since emerged online. This new road rage incident is exactly the kind of worrying interaction that the War Zone has repeatedly warned in the past could lead to a sudden escalation in tensions between various actors in Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 4, 2019",Take A Rare Look Inside An Army Ranger Armory Somewhere In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army’s elite 75th Ranger Regiment has released a rare set of photos from inside an armory for its personnel in Afghanistan. Rotating contingents of Army Rangers have served for years as key direct action forces for conducting raids on the Taliban and other terrorist groups in the country. The secretive Joint Special Operations Command has often directed these operations and they have sometimes been in cooperation with the most capable of the Afghan military’s own special operations units . The 75th Ranger Regiment posted the pictures online through the U.S. military’s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service website on Feb. 19, 2020, but they were taken nearly a year earlier at an undisclosed location in Afghanistan. A flag seen in the background of some of the pictures indicates that deployed elements of the Regiment’s 3rd Battalion were using the armory at the time. Each of the pictures has the same brief caption, which reads: “U.S. special operations service members conduct combat operations in support of Operation Resolute Support in Afghanistan, February 2019. RS is a NATO-led mission to train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and institutions.” Though there is no detailed information accompanying the pictures, they do offer a good look at the typical weapons and other gear that Rangers are employing on operations in Afghanistan, including modified M4A1 carbines , Mk 48 light machine guns, and an 84mm Carl Gustaf M3 recoilless rifle . The last weapon is one that has been in use around the world for decades, but which only came to the U.S. military in the late 1980s when the Rangers adopted them. The use of the Carl Gustaf subsequently expanded throughout the U.S. special operations forces community and, more recently, the recoilless rifles have begun to make their way to conventional Army and Marine Corps units.  You can read much more about the M3 in this past War Zone piece . US Army Here are the detailed images with descriptions of what we are seeing: Various M4A1 carbines hang in the armory in Afghanistan. These are, by and large, in a standardized configuration that the Rangers adopted years ago, known as the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Block II, according to Leigh Neville’s Guns of Special Forces, 2001-2015 . This includes the Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS) II handguard with attachment points for various accessories, including the flashlights and laser aiming devices seen on most of the guns. Each one also has a muzzle device that can accept a quick-detach sound suppressor and most of the carbines have one fitted. There are a number of different optics seen, as well. The first carbine on the left has what appears to be a variant of the Aimpoint Comp series non-magnifying red dot sight, as does the gun second from the right. The third and fourth M4A1s from the left have EOTech Model 553 non-magnifying holographic sights. The others have SU-230s or SU-269s , both of which are variants of the Elcan Specter DR with 1x and 4x magnification modes., US Army A trio of 7.62mm Mk 48 light machine guns. These guns also have laser aiming devices and a version of the Elcan Specter DR with 1.5x and 6x magnification modes., US Army A close up of one of the Ranger M4A1s with an EOTech Model 553 sight., US Army Mk 48 with their barrels removed and stacks of spare barrels underneath., US Army An individual in the Armory with no visible unit patches inspects one of the M4A1 carbines with an EOTech Model 553 sight., US Army An M3 Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle is just barely visible in the background on the floor. What appears to be an 84mm illumination round, which contains a parachute flare, is to its immediate right., US Army Another shot with the M3 recoilless rifle in the background., US Army Other personal gear is also visible in the armory. This includes this row of helmets with night-vision goggles attached, at least one of which also has an infrared strobe light to help friendly aircraft identify the Rangers on the ground. , US Army It’s not clear why the 75th Ranger Regiment decided to release these photos now. They have come out just days before the Taliban are set to enter into what has been described as a “ period of reduced violence .” This partial ceasefire is part of a possible pathway to a true peace plan between the group and the United States. Army Rangers remain deployed in Afghanistan and the elements of the 75th that are there now are no doubt just as prepared for whatever might happen as the ones who were utilizing this armory last year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",Here Is What Each Of The Pentagon’s Air-Launched Missiles And Bombs Actually Cost,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Whenever you see pictures of U.S. military combat aircraft, drones, and helicopters deployed on operations overseas, or even just during exercises in the United States or abroad, they’re often loaded down with various missiles and other precision-guided munitions. It’s no secret that the United States spends a lot on defense , but how much do each of these various weapons actually cost? The individual prices of various air-launched munitions is an interesting and important thing to consider, especially given how many of them the U.S. military expends each year. In 2019 alone, American military aircraft, manned and unmanned, employed 7,423 munitions of various types in Afghanistan and another 4,729 in Iraq and Syria , according to official data . This year, already, they’ve expended 415 and 68 weapons in those same areas, respectively. The War Zone has collected the latest unit costs of many of the Pentagon’s air-launched weapons to give readers a sense of just how much it is spending to arm its fleets of combat aircraft. It should be stressed that these are the prices for just the individual weapons and do not factor in any future spending on support services, modifications, or upgrades. Some may be surprised, or even a bit mortified, at just how expensive some of these weapons are. USAF It’s also important to note that unit prices fluctuate, wildly so in some cases, depending on various factors, including the economies of scale from buying larger lots. What this means is that different services may actually end up paying different amounts for the same weapons. A single service might also find itself paying different amounts for the same munitions in the base budget and the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget, especially if the size of the various orders are significantly different. The Department of the Navy is responsible for the Marine Corps’ budget, as well. So, the unit prices that the Navy pays also apply to purchases of certain munitions destined for the Marine Corps, too. USN What follows are the unit prices, rounded to the nearest dollar, that the various branches of the U.S. military expect to pay for various air-launched weapons in the 2021 Fiscal Year as they appear in the official budget documents. Air-to-Air Missiles: AIM-9X Sidewinder (Air Force) – $472,000 AIM-9X Sidewinder (Navy) – $430,818 These unit prices are averages for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year orders for both services, which include lots of AIM-9X-2 Block II and AIM-9X-3 Block II+ missiles, the latter of which is specifically for variants F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air To Air Missile (AMRAAM) (Air Force)- $1.095 million AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air To Air Missile (AMRAAM) (Navy)- $995,018 Air-to-Surface Missiles: AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) (Navy) – $6.149 million AGM-114 Hellfire (Air Force) – $70,000 This unit price is an average for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year order, which may include a variety of Hellfire missiles in Air Force service, including, but not limited to the AGM-114R2, AGM-114R4, AGM-114R9E , and AGM-114R12. This is also the unit price for orders in the base budget. The Air Force is also looking to purchase a much larger number of AGM-114 variants through the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations budget at an average unit cost $31,000. AGM-114 Hellfire (Army) – $213,143 This unit price is an average for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year order, which may include a variety of Hellfire missiles in Army service, including various different variants of the AGM-114R , as well as the millimeter-wave radar-guided AGM-114L . This is also the unit price for orders in the base budget. The Army is also looking to purchase a much larger number of AGM-114R variants through the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations budget at an average unit cost $76,461. AGM-114 Hellfire (Navy) – $45,409 This unit price is an average for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year order, which may include a variety of Hellfire missiles in Navy and Marine Corps service, including, but not limited to the AGM-114K/K2, AGM-114M, AGM-114N, AGM-114P/P2, and AGM-114Q. AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) (Air Force) – $1.266 million This unit price is an average for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year order, which includes examples of the AGM-158A JASSM and AGM-158B JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER). The Air Force also expects the complete 2021 Fiscal Year JASSM order will also include the purchase of the first batch of low rate initial production AGM-158D JASSM-Extreme Range (JASSM-XR) missiles. AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) (Air Force) – $3.960 million AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) (Navy) – $3.518 million AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) (Army) – $324,805 AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) (Navy) – $243,281 Precision-Guided Bombs: GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) (Air Force) – $39,000 This unit price is an average for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year order, which may include the GBU-39A/B Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) variants, which has a special carbon fiber body intended to reduce the chance of collateral damage, and GBU-39B/B Laser SDBs. GBU-53/B StormBreaker /Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) (Air Force) – $195,000 GBU-53/B StormBreaker/Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) (Navy) – $220,916 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) (Air Force) – $21,000 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) (Navy) – $22,208 These are the unit prices for orders in the base budget. The Air Force is also looking to purchase a much smaller number of JDAM kits through the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations budget at an average unit cost of $36,000. The Navy is also looking to purchase a smaller number of JDAM kits through the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations budget at an average unit cost of $23,074. These unit prices are also averages for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year orders for both services and apply to the JDAM guidance kits only for 500, 1,000, and 2,000-pound class bombs. This unit price average also includes multi-mode Laser JDAM kits. The different JDAM guidance kits will work with a wide variety of different dumb bomb types within those classes, but some, such as the new BLU-137/B 2,000-pound class bunker buster, require certain weapon-specific modifications that impact the specific price point. Per the Air Force budget, a standard, unguided Mk 82 500-pound class bomb has a unit price of $4,000, while 2,000-pound class Mk 84 unguided bombs cost $16,000 apiece. It’s important to note that a number of air-launched munitions that are in active service across the U.S. military, such as the AGM-65E Maverick laser-guided missiles, AGM-154 Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bombs, AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, and Paveway laser and multi-mode guidance kits for various types of bombs, are not mentioned above. This is because the services are not planning to buy new stocks of them in the 2021 Fiscal Year or they are included include broader sections of the budget where their exact unit cost is not readily apparent. There are requests for funds for sustainment of many of those weapons, as well as modifications and upgrades, too. The Navy is notably expecting to begin purchasing a powered derivative of the AGM-154, known as the JSOW-Extended Range (JSOW-ER), in the 2022 Fiscal Year. Regardless, now, the next time you see a U.S. military combat aircraft, drone or helicopter, you’ll have a head start figuring out just how much its loadout of bombs and missiles actually cost.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Proposed Facility Would Drastically Cut Down Time Required To Arm Bombers On Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During any major conflict in the Pacific region involving the United States, Andersen Air Force Base on Guam would serve as a major hub for U.S. air operations, including acting as a valuable staging location for America’s B-2 , B-52 , and B-1 bombers . Amid a growing emphasis on security concerns in the Pacific, in general, the Air Force wants to rectify something of a glaring gap in Andersen’s infrastructure. At present, the base lacks facilities to pre-load Common Rotary Launchers (CRL) for the service’s bombers with cruise missiles and to store the launchers pre-loaded so they can be more readily installed on an aircraft as a single unit. Right now, ground crews can only load missiles one at a time onto launchers already installed in the bombers’ bomb bays, a process that can take nearly half a day to complete. The Air Force’s most recent budget proposal for the 2021 Fiscal Year includes a request for $56 million to build what it calls a “Stand Off Weapons Complex” at Andersen Air Force Base. The project would include the renovation of an existing structure, Building 51109, as well as the construction of all-new additions, such as “earth-covered magazines” to store the pre-loaded CRLs. The refurbished and new structures will all need to be able to withstand the harsh weather that Andersen regularly experiences, including typhoons with winds gusting up to 195 miles per hour. “Currently, there are no facilities capable of supporting standoff weapon pre-load operations at Andersen Air Force Base,” the Air Force budget documents explain. “Without this capability, missiles are loaded one at a time, requiring more than 11 hours.” USAF USAF USAF USAF The section on the proposed infrastructure improvements says that it only takes two and a half hours to install a preloaded CRL onto a bomber. It does not say whether or not loading certain types of missiles onto certain bombers impacts how long the process takes in any way. Also, while the proposed infrastructure improvements are specifically focused on pre-loading the CRLs with stand-off weapons, there’s no reason why the facilities could not be used to load them with other munitions, if required. An airmen manuevers a trailer with pre-loaded Common Rotary Launcher into position for loading underneath a B-52 bomber at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana., USAF A pre-loaded Common Rotary Launcher inside a storage bunker at Barksdale Air Force Base., USAF Also known as the Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRL), the rotary launchers were originally intended to accommodate various nuclear weapons, including cruise missiles, such as the AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile and the now-retired AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile , and nuclear gravity bombs . The Air Force began developing the launcher in 1981 specifically as a system that would work with its existing B-52 and B-1 bombers, as well as what was then known as the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB). The ATB program led to the development of the B-2 stealth bomber. As time has gone on, the Air Force has modified and updated the CRLs to be able to accommodate a wide array of conventional weapons , including the AGM-158 Joint Air-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) series and various precision-guided bombs. In November 2019, the service notably retired the conventional variants of the ALCM, the AGM-86C and D versions , leaving JASSM and its subvariants as the only conventional stand-off weapons presently certified for use with the CRL. A briefing slide showing the Air Force’s expansion of the conventional weapon capabilities for the B-52 specifically, including various conventional loadouts utilizing the Common Rotary Launcher, as well that bomber’s external underwing pylons ., USAF The JASSM family, including the now-in-development AGM-158D JASSM-Extreme Range, or JASSM-XR , is likely the be the primary conventional standoff weapon for America’s bombers for the foreseeable future. Last year, Congress also eliminated the requirement for a conventional version of the future Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) cruise missile, the nuclear-armed version of which is still slated to replace the AGM-86B. At present, each CRL can accommodate eight AGM-86Bs or JASSMs. But even if it takes a shorter amount of time to load the slightly smaller JASSMs versus AGM-86Bs one by one onto certain bombers, the process is still clearly arduous. JASSMs loaded onto a Common Rotary Launcher in the bomb bay of a B-1B bomber prior to the US-led strikes on Syria in April 2018., Undisclosed It’s also a major undertaking to install the preloaded CRLs. The Air Force notes that it will have to upgrade the roads between the loading facility and dispersal areas where bombers would be parked due to the fact that trailers carrying the fully armed CRLs can weigh nearly 40 tons in total. The service says categorically that the “existing asphalt roadway” they have now “will fail” if they ever tried to tow pre-loaded CRLs across it.

Congress still needs to approve this proposal, as well as the rest of the Air Force’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request, but it’s hard to see how anyone could deny that 11 hours is just too long loading just one bomber’s CRL full of missiles, especially in a crisis.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",DARPA Wants Millions To Design An Unmanned ‘Flying Gun’ Under Its New Gunslinger Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tucked away inside the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s most recent budget proposal is a request for millions of dollars to explore what one could best describe as an unmanned flying gun capable of engaging airborne and ground-based targets. This comes around a year and a half after DARPA first announced it was working on what it called a “ Flying Missile Rail .” The system would carry its own air-to-air missiles and would be launched like a drone from under the jet’s wing, after which they would fly off and engage aerial targets with their missiles. DARPA is asking for $13.27 million in its budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year for the flying gun effort, which it has dubbed Gunslinger. The budget documents say that this is a new program and it is in no way related to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps program of the same name , which developed a system to detect incoming hostile gunfire. “Gunslinger program will develop and demonstrate technologies to enable an air-launched tactical range missile system capable of multi-mission support,” the Gunslinger entry in DARPA’s budget proposal says. “This system will utilize the high maneuverability of a missile system coupled with a gun system capable of scalable effects and engagement of multiple targets.” The section does not give any specifics as to the overall size of the weapon system DARPA is envisioning or what type or types of guns it might be capable of carrying. It also does not say what types of aircraft would be capable of carrying these gun-armed “missiles” in the future, though it says that the plan would be to ultimately transition the project to the Air Force and the Navy. The entry on Gunslinger from DARPA’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request., DARPA “These mission sets addressed [by Gunslinger] will include counter-insurgency (COIN) operations, close air support (CAS) and air-to-air engagements,” the budget documents add. “The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a robust missile system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic, propulsion, and payload capacity for a wide operational envelope, (2) the algorithms that support maneuvering and target recognition to enable expedited command decision making for selecting and engaging targets and (3) approaches to incorporating modularity of design to reduce cost throughout the design and development process.” The funding that DARPA is seeking the 2021 Fiscal Year would go specifically to “trade studies, to include propulsion, munitions, sensors, GPS and communication,” as well as conceptual design work and modeling and simulating potential concepts of operation for employing the weapon system. It’s not entirely clear what the driving factors behind this program are from its description in the budget documents. The use of the word “missile” to describe it strongly implies that DARPA is treating this as an expendable weapon, like any other missile or bomb, rather than a recoverable, reusable drone. The section on Gunslinger does say that it would have the ability to “loiter” over a part of the battlefield, engaging multiple targets. Loitering munitions , which Israel pioneered and that are something of a hybrid of traditional missiles and unmanned aircraft, are seeing increasing use within the U.S. military. It’s certainly true that aerial guns typically offer the ability to focus fire on much smaller targets, which is especially valuable if the threat is situated very close to friendly forces or innocent bystanders. This is something that is very likely to occur in dense urban areas, which the U.S. military increasingly sees as a likely environment for future conflicts. With a sufficiently large ammunition magazine, guns can also readily engage multiple targets and rapidly shift focus from one to another, things that a single traditional missile or bomb cannot achieve. Ammunition loads can also be tailored to specific target sets . One possible concept of operations could involve a high-flying bomber-type aircraft , or some or form of future “ arsenal plane ,” launching these flying gun pods over a target area, where they could offer a more persistent and precision means of engaging targets on the ground or in the air. When it comes to close air support, U.S. Air Force bombers have increasingly been called upon to perform that mission , but lack any functional way of providing this particular kind of direct fire. It’s worth remembering that Boeing received a patent for a ventral gun system for the B-1B Bone bomber in 2018, but there has been not been any clearly articulated reason why the company pursued that project in the first place since then. A schematic of Boeing’s notional ventral gun system for the B-1B Bone bomber that would fit inside the bomber’s rear bomb bay., USPTO A schematic of the gun system itself., USPTO There has been something of a move away from gun-armed aircraft by the U.S. military, in general, as well. The Navy and Marine Corps versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter do not have a gun installed by default, though they can carry an external gun pod . However, that system, as well as the internal 25mm GAU-22/A gun on the Air Force’s F-35A variant, have limited ammunition capacities. The F-35A carries 180 rounds for the GAU-22/A, which fires at approximately 3,300 rounds per minute, giving the aircraft enough ammunition for roughly 3 three seconds of continuous fire. Though nowhere near this extreme, other U.S. military combat jets equipped with internal guns also have relatively limited ammunition capacities. The F-16C/D Vipers and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets carry 511 and 412 rounds of 20mm ammunition for their M61 Vulcan cannons, respectively. That gun has a rate of fire of around 6,000 rounds per minute, giving Viper pilots just over five seconds of continuous fire and aviators flying Super Hornets a little more than four seconds of trigger time. Advocates of retaining the venerable A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft often cite its iconic 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger cannon and ammunition load of 1,174 shells as a key reason for keeping those aging aircraft in service as long as possible. Proposals for A-10 replacements in the past, such as the experimental Scaled Composites Agile Responsive Effective Support (ARES) aircraft, focused heavily on gun armament. General Electric also offered the GPU-5/A gun pod for a time, which contained a lightened derivative of the GAU-8/A, the GAU-13/A, in a failed attempt to give other aircraft the A-10’s awesome firepower. The Air Force’s most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year calls for the retirement of 44 Warthogs, 15 percent of the remaining fleet. The service also still wants to eventually replace them all with F-35As. So, DARPA may be looking into Gunslinger as potential alternative means of providing an aerial gun capability in the future that would also not necessarily require a dedicated aircraft. The gun-armed “missile” would also provide a system that a stealth aircraft could carry internally while remaining its most low-observable configuration. It could even fly into high-threat areas without putting the launching aircraft at risk. It could also bridge a gaping chasm between the capabilities of high-flying bombers and low-flying close air support capable fast jets when it comes to providing close air support. It’s also entirely possible that this will turn out to be a more academic exercise with benefits that may not necessarily be directly tied to the performance of the weapon system. For instance, DARPA’s tangential Flying Missile Rail project also focused heavily on exploring rapid prototyping and manufacturing processes. You can read more about that in this past War Zone story . The U.S. military, as a whole, is increasingly interested in these types of developments to help reduce the ever-growing costs of both procuring and sustaining high-end systems, such as stealth aircraft. At the same time, DARPA’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request also asks for $22 million to continue work on a program called LongShot, another new effort, but one that sounds very much like an evolution of the Flying Missile Rail effort with a more operational focus. “LongShot will explore new engagement concepts for multi-modal, multi-kill systems that can engage more than one target,” the budget documents say. The entry on LongShot from DARPA’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request., DARPA “An air system using multi-modal propulsion could capitalize upon a slower speed, higher fuel-efficient air vehicle for ingress, while retaining highly energetic air-to-air missiles for endgame target engagements,” it continues. “First, the weapon system will have a much-increased range over their legacy counterparts for transit to an engagement zone. Second, launching air-to-air missiles closer to the adversary increases energy in terminal flight, reduces reaction time, and increases probability of kill.” Congress still has to debate and decide whether to approve DARPA’s budget overall request, including Gunslinger, along those from the rest of the U.S. military. Maybe as those discussions, both public and private, continue, we may learn more about the ostensible objectives and driving forces behind the project.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of Kalitta Air 747-400ERF freighters carrying hundreds of U.S. citizens home from Japan after weeks of being quarantined on-board the cruise ship Diamond Princess , where 454 passengers contracted the COVID-19 novel coronavirus , have arrived at two American military bases. Pictures from the operation show that at least one of the aircraft was carrying a specialized shipping container-sized bio-containment system to isolate individuals diagnosed with the virus from non-infected passengers and crew. The late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen helped develop this system after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The two aircraft left Tokyo’s Haneda Airport at 7:05 AM local time on Feb. 17, 2020. Due to crossing the International Date Line, the first of these planes touched down at Travis Air Force Base in California at just shy of 11:30 PM local time on Feb. 16. The second 747 arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas at 3:56 AM local time on Feb. 17. “During the evacuation process, after passengers had disembarked the ship and initiated transport to the airport, U.S. officials received notice that 14 passengers, who had been tested 2-3 days earlier, had tested positive for COVID-19,” the U.S. State Department, which had chartered the flights, said in a statement on Feb. 17, 2020, using the formal name for the new coronavirus. “These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols.” The press release did not offer any details about this “specialized containment area,” but pictures from the evacuation show a Containerized Bio-Containment System (CBCS) installed on one of the aircraft. The 747-400ERFs are not configured to carry passengers by default and those that had not tested positive for the new coronavirus traveled in palletized seating installed on the planes’ cargo floors. The CBCS is 44 feet long and eight feet tall, making it roughly the same size as an ISO shipping container. It is “a first-of-its-kind, flyable medical transport unit with full biocontainment,” MRIGlobal , which helped design the system, says on its website. “The units feature three rooms: a patient treatment area for four patients and four caregivers; an ante room to safely don and doff personal protective equipment; and a rest area for two caregivers,” MRIGobal’s page continues . “Pilots can cargo the CBCS in both private and military aircraft, confident that the biocontainment is safe and effective. CBCS units can be moved by truck, too, ready for use. The CBCS is designed to survive crash loads and rapid decompression per DOD Safe-to-Fly standards, and the entire system can be rapidly de-contaminated and put right back into service.” A 3D rendering showing the layout of the CBCS., MRI Global A view from inside the CBCS during a training exercise., Phoenix Air Another interior view., USAF The development of the system began in 2014 with a $5 million public-private partnership grant from the State Department to the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. At the time, Paul Allen , a Microsoft co-founder who passed away in 2018 due to cancer, had expressed an interest to the U.S. government in using some of his considerable wealth in helping to combat the Ebola virus. In December 2013, an Ebola outbreak in West Africa turned into a major regional crisis. This, in turn, prompted the United States to deploy considerable resources, including a U.S. military task force, to safeguard American citizens and help contain the epidemic. That outbreak demonstrated the value of a smaller system, known as the Aeromedical Biological Containment System (ABCS). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), together with the U.S. military and air services contractor Phoenix Air, had developed the ABCS between 2007 and 2010 in response to a number of serious disease outbreaks, including multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza, or “bird flu.” The ABCS, which was designed to fit inside Phoenix’s Gulfstream III business jet aircraft, consists of a tent-like isolator unit that is entirely sealed to prevent airborne pathogens from escaping. You can read much more about the development of ABCS and Phoenix Air’s specially outfitted Gulfstreams here . Between 2014 and 2015, Phoenix Air’s ABCS-equipped Gulfstream IIIs successfully brought 41 Ebola-infected patients to hospitals in the United States and Europe. So, when Paul Allen had offered to help, the State Department asked if he would be willing to help fund work on a larger, more capable containment system that could be employed in response to any future epidemic. The Paul Allen Foundation, together with MRIGlobal and Phoenix Air, set to work and the first examples of the new Containerized Bio-Containment Systems (CBCS) were ready for testing in 2016. MRIGlobal says that it took just 191 days in total, after the requirements were solidified, to design and build the two CBCS. The CBCS requires a much larger aircraft than the Gulfstream III to carry it. Kalitta’s 747s are one option, but the State Department has also worked with the U.S. Air Force to certify its C-17A Globemaster III airlifters to carry them, if necessary. A US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III airlifter with the CBCS installed., USAF USAF USAF Phoenix Air is the primary contractor responsible for sustaining the CBCS. At least as of 2018, the company stood on-call to transport the containers by truck to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where personnel would load them onto an aircraft, such as one of Kalitta’s 747s. Hartsfield-Jackson is situated some 40 miles southeast of Cartersville Airport, where Phoenix Air is headquartered, but it is too small to readily accommodate commercial aircraft large enough to carry the containerized system. “Training exercises are conducted several times annually, flying multiple aircraft to Africa, to maintain the high level of skills required to perform these missions,” according to Phoenix Air . “The Contagious Disease program is operated under a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of State (DOS).” A low-quality image the US State Department released in 2016 of a Kalitta Air 747 carrying an CBCS in Monrovia, Liberia, during an Exercise called Tranquil Surge., US Department of State It’s not immediately clear if the State Department has access to more than two of these systems now. With each one only able to hold four patients, one or two of them would not have been enough to isolate all 14 of the U.S. citizens on the flights out of Japan who had tested positive for COVID-19. The CBCS may have simply been installed to provide an area to safely transport anyone who began experiencing especially severe symptoms in flight. The pictures from on-board the 747s show that the crew was wearing protective suits and it seems almost certain that other precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the virus. “Passengers that develop symptoms in flight and those with positive test results will remain isolated on the flights and will be transported to an appropriate location for continued isolation and care,” the State Department had said in its statement . “Upon landing in the United States, passengers will deplane at either Travis AFB or Joint Base San Antonio and will remain under quarantine for 14 days.” A total of around 340 Americans left Japan on both flights. Around 400 Americans had been on-board Diamond Cruises’ Diamond Princess when it arrived in Yokohama harbor some two weeks ago. Japanese authorities placed the ship under quarantine after learning that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong had tested positive for COVID-19. At least 46 U.S. citizens on the ship have already contracted the coronavirus since then. At the time of writing, the CDC says that there are 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, not including those from the Diamond Princess, and that 60 additional individuals are being evaluated for possible infection with the virus. There have been no deaths confirmed to be linked to this new coronavirus in the United States to date. As of Feb. 16, 2020, the United Nations’ World Health Organization reported that there were nearly 51,900 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide and 683 fatalities. The vast majority of these cases and deaths have occurred inside China, where the virus first appeared in December 2019. There have only been three deaths outside of China, one in the Philippines, one in Japan, and one in France. Though COVID-19’s spread outside of China has been significantly slower than inside that country, it has now appeared in 25 other nations around the world. WHO The U.S. State Department already helped diplomatic staff and other U.S. citizens evacuate China on chartered flights, including on Kalitta’s 747s, but it is unclear if the containerized containment system was employed or otherwise available on any of those earlier flights. If there is a need to help Americans leave other countries where the virus becomes a major concern, it is certainly possible that the State Department will charter additional flights, some of which may be carrying the highly specialized Containerized Bio-Containment System in case there is a need to isolate infected passengers.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 6, 2020",Stripped F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Jet Listed On Government Surplus Website,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Skunk Works’ F-117 Nighthawk , the first operational stealth aircraft that still flies under a veil of secrecy well over a decade after its official retirement, continues to capture the public’s imagination . Finally in the twilight of its existence, the remaining F-117 force that is stored at Tonopah Test Range Airport is set for destruction over the coming decade, aside from a dozen airframes that have been earmarked to potentially end up in museums after elaborate demilitarization processes have been completed. Now, according to a listing, the bare carcass of one of the 64 F-117A and pre-production YF-117s built has been offered as surplus on the government’s GSAXcess.gov website. We were notified of the existence of the listing by a reader who saw a screenshot of it posted over on Dreamlandresort.com ‘s forum. The website provides an impressive archive of information about Area 51, its history, and the surrounding Nevada Test and Training Range —and no, talk of aliens isn’t welcome. The listing is basically for the totally stripped fuselage of F-117A 84-0827. That aircraft was the 43rd F-117A built and first flew on April 7th, 1987. 37th Fighter Wing Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk 84-0827 on the ramp at Tonopah TTR Airport. This is a rare public image of the F-117s during their time at TTR. , USAF All the sensitive and toxic radar absorbant material and radar defeating substructures have been removed, as has pretty much everything else on the Nighthawk. The listing notes that the aircraft has been “extensively cannibalized,” which means picked for parts to keep other jets flying. Most importantly, it states that the plane is only available for static display, but it will take a lot of work to get it back to a presentable state. You can learn all about the intricate process of taking a mothballed F-117 and turning it into a display aircraft in this past post of ours. Suffice it to say, entire sections of the aircraft have to be fabricated from scratch so that it resembles its original form, but does not present a security risk. The listing estimates those costs will run around $300,000. The listing goes on to give the original unit price of the F-117A—$42M—and states the Special Access Program the F-117s continue to exist under. It also gives a nod to the fact that it remains at one of the most highly secure locations in the United States—inside the layers of security at Tonopah Test Range Airport. This is the same locale that secretly hosted the F-117 force during its early operational years. GSAXcess.gov via Dreamlandresort.com As of last Fall, 51 of the F-117s remained at Tonopah. None have been destroyed as was mandated by congress years before. A media blasting facility had to be built at Tonopah to totally strip the jets of all their secretive skin coatings before disposal or transfer. Now that this has happened, the airframes appear to be trickling out for disposal or display. One of the jets was painstakingly demilitarized and sent for display at the Reagan Library , while another supposedly went to the National Museum of The United States Air Force. So, this appears to be another one that is up for grabs to a museum, base, or other facility that has the funds to make it happen. Whether or not it was originally one of the dozen airframes selected as candidates for display or if it became available in addition to those because it was cannibalized for parts, isn’t clear. Regardless, the listing is just another reminder that the Nighthawk’s days are numbered. But considering that it has had a remarkably active career even after being retired following decades of successful service, which many would describe as ‘borrowed time’ as it is, it’s not like the beloved and revolutionary jet is going out with a whimper. The fact that a dozen will be available to museums also takes away some of the sting. It will be interesting to see where what’s left of 84-0827 ends up, if not the scrapper’s torch. We will be sure to report back if or when more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 3, 2020",Check Out All The Airpower On Guam For Exercise Cope North In This Exclusive Satellite Image,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Cope North, the huge multi-national air warfare exercise that calls Andersen AFB on the island of Guam home, is officially underway. The drills include the Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as well as the Pentagon’s own substantial airpower already deployed to the island outpost, and other units sent there just for the exercise. In total, some 100 aircraft and 2,000 personnel are taking part in this iteration of the operation, which includes everything from coalition counter-air to deep strike mission training to disaster relief, and pretty much everything in between. It’s all about getting the diverse international players to learn how to work seamlessly together during a crisis. Overall, Cope North is one of the region’s most impressive displays of air combat capabilities and the extent of its size translates well even from the point of view of low earth orbit. In fact, our satellite tasking caught the ‘group image’ of the participating aircraft and personnel very close to the moment the image below was snapped, one that shows a dizzying array of air combat capabilities. These group images are a staple of Cope North, as well as many other international large force employment (LFE) exercises.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Andersen is incredibly strategic for the U.S. military. Its distance from potential adversaries, especially China and North Korea, would give it a degree of survivability during a conflict that is far greater than what America’s air bases in Japan and South Korea would face. The installation is truly gargantuan in scale and is set up to support all types of airpower, including that of a strategic nature. That’s why a continuous rotation of American bombers calls the base home. At any given time, roughly four to six B-1Bs, B-2As, or B-52Hs are present at the base and capable of delivering a scalable offensive punch, from conventional to nuclear (at least in the case of the B-2A and B-52H), on a moments notice, anywhere in the region. At times , even all three of America’s bomber types have been on the island at the same time . During an actual crisis, Guam will serve as a key staging and power-projection hub for America and its allies. F/A-18 Hornets taxi down the central dispersal, past KC-135R and B-52Hs., USAF Cope North, which was originally an exercise between the U.S. and Japan that took place quarterly in Japan, has a history dating back to the 1970s, but its presence at Andersen began back in 1999. Since then it has turned into an annual event, grown in size and complexity, and it has added a new participant, the Royal Australian Air Force. The operation is all about further developing tactics and procedures, and putting them to work across all three nation’s air arms so that they can fight and win as a team in the Pacific Theater of operations. As for the aircraft participating, from what we know, Japan brought its F-15J and F-2 fighters, as well as its E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft. In addition, the JASDF also brought Hawker U-125 maritime patrol aircraft, its indigenously developed C-2 cargo plane, and according to an Air Force press release, the country’s fascinating US-2 flying boat is also going to participate in aircrew recovery drills for the first time. The Aussies brought their E-7 Wedgetail , F/A-18 Hornet, and KC-30 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft. The U.S. leveraged its air power in the region, which includes F-16C/D, F-15C/D, F/A-18C/D, EA-18G, RQ-4, KC-135R, E-3G, and even C-12J aircraft, which are all taking part in the drills. Most notably, the exercise is supported by the 18th Aggressor Squadron and their eclectically painted F-16C/Ds that are normally based at Eielson AFB in Alaska. They provide a highly capable threat force for the players to deal with. 18th AGRS F-16Cs on the ramp at Andersen AFB for Cope North 2020., USAF The B-52Hs that are already forward deployed to the island are also taking part. This is just the list as we understand it, it is possible that there are a few other participants that we cannot definitively state at this time, a couple of then seem to appear in the images below.

Beyond another hangar facility being built on the north ramp area, on the southern main ramp, the construction of a pair of addition typhoon-hardened large hangars is still underway. Over the last 15 years, these types of hangars have replaced more traditional ones that were scattered across Andersen AFB’s southern ramp. The two that are under construction now have been so for years.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Mar 6, 2020",B-1B Bombers Can No Longer Fly At Low-Level And Their Annual Flight Hours Have Been Restricted,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the announcement of the potential imminent retirement of more than a quarter of the remaining B-1B bomber fleet, it’s a great time to look back at the rollercoaster ride the B-1 community has been on and to look forward to it’s looming sunset years. The United States Air Force is one of the world’s last remaining air arms to retain global power projection with a long-range bomber fleet and there are no signs it will give that up. B-21 Raider stealth bomber procurement is proceeding full steam ahead with the partial goal of replacing B-1s starting in the early 2030s . The sudden move by the Air Force to offer up 17 B-1s to the congressional budgetary chopping block has surprised some, but not all. So, how did we get here and how bad is the current state of the B-1B force? On June 29th, 1985, at 1:55 PM, a B-1B nicknamed Star of Abilene was the first example of the bomber to land at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas as part of a delivery ceremony in front of an air show crowd of 45,000. Almost foretelling the B-1’s legacy, legend has it that the real Star of Abilene was delayed by maintenance problems and another B-1 arrived in its place so as to not disappoint the crowd. With that first delivery, Dyess became, and still is, the center of the B-1 world. In 2003, 18 years later, the Star of Abilene was retired early with 33 of its stablemates as part of a plan to concentrate the B-1 budget to increase reliability. The bomber was towed through Texas’ red dirt and mud to get to the main gate for display where it remains today. In total, 100 B-1Bs were built and 62 remain in service 35 years after the type’s introduction into service. In those three and a half decades, one of the worst kept secrets of the B-1 program was its poor reliability. B-1B under construction at Rockwell’s facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California during the mid-1980s., National Archives The B-1B was resurrected from the canceled 1970’s B-1A program, which was originally intended to replace the B-52 . When it was brought back in 1981, the bomber had become an interim measure due to the delays the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program experienced. The ATB was funded at the time as “Aurora,” but was ultimately known to the public as the B-2 Spirit. When the B-2 was finally rolled out for the first time, it did so the same year as the 100th and final B-1B delivery, 1988. The B-1 dutifully took its place next to the B-52 in the nuclear deterrent role, until it stood its last nuclear alert in 1997. The bomber’s first combat employment was shortly thereafter during Operation Desert Fox in Iraq in 1998.  After September 11th, 2001, B-1s quickly found their place in Operation Enduring Freedom. B-1B seen sitting idle while deployed to the Middle East during the 2000s. , National Archives In actuality, B-1s were already deployed to Guam for a global power exercise when the 9/11 attacks took place. They quickly moved to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and in March 2002 the 9th Bomb Squadron from Dyess AFB participated in Operation Anaconda . Throughout operations in Afghanistan, and eventually Iraq, B-1s flew from Oman, Diego Garcia, Qatar , and other forward operating locations. Their loiter time, large payload, and ability to perform show of force flybys, as well as other unique capabilities, rapidly evolved them into one of the world’s most requested close air support platforms and a virtual flying arsenal ship. That’s a large contrast from the nuclear deterrent role for which the bomber was originally intended. Upgrades to precision weapons capabilities continued and proved useful. In combat, B-1s mostly employed GBU-31/B 2,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions . Such large ordnance kept B-1 use in Iraq more limited. In 2007, the Sniper XR targeting pod was fitted to the right front-most external weapons hardpoint, greatly improving precision weapons delivery capabilities by self target acquisition. More recently, $1.26 billion was spent on long overdue avionics modernizations , called the IBS, or Integrated Battle Station, for the forward and aft B-1 crew stations. The B-1B’s upgraded cockpit. , USAF B-1B’s upgraded rear crew station. , USAF B-1s were almost continuously deployed for 15 years and over 12,000 combat sorties have been flown to date. Ground commanders love the B-1 for always performing assigned taskings when needed, but the B-1 world was infamous for maintenance problems and low mission capable rates. In August 2019, only six of the remaining 62 B-1Bs were mission capable. The highest time B-1 has accumulated over 12,000 flight hours. Priority was given to keep jets ready for combat, but training is essential to readiness. An elaborate system including, but not limited to generating spare jets, ever-evolving maintenance inspection concepts, and cannibalization programs became essential parts of even peacetime operations as the jets continued to age poorly. A normal day on a B-1 flightline involves aircrews starting up perfectly good aircraft and routinely finding so much going wrong that they leave it for a spare, or even a spare of a spare. A B-1Bs preparing to on a Red Flag mission out of Nellis AFB. Note the Sniper targeting pod on the forward fuselage pylon., USAF The original engineers expressed disapproval back in 1990 when they discovered active duty aircrews were performing touch and go landings. Remember, this jet was designed to sit nuclear alert. Combat jets and especially heavy bombers are purpose-built, life limited, and a finite resource. The service life expectancy of the B-1 fleet has already been extended several times. The bombers were never intended to see continuous use, to include conventional combat, for decades on end. Like all machines, B-1s wear out. Things like heavyweight landings have a price to pay. Even in the early days of the B-1B program, cracked longerons – the plane’s backbones – and other structural problems were found. Many more structural issues have been discovered since, including wing spar tabs, lower wing skins, fuselage splices, longeron doublers, and upper wing splices. B-1B during phase inspection at Tinker AFB., USAF A single disused B-1, 85-0082, was removed from Edwards Air Force Base in 2012, partially disassembled, and trucked to Seattle where it would become a fatigue testing article, providing useful information about the health and longevity of the aircraft’s structure. Modifications, One Time Inspections (OTIs), and extensive Time Change Technical Orders (TCTOs) have since been implemented. Aircrew procedures have been updated many times as fleet management initiatives have been deployed. The B-1B scheduled inspection concept at home bases went from phase to isochronal and back again in a search for the best way to manage the aging fleet. Every B-1 in the United States Air Force inventory has been extensively inspected and rebuilt many times by Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. PDM generally happens every five years and jets head back to their home stations looking brand new. A B-1B after a major overhaul at Tinker AFB. , USAF Bill Barnes, Director of the B-1 Systems Program Office, acknowledged that “It’s been flown past its certified service life and, as such, it’s developed numerous structural issues and we’ve been working on repairs for over the last four or five years.” In 2018, a B-1B, callsign Hawk 91, had a series of problems over Texas that resulted in the aircraft commander calling for the entire crew to eject. The first ejection summarily failed and the crew decided to stay together and land the jet in Midland, Texas. There were already issues with egress documentation and maintenance in previous years, but this failed ejection was traced to a part. Fleetwide groundings ensued. Three weeks later, the grounding was gradually lifted as the fleet was inspected and repaired as necessary. In addition to serious egress system problems, critical structural discrepancies have been a primary focus of the B-1 Systems Program Office at Tinker. Recently the 766th Aircraft Maintenance Group there stood up a dedicated repair line just to address B-1 structural issues. Before B-1s leave, they undergo 5,000 man-hours of repairs in only 30 days under phase 1. Phase 2 will begin in April 2020 and B-1s will receive 14,000 hours of repair work each. To meet these increased maintenance goals, the Tinker B-1 PDM will need to increase its workforce by 50 percent. The goal, at least in theory, is to keep the B-1 structurally capable of flying until 2040. A technician gives a tired Bone some much needed TLC at Tinker AFB., USAF A further implementation intended to keep the B-1 fleet going is a yearly flight hour limit imposed by General Timothy Ray, the Commander of Global Strike Command. Each aircraft will be expected to fly less than 300 hours per year unless waivered, according to a B-1B Fleet Management Policy Letter sent out to Ellsworth and Dyess Air Force Bases in January of 2020. Global Strike Command stated the following to The War Zone regarding the B-1B’s material condition: “Over the last 35 years, the B-1B Lancer community has continuously reinvented itself as a premier long-range precision strike platform. However, continuous bomber support over the last 20 years has taken a toll on the airframe’s structure due to overuse in a manner not commensurate with it’s planned design.” B-1B undergoing an engine swap of one of its four F101 afterburning turbofans. , USAF One of the most taxing flight profiles on the B-1B airframes, according to the engineers, is low-level terrain-following flight. The ‘whiskers’ at the front of the jet are known as the Structural Mode Control System vanes (SMCS vanes), a further evolution of the YF-12’s shaker vanes tested at Edwards Air Force Base in the 1970s. SMCS Vanes react to a set of accelerometers in the nose and spine with hummingbird-fast movements intended to dampen structural oscillations, increasing airframe life and improving ride quality. The B-1B’s original mission was to penetrate under the radar at low-altitude and high-speed in any weather, day or night. USAF SMCS or not, cruising at 540 knots at 500 feet above ground level regularly for 35 years has worn the B-1 fleet out in ways flying level at 20,000 feet and dropping JDAMS in combat never has. Almost all the low-level flying has been stateside during peacetime. Confusingly, the idea of using a B-1’s terrain-following radar and low-level capability to penetrate soviet air defense went away a long time ago. Nonetheless, B-1 aircrews continued to train for the entire life of the bomber by frequently flying low-level routes. Why? One reason is that it’s fun. Has a B-1 ever flown an actual combat low-level ingress to penetrate contested or denied airspace? It’s unlikely, but I stand to be corrected. More to the point, the B-1 aircrew low-level training requirement has ended over structural longevity concerns. Lieutenant Colonel David Faggard, Air Force Global Strike Command top spokesperson, said: “We’re working closely with aircrews, maintenance, industry engineers and combatant commands to identify and determine what, if any, changes may be made as we balance operational necessity today with the longevity of the B-1 airframe for the future.” Faggard declined to comment on specifics, but The War Zone understands that a 5,000-foot floor for B-1 operations has now been implemented. The B-52 community largely gave up low-level training a long time ago. In their case, they had a much larger fleet, with 744 examples built and providing data points, so the accelerated airframe wear caused by low-level training couldn’t be ignored. The B-52, like the B-1A, and unlike the B-1B, was built from the outset for high altitude missions, which they may end up having flown for an entire century before they are retired. Meanwhile, the B-1 world is finally and quietly entering its twilight years. National Archives We reached out to an engineer associated with the B-1B program, who told us the following: “In my own opinion after seeing in excess of 20 years of B-1 operations, we’ve accomplished more than the aircraft was really ever intended for, even if it wasn’t used in the originally conceived methods. The B-1 has been maligned, underfunded, and often placed under the charge of those who managed it poorly and didn’t represent it well when it came to sustainment and actual preventative measures for fleet health.” “The aircraft has largely overflown its original estimated service life and as B-1 operations will eventually dwindle into the twilight, many people will never know the amount of effort poured into keeping it flying despite the conditions, which forced it’s handlers to keep moving the goalposts. We were promised better systems through upgrades only to have them fail and no spares available. Procurement and sustainment contracts for critical components often took years only to have those parts not fit or fail sometimes out of the box.” “I’m anxious to see what’s coming, but also somewhat saddened by the sober knowledge I’ll watch these aircraft depart on their final flights.” Tyler Rogoway U.S. Air Force General Timothy Ray, commander of Global Strike Command seems to agree B-1s were overextended. He said, “The ongoing inspections and TCTOs [Time Compliance Technical Orders] were a much-needed step back even though we lost a lot of flying.” He also mentioned that he’s hopeful mission capable rates will improve. The most recent combat employment for the B-1B Program was a somewhat mysterious October 2019 rapid deployment by Bones from Ellsworth to Saudi Arabia, where the bombers supported the operation that resulted in the death of Bakr Al Baghdadi . During that mission, B-1s mostly lied in wait as F-15Es did the heavy lifting with stealthy JASSMs missiles . As late-life maintenance obligations and complications pile up, B-1s have seen fewer and fewer deployments. When they deployed in 2019, they did so briefly and in small packages. More short strategic bomber rotations are planned. General Ray commented, “The deployments are short, they’re crisp, they’re not long and enduring.” He doesn’t believe the missions will keep B-1s from undergoing maintenance. Crews work on a B-1B deployed to the Middle East in support of the Global War On Terror. , USAF Regardless of decreasing expeditionary and combat use, a recent “expanded carriage demonstration” performed by the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base hints at the potential for keeping the B-1B relevant until it is replaced by the B-21 Raider. But realizing that potential will cost even more money for a jet that is already being drawn down and is costing the Air Force plenty. The Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber is expected to be flying at Ellsworth AFB starting around 2025, if everything goes as planned , gradually phasing out and replacing B-1s sooner than later. The B-21s certainly has large shoes to fill, but from the outset of recent acquisitions such as the F-35, the Air Force has placed a strong emphasis on ease of maintenance and reliability, whether or not that will actually materialize is another question altogether. B-1 retirements are scheduled to begin in 2032 and go through 2038. What will the B-1’s golden years look like? With all the work being done at Tinker to keep B-1s able to fly until 2040 and the recently implemented flight restrictions, it appears that the B-1 fleet will be handled with deliberate gentleness. Tyler Rogoway With all this in mind, enjoy seeing B-1s at air shows while you can. As of February 2020, the Air Force is already telling Congress it’s unwilling to pay for sustainment and structural improvement costs for 17 of the 62 B-1s and wants to send them to the boneyard at Davis Monthan AFB by the end of the year. It will either be forced by lawmakers to pay for keeping the bombers flying or the sunset years of the B-1 fleet will consist of 45 of the original 100. However many are left, they will be carefully operated and delicately maintained to last as long as needed. One more unpredicted fleet-wide structural problem could be more than the Air Force wants to pay for and it is very possible the fleet could be drawn down before the current plans dictate, depending on how it actually ages. The pride of the B-1 universe has always been deeply rooted in its combat-proven ability to get whatever is asked of it done in the face of complex maintenance challenges. Inarguably, B-1s are very, very used. A day when the final B-1 flight will take place is now on the horizon and elaborate sustainment practices will be increasingly necessary to keep that date from coming to pass sooner than anyone currently wants.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2019",This Is How The Air Force Gets Its New Survival Rifle To Fit Under An Ejection Seat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has offered the first good look at how its new-ish GAU-5/A carbines squeeze in with other items inside a survival kit that the service’s pilots are now flying with under their ejection seats. The guns are converted standard M4 carbines with various new features, most notably a special locking system that allows users to break it down into two halves in 30 seconds or less and reassemble when necessary just as fast. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center released the picture of the carbine broken down inside its kit, along with four tan-colored 30-round magazines and other items, along with additional images of the gun assembled and disassembled on Feb. 14, 2020. Air Force gunsmiths at the Air Force Security Forces Center, situated at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, assembled 2,700 of these GAU-5/As, also known as Aircrew Self Defense Weapons (ASDW), to units across the service between February 2018 and January 2020, when it reportedly completed all of the planned deliveries. It’s interesting to note that this is 600 more guns than the Air Force expected to produce as of June 2018. “We were asked to design a stand-off weapon that was capable of hitting a man-size target at 200 meters,” Richard Shelton, Chief of the Gunsmith Shop, said in a statement for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Feb. 2020 story on the GAU-5/A. “It disconnects at the upper receiver, is located inside the seat kit [of ACES II ejection seats], and can be put together within 30 seconds if needed.” The GAU-5/A assembled., USAF The GAU-5/A broken down for storage in the survival kit., USAF The GAU-5/A, four magazines and other items packed into the survival kit., USAF Cry Havoc Tactical supplied the unique locking system that is at the heart of the converted carbines. They also feature a pistol grip that folds backwards to make them even more compact when stored inside the survival kit. The space limitations under the ACES II seat to mean that the survival kit isn’t big enough to accommodate a carbine with an optical sight mounted on it, meaning that pilots would only have the gun’s iron sights to aim with in an emergency situation. The gun otherwise handles almost identically to a standard M4 carbine. The fact that the GAU-5/A, which should not be confused with the Vietnam War-era AR-15/M16 variant with the same designation, is so very similar to the M4 and uses the same ammunition helps reduce training and logistics requirements. This appears to be one the core factors in Air Force’s decision to go with this gun over a more purpose-built personal defense weapon or survival rifle, which might have additional capabilities within the limitations of the space available. This is something The War Zone has discussed in-depth regarding this carbine in the past. Regardless, the Air Force had a clear requirement to give pilots additional firepower in the event that they got shot down after Jordanian Air Force pilot Moaz Al Kasasbeh bailed out over a then-ISIS-controlled area of Syria in December 2014. The terrorists captured and murdered Kasasbeh, which prompted the service to begin squeezing Vietnam-era GAU-5/As into certain survival kits . Before then, pilots only had their standard M9 pistols to rely on if they had to bail out over hostile territory. Other members of the international coalition fighting ISIS followed suit, with the Dutch Air Force notably issuing a 9mm machine pistol to its pilots. An airman assembles a GAU-5/A., USAF The Air Force says that it spent approximately $2.6 million to both craft the complete conversion and field the guns. While we don’t know what the base unit price per gun was without the development costs factored in, this works out to just under $963 each. It’s not clear whether or not the service purchased entirely new guns to convert or used existing M4s, but the latter course of action seems much more likely and cost effective. Cry Havoc’s website says the price of a basic conversion kit to add the takedown locking system to any AR-15/M16 type gun, which offers for sale the public, as well, is $349. The full cost of the complete GAU-5/A “weapon system” may factor in the four magazines and other items that go along with them into the survival kit, too. We also don’t know all of the units that have received GAU-5/As and what aircraft they are flying now with the new survival kits. United Technologies Aerospace Systems’ ACES II seat is used in the F-15C/D Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Viper, and F-22 Raptor Combat jets, as well as the A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft and the B-1B Bone and B-2 Spirit bombers. In May 2019, the 366th Fighter Wing, which is based Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho and flies F-15E Strike Eagles, announced that it had begun flying with the new survival kits containing GAU-5/As. We also know that F-22 pilots from the 3rd Wing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska began training with the guns last year. A member of the 3rd Wing trains with a GAU-5/A in 2019., USAF In addition, we know that 2,700 of these guns are now in service across the Air Force, tucked away inside compact survival kits under pilots’ ejection seats.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mojave Air and Space Port is truly a wondrous place filled with cutting-edge aviation treasure . Case in point, just earlier today, aviation photographer Jack Beyer snapped a series of shots of a bizarre-look and remarkably large vertical takeoff and landing drone that was being towed across the field. The insect-like craft appears to have four horizontally-mounted propellers and one push propeller at its rear. These qualities, along with the high stance of its streamlined four fixed landing gear and what appears to be a payload handling system on its belly, point to this craft being a cargo hauler capable of landing pretty much anywhere. See the update at the bottom of the post for the latest information on this highly intriguing flying machine. VTOL aircraft, especially electrically/hybrid-powered ones (eVTOL) similar to this, which are based on personal mobility concepts , are one of aviation’s fastest moving, but largely unproven sectors . The VTOL cargo space is somewhat narrower, with one company immediately coming to mind: Elroy Air. Elroy Air has created a system it calls Chaparral that uses a hybrid-electric powerplant and will hopefully be capable of delivering up to 500 pounds of cargo over distances up to 300 miles. It is meant to be able to operate independently of any air travel infrastructure and seamlessly within congested airspace using a variety of onboard sensors and dynamic flight planning software. The company has just joined forces with Embraer’s forward-thinking business unit, EmbraerX, to further develop and potentially revolutionize point-to-point light cargo transportation. Elroy Air Elroy’s design is similar to the one seen in the photos, but it seems more likely that the drone in question is a competitor’s creation. According to Jack Beyer, the aircraft was on the runway near where Virgin Orbit’s Cosmic Girl 747 launcher aircraft was parked. It may have been doing some engine runs and once the activity was wrapped up, the strange craft was towed away to an area out of sight. Jack Beyer Jack Beyer Jack Beyer Jack Beyer Jack Beyer Jack Beyer Jack Beyer Jack Beyer The craft has some sort of heart-like logo on its tails which also may help us identify its owner. So lend us a hand, let’s figure out what this aircraft is and who it belongs to! Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. UPDATE: This story just got way more interesting. This aircraft wears the registration N871YT , which belongs to Toyota. A Redditor got a much closer look at the strange aircraft a couple of days ago. As one commenter notes, Toyota is working on a project with eVTOL outfit Joby , this may be related to that or another project altogether. It gets even more intriguing in that the logo on the drone’s tail is the same as the one on their hydrogen-fueled truck program named Project Portal, which points to the possibility that this aircraft may actually run off of a hydrogen-electric system. UPDATE: Here is the statement from Toyota following our inquiry: “ While we generally refrain from commenting about specific research programs, we will say that this program is unrelated to Joby or UPS. At Toyota we are creating better ways to move…across town or across the room. As we look toward the future, we’re also expanding our horizons beyond the design and sale of great vehicles to develop products that address mobility challenges for everyone.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 3, 2020",China’s Y-20 Airlifters Make Crisis Debut Bringing Medics And Cargo To Virus Plagued Wuhan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force, or PLAAF, has conducted a large airlift operation to bring medics and other humanitarian supplies to the city of Wuhan, which is the epicenter of a massive outbreak of a novel coronavirus that began late last year. The force included six of the PLAAF’s newest Y-20 airlifters , as well as other aircraft. This comes amid growing criticism, within the country and among the international community, of how authorities have handled the epidemic, which has killed at least 1,355 people in China. The PLAAF aircraft arrived at Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan on Feb. 13, 2020. In addition to the six Y-20s, three Russian-made Il-76s and two Chinese-built Y-9s also ferried in medical personnel and other cargo. Chinese state media said that the country’s Central Military Commission, China’s top military body and technically the military wing of the Chinese Communist Party, ordered the airlift. The airlift force brought 947 personnel and 47 tons of cargo to Wuhan. A total of approximately 1,400 military medical personnel arrived in the city, including via ground transport, according to state media reports . Chinese authorities plan to eventually deploy 2,600 medics from across the People’s Liberation Army to the city, where they will help overwhelmed hospitals treat patients with the new strain of coronavirus, known formally as COVID-19. This will bring the total number of PLA medical personnel in Wuhan to approximately 4,000. An interesting look inside the main cargo bay of one of the Y-20 airlifters the PLAAF sent to Wuhan., Chinese internet The Y-20, which first entered operational service in 2016, can reportedly carry a maximum payload, including both personnel and cargo, of 132,000 pounds. The Il-76s that the PLAAF also sent to Wuhan have a payload capacity of up to 96,000 pounds. The Y-9s, which are four-engine turboprops rather than jet-powered like the Y-20s and Il-76s, can each carry up to 50,000 pounds of cargo. The employment of the Y-20 specifically is notable given how heavily the People’s Liberation Army has promoted it as a major development that has significantly expanded its abilities to conduct large-scale airlift operations inside and outside of China. It’s unclear exactly how many of these aircraft the Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation has built so far. Exclusive satellite imagery The War Zone obtained in December 2019 showed at least 20 of these planes in various states of completion at Yanliang Air Base, which is also home to Xi’an and elements of China’s Flight Test Establishment. One of the six Y-20s and the three Il-76s are seen at Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan on Feb. 13, 2020., Xinhua/Li Yun However, the Y-20, very loosely analogous to the U.S. Air Force’s C-17A Globemaster III airlifter, remains hobbled in many respects by the lack of a modern, high-bypass turbofan engine to power it. At present, the domestically-developed high-bypass WS-20 turbofan, which is supposed to replace the existing Russian-made low-bypass Soloviev D-30KP-2s on the Y-20s, isn’t expected to enter production until 2024 at the earliest. Regardless, the operation in Wuhan does give the PLA, which has a general dearth of real-world combat experience, an opportunity to actually carry out a major airlift in a more complex, if non-combat environment. Chinese state media itself has been quick to tout that this is the first outing for the Y-20 specifically “ in non-military action .” Realistically, it appears to also be the first time the planes have been employed in response to an actual contingency of any kind. The COVID-19 first began in Wuhan in December 2019. It quickly spread to the rest of Hubei province, where the city is located, and elsewhere in China. Cases of the virus have since popped up in at least 23 other countries. However, China has, by far, seen the highest total number of infections, as well as deaths. On Feb. 13, authorities in Hubei province revised their reporting methods and announced that there were actually 14,840 additional cases and had been 242 more deaths than were previously known. In total, since December, almost 60,000 people in China have contracted the virus and 1,355 people have died. At the time of writing, there have only been two confirmed deaths outside of China – one in the Philippines and one in Japan – and less than 500 reported cases overall. Chinese authorities have put Wuhan, as well as a number of other cities, under a near-total lockdown for weeks now in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. The spread of COVID-19 as of Feb. 12, 2020., WHO As such, the airlift into Wuhan also appears to be a very public attempt on the part of the Chinese government to demonstrate its commitment to tackling the epidemic amid increasing complaints about its handling of events. This criticism has even begun to come from within China, with an especially notable outpouring of anger following the death of Dr. Li Wenliang earlier this month. Li had tried to raise the alarm about how dangerous COVID-19 was last year, but authorities subsequently sent police to his home to order him to remain quiet about the virus. The airlift also follows a notable recent shakeup in the leadership in Hubei, including the replacement of the province’s Communist Party boss and its health commissioner. It comes amid reports of the limited response from the People’s Liberation Army, despite its apparent extensive capabilities to respond to the international military crises and humanitarian ones, as well. On Feb. 6, 2020, Defense One had published a detailed accounting of PLA support to the response to COVID-19, based on publicly available information, which noted that the first military medical units had only arrived in Wuhan almost a month after the outbreak began. That piece, which is worth reading in full, also said: “They arrived in relatively small numbers: three medical teams were reported to have been sent from Shanghai, Chongqing and Xi’an, totaling 450 personnel . The subsequent lack of any major following deployment was striking, especially as needs ranged from supply to construction, such that regime officials even turned to making false claims of building hospitals in record time.” “The PLA’s relative lack of response is even more puzzling given that Wuhan is home to major military units that should be capable of deploying to a contingency. These include the Joint Logistics Support Base [联合保障中心], notionally the center of the PLA Logistic Support Force’s network of warehouses and stockpiles). According to China’s 2019 defense white paper , the PLA Joint Logistic Support Force ‘comprises the support forces for inventory and warehousing, medical services, transport, force projection, oil pipelines, engineering and construction management, reserve assets management, and procurement.'” “The timing was also noteworthy. Despite the base in Wuhan, and theoretically at least, a streamlined ability to flow units into and out of the province, the PLA Logistics Support Force only established a ‘response and coordination mechanism’ on Jan. 26th, almost a month after the virus began to spread and 15 days after it was officially acknowledged. Even then, official reporting on this ‘mechanism’ describes it as offering communications and funding capabilities, rather than distributing stockpiles, delivering aid, or mobilization of hospitals under its management.” The Defense One piece also specifically highlighted the absence of the Y-20s, and the PLAAF, in general, from the already limited military response efforts. Overall, the PLA’s involvement in the crisis remains very small compared to its size and resources. However, the airlift, together with the leadership reshuffle, may well point to change in how authorities plan to try to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak going forward. There are already some other indications of shifting policies at the highest levels in recent days, including the decision to allow a team from the World Health Organization to come in and help investigate the origins of the epidemic and what can be done to stem it. Beijing had rejected WHO offers for weeks and is still declining similar offers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. However exactly the Chinese response to COVID-19 continues to evolve in the coming weeks and months remains to be seen, but there is a definite possibility that we may now see increasing PLA involvement, including PLAAF airlifters, such as the Y-20.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 27, 2019",Watch This U-2 Spy Plane Make A Crazy Landing Without Its Flaps Or Speed Brakes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has appeared online showing a U.S. Air Force U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane landing at RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom without the help of its flaps or speed brakes. The same clip also shows another U-2S touching down normally from the exact same perspective, offering an interesting comparison of the two landing profiles. Twitter user and plane spotter @Saint1Mil recently captured both U-2Ss landing at RAF Fairford and shared the footage online. The U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane is notoriously difficult to land under the best conditions, in large part due to the copious amount of lift its wings produce to its landing gear configuration, with only a pair of wheels in the center fuselage and smaller pair of wheels under the tail. The U.S. Air Force notably utilizes pilots driving chase cars on the ground to help get the aircraft down on the ground safely after each mission. The first U-2S lands as normal with its flaps and speed-brakes deployed. It touches down relatively quickly with the chase car racing behind it. On an unrelated note, the chase car seen in the following video appears to be one of two white Dodge Chargers that the Air Force airlifted to the United Kingdom to support Dragon Lady operations last year at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars, something you can read about in this past War Zone story . The second Dragon Lady comes in with its flaps still retracted and the speed brakes closed. As one of the commenters on @Saint1Mil’s Tweet noted, this landing had to be at a higher speed and much flatter to make up for the lack of ability to slow down without a dangerous loss of lift and stability. You can hear what appears to be the pilot actually increasing the throttle for a moment as the plane flies over the camera. The more typical pitching up, or flaring, right before landing that is visible in the first U-2S landing, would have made it difficult, if not impossible to land under these conditions. As it is, you can see the second Dragon Lady have an exceptionally hard time actually sticking the landing and staying on the ground. The full landing run is notably longer overall. All of this is very understandable given the aircraft’s overall design. Even the wings on the original U-2s, which were shorter than those on the present U-2S models, were exceptionally efficient and the type’s first flight, on Aug. 1, 1955, at Area 51, was accidental . The plane was only supposed to conduct a high-speed taxi test, but it left the ground after Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier tried out the ailerons with the aircraft traveling at around 70 knots. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1-CeBS2EFWM “I had no intentions whatsoever of flying. I immediately started back toward the ground, but had difficulty determining my height because the lakebed had no markings to judge distance or height,” LeVier subsequently said, according to a now-declassified CIA history of the U-2 program. “I made contact with the ground in a left bank of approximately 10 degrees.” “The U-2 bounced back into the air, but LeVier was able to bring it back down for a second landing,” the previously secret history added. “He then applied the brakes with little effect, and the aircraft rolled for a long distance before coming to a stop.” All told, with the U-2 already so finicky to land, to begin with, it’s not hard to see why the Air Force continues to train pilots on how to get the plane back down on the ground safely if an emergency keeps them from being able to extend the Dragon Lady’s flaps.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 27, 2020",The Claim That A New Cambodian Airfield Is Actually A Chinese Base Is Dubious At Best,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A widely circulated report from News.com.au, a division of News Corp Australia, was published on Feb. 8, 2020, and was subsequently parroted and shared all around the national security and defense online community. The story claims that an airfield that is under construction near Cambodia’s Dara Sakor Seashore Resort is actually a Chinese Air Base that will give China’s military greater reach throughout a critical and increasingly tense region. This all sounds fairly ominous and intriguing, but there is one problem, high-resolution satellite imagery exclusively obtained by The War Zone does not support such a bold claim. While it is possible that Chinese military aircraft will use the base when it is completed, we see no obvious signs of that at present. The News.com.au story stated in part: “Many of the aircraft turning bays are too small for large commercial airliners. Instead, they’re just right for fighter jets. And exactly why it needs to be 3400m [~11,155 feet] long is uncertain.” “That’s far larger than even the largest civilian airliners require to land or take off. There is no significant nearby population or industrial centre. And its enormous scale goes far beyond the needs of the languishing Koh Kong resort nearby.” This passage is littered with laughably reaching and flat-out inaccurate assumptions. A roughly 10,000-foot is not uncommon at airports that will be able to accommodate airliners, especially in an area of the world that experiences high temperatures year-round. The claim about the turning bays is also wrong. The distance from the runway edge to the turnout area’s outer edge is roughly 330 feet. This is ample room for any airliner or transport to make an about-face. For comparison, the turnout area at St. Maarten’s Princess Juliana International Airport , a famous Caribbean airstrip that hosts the largest of airliners and cargo aircraft, is roughly 300 feet wide, including the runway. The airfield’s turnout areas are very large and can accommodate any aircraft., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The under-construction airfield’s centralized apron could presumably be used to accommodate a number of aircraft of various sizes, from helicopters, to regular regional turboprop and jet traffic, to large international charter aircraft. There are no hangar bays or other notable aircraft support improvements erected at this time that would point to a specific use for the airfield, either. The apron itself is quite small by Chinese military airfield standards. Also, there aren’t any heavy security improvements or other features that point toward the base having some sort of primary military application. There is a road direct to it from the nearby luxury resort. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION In addition, a military airbase is not just built for fighters. A heavy logistics train would have to support those aircraft, including large transports and airliners, so the idea that a modern airfield would be just tailored for tactical fast jets and would not be able to accept larger aircraft is absurd and questions the writer’s knowledge on the subject and/or their sourcing. With all this in mind, yes, it is possible the Chinese have something to do with this new airfield. China is certainly looking to expand its military presence beyond its own borders and Cambodia already has a unique relationship with China in this regard. The resort and the large dock area nearby are part of a larger Chinese investment that is tied to the Belt And Road initiative, a soft-power economic effort to increase China’s general influence abroad. At the same time, it could just as easily be an airfield being built to support local tourism and other operations. Being able to bring airline, charter, and private air traffic directly to the luxury destination would be a huge advantage to seeing it prosper. In addition, any airfield can be potentially used for military purposes in a crisis, but if China makes it a practice of turning its foreign business investments into military capabilities, that would be pretty counter-productive to realizing future prospects.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The focus on fighter aircraft is also odd. The base presents even more utility for surveillance aircraft flights, including those by long-endurance unmanned aircraft, than short-range fighters. It could provide convenient access into the Andaman Sea, Bay of Bengal and Gulf Of Thailand, as well as fortifying China’s domain over the South China Sea . Persistent intelligence gathering, sea control, and long-range maritime targeting capabilities are more of a priority for the People’s Liberation Army than forward-staging tactical airpower in the region. SE Asia Map. Cambodia’s strategic location is somewhat relevant, but that doesn’t necessarily mean China is building an airbase there. , Cacahuate/wikicommons So, there you have it. While it is still very possible that China could be the end-user of this airfield and Beijing has some peculiar investments in the area, the original report was reckless with its assumptions and many who read and shared the article were far too accepting and unskeptical of those conclusions. Time will tell if the airport becomes a Chinese military outpost, but for now, it remains very much an unsolved mystery.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Many of the exact details about the incident are still unclear, but U.S. Air Force F-15 combat jets executed a show of force during a standoff between U.S. troops and a mob aligned with Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad at a checkpoint, which had spiraled into a brief gunbattle. That skirmish left one Syrian dead and an American with very minor injuries. A Russian military patrol that was in the area was also on the scene during the shooting, which follows weeks of similar standoffs between U.S. and Russian personnel in northeastern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition ostensibly fighting ISIS in both Syria and Iraq confirmed that the incident had occurred at a checkpoint near the town of Qamishli, which is situated right on the Syrian-Turkish border in Syria’s northeastern corner. Syrian state media said that the altercation had taken place specifically on a stretch of road in the village of Khirbet Ammu, to the east of Qamishli. The U.S. forces were traveling in a convoy in a mix of M-ATV and MRAP mine-resistant wheeled armored vehicles at the time.

That comes amid major questions about the U.S. military’s force posture in Syria, as a whole, and the future of the American military’s presence there.Â The skirmish near Qamishli also comes as Turkish forces and their local partners increasingly find themselves in open conflict with pro-Assad forces in western Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 8, 2019",A Swedish Air Force Gripen Fighter Jet Just Literally Bombed A Forest Fire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An unusually dry summer has touched off dozens of forest fires across Sweden, including in a number of hard to reach and potentially dangerous areas. To try and halt the spread of one blaze in and around a military training range in the municipality of Älvdalen, Swedish emergency management authorities took a novel approach – call in the country’s air force to bomb it. On July 25, 2018, a JAS 39C Gripen fighter jet from the Swedish Air Force’s F 17 wing dropped a single 500-pound class GBU-49/B Paveway precision-guided bomb on a part of the burning forest. The fire around the range has been burning for two weeks already, threatening nearby communities and forcing evacuations . “It’s an attempt to remove the oxygen from the fire, which is only a possibility because the fire is on a military shooting range,” Johan Szymanski, in charge of the response to the fire, said, according to state broadcaster SVT . “Our view is that the fire is unique and because of this we must use unconventional extinguishing methods.” The most immediate problem is that the range is potentially littered with unexploded ordnance, posing a hazard to firefighters on the ground. The danger is not just that individuals fighting the blaze might stumble across something and get injured, but that the intense heat from the fire might just set off any leftover shells or bombs. The video below shows the actual release of the GBU-49/B over the fire in Älvdalen. Swedish authorities halted the firefighting for a period on July 18, 2018, based on these concerns. According to Szymanski, there were rules limiting personnel from getting within half a mile of the training area. The emergency services turned to water bombing aircraft and helicopters instead.  Unfortunately, likely due to a lack of personnel on the ground to take advantage of the water drops and get the fire under control, these missions had little impact on the conflagration. “This was an attempt to solve a unique problem in a difficult-to-reach area,” Szymanski added. “Following the request … we found that an attempt could be made [to bomb the fire].” To be sure, the GBU-49/B , a dual-mode weapon with laser- and GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System (INS) guidance systems, would have allowed the Swedish Air Force to focus their attention on a very specific point. The weapon’s effects were also limited enough to avoid creating any additional fires. A Gripen carrying a full load of 2,000-pound class Paveway guided bombs with practice warheads., Saab It’s not clear whether the Swedish government will call for more of these firefighting strikes in the immediate future. Szymanski did say that the operation validated the concept and that he or his colleagues might consider doing it again in the future. It’s not the first time the Swedish military has employed actual weaponry to put out fires at this particular range, either. According to an official statement from the country’s Armed Forces, troops have used artillery fire to suffocate blazes in the past. The basic idea of suffocating a blaze with a large blast is hardly unheard of, either, and specialized personnel who fight oil well fires also use explosives in certain cases to extinguish the flames. In those cases, firefighters lower the improvised bombs into position using a crane or other piece of machinery, rather than dropping them from a plane, though. A Swedish Army Archer wheeled self-propelled howitzer., Ibaril via Wikimedia The idea of “bombing” a fire from the air isn’t entirely new, either. As early as the 1930s, the United States considered employing aircraft carrying canisters full of water or chemical retardants to attack forest fires, especially those that might be in difficult to access areas, quickly. After the end of World War II, what was still then the U.S. Army Air Forces began a new project to fully investigate the feasibility of this idea and developed various dedicated aerial forest firefighting weapons. The first of these were modified drop tanks filled with water and equipped with special “ variable time ” radar proximity fuzes to blow them open right above the fire. The service also crafted the T-29, a 40-pound TNT charge inside a paper shell with wooden fins at the rear to stabilize it as it fell to earth. Like the Swedish operation in Älvdalen, the goal was to choke off the oxygen supply to the fire with the blast. The bomb’s construction limited the potential for fragments to actually cause additional fires. Unfortunately, tests showed that the explosion itself was enough to ignite blazes, according to a 1948 U.S. Air Force Air University thesis on the topic of aerial forest firefighting. P-47 fighters and B-17 and B-29 bombers – some actually flying in U.S. Forest Service markings – took part in the experiments, dropping both types of weapons. The organization ultimately determined the T-29 was not a useful tool, but that the water bombs might be. Personnel load a water-filled drop tank onto a US Forest Service-marked P-47 fighter plane during a test., USAF Accuracy remained the limiting factor and the United States ultimately abandoned the project. Today, water bombing aircraft release make their runs at extremely low levels over the impacted area to best ensure they are on target, a type of flying that requires a not insubstantial amount of skill in of itself. Using a GBU-49/B would definitely solve the precision problem and allow. There continues to be a desire for more precise and rapid, stand-off forest firefighting tools given the immense risks the blazes can pose to personnel on the ground in general, even when they’re burning across military training areas. In 2014, Boeing filed a patent for a special artillery shell full of flame retardant chemicals that could allow personnel to rapidly saturate a particular area. It remains unclear if anyone is actively developing this concept. An image from Boeing’s patent for a firefighting artillery shell., USPTO Still, it’s unclear how practical air or artillery strikes against fires might be in the future from legal or regulatory perspectives. This latest case in Sweden avoided many of those questions since it occurred on a military-controlled training range to begin with. Swedish authorities, or government officials in any other country, would almost certainly be hesitant to approve this sort of operation on or around private land, especially near populated areas. At the same time, if a forest fire has already forced people to evacuate and threatens to destroy private property, all the parties involved might be more willing to consider this option, especially if other more traditional options seems impractical. The Swedes now have at least one data point to use as a starting point to further exploring the concept. With the fire in Älvdalen ongoing, and others still raging elsewhere in Sweden, we will definitely be keeping an eye out to see if officials call on the Swedish Air Force again to literally attack the blazes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 23, 2021",Help Us Decipher This Terrifying Video Of A Suicide Drone Flying Up An Armored Vehicle’s Ramp (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A frightening video has emerged showing what appears to be a suicide drone attack on a wheeled armored vehicle that is surrounded by personnel. The drone seems to be some rudimentary man-in-the-loop remote controlled setup with a fixed forward-facing video camera and a single front-mounted propeller. It catches the people milling around the center of the compound where the vehicles are congregated by surprise as it makes its dive, literally flying up the rear ramp of the armored vehicle before its video feed ominously cuts out. One of the topics I have been most passionate about over the years is the threat posed by low-end and now, in many cases, commercially available drones, as well as the Pentagon’s alarming lack of vision when it came to predicting their transformation into weapons. To get up to speed on this issue, take a look at these in-depth pieces of mine linked here and here . Israel largely pioneered this concept on a military-grade level, but it really emerged as a capability of non-state actors during the Battle Of Mosul. Fast forward to today and it is now a very hot topic served up with plenty of bad and sensationalist information by the mainstream media. Regardless, the presence of lower-end enemy drones is a near-daily issue that our troops deal with overseas. With this capability rapidly proliferating, the mysterious video below, which I first saw on a Russian language Twitter account , is disturbing, but sadly not all that surprising. I have to be clear, I have no idea what the background is on this video or if it is indeed authentic, although it certainly looks like it is after a close examination. Even the drone intermittently losing line-of-sight radio connectivity as it descends just feet off the ground looks accurate. It is possible that it could have been a friendly unmanned aircraft that malfunctioned, although that seems unlikely as it appears to be flown directly into the ramp of a targeted armored vehicle. Even recovering a small hand-launched drone in such a manner would be dangerous, but coincidences do happen. Otherwise, it could be some very well made fake that I am not familiar with, but that also seems improbable. The location of the video is unknown, but the vehicles may give us some clues. They appear to be similar to Stryker and LAV III Kodiak wheeled armored vehicles. The two designs are very closely related, with the Stryker serving with the U.S. and Thailand and the LAV III serving with Canada, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, New Zealand, and Thailand. Considering the setting and what happens in the video, it is nearly impossible for this attack to be involving Thailand, Colombia, or New Zealand. So, if indeed they are of the LAV III/Stryker family, it would seem that a U.S. or Saudi vehicle is being struck. The Kingdom has been in a brutal conflict with Houthi rebels in Yemen, a group that has leveraged suicide drones as a primary vengeance weapon over the last half-decade. The country’s lighter armor has definitely taken part in the fighting. Maybe we are seeing a group of Saudi soldiers in the drone’s video feed as it makes its terminal attack run. Meanwhile, the U.S. has deployed Strykers to major hot spots in the region in recent years, most notably in Northern Syria . We will need to take more time to analyze the video to better identify the vehicles involved as it is possible it is another type altogether. There are many types of wheeled armored vehicles in operation around the globe, many of which have similar features, but the rear area on the vehicle in the video looks very much like one of the two discussed above. So, with all this in mind, what do you think we are seeing here? We can only hope that the drone in question was a dud and all that was harmed was an armored vehicle’s hardened passenger compartment. Regardless, if this video is indeed authentic and does depict an attack, it is another stark reminder of how troops are operating in combat zones where air superiority is no longer assured and a fighter combat air patrols will not fix the problem. The U.S. military’s glaring short-range air defense gap has to be closed and the lack of foresight in regards to what was clearly a brewing threat has to be learned from so that it doesn’t happen again. Let’s get to the bottom of this mysterious and remarkably dramatic video. Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below or shoot me an email at the address posted. UPDATE: What amazing readers we have! I received so many emails, DMs, comments, and tweets regarding this video that varied widely as to what people thought they were seeing and why. These came from top industry professionals to just interested parties that wanted to share their thoughts. I also got some great leads on future stories from it. I can’t thank all of you enough. Ok, now onto the answer! This may be one of those wild coincidences that I mentioned above. There was some evidence regarding the configuration of this drone and some of those used in Yemen that have Iranian ties. Yet the most valid evidence I received was from a number of people that were familiar with one type of drone, in particular. It appears the drone in question might very well have been a Lockheed Desert Hawk III that either went haywire during recovery or that received inaccurate coordinates for recovery. Note the image below shows the Desert Hawk III type with the camera mounted on its left wing leading edge and a very similar collapsable prop. The video below also shows a similar data overlay arrangement to the one we see in the mystery video. The aircraft, which was created with help from the Skunk Works, is made primarily of polypropylene material and is designed to break apart on landing in such a way that it can be easily reassembled for flight. Desert Hawk III. Note the forward camera in the wing leading edge. , Lockheed Martin https://youtube.com/watch?v=0XR1ViWJpn0 As for when and where the video was shot, that remains unclear, although the video dates back to at least 2013, and possibly quite earlier. The user of the drone is also unclear, although the Royal Army was the biggest adopter of it. We continue to update this post as we find out more!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 5, 2020",The Navy Wants Money To Get Started On Its Future SSN(X) Attack Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is asking for funds to begin developing the requirements for an all-new attack submarine, now known as SSN(X), as well as examining associated technologies and concepts of operation, in its latest annual budget request. The fact that the service was interested in a new submarine focused primarily on attacking surface ships and other subs, akin to the original plan for its significantly truncated Seawolf class, first emerged more than a year ago. The Navy wants $1 million to begin very preliminary work on the SSN(X) program in its budget proposal for the 2021 Fiscal Year . The service is hoping to receive at least $1 million each year through the 2025 Fiscal Year, as well. The budget documents also note that this is a “new start” project that it should not be confused with the separate budget for “New Design SSN,” which pays for research and development related to the future blocks of the Virginia class attack submarine . It’s also important to note that Congress still has to approve the Navy’s request. “The U.S. Navy must produce and maintain a submarine fleet that is of sufficient capability to protect America from current and future threats,” the section on SSN(X) in the budget proposal explains. “SSN(X) is required to maintain a submarine force structure, and will be designed to counter the emerging threat posed by near peer adversary competition for undersea supremacy.” USN USN In recent years, the U.S. Navy has been outspoken about increases in Russian submarine activity in particular in the North Atlantic and the East Coast of the United States, concerns you can read about in more detail in these recent War Zone pieces . The service is also faced with dramatic increases in the size and capabilities of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, including its submarine forces , which is increasingly active across the Pacific, as well as other regions of the world. “Unlike the Virginia Class Submarine , which was designed for multi-mission dominance in the littoral, SSN(X) will be designed for greater transit speed under increased stealth conditions in all ocean environments, and carry a larger inventory of weapons and diverse payloads,” the budget request continues. “While SSN(X) will be designed to retain multi-mission capability and sustained combat presence in denied waters, renewed priority of the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission against sophisticated threats in greater numbers will influence the design trade space.” The first-in-class USS Virginia ., USN The Congressional Budget Office disclosed the first details about the Navy’s plans for a new attack submarine in a report in October 2018. At that time, CBO’s analysts said that the notional design would be similar in size to the first two examples of the Seawolf class and be faster, stealthier , and carry more torpedoes than existing Virginia class submarines. Block I through Block IV Virginias will all have a standard loadout of 37 Mk 48 heavyweight torpedoes . The larger Block V boats will have a larger load of 65 Mk 48s. The Seawolfs can carry up to 50 of these torpedoes. The Navy originally planned to buy 29 Seawolfs , but ultimately received just three, all of which are now heavily modified special-purpose submarines. The first-in-class USS Seawolf and the USS Connecticut have submerged displacements of around 9,100 tons, more than 1,000 tons that of Block I Virginias . The third Seawolf, USS Jimmy Carter , is 100 feet longer and displaces around 3,000 tons more on account of the addition of a highly specialized Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) section added to the hull. You can read more about this modification, which was part of broader changes to enable the boat to perform top-secret intelligence-gathering and espionage missions, in this previous War Zone piece . An infographic showing the capabilities contained with USS Jimmy Carter’s Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) hull section., USN The Navy’s latest budget documents make clear that it wants SSN(X) to have powerful networking capabilities, including the ability to share information with various other platforms, which could include unmanned undersea and surface vessels . The service has already been a pioneer in networking and sensor fusion capabilities, with hopes that it will eventually be able to link all of its ships, submarines, aircraft, and other assets. The budget request also interesting notes specifically that the new attack submarine will have to be able “to defend against threat UUVs [unmanned undersea vehicles].” The Navy does not name any particular systems that it is concerned that SSN(X) might encounter, but Russia and China are notably developing various UUVs. All of this notwithstanding, it is important to remember that the SSN(X) program is still very much in its infancy. The Navy’s budget proposal says its immediate priorities are on the development of firm requirements for the submarine, as well as conducting various studies into the projected available industrial base capabilities, cost of development and procurement, and concepts of operation for the new boats. The service will look to “conduct advanced technology development in the areas of speed, stealth, and survivability,” as well. There are still significant concerns about how much it might cost for the Navy to actually acquire a fleet of SSN(X) submarines in the future. Just how expensive the Seawolfs were, in the end, was a major factor in the decision to dramatically curtail how many the service ultimately bought. In the end, Seawolf and Connecticut each had a unit price of around $6 billion, in 2019 dollars. Along with the even more pricey Jimmy Carter , these remain the most expensive attack submarines ever built. The Seawolf class attack submarine USS Connecticut ., USN Back in 2018, CBO had questioned the validity of the Navy’s projection that it could buy SSN(X)s for around $3.1 billion each. The economies of scale from buying a larger fleet of submarines could help keep unit costs down, but the Navy is still talking about new, highly advanced design. In addition, the Navy is still facing difficulties in balancing its shipbuilding budgets against other priorities and continues to struggle to find a realistic path toward meeting the Congressionally-mandated goal of a total fleet of 355 ships and submarines. At the same time, with regards to submarine procurement specifically, the service is already staring down concerns about how any real cost growth in the acquisition of its already extremely expensive Colombia class ballistic missile submarines might impact future budgets. As it stands now, the Navy doesn’t expect to begin receiving any SSN(X)s until 2038 at the earliest. All told, the exact requirements for and concepts surrounding the SSN(X) will all but certainly morph and evolve as time goes on, but the Navy’s budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year makes clear that the service wants to move ahead with the development of its next attack submarine.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 5, 2021","Air Force Bails On Tri-Service Hypersonic Weapon Project As Army, Navy Ask For More Money","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to stop work on an air-launched missile that uses common unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , which remains under development for the U.S. Army and Navy. Both of those services are pushing ahead with plans to use that vehicle as the warhead on new ground and sea-launched weapons , respectively. The Navy wants to nearly double funding for its portion of the program in the next fiscal year. The Air Force first announced its desire to end the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon, or HCSW, which is pronounced “hacksaw,” on Feb. 10, 2010, as part of the rollout of the Pentagon’s proposed budget for the 2021 Fiscal Year. Lockheed Martin won the contract, which had an estimated value of up to $928 million, to develop HCSW in 2018. The Air Force had received more than $571 million, in total, for work on this hypersonic missile in the Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020 budgets. It’s important to note that Congress still has to approve the new plan to cancel HCSW. “Funding decreased due to higher Department of Defense and Air Force priorities to fund only one of the two Air Force hypersonic prototyping efforts,” an Air Force budget document explains as justification. The service is continuing with the development of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, which is pronounced “arrow.” The Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget request asks for just under $382 million for continued work on ARRW, almost $96 million more than it received for this program in the previous fiscal cycle. One of the service’s B-52 bombers carried a captive carry ARRW test article on a flight test for the first time last year. At present, the program’s goals for 2020 include the construction and test of this weapon’s rocket booster, which will be followed in 2021 by additional booster tests and the construction and test of a complete prototype missile. Details about the ARRW program and the Air Force’s future plans for it from the service’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal., USAF The primary difference between HCSW and ARRW is the design of the unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. HCSW’s design is a conical one based on the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) that the Army and Navy are developing for their ground-launched Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) and sea-launched Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) programs, respectively. ARRW will use a wedge-shaped glide vehicle derived from the design that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is working on as part of its Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. Concept art from DARPA’s earlier Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2 (HTV-2) program. The vehicle under development as part of the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program is reported to be a similar design., DARPA The Army developed this conical boost-glide vehicle design for its previous Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) program. The Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) vehicle is understood to be a similar design., US Army The conical design is seen as less risky, but also less capable in terms of both maneuverability and range than a wedge type vehicle. Both types share the same basic concept of operation, with a rocket booster propelling them to an optimal speed and altitude, after which they glide along a relatively level trajectory toward their targets at extreme speeds. As with ARRW, the B-52 is also intended to be the primary launch platform for HCSW, a flight test for which had been scheduled to occur in December 2020. It’s unclear whether or not that will now occur, as the Air Force has said that work on HCSW will still help inform other hypersonic developments. “The HCSW team pioneered significant advancements in hypersonic technology development and integration of existing, mature technologies for use in various hypersonic efforts across the Department of Defense, including Army, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency programs,” Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told Defense News on Feb. 10. “The HCSW team successfully met all developmental milestones. These advancements will serve to expedite the generation and demonstration of various hypersonic weapon capabilities in the near future.” The Air Force’s intention to cancel HCSW has not slowed Army and Navy interest in their conical boost-glide vehicle design or their respective complete weapon systems. Just the opposite. The Navy’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal requests a little over $1 billion for Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), up from $512 million in the 2020 Fiscal Year budget. The Army is looking to create an entirely new budget line for its Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) and is asking for just over $30 million in funding for that project in the upcoming fiscal cycle. USN USN USN USN USN The Navy is still planning to conduct another CPS flight test this year, which it expects to follow up with a joint flight test with the Army next year. The Army and Navy weapons will share a common booster and other features, along with the same conical boost-glide vehicle. As a conventional weapon, the Navy expects to deploy the CPS missile on its four Ohio class guided missile submarines, as well as its future Block V Virginia class attack submarines, the latter of which will feature four suitable large launch tubes as part of the integration of the so-called Virginia Payload Module (VPM). A future, conventionally-armed “ large payload submarine ” could potentially carry these weapons, as well. Part of the funding the Navy wants for CPS in Fiscal Year 2021 would go toward continuing work in support of eventually integrating the missile on the Block V Virginias . The Army plans to deploy the LRHW on a road-mobile launcher . The service’s Fiscal Year 2021 funding request for this program would go toward ” modeling, simulation and demonstrating of system components” and the goal is to “begin simulation of integration of subsystems and component technologies to optimize hypersonic weapon system performance” that year. The section of the Army’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal covering the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) program., US Army A US Army infographic showing the use of a common glide vehicle warhead and missile in its Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system, as well as the launcher and other particular elements that will be specific to the ground-launched weapon., US Army All told, the Air Force’s decision to abandon its HCSW program, while the Army and Navy continue with their related efforts, makes a certain amount of sense. HCSW and ARRW offer duplicative capabilities in many respects and, while the latter is more complex, DARPA is already funding risk reduction work in the form of the separate TBG program. At the same time, if ARRW runs into complications and delays, it is very possible that the Air Force could again shift its priorities and leverage the Army and Navy’s work on CPS and LRHW to develop a HCSW-like interim system. Beyond that, Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for both CPS and LRHW and has already left the door open for possibly restarting the HCSW program in the future. “No layoffs are planned given the magnitude of work we have and if the Government should decide to restart, we will be ready,” Lockheed Martin told CNBC on Feb. 10. All told, the Air Force’s decision to halt work on HCSW, at least for the time being, seems to be a reasonable one in light of the new, relatively flat defense budget. Regardless, hypersonic weapons , as well as defenses to shield against foreign designs , clearly remain a high priority across the U.S. military. If ARRW runs into trouble, or the service’s budget priorities shift once again, it may well turn out that reports of the death of this particular hypersonic weapon program were premature.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was something many of us saw as a near-certain eventuality, the Navy has formally announced that it wants to retire its first four Littoral Combat Ships. Split evenly across both the Freedom and Independence classes of the failed Littoral Combat Ship concept , the oldest of the vessels was commissioned just 12 years ago, the youngest a mere six years ago. Yes, you read that right—six years ago! The troublesome fleet within a fleet has been serving as a training and test force , a dubious role from the start that the Navy says isn’t even needed anymore. Giving up on the vessels as front line ships began a few years ago as part of a restructuring plan that was initiated as the program became increasingly mired in technological and logistical turmoil. It can’t be overstated just how stunning an admission this is for a service that is desperately trying to find a way to reach its 355 ship fleet goal in the coming years. Retiring four youthful vessels does not vibe with this strategy, at least on paper. It serves as a clear indication of just how bad the first four of these vessels truly are and it serves as another reminder of how the Navy is coming to terms with the LCS debacle after years of being in denial. The news of the planned divestiture came as part of the Pentagon’s briefings on the department’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request. The justification behind the move reads as such in the Navy’s budget highlights briefing book: Navy decommission the first four LCS ships. These ships have been test articles and training assets, and were key in developing the operational concepts leading to the current deployment of LCS ships today. But cancelling their modernization allows us to prioritize lethality and survivability where we need it and in the mission packages assigned ships that will fill the roles of Surface Warfare (SUW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Mine Countermeasures (MCM) going forward… I have set up a clip in which you can watch Rear Admiral Randy Crites’ comments on what is bound to be a very controversial new plan to flush LCS-1 through LCS-4 out of the fleet by clicking here. LCS-2 and LCS-1. , USN Now that the Navy is admitting that it isn’t even worth keeping the four ships, which are uniquely configured and problem-prone, around for training and experimentation duties, where they will end up is anyone’s guess. At this point, they could be mothballed, picked for parts, and eventually meet the scrapper’s torch. On the other hand, maybe an ally will be willing to take one or two of them on for a very good price. A lot of you are probably saying “give them to the Coast Guard!” I would bet heavily that the Coast Guard doesn’t want them and that service is already cash-strapped as it is. Adding these anchors to their bottom line would be a move in the wrong direction. Using one for a SINKEX drill would be quite interesting as both types’ survivability has long been in question, especially due to the widespread use of aluminum in their construction and their overall lower design standards than their more hardy dock mates. Seeing what real weaponry does to either of the designs could be beneficial, but doing so may be a bit too ironic and damning of a pill for the Navy swallow. Keep in mind that Congress still has to approve this remarkably frank choice by the Navy.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 5, 2020",New Pentagon Map Shows Huge Scale Of Worrisome Russian and Chinese Naval Operations,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has released a map showing areas of increased Russian and Chinese naval activities, as well as the locations of major undersea cables , around the world as part of its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year. This is perhaps the most granular detail on these subjects that the U.S. government has provided to date after years of warning about the threats that these patrols, especially by Russian submarines , pose to American national interests. Just last week, we reported that a senior U.S. Navy officer stated that Russian submarine sorties had become such an issue that the service no longer treats the East Coast of the United States as “uncontested” and would no longer view it as a guaranteed “safe haven” in a crisis. The U.S. military released the annotated map in a 134-page overview report accompanying its 2021 Fiscal Year budget proposal. The graphic is part of a section describing new and emerging security concerns, especially with regards to so-called “great power competitors,” such as the Russians and the Chinese. The Trump Administration does not appear to have included any similar map in the documentation that went along with its previous budget requests for the 2018, 2019, or 2020 Fiscal Years. “We continue to see increased reliance on the maritime system, with maritime traffic increasing four-fold over the last 2 decades; 90 percent of all global goods being shipped, and new trades routes opening to the north,” the document explains. “Almost the entire internet and trillions of dollars in trade are carried today on a largely unsecure network of undersea cables.” “Overall, the maritime system is more heavily used, more stressed and more contested than ever before,” it continues. The map showing Russian and Chinese naval activity, as well as the location of major undersea cables., DOD Though the map does not say what time period it covers and or what types of naval vessels were necessarily present in specific locations and when, it does confirm that there has been notable Russian naval activity off the coast of the southeastern United States, as well as in the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean, in recent years. It also shows notable operations in Russia’s Arctic region , an area that is becoming increasingly strategically important . Russian naval vessels also follow clear transit routes in the Atlantic, as well as the Pacific, according to the map. There is one main route between the waters off the coast of Portugal and Spain and the Southeastern United States and the Caribbean , not surprisingly mainly around Cuba , with branches that also run from the North Atlantic to the northern coast of South America and between the Gulf of Guinea in Africa and the northeast tip of Brazil. What is perhaps most striking is the relative density of Russian naval activity around the United States, and even around Russia’s own shores, compared to that of Chinese maritime operations in the South China Sea and other areas of the Western Pacific . China also has a very active presence in the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic northwest of the Bering Strait, north of Russia’s Far East regions, according to the map. This, overall, is a clear reflection of the explosive growth in the size and capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, something The War Zone has discussed on multiple occasions . “Our global competitors continue to grow their naval forces, and they are expanding their areas of operations and collaboration with each other,” the budget overview report says. ” We simply have a lot more to protect from increasingly capable maritime adversaries who will present challenges to our economic security and indeed, our very way of life.” This newly released map from the Pentagon gives us one of our first good looks at the scope and scale of these concerns, which are only likely to expand in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 19, 2020",Iran Touts Big Ballistic Missile And Lightweight Solid Fuel Rocket Motor Leaps,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has unveiled a new short-range ballistic missile, the Raad 500, which it says it both lighter and has a longer range than similar existing weapons in the country’s arsenal. A new, lightweight, solid-fuel rocket motor, which also offers added reliability and flexibility over liquid fuel types, is at the heart of the design, technology that Iranian officials say they plan to utilize in other ballistic missiles, as well as space launch vehicles , in the future. Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) showed off the Raad 500, along with its Zohair rocket motor, also written Zoheir, during a televised ceremony on Feb. 9, 2020. IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami and Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the IRGC’s Aerospace Force, also revealed the Salman rocket motor, which is a derivative of the Zohair they said was intended for space launch vehicles. As its name suggests, the Raad 500 reportedly has a range of 500 kilometers, or approximately 310 miles. This is more than twice that of the solid-fuel Fateh-110 , one of the more ubiquitous short-range ballistic missile designs presently in Iranian service. Iran already has a longer-range derivative of the Fateh-110 family, Zulfiqar , which reportedly has a range of just under 435 miles. However, the IRGC also says that the Raad 500 is half the weight of the Fateh-110, which gives it a significantly greater power-to-weight ratio than the previous design. The Zohair rocket motor appears to be the key factor in achieving these improvements. It uses a wound filament case, rather than a metal one, substantially reducing its weight. Video footage from the event suggests that the Raad 500’s overall body may be of a similar and equally lightweight construction. All of this means that the rocket motor has to propel less weight, translating to a longer range. This, in turn, would allow Iranian forces to employ these missiles at targets that are outside the range of the existing Fateh-110 or even Zulfiqar, or fire these weapons from sites deeper within Iran making it harder for an opponent to monitor those activities or attempt to launch a pre-emptive strike before a launch. Missiles with solid-fuel rocket motors , rather than liquid fuel ones, are already safer to handle and easier to prepare to fire. It also increases the available payload capacity, which could allow for larger and more complex warheads. The IRGC says that the Raad 500 has a maneuverable re-entry vehicle on top, which would increase the weapon’s accuracy. With an appropriate guidance package, such as one including an imaging infrared sensor, it could also potentially engage slowly moving targets, such as aircraft carriers and large warships. In 2018, Iran had unveiled a version of the Fateh-110, the Fateh Mobin , which it claimed was an anti-ship variant. The threat of Iranian ballistic missile barrages already represents a known threat to foreign naval activites, especially those of the United States, in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, and the strategic Strait of Hormuz that links those two bodies of water together. https://youtube.com/watch?v=brzuTdFS4ZQ Iran already has a substantial arsenal of ballistic missile types, including both solid and liquid-fuel designs. It has increasingly shown a willingness to employ these weapons. Most recently, in January 2020, the IRGC launched unprecedented ballistic missile strikes aimed at American troops in Iraq in retaliation for the U.S. government’s decision to kill Qasem Soliemani, then head of Iran’s Quds Force, in Baghdad that same month. Iran employed variants or derivatives of the solid-fuel Fateh-110, possibly Zulfiqars, as well as Qiam liquid fuel short-range ballistic missiles, in those strikes. U.S.-Iranian tensions had already been building for months and remain high . The benefits of the wound filament motors and other rocket components, as well as new and advanced solid-fuel rocket motors, could easily be applied to derivatives of other existing Iranian ballistic missile designs to give them enhanced capabilities. They could also lead to the development of all new missiles. The IRGC said that Salman rocket motor, which is related to the Zohair, but has a thrust vectoring capability, would go into a new, future space launch vehicle. Thrust vectoring could also have applications for offensive weapons. The IRGC’s public acknowledgment of a link between technology developed for Iran’s ballistic missiles and space launch rockets for its ostensible civilian space program is notable in of itself. Iranian authorities for years have denied accusations from various countries, especially the United States and Israel , that its space launch developments are a cover for work on longer-range ballistic missiles. The technology required for ballistic missile and space launch vehicles is not entirely the same, but they do share various physical components and technical experience from one can inform research and development into the other. Though there is no indication that the two events were directly related, the IRGC rolled out the Raad 500, Zohair, and Salman following the country’s third failed attempt to put a satellite into orbit in just over a year . Iranian officials claimed that the liquid-fueled Simorgh space launch vehicle functioned as intended in this latest case, but that the satellite onboard failed to reach orbit. Iran has described the launch as a partial success that provides valuable data and experience for future space launch developments. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SIj7in01boc It’s also interesting to note that North Korea, which, like Iran, is also subject to extensive international sanctions, has made significant strides in the development of solid-fuel rocket motor and wound filament rocket component technology in recent years. While, at present, there is no evidence of Pyongyang’s involvement in the development of the Raad 500, Iran’s liquid-fuel Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missile, which emerged in 2017 , is very similar visually to the North Korean BM-25 , also known as the Hwasong-10. There are also links between the two countries in the design of other missiles, as well as space launch vehicles. Regardless of the exact origins of the technology, the Raad 500 shows clearly that Iran continues to invest substantial resources, despite crippling sanctions, into its ballistic missile programs. It also shows that those efforts are producing significant results, despite Iran’s often laughable propaganda surrounding claimed military and other technological achievements . It’s not clear how close the Raad 500 may be to representing a real, operational capability for Iran, but it, along with the Zohair and Slaman rocket motors, are indicators that more major Iranian missile, as well as space launch vehicle, developments are on the horizon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2020","No, The United States Doesn’t Have An Automatic “Dead Hand” Trigger For Its ICBMs","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent Air Force Magazine article has caused something of a stir after it highlighted systems and procedures that the U.S. Air Force employs to ensure it can still launch its Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, if necessary, even if personnel in individual missile alert facilities are incapacitated for some reason. At first glance, it might appear that the United States has something of a “Dead Hand” arrangement to fire these world-ending weapons, drawing comparisons to systems the Soviet Union reportedly employed and that present-day Russia apparently still uses. However, a closer look at the American protocols shows the system is place is far from automatic and still has a number of checks and balances to prevent an inadvertent missile launch . Air Force Magazine ‘s Rachel S. Cohen included the mention of the need for watchstanders in missile alert facilities to routinely enter a “stand down” command into their control consoles in a recent story on Air Force Missileers. The publication of the piece followed the launch of an unarmed Minuteman III from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California as part of a routine test of the missile’s accuracy and reliability. The inert re-entry vehicle splashed down as intended some 4,200 miles away in the Pacific Ocean at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. At present, the Air Force’s three Missile Wings oversee 400 Minuteman IIIs in silos spread across Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota. Another 278 missiles are in inventory for testing and other purposes. Missileers stand watch in hardened underground alert facilities in the missile fields 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. “The Airmen also spend their time on routine inspections and sending messages to others in the operation and to the ICBM itself. Missileers must give the weapon system what is essentially a “stand-down” order every six hours,” Air Force Magazine ‘s Cohen wrote in her recent piece . “If they don’t respond to that prompt within 10 minutes, the missiles will assume that its human operators are dead, and start looking for a launch command from one of the Pentagon’s nuclear mission control aircraft.” For this description, it might seem as if the missile alert facility’s systems would begin initiating a launch sequence on its own if the operators were to miss one of the four prompts they get every day to let the computers known they’re still alive. However, the reality is far less extreme. Missileers assigned the 90th Missile Wing, headquartered at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, train in a launch control center within a missile alert facility., USAF What the Air Force Magazine piece is describing is that missile alert facilities have a built-in backup arrangement where, if it appears that the human operators are no longer capable of performing their duties, it goes into a mode where it cuts them out of the launch sequence. However, it still needs to receive a valid launch code from an outside source and will not automatically fire any missiles on its own. The U.S. military does have a fleet of E-6B Mercury airborne command post aircraft equipped with the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS), which you read about in more detail in past War Zone here and here , that do have the capability to remotely trigger a launch under various circumstances, something that is publicly known. They’re not flying around sending out launch codes by default, though. “There are ZERO ABNCPs [airborne command posts] in the air to respond to an inquiry,” Robert Hopkins, a retired Air Force pilot and historian, wrote on Twitter. “ANY other [missile alert facility] capsule can respond, and failure to respond DOES NOT trigger a launch. It escalates inquiries.” It’s also important to note that, in 1991, then-President George H.W. Bush ended the practice of keeping both nuclear-armed bombers and missile alert facilities on a 24-hour alert status that kept a number of them actively poised to strike targets in the Soviet Union and elsewhere at a moments notice. Today, the Air Force has a policy of so-called “ open ocean targeting ,” whereby its Minuteman IIIs are, by default, pointed at open areas of the sea, specifically to prevent a catastrophe from an accidental launch. During an actual crisis, personnel would need to re-target these weapons before firing them. Today, the primary role of America’s ICBM force within the country’s nuclear triad is to act as as a “sponge” to “soak up” an opponent’s warheads, which could otherwise be employed against other targets. This has long called into question its basic utility, Dead Hand or not, especially when considering the costs of maintaining and modernizing it, something The War Zone has highlighted in the past. With regards to this prompt that Missileers get every six hours, it, like so many things about the Minuteman III ICBMs and their launch control systems , it seems like a holdover from the Cold War. President Bush’s 1991 decision to end the standing nuclear alert also led to the decommissioning of the AN/DRC-8 Emergency Rocket Communications System (ERCS). First introduced in 1963, this system consisted of a UHF signal repeater, capable of broadcasting an “Emergency Action Message” – something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece – with a launch code, on top of a rocket. The Blue Scout test and space launch rocket was employed until 1968, when modified Minuteman IIIs took over this role. During a nuclear attack, the Air Force could fire rockets with the AN/DRC-8, if necessary, which would then fly very low in space across the missile fields broadcasting the launch code. If the operators in the missile alert facilities down below were dead or otherwise incapacitated, one would imagine that the backup system in place would have then received the code and carried out the launch sequence automatically. A UHF signal repeater payload from the Emergency Rocket Communications System, now on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force., Kelly Michals via Flickr Again, as is the case today with the E-6Bs, there still would have had to have been an active decision to employ the ERCS, to begin with. Starting in 1967, EC-135 Looking Glass airborne command post aircraft, the predecessors to the E-6B Mercuries, also entered service to supplement the ERCS. The very idea of an actual automatic “Dead Hand” trigger that could launch a massive nuclear retaliatory strike in the absence of a functioning human-operated command and control system, has been a controversial topic of discussion for decades because of the obvious concerns about possible accidents and malfunctions. Starting in the 1960s, the Soviet Union reportedly began work on possible Dead Hand triggers, which eventually resulted in the development and fielding of a system called Perimeter . There are relatively few publicly known details about Perimeter to this day, but from what is known, it is very similar to the American ERCS, right down to including a rocket carrying a system to communicate a launch command to the country’s strategic missile forces down below. There is a debate about just how automated Perimeter is or isn’t. For years, experts and scholars described it as an entirely automatic arrangement, akin to the famous fictional “Doomsday Machine” in Stanley Kubrick’s iconic 1964 Cold War black comedy Dr. Strangelove . https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozg7gEchjuM “In a crisis, military officials would send a coded message to the bunkers, switching on the dead hand,” a 1993 New York Times story said. “If nearby ground-level sensors detected a nuclear attack on Moscow, and if a break was detected in communications links with top military commanders, the system would send low-frequency signals over underground antennas to special rockets.” However, David Hoffman, a longtime journalist, offered details suggesting it was much less automatic in his 2009 book Dead Hand : The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy and in subsequent interviews. Stories had already begun to emerge by that point that indicated that Perimeter was actually more “semi-automatic” in its functionality, just like its American counterpart. “They [the Soviets] thought that they could help those leaders by creating an alternative system so that the leader could just press a button that would say: I delegate this to somebody else. I don’t know if there are missiles coming or not. Somebody else decide,” he told NPR ‘s Terry Gross in 2009. “If that were the case, he [the Soviet leader] would flip on a system that would send a signal to a deep underground bunker in the shape of a globe where three duty officers sat. If there were real missiles and the Kremlin were hit and the Soviet leadership was wiped out, which is what they feared, those three guys in that deep underground bunker would have to decide whether to launch very small command rockets that would take off, fly across the huge vast territory of the Soviet Union and launch all their remaining missiles. A control room at nuclear missile base outside of Moscow in 1992., Robert Wallis/Corbis via Getty Images Still, even though the United States, and Russia, based on the most recent reporting, do not have automatic nuclear “Dead Hands” in place, the concept continues to a topic of interest. Deterrence theory relies explicitly on a country maintaining a credible “second strike” capability to respond to hostile nuclear strikes, no matter how devastating they might be. Right now, in the U.S. military, the Navy’s fleet of Ohio class ballistic missile submarines armed with Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles form the core of this retaliatory capability. However, some fear that various new strategic weapon developments, such as Russia’s recent fielding of a small number of nuclear-armed Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, risk invalidating existing command and control protocols and their backups and fail-safes. In August 2019, War on the Rocks published a piece in which Dr. Adam Lowther, Director of Research and Education at the Louisiana Tech Research Institute, and Curtis McGiffin, Associate Dean, School of Strategic Force Studies, at the Air Force Institute of Technology, both of whom are also retired U.S. military officers, advocated for an actual American Dead Hand system. This proposal immediately proved to be controversial and prompted criticism from other scholars and experts . It is worth noting that the U.S. military, while it is not publicly pursuing a Dead Hand of some kind, has been working hard in recent years to upgrade and improve the capabilities of its nuclear command and control architecture and the reliability of new and existing systems, in the face of a variety of threats, including cyberattacks . Last year, the Air Force notably released an entirely revised edition of the unclassified Air Force Instruction 13-550, Air Force Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) . The new manual focused heavily on the need for increased “resilience,” that is to say systems that can reliably resist attacks, especially against cyber threats , as well as electromagnetic pulses . The U.S. military is also seeking improvements to the Airborne Launch Control System and a replacement for the E-6Bs. The future Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) aircraft are also expected to serve as a replacement for the Air Force’s E-4B Nightwatch airborne command posts and its C-32A Air Force Two VIP transports. The E-4B had briefly carried the ALCS, as well, but no longer have this capability . This diagram gives a sense of just how complex the existing nuclear command and control neworks are and how the Airborne Launch Control System onboard the E-6B Mercuries fits into that architecture., USAF The United States is also in the midst of a major modernization of its nuclear capabilities, across the board, and the associated infrastructure that goes along with that deterrent, which estimates have said could cost at least $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years. The upcoming budget proposal from President Donald Trump’s Administration for the 2021 Fiscal Year, which is slated to be released publicly next week, will seek to add billions more in funding for nuclear weapons-related projects. The War Zone has questioned in the past whether this is at all sustainable, or even logical, over such a long period. Whatever happens to the U.S. government’s plans to modernize the country’s nuclear deterrent capabilities, there’s no indication that it is looking to implement a Dead Hand trigger for its ICBMs, or any other weapon systems. There’s no evidence is has one in place now, either.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to the very shady world of drug-running, it seems that few stories are not fascinating. Such is the case with a Hawker Siddley 125 business jet that landed on a very rough strip in Guatemala on January 27, 2020. But it’s not just the fact that the plane made it down safely and was subsequently flown out from the undulating dirt strip by a ridiculously brave Guatalmalan Air Force pilot, the plane’s identity also includes a bizarre twist.

Its big air brakes and slotted flaps help bring the mid-size private jet to a stop quickly. Still, the improvised airstrip depicted in the video, which seems more like a rough road than anything else, is a far cry from anything this plane was designed to handle. The fact that it made the landing at night is even crazier. The aircraft made it safely to a Guatemalan Air Force installation after the salvage flight. , MINISTERIO DE LA DEFENSA NACIONAL EJÉRCITO DE GUATEMALA The discovery and seizure of the jet didn’t make much news internationally, but the fact that one gutsy Guatemalan Air Force pilot actually flew it out of the seemingly one-way landing spot has become a viral sensation in the aviation social media universe. Check out the crazy video for yourself below: https://youtube.com/watch?v=w5zuUt9Xdmc The aircraft safely made it to a Guatemalan Air Force installation where its condition is being evaluated while it is still being used as evidence as part of the investigation. Yet the story of the drug-running Hawker doesn’t end there. In an odd twist, the aircraft actually wears the same bogus registration of a similar aircraft that was seized for an identical activity in Belize two years ago . That registration is N818LD, which is actually legitimate , but belongs to an HS 125-700A owned by Central Virginia Aviation LLC and is current with the FAA. In fact, the jet that landed on a road in Belize even had a similar, but not identical paint job to the real McCoy . An HS 125 that was used for drug running found in Belize in the Spring of 2018. It also wore the bogus tail number N818LD, Belize Government The strangeness doesn’t end there. The spoofed registration has been used more than in just these two incidents, with it appearing on another HS 125 drug-running plane that landed in Venezuela just a month before the Hawker was seized in Belize. An HS 125 variant found with the same bogus registration N818LD in Venezuela in March of 2018. According to eltubazodigital.com, the aircraft’s real registration was XB-PDD., Venezuelan Government So, it seems that using the N818LD has become something of a tradition in the drug-running community when an HS 125 derivative is available, or at least for one smuggling group or cartel. The use of the type is highly logical, not just for its aforementioned short-field performance and tough airframe, but also for its range, payload, speed, and the fact that there are plenty of them that are aging out of normal operations. The drug runners traditionally use careful route planning and fly as low as possible at night to remain undetected by radar and various law-enforcement and counter-narcotic-tasked military units in the region. It is an incredibly dangerous business as it can mean being thrown in a horrific prison for a very long period of time, crashing and burning on an austere road-turned landing strip, or being shot down by patrolling fighter aircraft. This was the third aircraft found in Guatemala this year associated with drug-running operations. Last year there were 54 in total. The region overall has seen an uptick of these types of smuggling operations, which isn’t surprising as it seems that the cartels are becoming more aggressive with their international higher-tech (relatively) smuggling operations as of late. As for the real N818LD, it isn’t clear if it is still flying in the states, but maybe it would be a good time for its owners to switch its registration regardless.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The propensity of the Iranian regime to make often laughably hyperbolic claims about their military and technological achievements is nothing new, but some of the most absurd claims seem to routinely revolve around the country’s ostensible ambitions to become a power in space. Earlier this week, Iran’s Minister of Information and Communications Technology Tweeted out a picture purportedly of a spacesuit for future Iranian astronauts. Observers quickly determined that it was actually an altered Halloween costume that is readily available for purchase online. Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi made the post on Twitter on Feb. 4, 2020. Jahromi previously worked in various managerial posts for Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence between 2002 and 2009 before moving into telecommunications. The U.S. government sanctioned him in November 2019, claiming that he had been directly involved in censorship of the country’s internet on behalf of the regime in Tehran. He is presently the youngest member of the cabinet of Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. The Tweet itself is short. “Astronaut costume #bright_future” is all it says in Farsi.Â At the time of writing, it is still up, despite the many responses regarding the suit’s origins. The most important clues are a circle-shaped area on the right-hand breast of the suit and a rectangle-shaped one on the opposite side. These correspond exactly to a NASA logo and name patch seen on a Halloween costume on sale through online storefronts, such as Amazon , for around $20. A full screenshot of the listing for the costume on Amazon., Amazon It’s unclear why Iran thought it was a good idea to display this laughably off-the-shelf costume in a serious manner. It almost seems better suited to be a claimed flight suit for child-sized pilots to go along with Iran’s laughable Q313 “stealth fighter” mockup from years ago. That said, it is in line with other over-the-top propaganda that the Iranian regime has produced regarding its space efforts in the past. In January 2019, amid celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps put up a billboard that absurdly implied Iran’s achievements in this realm included the development of the U.S. Space Shuttle. #Tehran 's gigantic billboard being criticized on social media for ignoring women, using American space shuttle to show #Iran 's advancements pic.twitter.com/4QLFB2nn4V — Sobhan Hassanvand ðŸ“° Ø³Ø¨Ø­Ø§Ù† Ø­Ø³Ù†ÙˆÙ†Ø¯ (@Hassanvand) January 17, 2019 Iran’ does, technically, have a manned space program, but there is no indication there anywhere close to actually sending anyone into space. Former firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad notably said he wanted to be the country’s first astronaut in February 2013. This followed what Iran claimed was a successful launch and recovery of a capsule containing a monkey the month before. State and quasi-state media heavily touted the achievement. An earlier Iranian attempt to reach this milestone had failed in 2011 . At the same time, Iran’s nascent space program, at its core, is very real. It’s certainly real enough that the U.S. government, among others, regularly accuses Iran of using it as a cover for the development of technologies for long-range ballistic missiles , including a possible future intercontinental ballistic missile design. “Hiding beneath the layer of absurdity Western media loves so much, there is a serious development program aimed at manned suborbital flights which after passing its early stages gets frozen for financial and bureaucratic reasons,” Fabian Hinz, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, wrote on Twitter following the spacesuit debacle. “One should be very careful not to draw major conclusions about Iranian capabilities and intentions based on artefacts [sic; artifacts] generated by state propaganda and bureaucratic dynamics.” So in conclusion, while it's nice to have a good laugh, one should be very careful not to draw major conclusions about Iranian capabilities and intentions based on artefacts generated by state propaganda and bureaucratic dynamics and amplified by Western reporting. 4 — Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) February 4, 2020 Iran is in the process right now of preparing to attempt to launch another satellite into orbit aboard one of its domestically developed space launch vehicles, designs that have a decidedly mixed track record. In August 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump notably Tweeted out a U.S. satellite intelligence image of the aftermath of a failed launch attempt involving a Safir space launch vehicle. The rocket had exploded on the launch pad at what American officials refer to as “Semnan Launch Site One,” part of the Imam Khomeini Space Center , also known as the Semnan Space Center. We are.

Iran also just recently publicly displayed a full model of a future Soroush space launch vehicle for the first time at an exhibition in Tehran meant to highlight various technological achievements. Artwork and models of similar vehicles have been floating around for years, but this confirms that the Iranian regime is actively working on it. From the details present on the model, the design appears to be an enlarged three-stage derivative of the Simorgh that also notably adds a cluster of four rocket boosters at the bottom.Â Some Pictures from the exhibition of aerospace technological achievements in Tehran https://t.co/SvWAx2oZ7B #Iran #Space #Satellite pic.twitter.com/JPyux3bqmM — Web Sorber (@WebSorber) February 6, 2020 Pictures by IRIB and recent technical presentations show that aerodynamic and CFD analyses of the Souroush SLV has been been done in Iran Aerospace Research Institute https://t.co/UK4wVr8feT .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mass flare releases by a single aircraft can be major crowd-pleasers , but six A-10 Warthogs flying in formation behind a tanker raining flares in unison is downright glorious. Just such a spectacle occurred near Dubai’s famed Palm and World man-made island archipelagos. The video, which was posted by one of our favorite Instagram follows, Combat_learjet, can be seen below or by clicking this link. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Combat learjet (@combat_learjet) Some of our readers are probably asking themselves “is this actually a screen capture Digital Combat Simulator (DCS)?” At first glance, we had the same concerns, but it appears to be authentic based on our analysis. The A-10s shown are fitted in with a 500-gallon fuel tank on their centerline stations. This configuration is often associated with ferrying operations. Beyond that, we have no idea when the video was taken or what the circumstances were that led to the mass flare release photo-op. You also might  be wondering “how much did that seconds-long display cost?” We do have an answer for that, at least in terms of what the flares themselves cost. In our recent piece about what the Pentagon actually pays for various infrared decoy flares, the cheapest ones used by the A-10—the M206s—cost $35 apiece. A single bucket is packed with 30 flares. So, if just one bucket was spent by each ‘Hog—it very well could have been more—it would have run a total of $6,300. USAF The prices for various other flares only go up from there, but as we noted in our piece, these things have an expiration date, and they are better disposed of having a little fun than via some costly hazardous materials elimination process, if that was indeed the case. Historically, A-10s spend a lot of time in the Middle East area of operations and they would be especially useful at taking on swarms of Iranian fast boats during even a limited conflict in and around the Strait of Hormuz, which isn’t far from where this was shot. This is a mission set that A-10 pilots, as well as those of other platforms , are increasingly becoming proficient in. Regardless of the details, or lack thereof, the six-ship flare dump is an amazingly beautiful and unique sight to behold.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 8, 2018",The Crew Of This Army National Guard M1 Abrams Tank Flies An Anarchist Flag In Kuwait (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The practice of crews naming tanks, or otherwise adorning them with artwork, slogans, and flags, has been around since the very first types appeared on battlefields in Europe during World War I and the practice continues to this day. Pictures recently emerged of an M1 Abrams main battle tank from the South Carolina Army National Guard in Kuwait flying a large black flag with a stylized red “A” inside a circle, as well as one showing a crew member sporting a patch with a similar circled A and the phrase “No Masters.” These are symbols and slogans that originated with anarchist movements more than a century ago, but they’ve since made their way into far less politicized subcultures. It’s worth noting there’s no indication that this tank’s crew holds any related political beliefs. The 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team’s public affairs office posted the pictures online on Feb. 4, 2020. The headquarters of the Brigade is part of the North Carolina Army National Guard, but it also includes the 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, an element of the South Carolina Army National Guard. The M1 tank in question, which has the bumper code A-112, is assigned to 4-118th Infantry’s Company A. The bulk of the 30th is presently in Kuwait as part of a rotational deployment to the Middle East and it also has personnel presently forward-deployed in Syria. 4-118th Infantry was notably the unit that briefly sent Bradley Fighting Vehicles to that country last year. The morale patch with the “No Masters” slogan and the circled A, which are also overlaid on top of the South Carolina state flag., US Army A-112 fires its main gun during the gunnery training on Feb. 4, 2020., US Army The pictures show A-112 conducting gunnery training with other tanks from the battalion. This includes one with the name “Circled X,” the exact meaning of which is also unclear. “Circled X,” another tank from Company A, 4th Battalion, 118th Infnatry., US Army The 30th’s public affairs office has previously released pictures showing other M1s from the 1st Squadron, 150th Cavalry, a unit from the West Virginia Army National Guard that is also assigned to the brigade, with what are perhaps more typical names, such as “Bulletproof,” “Dealer,” “Dinocave,” “Don Quixote,” and “Drink Water.” Another tank simply has the logo of soft-serve ice cream and fast-food chain Dairy Queen on the main gun barrel. US Army US Army US Army US Army US Army US Army There’s another one called “Dracarys,” which features an image of a dragon on the main gun barrel, as well, obvious references to the now-completed HBO television series “ Game of Thrones .” References to this extremely popular show have appeared in military artwork in the past. US Army The “anarchy” tank from 4-118th Infantry does not appear to have a name, though it does have a large black box on its main gun barrel where one might have previously been. The flag draws clear attention to the theme, which also, as noted, appears on the morale patch that one of the crew members is seen wearing during the gunnery training. That patch also overlays the circled A and the “No Masters” slogan on top of the South Carolina state flag. The circled A dates back to 19th-century anarchist movements and is a reference to a phrase in French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon’s book What Is Property? , which he published in 1840. He wrote that “society seeks order in anarchy,” leading to the “A” for “anarchy” within an “O” for “order.” Proudhon has been described since then as the “ father of anarchism .” In the context of the circled A, “No Masters” seems to be a reference to “ No Gods, No Masters .” This is a slogan that also emerged in Europe in the late 1800s associated with anarchist and labor movements. Regardless, the circled A has evolved and transformed in the centuries since then, perhaps most notably becoming a core symbol among punk rock groups and the anarcho-punk movement that first emerged in the 1970s in the United Kingdom. “No Gods, No Masters,” is also now heavily intertwined with punk and punk rock movements. It’s unclear what the crew of A-112 is actually referring to with their flag and the “No Masters” patch. We have reached out to the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team’s public affairs office asking for more information. However, the circled A and this slogan have made their way into decidedly less political realms in recent years, most notably the very popular television show “ Sons of Anarchy ,” which aired on FX between 2008 and 2014. Cast members from the “Sons of Anarchy” television show, seated, sign autographs for US service members in Iraq in 2010 as part of a visit organized by the United Service Organizations (USO)., US Army The show centered on a fictional biker gang of the same name, which had logo that featured a grim reaper holding a sphere emblazoned with the circled A. It also led to the popularization of the phrase “No Rules, No Masters,” which made its way onto licensed t-shirts that are still available for sale online. Still, naming a tank in reference to a television show, or even displaying art or a flag directly referencing that kind of media, is one thing. Flying a huge anarchist flag with no other immediate context is another and it is certainly a unique display based on the other images we’ve seen. It’s also notable given how seriously the U.S. military takes its role as an apolitical entity and the steps it has taken to make this clear over the years. Hopefully, we’ll learn more about what A-112’s crew is referring to specifically. It’s certainly an interesting choice for a theme, but it also definitely carries on the well-established tradition of naming tanks, as well as other armored vehicles, and otherwise adding personalized touches in the form of artwork and slogans. UPDATE: 3:35pm EST Some of our military readers have informed us that “Circled X,” the name of one of the other M1 tanks assigned to Company A, 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry, is a reference to Department of the Army (DA) Form 5988-E, Equipment Maintenance and Inspection Worksheet. The form calls for the individual filling it out to mark it with one of five status symbols. A circled X is the second most serious symbol , indicating a problem that requires approval from higher authorities to continue operating the vehicle, possibly with restrictions, until the problem has been resolved. UPDATE: 5:00pm EST U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Cindi King, a public affairs officer for the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team in Kuwait, has provided the following statement to clarify the use of the flag It was not intended to be a political statement, as we already indicated was very possibly the case. Here is the full statement: “They are A company – so it is tradition they nickname their lead tank and company after something that starts with A. There was nothing intended to be disrespectful nor political.” “They do not want to appear disrespectful or making any type of statement other than they are A company and this nickname sounds tough. To ensure there is no further misunderstanding or appearance of making any statement- these photos are deleted and the unit is notified that this appears to represent something that it is unintended to. They will proudly continue to fly their state flag and US flag and think of something else that begins with A. We apologize if this sent any type of negative message or appeared disrespectful or offensive. They did not want it to come across as any type of political statement – as it is not. Thank you for allowing us the chance to clarify this.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Around The Globe Middle East News & Features Persian Gulf"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Oct 9, 2020","We Talk Giant V-Shaped Airships, Space, And Phoenix Lights With JP Aerospace’s Founder","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Space is clearly the final frontier for the American armed forces, as made clear by the recent creation of the U.S. Space Force . The establishment of the newest branch of the United States’ military has been controversial, as have several seemingly bizarre statements about the shadowy space fighting capabilities of America and its adversaries. Despite the controversy, it is undeniable that the space domain will play an increasingly important role in the militaries and economies of the 21st century. For that reason, revolutionary spaceflight startups, such as SpaceX, and more established companies, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are working to expand access to rocket-based spaceflight and even reusable launch vehicles. While these high-profile companies tend to get most of the press with spectacular launches, and in SpaceX’s case, spectacular landings , there is another revolutionary aerospace company, JP Aerospace (JPA), that has for years been exploring a potentially simpler, cheaper, and safer way to reach outer space via orbital airships. The War Zone recently spoke with JP Aerospace’s founder John Powell to discuss the company’s huge sci-fi looking craft, as well as the promise of using lighter-than-air craft to put spacecraft in orbit, the possibility of even building floating “cities on the edge of space,” and more. Why Airships? John Powell founded JP Aerospace in the late 1970s in order to develop new, more affordable methods of reaching space using lighter-than-air vehicles. Over the years, the company has developed a wide range of balloons and inflatable vehicles that can reach extreme altitudes to accomplish various objectives. The firm also partners extensively with educational institutions to allow students to create tiny ping pong ball-sized satellites called PongSats, which are flown aboard JPA craft.  Eventually, the company aims to develop a whole new infrastructure to allow routine, safe, and efficient V-shaped lighter-than-air craft to float slowly up to space. In his 2008 book Floating to Space : The Airship to Orbit Program, Powell writes that much of the world’s current spaceflight technology is still based on the missile technology of the Cold War-era Space Race when money was no issue and the dangers of launching rockets were accepted as inevitable. As such, Powell says that current spaceflight technology worldwide is “too expensive, too dangerous, takes an army to ready, carries too little, and will never open up the space frontier,” adding: Current NASA estimates call for ten years and ten billion dollars to create a craft that is smaller and less capable than the existing space shuttle. The Russian space program is hampered by huge economic problems. The Chinese are now joining the space community; however they are decades behind. All these efforts are only improvements on the existing technology, large rockets fired into space. The focus is on lighter materials, more efficient engines, and better electronics. This is fine-tuning. Fine-tuning does not create dramatic change. To truly create a new spaceflight paradigm, Powell writes in the book, we need a way to reach space that is far less expensive and doesn’t require the massive infrastructure needed to launch what are still essentially ballistic missiles. That’s precisely where airships come in to play. A 175-foot JP Aerospace Ascender performing an in-hangar float test., JP Aerospace Powell told The War Zone that the main advantage lighter-than-air craft can offer is the massive reduction in the size and weight needed for a vehicle to reach space, saying: The higher you start from, the smaller your rocket needs to be. Think of Virgin Galactic’s Spaceship Two , or the Pegasus orbital launch vehicle. They both get a huge advantage by launching from an aircraft. Think of an orbital airship as an air-launch, but instead of firing the rocket at a mere 50,000 feet it does it at over 200,000 feet. Aside from the reductions in rocket size and fuel volume, Powell adds that airship-launched spacecraft are also made much safer and efficient by carrying less fuel, explaining: The largest danger of space flight is the high rate of energy release. You put six astronauts on the largest tank of liquid explosives on the planet then light it on fire. Six minutes later they’re in space. Would you want to fly to New York that way? A 747 doesn’t burn all its fuel in a few moments and hurl the passengers across the sky, it burns it slowly over the course of the entire trip. It can do this because the aircraft is supported by the air with its wings. The thin atmosphere at the edge of space supports the airship while it accelerates over days to reach orbital speed. It is both a buoyant craft and a flying wing. Instead of the current ‘oh no, an engine failed, everyone dies’ scenario, you have an ‘oh no, an engine failed, somebody go back and work on it, have a meeting, if we can’t fix it in a few hours we’ll need to go home’ scenario. Airships to orbit can change the very nature of space travel. To change the nature of space travel, Powell and JPA have put together what they call the Airship to Orbit program. The Airship To Orbit Program JP Aerospace’s plan for the Airship to Orbit program consists of three stages. During the first stage, a gigantic V-shaped airship like the JP Aerospace Ascender rises from the Earth’s surface to an altitude of around 140,000 feet. The three stages of the ATO program., JP Aerospace There, the Ascender airship would dock with a space station resembling a starfish known as a Dark Sky Station. JP Aerospace envisions Dark Sky Stations with arms 2 miles in length which would serve “not only as a port for the orbital airship but also as a research center, construction site, and tourist destination.” JPA calls these conceptual stations “cities at the edge of space” and the Dark Sky Station Block Four JPA envisions would house 35 crew members and have room for 70 passengers. Dark Sky Station concept art., JP Aerospace Powell told The War Zone that JP Aerospace has already conducted flights of small scale Dark Sky Station platforms. Already, some of JPA’s flights have broken world altitude records he said, adding: In fact, there is only one airship ever to reach those altitudes, that is our Tandem airship which flew to 95,085 feet in 2011. The only other airship that has gotten close was the Southwest Research institutes ‘HiSentinel’ airship [which] flew to 74,000 feet in 2005, but failed moments after reaching that altitude and was never found. There have been subsequent HiSentinels that have flown to lower altitudes. We also flew a ½ scale Tandem airship to 80,000 feet in 2010. A flight of a small-scale Dark Sky Station testbed., JP Aerospace The third phase of the planned ATO program would launch directly from the Dark Sky Station. A V-shaped orbital airship up to 2,000 feet in length would exit from the upper atmospheric station and fly to orbit using both buoyant lift and hybrid chemical/electric propulsion. These orbital vehicles JP Aerospace envisions would be too large and light to fly in the lower atmosphere and would have to be assembled at the Dark Sky Station where atmospheric pressures are much lower. Thanks to orbital acceleration, this final airship would become hypersonic, reaching speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour (close to Mach 23) as it rides its own shockwaves through the upper atmosphere. As early as the 1960s, NASA was flying V-shaped lighter-than-air reentry vehicles at speeds as high as Mach 7 at 96 miles above the Earth’s surface, so there is at least a technical precedent for hypersonic inflatable aircraft at extreme altitudes. The Inflatable Micrometeoroid Paraglider (IMP) developed at NASA’s Langley Research Center. The inflatable aircraft was designed to fly into the highest reaches of the atmosphere where it would be bombarded with micrometeorites. The data gathered allowed NASA researchers to determine what level of protection against these micrometeorites is needed for spacecraft., NASA.gov The ultimate goal of JP Aerospace’s ATO program is to create the infrastructure for manned Earth-to-orbit travel, which consists of the three stages in the ATO program. Introducing flight crews obviously also introduces a whole new level of complexity and risk to the ATO program, and so far JP Aerospace has not conducted any manned high-altitude flights. In fact, Powell says that there are no manned airships currently flying in the near space-environment. However, JP Aerospace is currently working on a manned submarine in order to test the pressurization and life support systems that would be necessary aboard a manned airship or Dark Sky Station operating at near-space altitudes. The Bellavia submarine developed by JP Aerospace., JPaerospace.com Obviously, as Powell notes in his book Floating to Space , to construct the world’s largest aircraft ever conceived will not be an easy task. Powell writes that the construction of these orbital airships “not only requires many new technologies, but also requires them to work together.” Components and entire systems will have to be designed largely from scratch. Still, Powell claims in Floating to Space that “impossible” simply means no one has done it before. “Look closely at something that was done that was proven to be impossible,” Powell writes, “very often the key reason it was considered impossible still exists. The problem was overcome in an unexpected way.” Concept image of the proposed JP Aerospace orbital airship., JP Aerospace Barriers Left To Cross JP Aerospace has flown hundreds of missions, but serious technical challenges still stand in the way of the company or any other aerospace firm developing fully operational orbital airships or lighter-than-air space stations. According to Powell, while the development of the ATO program is still many years away from its first flight of a 2,000-foot orbital airship, many of the concepts required for such a ship have already been tested either by JPA or by other laboratories, explaining: The number one question is: Can a little group like JP Aerospace tackle such a huge and complex project? Answer: I have no idea, but so far so good. Serious challenges include active drag reduction: Even at the edge of space the aerodynamic drag on the vehicle is considerable. Active drag reduction, using electrical power to reduce drag, has been around for decades. However, only in national labs. We need to take this technology and put it in the real world. Balloons and other inflatables have been flown to Mach 10 in the upper atmosphere. The question is: can they be flown to Mach 24? Another major undertaking is the sheer size of the vehicles. The orbital airship needs to be 6,000 feet long to be buoyant enough and have enough wing area to support it at the altitude where it will conduct its orbital insertion burn at 300,000 feet. The vehicle will need to be built (at least inflated) at the Dark Sky Station. No one has ever built anything in the sky before. There are major technical problems with a high altitude platform like the Dark Sky Station. The arms of the Dark Sky Station will be two miles across. All current long-duration balloons utilize advanced multi-layer materials to survive in the upper atmosphere to long durations. The Dark Sky Station will employ lower-tech films and replace them in flight when they deteriorate. This way we change the long duration issue from an exotic technology problem to a maintenance problem. We have accomplished high altitude gas moving and balloon swapping on our research flights. “Big Black Triangles” Many of the images of JP Aerospace vehicles both prototype and in development may look familiar to those aware of incidents of alleged unidentified aircraft over the last few decades. As an aside to our interview with JP Aerospace’s John Powell, we asked Powell how possible he feels it could be, based on his experience, that the USAF or another military/governmental body may be operating “black” or off-the-books lighter-than-air craft which might explain some of these reported sightings. JPaerospace.com There have been numerous claims made in recent years surrounding alleged secret military airships , encouraged by popular lore and high-profile incidents. After all, there is some precedent for such craft, such as the Silent Joe stealth blimps from the 1960s or the Northrop Grumman LEMV from the past decade. Despite there being no conclusive evidence that such airships exist, there have been plenty of unconfirmed and anecdotal reports that point to this being the case. In the early 1980s, scores of eyewitnesses claimed to have seen massive , slow-moving V-shaped aircraft floating silently through the night skies above the Hudson Valley in New York state. In the 1997 “Phoenix Lights” incident, thousands of witnesses throughout Arizona, Nevada, and northern Mexico reported seeing a similarly massive and silent aircraft. Accounts vary, and some claim that there were two separate sets of lights conflated as one incident, but most eyewitnesses reported seeing a giant, silent craft that was either v-shaped or triangular passing low over the region. A test flight of the JPA Ascender 9., JP Aerospace Arizona’s governor at the time, Fyfe Symington, even witnessed the incident and later told reporters that despite the fact that the USAF later identified one of the groups of lights seen during the incident as flares dropped by A-10 Warthogs during training exercises at the Barry Goldwater Range, he believes he saw something else entirely: I witnessed a massive delta-shaped craft silently navigate over Squaw Peak, a mountain range in Phoenix, Arizona. It was truly breathtaking. I was absolutely stunned because I was turning to the west looking for the distant Phoenix Lights. To my astonishment this apparition appeared; this dramatically large, very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights was traveling through the Arizona sky. As a pilot and a former Air Force Officer, I can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I’d ever seen. And it was certainly not high-altitude flares because flares don’t fly in formation. One of the firm’s large boomerang-shaped craft taking to the skies on a test flight. , JPaerospace.com JP Aerospace’s John Powell says that while his company has designed vehicles for the Department of Defense, some of which went on to the ‘black’ world, his company was ultimately not responsible for the Phoenix Lights incident: Here I must tread a little delicately. We have built several airships and other vehicles for various DOD agencies. None of our programs were classified. However, after completion and delivery, our vehicles entered into programs of which I have no knowledge. We were testing vehicles at the time of the Phoenix lights incident, however, I can absolutely say that JPA was not, nor [was] our equipment, involved. There have been times where our vehicles have been sighted and confused for UFOs or other mysterious things. I have also seen images of great vee-shaped objects in the sky that I can say for sure were not mine, but I could note perhaps the tech of a competitor. This is all speculation. The only public record of a JP Aerospace airship built for the DoD was a 175-foot Near-Space Maneuvering Vehicle (NSMV) that JPA developed for the Air Force’s now-defunct Space Battlelab and Space Warfare Center at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. A 175-foot JP Aerospace Ascender, JP Aerospace A 2005 RAND Corporation technical report prepared for the US Army titled “ High-Altitude Airships for the Future Force Army” states that the NSMV built for the Air Force was to be tested at Fort Stockton, Texas in June 2004. During the test, the NSMV was scheduled to climb to 100,000 feet and loiter for five days, navigate by remote control, maintain a static position for a short time, and then return to Earth. At that altitude, the NSMV would have had a 230-mile surveillance radius, according to official documents. Line-of-sight at that altitude is roughly 380 miles in any direction. Unfortunately, a DoD document from 2012 states that the test flights of the NSMV that JP Aerospace built for the Air Force Space Battlelab were canceled due to issues with the craft’s propulsion system and failed launches. In Floating to Space , John Powell writes that the 175-foot Ascender built for the NSMV project was destroyed “during a high wind accident while being prepared for its first flight.” The Air Force terminated the program in 2005. A Possible Future For Space Travel While lighter-than-air craft don’t get the attention that traditional high-performance aircraft do, they nonetheless remain a vital subject of aerospace research within the Department of Defense, according to a 2012 report prepared by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. The report discussed airship technologies that the Department of Defense’s laboratories and contractors were developing or had developed at the time that “enable viable lighter-than-air vehicles to contribute to our short, mid, and long term strategy for national security and defense” and offered “advanced intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and communications capabilities through integrated sensor payloads and on-board processing for real-time intelligence and post-mission forensics.” The report also noted that “advances and investment in aerostat and airship technology are also being made in the private sector” and that “the DoD is monitoring this progress and will continue to look for opportunities to advance our objectives through commercially available technology.” In addition to JP Aerospace, the report discussed recent airship platforms designed and constructed by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, the Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and other aerospace contractors. Tethered aerostats have become a staple at U.S. military bases in war zones. They carry a variety of surveillance systems to provide persistent intelligence gathering and situational awareness security over a localized area., US Army A 2013 report that the Rapid Reaction Technology Office prepared added that “as the U.S. engaged in conflicts where airspace was less contested, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, interest increased in the development and use of LTA [lighter than air] vehicles for multiple purposes.” Forward operating bases and small tactical units used tethered aerostats for persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, demonstrating the fact that airships and aerostats still have a use on the battlefield, especially low altitude ones. America’s potential foes have followed suit in recent years . While the Department of Defense still employs lighter-than-air vehicles primarily for ISR missions, many DoD laboratories are working towards developing hybrid airships for logistic airlift missions . As the armed forces continue their pivot towards space, companies like JP Aerospace that are willing to explore the possibilities of lighter-than-air spaceflight and find new paradigms will be increasingly important. One of Google’s Project Loon balloons. , Ilighter/wikicommons There is also great potential for replacing or augmenting communications satellite networks with LTA craft. This could be a key area of research and development for the DoD as space becomes increasingly contested and new issues arise such as orbital pollution. There is already precedent in the commercial sector for such LTA-based communication networks, such as the Loon project launched by Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc. Loon uses high-altitude balloons flying up to 11 miles up in the stratosphere to provide wireless broadband internet to those on the surface below. With all this in mind, lighter-than-air flight is undergoing something of a modern renaissance, but the leap from more terrestrial uses to taking payloads into space certainly signifies the apex of imagination when it comes to what is the oldest form of non-organic flight. We can only hope that JP Aerospace continues to push the boundaries of airship-to-orbit technology so that maybe one day we all may be able to float to orbital space stations aboard massive V-shaped airships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 11, 2022",Ukrainian Troops Are Still Using This Pre-World War I-Era Maxim Machine Gun In Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Six years after Ukraine first found itself embroiled in armed conflict with Russia and its proxies , the country continues to rely heavily on stocks of Soviet-era aircraft , vehicles, weapons, and other military equipment, derivatives thereof , or newish designs that leverage those existing resources in some way. In one particularly extreme example, a recent video clip from the front lines shows that the Ukrainian military is still actively using the M1910 Maxim machine gun, a design that predates World War I. The video, which originally aired as part of a segment on Ukraine’s Channel 5 television network and has been circulating on social media since at least Jan. 31, 2020, shows a member of the Ukrainian armed forces manning the M1910 machine gun in an unspecified location in the country’s Luhansk Oblast. Luhansk is one of the Ukrainian regions that declared itself to be an independent republic in 2014 following Russia’s illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula and the beginning of the Kremlin’s support for nominally local separatist forces in the eastern part of Ukraine. Luhansk, together with Donetsk, form a region known as the Donbass, which has been the epicenter of the conflict ever since. This actually isn’t the first time images of an M1910 in use in Ukraine have emerged. In 2016, Ukraine’s TSN news network released a video of another one of the Maxim guns still in service with the country’s armed forces. The Russian M1910 is a direct descendant of Hiram Maxim’s eponymous machine gun, which was the first weapon of its kind to see widespread production and use, beginning in the mid-1880s. Variants of the then-revolutionary gun quickly found their way onto battlefields around the world and were license-produced in a number of countries, including Imperial Russia under the Tsar. The M1910, which first entered service in 1910, is a water-cooled gun that features a large hollow jacket around the barrel that is regularly filled with water to keep it from overheating during sustained fire. This variant also fires the standard Russian 7.62x54mm cartridge, the first versions of which entered Imperial Russian military service in 1891. After 129 years, this remains the oldest basic cartridge design still in widespread military use and Russia today is still producing new guns chambered to fire the latest variations of this relatively ancient ammunition. Russian Maxims served in both World War I with the Tsar’s forces, then on both sides of the Bolshevik Revolution and ensuing Russian Civil War, and with the Soviet military during World War II. Though the Soviets began replacing them with newer SG-43 machine guns in 1943, the M1910 remained in production until 1945, with a number of general refinements being added to the design over the years. It’s not clear what particular M1910 variant is seen in the recent video from Ukraine, but it notably lacks the later so-called “ tractor cap ” on top of the cooling jacket, which was added to many of the guns, such as the one in the video below, beginning sometime between 1941 and 1943. The gun seen in the video clip from 2016 does have this feature. This large cap allowed machine gun teams to fill the jacket with snow, as an alternative to water, which would freeze during Russia’s frigid winters. It’s also worth noting that even if the gun seen in the video from Ukraine was among the very last M1910s produced in the Soviet Union, it would still be 75 years old. M1910s of various types remained in reserve storage in the Soviet Union for decades and were also widely exported to Soviet allies and partner forces. It’s perhaps not surprising that some would still be in depots in Ukraine, which most recently gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. As long as the gun itself works, there aren’t any real hurdles to using it, either. As noted, it uses standard 7.62x54mm ammunition, which remains in production in Ukraine and Russia, among other countries, more than a century after it was first introduced. Subsequent Soviet machine gun designs also continued to use interchangeable cartridge belts to further reduce logistical demands. This particular Ukrainian M1910 appears to be loaded with ammunition using a belt from a much more modern PK-series machine gun . A US Army soldier fires a PK-series machine gun during an exchange with foreign forces. The belted 7.62x54mm ammunition is clearly visible., US Army There may even be some benefits to employing the Maxim over more recent designs. The video shows it positioned in a fixed machine gun nest, where a water-cooled gun, which can fire indefinitely without overheating so long as the cooling jacket is regularly topped up and nothing physically breaks, could actually be an ideal choice. At the same time, it also shows how deep Ukraine has had to dig to source additional weapons and other military equipment while it faces down one of the world’s largest armies and its proxies. Whatever the case, that this M1910 is still serving in any capacity at all is both a testament to the design of Maxim’s gun and Russia’s 7.62x54mm cartridge. With the conflict in Ukraine, unfortunately, not looking like it will be ending any time soon, it’s possible that this gun, already at least 75 years old, still has years of service left ahead of it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 17, 2019",Greece Is Sending Patriot Missiles To Saudi Arabia To Guard “Critical Energy Infrastructure”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Greece says it is preparing to deploy a Patriot surface-to-air missile system unit to Saudi Arabia to help protect the Kingdom’s oil infrastructure. This news comes amid reports that the U.S. military is trying to get approval from Iraqi authorities to send Patriots there in the wake of unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at American personnel in that country last month. That plan could involve moving U.S. Army Patriot units presently in Saudi Arabia into Iraq. Stelios Petsas, a spokesperson for the Greek government, announced the impending Patriot deployment in an interview on Feb. 3, 2020. He did not say how large the air defense contingent would be or when would actually arrive in Saudi Arabia, but said that the government in Riyadh was underwriting operation, which is “to protect critical energy infrastructure.” The Greek military has six squadrons of Patriot PAC-3 surface-to-air missile systems, all of which are assigned to the Hellenic Air Force’s 350 Guided Missile Wing . “The deployment contributes to energy security, promotes our country as a factor of regional stability and strengthens our ties to Saudi Arabia,” Petsas said . “As a defensive system, this constitutes no threat to other countries in the area.” A Hellenic Air Force Patriot surface-to-air missile launch station., Hellenic Air Force Petsas added that discussions about sending Greek Patriots to Saudi Arabia first began in October 2019, which is not surprising. The month before, unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile strikes had caused significant damage to Saudi oil infrastructure. The Kingdom subsequently said that it believed the strikes were at least “ sponsored by Iran ,” while the United States accused Iran of directly carrying out the operation. U.S. authorities quickly pledged to help bolster Saudi air and missile defenses and called on its allies and partners to do the same. Petsas said in his interview that France and the United Kingdom were also be planning to send forces to Saudi Arabia and that Italy might be looking to do the same in the future. Though the Greek deployment has been in the works for months, it could be especially beneficial for the United States now, which is looking to deploy Patriot units to Iraq in the aftermath of the Iranian ballistic missile strikes on facilities where U.S. troops are situated in that country on Jan. 7. Those strikes were in retaliation for the U.S. decision to kill Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani outside Baghdad International Airport just days earlier. The U.S. military did not have Patriots or any other robust air or missile defenses in place in Iraq at the time. This, in turn, has prompted public criticism of this lack of preparedness, especially given the deployment of Patriot units in Saudi Arabia last year. Given the relatively small size of the U.S. Army’s overall Patriot force, some or all of the four batteries of these surface-to-air missile systems that are present in the Kingdom, which are also tasked with defending “critical military and civilian infrastructure,” may now reportedly get re-deployed into Iraq, if authorities in Baghdad approval the plan. However, Iraqi officials, who were incensed by the unilateral U.S. decision to kill Soleimani on their soil, are still withholding approval for the American air defense deployment. You can read more in detail about why there are still no American Patriot systems in Iraq in this recent War Zone piece . US Army personnel train on the Patriot surface-to-air missile system in Qatar., US Army In addition, Pestas, the government spokesperson, said that Greece’s decision to send its own Patriots to Saudi Arabia is also wrapped up in an array of other geopolitical concerns, most of which are linked to its long-standing rivalry with neighboring Turkey, which has been pursuing a steadily more assertive foreign policy under the administration of the increasingly authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent years. He explained that the Greek government was “ trying to re-energize ” its relations with Gulf Arab states, broadly, specifically to a challenge to Turkey’s overseas moves. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is presently in the Middle East on a tour that will take him to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Saudis and Emiratis, among others, also continue to enforce a blockade of neighboring Qatar as part of a bitter political dispute that first erupted in 2017. Since then, the government in Doha has embraced Turkish support , including the deployment of Turkish troops . At the same time, Turkey has increased its involvement in the civil conflict in Libya and leveraged its relationship with the internationally recognized government in Tripoli to assert claims over significant parts of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. This Turkish-Libyan agreement on maritime boundaries has prompted a new spat with Greece, along with Egypt , Cyprus, and Israel, among others, all of whom have categorically rejected Ankara’s claims. Greece and Turkey have other long-standing border disputes and the overall increase in tensions between the two countries has led to an increase in Turkish combat jets reportedly violating Greek airspace . These types of incidents have occurred on and off for decades and have led to reported shootdowns in the past. There have been reports of mock dogfights between Greek and Turkish fighters In some of the more recent cases, as well. A Hellenic Air Force F-16C Viper fighter jet, which the service commonly scrambles in response to Turkish combat jets getting close to or violating Greek airspace., Hellenic Air Force All of this comes as Turkey’s relations with its NATO allies, including Greece, as well as the United States, are at a recent low over various issues, including Ankara’s decision to buy Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a saga you can read more about here and here . Ankara’s unilateral military intervention into northern Syrian last year, aimed at ejecting U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces from a wide swath of that country, has also strained its relationship with Washington. There have been reports that the United States is finally considering removing its stockpiles of B61 nuclear gravity bombs from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey as a result of the worsening ties between the two countries. The Turkish government’s subsequent decision to cut a deal with its counterparts in Moscow to patrol a buffer zone in Syria, and to move closer toward the Russian sphere of influence in general, has only compounded these issues. Of course, it is worth noting that, Turkish-Russian relations are now themselves increasingly strained over the Kremlin’s unwillingness or inability to curtail a new Syrian government offensive into areas under the control of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels. It remains to be seen how Turkey may or may not respond to Greece’s upcoming deployment Patriots to Saudi Arabia and its efforts to reinvigorate ties with the Kingdom, in general. Regardless, it is a clear indication that Turkey’s grand ambitions under Erdogan, especially in the realm of foreign policy, are having complex and far-reaching impacts. In the meantime, the more immediate impact of the Greek Patriots heading to the Kingdom may be to help the U.S. military free up its own air defense assets for deployment into Iraq.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 30, 2019",Admiral Warns America’s East Coast Is No Longer A “Safe Haven” Thanks To Russian Subs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. Navy officer says that his service no longer considers the East Coast of the United States as an “uncontested” area or an automatic “safe haven” for its ships and submarines. This is a product of steadily increased Russian submarine activity in the Atlantic Ocean , including the deployment of more advanced and quieter types that can better evade detection. U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Andrew “Woody” Lewis made these comments at a gathering the U.S. Naval Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank jointly hosted on Feb. 4, 2020. Lewis is the commander of the Navy’s 2nd Fleet, which the service reactivated in 2018 specifically to address the surge in Russia’s submarine operations in the Atlantic. This fleet, headquartered at Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads in Virginia, reached full operational capability in December 2019. “Our new reality is that when our sailors toss the lines over and set sail, they can expect to be operating in a contested space once they leave Norfolk,” Lewis said. “Our ships can no longer expect to operate in a safe haven on the East Coast or merely cross the Atlantic unhindered to operate in another location.” “We have seen an ever-increasing number of Russian submarines deployed in the Atlantic, and these submarines are more capable than ever, deploying for longer periods of time, with more lethal weapons systems,” he continued. “Our sailors have the mindset that they are no longer uncontested and to expect to operate alongside our competitors each and every underway.” US Navy Vice Admiral Andrew “Woody” Lewis, head of 2nd Fleet, speaks at a conference during Exercise Baltic Operations 19 (BALTOPS 19)., USN Lewis did not offer any specific details on the total number of Russian submarines the U.S. military believes are on patrol in the Atlantic at any given time compared to previous years. There has been significant debate about the exact scale of Russia’s undersea activities, especially compared to peaks in the Soviet Navy’s operations at the height of the Cold War, and whether the Kremlin has only been able to generate the additional deployments by pulling resources from the Pacific region. However, it’s undeniable there has been at least a relative spike in Russia’s submarine activity in the Atlantic in recent years. In October 2019, Norweigan state broadcaster NRK reported that the country’s top military intelligence agency, the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), also known as the Etterretningstjenesten or E-tjenesten , was monitoring the largest single Russian submarine exercise since the end of the Cold war, involving at least 10 submarines, eight of which were nuclear-powered types, including two nuclear-powered attack submarines from the Project 945A Kondor class , also known as the Sierra II class. The Russian Sierra II class submarine Pskov ., Pskov.ru NRK ‘s report also said that the E-tjenesten believed that the goal of the exercise was to demonstrate the Russian Navy’s continued ability to deploy a large number of submarines far into the Atlantic while remaining largely undetected. This, in turn, showed the ability of that force, which might have included ballistic missile and guided-missile submarines , the latter of which may be able to carry Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles in the future, to hold targets on the East Coast of the United States at risk. As The War Zone noted at the time , the exercise could also give Russian submarines an opportunity to train on flooding the so-called GIUK Gap – standing for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom – which refers to paths between the Norweigan Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. It could also demonstrate their ability to maintain a defensive posture off the shores of Norway to present a threat to NATO members and protect Russia’s own assets in the far north, including its naval bases in the northwest region of the country and ballistic missile subs sailing hidden under the Polar ice cap. CIA “The Kalibr-class cruise missile, for example, has been launched from coastal-defense systems, long-range aircraft, and submarines off the coast of Syria ,” U.S. Admiral James Foggo, the commander of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe and Africa, had said in 2018 . “They’ve shown the capability to be able to reach pretty much all the capitals in Europe from any of the bodies of water that surround Europe.” Though last year’s exercise was a particularly large demonstration of Russia’s submarine capabilities, it does appear to be indicative of the kind of increasing challenges the Navy is seeing in the Atlantic, as a whole. Despite limited defense budgets, the Kremlin continues to invest heavily in the development and fielding of newer and more advanced submarines that are better able to elude U.S., as well as NATO, forces. One of the War Zone ‘s sources said that a large number of Navy submarines, ships, and maritime patrol aircraft spent weeks in the fall of 2019 attempted, without success, to locate the Project 885 Yasen class guided missile submarine Severodvinsk after it reportedly deployed into the North Atlantic. The type, which can carry up to 40 Kalibr missiles, among other weapons, is known for having an especially low acoustic signature . Russia has two further improved Project 885M Yasen-M class subs under construction now and plans to eventually build at least six of these upgraded versions, in total. The Yasen-M notably includes a new reactor that features an updated cooling system that reportedly further reduces the noise the submarine generates. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE The Russian Navy also launched a new special mission submarine, the K-139 Belgorod , a modified Oscar II class guided-missile submarine, last year. You can read the War Zone ‘s complete analysis of this boat here , but suffice to say it appears to have significant intelligence-gathering capabilities and will also reportedly be able to carry Russia’s new and controversial Poseidon long-range nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ‘doomsday’ torpedo. Belgorod is just one of Russia’s fleet of special-purpose submarines, which also includes the unique Project 10831 Losharik spy submarine. This boat was heavily damaged in a fire on July 1, 2019, but the Russian Navy plans to repair it and return it to service . Russia’s more advanced submarine fleets also include diesel-electric types, including the Project 636 Varshavyanka class, or Improved Kilo class , and the Project 677 Lada class , both of which are attack submarine types. The latter of these features an air-independent propulsion system, which makes it especially quiet. Russia’s only Lada class submarine, though the country is in the process of building two more and has two more on order., Морозов Л.Н. via Wikimedia Increased Russian naval activity in the North Atlantic is also not entirely limited to submarines. Vice Admiral Lewis highlighted how the USS Mahan , an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, was in the middle of training when it was tasked with monitoring the Vishnya class spy ship Viktor Leonov , in December 2019. The Viktor Leonov caused something of a stir when the U.S. Coast Guard announced that it had received reports that the ship was sailing in an “ unsafe manner ” off the coasts of South Carolina and Georiga. It also operated offer the coast of Florida for a time. There was never any indication that the Coast Guard had corroborated those reports and it was unclear where the originated from in the first place. The Russian ship, which has made numerous trips to the Western Hemisphere over the years, left waters off the East Coast of the United States before the end of the year. It then returned for a time to the waters off Florida in January 2020. Earlier in 2019, the Navy had also notably shadowed Russia’s first-in-class Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov as it sailed in the Caribbean as part of world tour following its commissioning. This warship is the Russian Navy’s most modern vessel to date. The Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov ., Alexander Galperin / Sputnik via AP Lewis said that all of this has impacted how the Navy prepares ships and submarines and their crews for deployments, with a greater focus on high-end operations during pre-deployment exercises and a greater emphasis on operational security in case someone is watching. 2nd Fleet, which does not technically have any ships assigned to it and shares administrative space with U.S. Fleet Forces Command at Hampton Roads, is primarily responsible for overseeing these preparations. “Each one of these certification events gets more and more complex, more and more what we would call high end,” Lewis explained. Recent composite unit training exercises that the 2nd Fleet has overseen, which are capstone events for the deployment of larger groups of warships, such as carrier strike groups and expeditionary strike groups, “are the best and most challenging operating I’ve ever done in my time in the Navy,” he continued. The U.S. Navy had also announced in 2018 that it planned to eventually create a submarine “aggressor” unit that could help train ship and submarine crews, as well as those on maritime patrol aircraft, to respond to the growing submarine threat in the Atlantic, as well as that of Chinese submarines in the Pacific. It could also help in the development of new tactics, techniques, and procedures for both submarine and anti-submarine warfare. “We talk about how we fight,” Vice Admiral Lewis said. “We have to tie that to how we train, because we’re never going to be better than how we train.” From his description of the situation in the North Atlantic, it sounds like Navy ships, submarines, and aircraft have increasing opportunities now to put that training to the test in what might he been considered routine transits a decade ago.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 8, 2020",Navy EA-18G Teamed With Two Other Growlers Flying Semi-Autonomously As Loyal Wingmen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has announced that it recently conducted an experiment together with the Navy in which an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft oversaw two other EA-18Gs flying missions semi-autonomously. The test demonstrated technology that would allow the service’s Growlers, as well as its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , to work closely together with unmanned aircraft and could also point to a future pilot-optional capability for these combat jets. The Chicago-headquartered plane maker revealed the tests had occurred in a press release on Feb. 4, 2020, but did not say when they had taken place. The company did say that the Growlers had operated from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, one of the Navy’s premier aviation test facilities and home of Naval Air Systems Command, and that the sorties had been part of the Navy Warfare Development Command’s annual fleet experiment (FLEX) exercises. “This demonstration allows Boeing and the Navy the opportunity to analyze the data collected and decide where to make investments in future technologies,” Tom Brandt, the firm’s Manned-Unmanned Teaming demonstration lead, said in a statement . “It could provide synergy with other U.S. Navy unmanned systems in development across the spectrum and in other services.” “This technology allows the Navy to extend the reach of sensors while keeping manned aircraft out of harm’s way,” he continued. “It’s a force multiplier that enables a single aircrew to control multiple aircraft without greatly increasing workload. It has the potential to increase survivability as well as situational awareness.” A pair of US Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft., USN Boeing says that the experiments consisted of a total of four flights, during which the three EA-18Gs performed 21 “demonstration missions,” in total. The company did not say what these entailed. Given the Growler’s primary mission set, they may have involved simulated electronic warfare sorties against mock threats, as well as simply showing off the ability of the EA-18G operating as the “mission controller” to direct and otherwise coordinate the activities of the other two semi-autonomous aircraft. There were pilots on board the two Growlers that flew semi-autonomous during the experiments, with those personnel performing the take offs and landings and otherwise acting as backups in case of system failures, according to Military.com . It’s also unclear if the Navy is specifically interested in a pilot-optional capability for the EA-18G or was simply using these test flights as an opportunity to explore manned-unmanned concepts, in general. When it comes to electronic warfare, the general concept that Boeing demonstrated during these recent tests makes good sense. Modern air defense systems and the sensors that support them, especially those in service or in development among “great power” competitors such as Russia and China , are increasingly more capable and have longer ranges. This, in turn, presents ever-growing threats to the non-stealthy EA-18Gs, especially in future operations where they might be called upon to support stealth platforms, such as F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Navy already expects the Growlers to perform their primary missions from a standoff distance , but this may not be enough to keep the aircraft adequately shielded from potential threats as time goes on. A graphic representation of how the EA-18G would support future operations, including those involving stealthy aircraft, by conducting so-called “modified escort jamming” from a standoff distance., GAO Linking the jets together with small groups of unmanned platforms with their own sensors and electronic warfare packages would enable the manned aircraft to detect and classify threats, as well as potentially engage them, from further away. The teams of pilotless aircraft could also cover a much broader area at once, while still reducing the risks to actual pilots. Back in 2017, the Navy had announced it was working with Northrop Grumman on developing swarms of very small drones carrying electronic warfare or other payloads that EA-18Gs could deploy using modified air-launched canisters typically used for cluster munitions . The Navy has also demonstrated the ability of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deploy drone swarms that could confuse or distract hostile air defenses, among other possible missions, in the past, as seen in the video below. Of course, these latest manned-unmanned tests may not necessarily be related specifically to the electronic warfare mission, which is ever-more distributed, including through the development of expendable non-kinetic munitions , and increasingly does not necessarily require a highly complex and expensive dedicated platform, such as the EA-18G. The Navy, specifically, has spent the better part of the last decade, at least, exploring and developing components for an over-arching, distributed, multi-platform electronic warfare architecture. The War Zone was first to report on the full extent of this program, known as Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors (NEMSIS), which you can read about in much greater detail here . The EA-18Gs at Patuxent River may simply have been the platforms available with the most appropriate existing systems installed to conduct the tests, which might be focused more on broader developments with regards to ‘loyal wingman’ type drones and largely-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). Simply turning existing combat jets into pilot-optional platforms would certainly offer a low-cost, low-risk path to a UCAV, albeit an unoptimized one with significantly limited capabilities compared to a design that does not need to in any way account for a pilot being onboard. In 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps notably conducted its own test involving an AV-8B Harrier jump jet flying together with a Kratos Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 ( UTAP-22 ), also known as a Mako, acting as a “ loyal wingman .” The AV-8B employed the Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) high-bandwidth data link during that experiment to exchange information and instructions with the UTAP-22. The EA-18G was the first aircraft to carry the TTNT system, which is now also now being integrated into the Navy’s Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lcP66syzQls All of this also comes as Boeing is continuing to develop the MQ-25A Stingray , a drone tanker that is set to be the first operational unmanned aircraft to join the Navy’s Carrier Air Wings and which could take on additional missions in the future. The service is also in the midst of re-examining what the next generation of naval combat aircraft might look like and what mix of manned and unmanned platforms may be the most optimal, something War Zone has previously covered in-depth . The MQ-25 program itself is as much about proving the concept of unmanned carrier aviation and developing the required infrastructure on the Navy’s carriers to support those operations as it is about the tanking mission itself. The service is in the process of installing drone control centers on its carriers now as they go through normal overhaul and maintenance periods, which it already says could support the fielding of additional unmanned platforms after the Stingray. In 2019, Boeing’s Australian subsidiary also conducted an experiment using a pair of jet-powered surrogate drones to demonstrate semi-autonomous teamed flight. This was in support of the company’s separate work on a new loyal wingman drone for the Royal Australian Air Force. Of course, this is certainly not the first time a branch of the U.S. military has demonstrated these types of manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. In 2015, the U.S. Air Force conducted a very similar test, known as Have Raider , involving a manned F-16D Viper fighter jet working with another, unmanned F-16. Two years later, as part of the follow-on Have Raider II experiment, the pilotless Viper actually broke formation with its manned counterpart, flew a pre-determined route, and then rendezvoused again with the F-16D. The reality is that the U.S. military, together with various defense contractors, notably including Boeing , already proved that semi-autonomous and autonomous UCAVs could work cooperatively with minimal human interaction nearly two decades ago. These UCAVs represented the biggest leap in air combat since the jet engine before they totally disappeared from the Air Force’s plans and nomenclature and got peculiarly passed over by the Navy. The X-47B, the Navy’s incredibly successful UCAV demonstrator, got passed over for a far less capable tanker drone, a highly controversial decision that still makes little sense. , USN You can read all about this bizarre and puzzling history and its consequences in this past special feature of ours. With this in mind, the Growler tests simply add to the already substantial mountain of evidence underscoring the validity and feasibility of these concepts, raising the question of why these capabilities still remain almost completely confined to experimental settings or the realm of deep classification. Hopefully, Boeing and the Navy will release more information about these latest Growler tests at Patuxent River and their objectives soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",A Russian “Inspector” Spacecraft Now Appears To Be Shadowing An American Spy Satellite,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Publicly available data suggests that a Russian inspector satellite has shifted its position in orbit to bring it relatively close to a U.S. KH-11 spy satellite. Russia has a number of what it calls “ space apparatus inspectors ” in orbit, which the U.S. government and others warn the Kremlin could use to gather intelligence on other satellites or function as “ killer satellites ,” using various means to damage, disable, or destroy those targets. On Jan. 30, 2020, Michael Thompson, a graduate student at Purdue University focusing on astrodynamics, posted a detailed thread on Twitter about the Russian inspector satellite Cosmos 2542, also written Kosmos 2542, appearing to synchronize its orbit with a U.S. satellite known as USA 245, which is understood be one of the National Reconnaissance Office’s KH-11 image gathering spy satellites . Russia launched this particular satellite from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome on Nov. 25, 2019, according to Space-Track.org , a U.S. government website that provides public data on space launches from the U.S. military’s Combined Space Operations Center and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command. This is just one of a number of space apparatus inspectors and other curious satellites that the Kremlin has put into orbit over the past decade. “This is all circumstantial evidence, but there are a hell of a lot of circumstances that make it look like a known Russian inspection satellite is currently inspecting a known US spy satellite,” Thompson wrote. “A pretty thorough look of the satellite catalog can’t produce another potential target that looks as good as this in terms of the orbits and viewing geometry.” Starting on Jan. 20, 2020, Cosmos 2542 had conducted a series of maneuvers to change its position and timing to match USA 245’s “orbital period.” The Russian satellite had previously been circling the planet in the same plane as its American counterpart, Thompson explained, but in such a way that the two only came relatively close to each other once every 11 to 12 days. “Note that any two satellites in the same plane with offset periods will have passes like this at some regular cadence,” Thomspon added. “It’s enough to raise suspicion, but not prove anything.” However, how Cosmos 2542 is orbiting now means that it now has a “consistent view” of USA 245. “As I’m typing this, that offset distance shifts between 150 and 300km depending on the location in the orbit,” according to Thompson. A spacing of 150 to 300 kilometers, or between 93 and just short of 186 and a half miles, may not seem “close” by terrestrial standards, but it is for objects circling Earth in the vacuum of space at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. “The relative orbit is actually pretty cleverly designed, where Cosmos 2542 can observe one side of the KH11 when both satellites first come into sunlight, and by the time they enter eclipse, it has migrated to the other side,” Thompson Tweeted, meaning that the Russian satellite has the potential opportunity to observe both sides of USA 245. Cosmos 2542 had already been involved in other curious activities since its launch in November 2019. On Dec. 6, 2019, Russia announced that it had deployed another smaller satellite, dubbed Cosmos 2543, while in orbit. Nico Janssen, another satellite observer, noted that USA 245 had shifted its own orbit between Dec. 9 and Dec. 10, possibly to prevent a collision with Cosmos 2543, according to RussianSpaceWeb.com . Janssen had also noted that Cosmos 2542 had synchronized its orbit with the American spy satellite. It’s still unclear what, if anything, in particular, Cosmos 2542 might actually be doing in this new orbit. One possibility is that it could be using onboard systems, such as cameras or other sensors, to gather information about the KH-11, the capabilities of which are highly classified. The Russian Ministry of Defense has said that the satellites exact capabilities are classified, but Interfax reported that its cameras are also capable of Earth imaging, in addition to monitoring other satellites in the inspector role, according to RussianSpaceWeb.com . Thompson questioned the intelligence value of visually observing the exterior of the American satellite, pointing out that publicly available information has already allowed for good estimates as to the basic imaging capabilities of these spy satellites, the first variations of which entered service in the 1970s. Of course, USA 245 was last of the most modern KH-11 Block IV satellites, also known as the Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System, to be launched and there may still be value in examining it externally. It may also be possible to gather electronic or signals intelligence data that could be of additional value. Beyond that, the ability of Cosmos 2542 to get into this position at all is notable and is exactly the kind of orbital maneuvering that the U.S. government had pointed to in the past evidence of potential “ killer satellites .” A highly maneuverable, but small satellite could possibly get close enough to disrupt the operation of, disable, or destroy another object in space using a variety of means, ranging from electronic warfare jammers to directed energy weapons, such as a laser. When it comes to spy satellites, it might be possible to just spray chemicals or other materials that blind or otherwise damage the lenses on their cameras. A low power laser could also blind optics persistently if the attack satellite were to be able to get in a good position. A killer satellite could also just simply smash into its intended target to try to damage or destroy it. A US Defense Intelligence Agency disagram showing the various means by which one satellite might attack another., DIA Russia insists that its inspector satellites are only in orbit for their ostensible mission of being available to get close to the country’s other space-based systems and examine them if they break down or otherwise malfunction. However, Thompson notes that the only other satellites in this particular plane are Cosmos 2523, Cosmos 2543, and the Russian commercial remote sensing satellite Resurs-P1 . Cosmos 2523 is another inspector satellite. Cosmos 2523 is also part of a group of Russian satellites that observers have previously watched perform various curious maneuvers back in 2018, as well. Whatever Cosmos 2542 is or isn’t doing, its present position is clearly deliberate and it is hard to see how it would not be related in some way to the position of USA 245. It is worth noting that this is hardly the first time similar confluences in orbit have occurred and that observers have spotted U.S. satellites possibly examining foreign satellites in the past, as well. Russia is known to be interested in anti-satellite capacities and has developed or is developing a number of terrestrial anti-satellite weapons, including ground-based and air-launched interceptors , too. China is pursuing similar developments , as well. The appearance of Cosmos 2542 in its new orbit also comes as the U.S. military is very publicly working to address concerns about the increasing vulnerability of various space-based systems that it relies on heavily. These space-based capabilities range from space-based early-warning systems to intelligence gathering platforms such as the KH-11 to satellites supporting navigation and communications , all of which would absolutely critical in any potential future conflict. The most obvious expression of this recent push is the creation of U.S. Space Force , an entirely new branch of the U.S. military to focus on American military activities in and related to space, as well as the procurement of satellites and other related systems and infrastructure. The Soyuz-2-1v/Volga space launch vehicle carrying Cosmos 2542 blasts off from Plesetsk Cosmodrome on Nov. 25, 2019., Russian Ministry of Defense One of Space Force’s immediate tasks will be to simply craft an understanding of what a future war in space might actually look like, which is an ever-increasingly realistic prospect, as The War Zone has highlighted on numerous occasions in the past. Despite this reality, basic definitions of what a conflict in space might entail and how the U.S. might act in response, including possible shows of force or direct retaliation , significant issues that The War Zone has also previously examined in-depth . “There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson had said at the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium in 2019. It remains unclear exactly what she meant, but her comments certainly indicated an increasingly tense environment for the U.S. military in space. “The central point is that we need a cadre of people who grow up and spend their whole careers learning and thinking: ‘how we dogfight in space,'” Air Force Major General Clinton Crosier, the Deputy to the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, said at RAND Corporation think tank event in 2019. “Our adversaries have things on orbit that are looking at ways to do harm to our systems.” U.S. military officials and politicians have also called for the declassification of more information about U.S. military space capabilities, which could potentially help explain what options may be available to deter or respond to potential threats in orbit. “In many cases in the Department [of Defense], we’re just so overclassified it’s ridiculous, just unbelievably ridiculous,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, the present Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a recent Air Force Association gathering, speaking broadly about classification issues, according to Defense News . How to react to the activities of foreign satellites, such as Cosmos 2542, where it may not be clear what the threat is, or if there even is one, is exactly the kind of issue that the U.S. military, and the new Space Force, in particular, will only increasingly be faced with as time goes on.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 1, 2020","Navy To Greatly Expand P-8 Poseidon’s Mission With New Missiles, Mines, Bombs, And Decoys","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says that it is interested in dramatically expanding the arsenal of weapons that its P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft are capable of carrying. The service says that it wants to start by integrating the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, on the planes, but then potentially move on to add various air-launched naval mines , precision-guided bombs, and the Miniature Air Launched Decoy , or MALD, to the available loadout options. There has been a debate within the Navy for years about giving the P-8As the ability to employ more types of munitions and other stores, which could turn these aircraft into arsenal ships of sorts capable of performing missions beyond anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare, and search and rescue, something The War Zone has been following for years now. On Jan. 28, 2020, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) issued a notice on the Federal government’s new central contracting website beta.SAM.gov, asking for contractors to submit information about their capabilities for integrating LRASM and the various other weapons onto the P-8A. LRASM, which is derived from the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) land-attack cruise missile, entered service last year on the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , as well as the U.S. Air Force’s B-1B Bone bombers . “The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), PMA-290 (Program Office for P-8A aircraft), is soliciting information from industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to perform aeromechanical and software integration of the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) onto the P-8A aircraft,” the contracting notice reads . There is also “the potential to include, but not limited to, the following additional weapon systems: 500 lb to 2,000 lb class of Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) variants, Mk62/63/65 mines, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD), Bomb Rack Unit BRU-55, and Universal Armament Interface (UAI). Engineering tasks for this effort includes, but are not limited to upgrades to the Boeing Tactical Open Mission Systems (TOMS) and Stores Management Computer (SMC) software and interfaces, test planning, execution, data reduction, and reporting on flight test efforts.” At present, the P-8A’s armament options consist of the AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile and the Mk 54 air-launched lightweight torpedo. The Navy is also already working on integrating Mk 54s with the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) kit onto the aircraft, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . HAAWC adds pop-out wings and tail fins to the standard torpedoes, which will allow Poseidon crews to employ them from a standoff range. A US Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft armed with an AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile prepared to take off from Kadena Air Base in Japan., USN The stealthy LRASM, which has been in development since 2014, is an obvious choice to give the P-8As a more capable standoff anti-surface warfare weapon over the aging Harpoon and has been a planned addition to the aircraft’s arsenal for some time. You can read more about this missile here . The possible addition of the Mk 62, 63, and 65 naval mines, collectively known as the Quickstrike family, which you can read about in-depth in this past War Zone story , also makes good sense. The Navy has been re-investing heavily in naval mine warfare, including developing new air, surface, and submarine-launched types, as a means of improving its ability to respond to a future large scale and very likely distributed maritime conflict, especially in the Pacific region. There are standoff wing kits now in development for the Mk 62 and Mk 63 mines, which would also enable the Poseidons to emplace maritime minefields from a safer standoff distance. The U.S. Air Force is already actively exploring this concept using its B-52H bombers . Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB-II), now also known as the GBU-53/B StormBreaker , is a small munition with standoff capabilities and a multi-mode guidance capability, allowing it to engage static or moving targets in any weather and at standoff ranges. A P-8A loaded with GBU-53/Bs would be a powerful tool against swarms of manned or unmanned small boats . The ability of the Poseidons to carry a large number of those munitions in place of larger weapons, combined with the aircraft’s range, sensor, and endurance abilities, could enable it to provide a more persistent defense against those types of threats across a broad area. The Navy’s largely retired P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft had the ability to engage smaller targets from a distance with AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missiles, a capability that did not get carried over to the P-8A. The inclusion of Joint Direct Attack Munition-series GPS-guided bombs and the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) are especially interesting because they point to potential future mission sets for the P-8A beyond purely maritime operations. With the exception of Laser JDAM variants, munitions in this family are not capable of engaging moving targets, such as ships or other watercraft sailing on bodies of water. The same standoff wing kit in development now for certain Quickstrike mines was also originally intended to help give JDAMs additional range and could become an additional capability for the P-8As in the future. StormBreaker also has the ability to engage land-based targets, including moving vehicles. Again, the P-8A’s range and endurance, combined with its overall payload capacity, and its vast array of sensors, could help turn the aircraft into more of a multi-mission weapons truck. Similarly, though the various versions of MALD, including the newest MALD-X, which you can read about in-depth in this past War Zone story , could distract and confuse the air defense systems on enemy warships and shores. In addition to helping to protect itself on the way to a target area, the P-8A could use its large payload capacity to employ significant numbers of MALDs in support of other combat aircraft and cruise missiles as they wend their way to their objectives. It’s not necessarily surprising that the Navy would be interested in growing the P-8A’s arsenal and, as a result, its mission sets. As mentioned earlier, there has been a debate going on about exactly this in the Navy’s maritime patrol community since around when the Poseidon first entered Navy service in late 2013. In 2014, a Navy maritime patrol pilot that had time flying the P-3 and the P-8 told The War Zone ‘s own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha , the following : “There are currently two schools of thought in the maritime patrol community right now when it comes to how the P-8 should be used. One where it works closely along the lines of its predecessor, and follows the P-3’s traditional mission sets of ASuW [anti-surface warfare], ASW [anti-submarine warfare], and limited ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance], and another where the P-8 can be adapted more dramatically for a litany of missions, including direct attack on ground targets. Personally, I believe the P-8A should also be equipped with a more robust set of weapons and sensors for the fight against smaller vessels in constrained littoral environments.” “Harpoon is a great weapon, but it’s too imprecise to use with civilian shipping nearby and in dense target environments close to shore. P-3C had a robust short-range ASuW capability with AGM-65 Mavericks, and we saw that used in Libya . We took a major step back capability-wise with only Harpoon being deployed aboard the P-8. I would equip P-8A with an off-the-shelf targeting pod such as the AAQ-33 Sniper [Advanced Targeting Pod], which is currently found on everything from USAF F-16s to B-52s. Couple the targeting pod with short-range, laser-guided munitions such as AGM-65 Laser Mavericks, AGM-176 Griffin , and/or or Small Diameter Bombs and you have a lethal and persistent weapons system.” By 2017, a P-8A pilot from the Navy’s Patrol Squadron Five (VP-5), the “Mad Foxes,” told The War Zone that this same debate was still ongoing, explaining: Tyler Rogoway: “There seems to be two different forms of thought within the maritime patrol community as to how the P-8 and its mission set will evolve. One points to a much broader set of missions, where P-8s may even support ground troops, or provide overland armed reconnaissance, or even work as an arsenal ship along with other functions. The French are doing some of this with their old Atlantique IIs today, kinetic missions included. On the other hand, more traditionalists in the maritime patrol community want to keep the aircraft locked more strictly in traditional ASW, ASuW, sea control and surveillance roles. How do you think the P-8 and its crews will evolve in the coming years?” Pilot: “This is purely my own opinion, but what we have seen from the fleet and combatant commanders, is that they want to keep the P-8 a maritime ISR and submarine tracking platform. The aircraft is optimized for this mission set, but it is being expanded with future capabilities like AAS [Advanced Airborne Sensor]. I believe that you will start to eventually see an evolution of the P-8 over time, in that as the P-3 and EP-3 begin to be phased out, the P-8 will slowly pick up those mission sets. I do not think it will ever become a true overland weapons truck asset; however, the plane definitely has the capability to accomplish these mission sets if the need arises.” The recent NAVAIR contracting announcement strongly suggests that the proponents of expanding the P-8A’s mission set and giving it the ability to carry additional munitions and other stores to realize that expansion, have won the debate after all these years. It’s not entirely clear what the Navy’s timeline might be for when the aircraft may gain the ability to employ weapons such as SDB-IIs or JDAMs, but the goal certainly now seems to be to integrate these munitions in the future. The contract notice says that the prospective period of performance would run from 2021 to 2026. The added armament options could be of interest to the P-8A’s growing international user base, as well. Australia and India already operate Poseidons, while the United Kingdom is looking to stand up its first squadron this year. Norway , New Zealand , and South Korea all have aircraft on order and there are a number of other prospective customers , as well. All told, the next few years look set to be a very important and exciting time for the Navy’s P-8A squadrons and their place in the service’s overall concepts of operation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 17, 2020",This Is What Nellis Air Force Base’s Ongoing Red Flag Exercise Looks Like From Space,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Red Flag is traditionally the world’s premier air combat exercise and it serves as the foundation of allied aerial warfare cooperation and interoperability that is absolutely crucial for fighting and winning wars in a coalition environment. Having been finely tuned and evolved over 45 years, the mother of all large force employment (LFE) drills takes place over the vast Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) complex that encompasses a massive portion of southern Nevada. The majority of the aircraft involved launch and recover at the famed Nellis Air Force Base, located at the tip of North Las Vegas. A few times a year, the base gets flooded with domestic and international flying units and from here Vegas’s biggest and most expensive show is put on, albeit one that few of the strip dwellers to the south even know exists. Red Flag, which first sprung from lessons learned during the Vietnam war, namely that if an aircrew survives their first 10 missions they are far more likely to survive their entire combat tour, is more critical now than ever before. Air combat is becoming ever more complex. Pilots will face advanced and intricate threat scenarios that often times cannot be replicated on their local training ranges. These include advanced and unfamiliar ground-based threats and a robust and highly trained aggressor force in the air, as well as complex electronic warfare tactics , and more. The Nellis range complex has evolved over the years to support these training situations and new live-virtual-constructive training is being introduced to make what can’t be done on the physical range a reality, as well. The huge NTTR airspace and the range and restricted areas that lie below it. 4808A, aka “The Box,” is the extremely restricted airspace around Area 51 that even Red Flag participants cannot penetrate. , RAND RAND So, with all that in mind, a few times a year dozens of military aircraft and hundreds of personnel migrate to southern Nevada to attend the holy grail of air combat training. Each Red Flag is different. They are uniquely tailored both in storyline/scenario and in scope to the attending force’s size, capabilities, and security concerns. Although the Red Flags that have the most diverse set of foreign and local players, and the largest armada of aircraft, get the most publicity, the smaller ones that include just America’s closest allies often are the most cutting-edge in terms of new and sensitive capabilities and adversary challenges being presented during training. This is precisely the type of Red Flag that is currently underway at Nellis. Red Flag 20-1 has been one of the least publicized Red Flags in memory. Official photos and video from the event are slim, to say the least. The only foreign flying participants are the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force—two of America’s closest allies that are also customers of its most advanced military aerospace exports. This intimate, smaller, and quieter Red Flag allows for a level of training and advanced tactics and capabilities integration not possible when lesser allies are present. Just three official images of participating aircraft at Nellis have been posted from Red Flag 20-1, although more may appear now that the second half of the exercise is underway: 119th Fighter Squadron Block 30 F-16C arrives at Red Flag. , USAF 41 Squadron, RAF, Typhoon FGR4 on the runway at Nellis during Red Flag.  , USAF VAQ-135 EA-18Gs taxi out for a Red Flag sortie. , USAF The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has brought their F/A-18F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers , and E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft. The Royal Air Force has brought their Typhoon FGR4s , F-35B Lightnings , and an A330 Voyager Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). The Air Force has a variety of aircraft playing a part as usual, including F-35s, F-16Cs, B-1Bs, RC-135Vs, E-3Gs, EA-18Gs, EC-130H, HH-60Gs, and HC-130Js. Here is a list based on a few combined sources of the players at Red Flag 20-1: 1 Squadron, RAAF – F/A-18F 6 Squadron RAAF – EA-18G 2 Squadron RAAF – E-7A 101 Squadron RAF  – A330 MRTT 41 Squadron RAF – Typhoon FGR4 617 Squadron RAF – F-35B 421st Fighter Squadron – F-35A 119th Fighter Squadron – F-16C VAQ 135 – EA-18G 37th Bomb Squadron – B-1B 343rd Reconnaissance Squadron – RC-135V 41st Electronic Combat Squadron – EC-130H 960th Airborne Air Control Squadron – E-3G 66th Rescue Squadron – HH-60G 79th Rescue Squadron – HC-130J 64th Aggressor Squadron – F-16C/D Draken International Aggressors- A-4K, L-159/39 You will note how heavily electronic warfare (EW) is playing a role in this Red Flag iteration, with Navy and RAAF Growlers involved, as well as an EC-130H Compass Call . The F-35 also possesses one of the most capable electronic warfare suites on the planet. EW is one of the most sensitive capabilities the U.S. and its allies possess. Being able to more freely apply it during a Red Flag with no other international players opens the door to bringing the latest and greatest EW capabilities to the forefront of the mock air war, both in terms of the ‘blue force’ allies and the ‘red force’ bad guys. Also note, these are the aircraft we know about flying from Nellis. Other assets will be brought in from remote locations, some of which may be entirely classified , or at least not disclosed , in nature, as well as the electronic warfare capabilities deployed on the range itself. There is also one other aircraft that has arrived ahead of Red Flag that is totally new to the Nellis ramp—Draken International’s refurbished and upgraded Mirage F-1s. The first example is now at the base, although it is unclear if it is participating in Red Flag 20-1. You can read more about these advanced aggressors in these past posts of ours linked here and here . With all that being said, you can take a look at what Nellis AFB looks like from space during such an operation.

Seven A-4s, 10 L-159/L-39s, and the first Mirage F-1 advanced aggressor to arrive at the base are visible. These aircraft are essential to bolstering the resident 64th Aggressor Squadron’s “red air” ranks in order to challenge 5th generation fighters like the F-35 and F-22, and those 4th generation fighters equipped with AESA radar systems. You can and should watch a clip of how aircraft like the F-22 run these jets down on the NTTR by clicking here . The Air Force is investing in the private aggressor support big time, with seven companies being tapped recently to provide these services all over the U.S. and beyond. Still, Nellis has been the proving ground for this concept as the USAF is years behind the Navy in adopting it. As such, the Nellis ramp will become increasingly crowded with these ‘adversaries for hire’ in the years to come. In addition to Draken’s lineup, a special operations/combat search and rescue HC-130J is seen next to the RAAF’s E-7A Wedgetail . The E-7A is among if not the most advanced AEW&C aircraft in the world and is part of Australia’s deep investment in electronic surveillance and electronic warfare aircraft as of late.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 31, 2019",Thousands Of Army Bradleys Don’t Have The Power To Use New Active Protection Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The vast majority of the U.S. Army’s Bradley Fighting Vehicles cannot be fitted with a new Israeli-made active protection system for one simple reason, they cannot generate enough power to operate it. The service is in the process of upgrading a number of Bradleys to a new configuration with an auxiliary power unit that will enable them to carry the Iron Fist Light system. At present, however, it expects to leave most of these armored vehicles in their existing form in favor of developing an all-new replacement design , a program that has recently hit major hurdles, leading to the cancellation of a planned competition. The Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, revealed the power generation issues in its annual report on the progress of various high-profile U.S. military procurement programs during the 2019 Fiscal Year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2019. The Army had first announced that it had picked Israeli defense contractor Elbit’s Iron Fist Light as its choice for a new active protection system for its Bradleys in December 2018. “The fielded Bradley A3 does not generate sufficient power to operate the APS,” DOT&E states bluntly in its report . “The Bradley A4 power components, currently under development, can support this APS solution.” A diagram showing the locations of various Iron Fist Light system components on the Bradley., DOD The Army has been actively working to add active protection systems to all of its major armored vehicle platforms, such as the Bradley, the M1 Abrams tank , and the Stryker family of wheeled vehicles, in recent years. The ever-growing threat of anti-tank guided missiles , as well as advanced shoulder-fired infantry anti-tank weapons, is the primary driver behind these efforts. The service is particularly concerned about how vulnerable these vehicles might be to these types of weapons in major conflict as a “great power” competitor, such as Russia. At the same time, these advanced anti-tank missiles and other anti-tank weapons are increasingly proliferating to smaller militaries and even non-state actors , making them a near-universal challenge for U.S. military mechanized operations. Anti-tank guided missiles have been a major factor in the conflict in Syria over the years. Last year, the Army briefly deployed Bradleys to help protect oil and gas fields in Eastern Syria. Active protection systems come in many forms and Iron Fist Light falls into the so-called “hard-kill” category. This means that the system employs small radars and infrared cameras to spot incoming missile or rockets. It then fires a shotgun-like burst of projectiles at the threat to destroy it. The Iron Fist Light system includes a number of these turrets, each of which can hold two “counter-muntions” that fire shotgun-like bursts at incoming threats. Only one inert counter-munition is installed in this instance., Joseph Trevithick Israel has been a pioneer in the development of such systems, with Rafael’s Trophy system being among the best known given its good record in actual combat service with the Israel Defense Forces. The U.S. Army has already begun installing Trophy, which functions similarly to Iron Fist Light, on its M1 Abrams tanks. The integration of Iron Fist Light onto the Bradley had reportedly experienced separate technical and other problems beyond the power generation issue. “Phase I demonstrated an inconsistent capability of the Iron Fist APS to intercept threats largely due to countermunition dudding and power failures to the launcher,” DOT&E explained in its review. “It is not a secret that the Iron Fist was allocated for the Bradley … and the whole process was delayed,” Dov Sella, the CEO of RADA, a subcontractor working for Elbit, told Jane’s 360 in August 2019. “At the end of last year, the U.S. Army decided to continue with Iron Fist and gave a time frame of about 9 [to] 10 months to sharpen the needles, tighten up all loose ends, and come back to testing with a more mature system.” Those issues have reportedly been resolved . However, this doesn’t mean that the majority of Bradleys will necessarily receive the new defensive system in the future. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle family has two primary variants, the M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle, which differ mainly in their internal configuration to support the mechanized infantry and cavalry scout roles, respectively. A number of other more specialized variants have entered service over the years, such a the M7 Bradley Fire Support Team vehicle, or BFIST, which is configured to provide an armored platform to support forward observers. At present, the Army has around 4,500 M2 and M3 Bradleys spread among its units, including those in the Army National Guard, as well as another approximately 2,000 in storage, according to The International Institute for Strategic Studies’ The Military Balance . An M7 BFIST vehicle. This variant notably replaces the TOW missile launcher on the left side of the turret with a large targeting system for spotting and marking targets for both artillery and airstrikes., US Army BAE Systems, the Bradley’s present manufacturer, has been working on the new A4 configuration for the Army since 2012 . The most significant component of the upgrade plan is the auxiliary power unit, together with a modified hull to accommodate it, which the service specifically asked for in order to support plans to add in additional networked communications equipment, more powerful sensors, and other systems, such as Iron Fist Light. The various different Bradley variants that go through the update process will all be designated as A4 variants, such as the M2A4, M3A4, and M7A4. The Army’s present plan is only to upgrade four armored brigades’ worth of Bradleys to the new A4 configuration, according to DOT&E . As of October 2019, the service had only contracted with BAE to bring 641 vehicles – less than 15 percent of the total number of Bradleys in service now –  up to the new standard. The hope is that the first of these vehicles will be ready for combat operations sometime in the 2021 Fiscal Year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2020. A visual look at the maneuver components of a standard Army armored brigade combat team, with Bradleys assigned to various roles. , CBO The plan is to make these upgraded Bradley available to units in need, rather than having them permanently assigned to specific brigades. One of these so-called “brigade sets” of the updated armored vehicles will be permanently situated in Europe. Still, with only four brigades worth in total, the Army will still only have limited numbers of versions equipped with active protection systems to distribute anywhere and to keep in reserve to replace vehicles that suffer serious break downs or are lost in combat. As noted, the existing A3 variants do not generate enough onboard power to adequately run Iron Fist Light, so there would be no way to readily integrate the active protection system onto earlier versions. This could also limit the ability of those Bradleys to accept other updates to their communications and data sharing capabilities or the addition of new sensors or other equipment in the interim. This decision to only acquire a limited number of A4 variants appears to have been, at least in part, the result of the belief that the upgraded Bradleys would only ever be something of an interim vehicle to bridge the gap between the A3 versions and the fielding of the future Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), which will also feature an active protection system of some type. The Army wants to ultimately replace all of its Bradleys with whatever design it picks under the OFMV program, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The service has been pursuing an increasingly aggressive schedule for that new effort, while also scaling back Bradley upgrade plans, including scrapping development of a further improved A5 configuration . It’s not clear if all the work related to that effort has completely come to a halt, though. In January 2020, the Army showed off an experimental Bradley with a new high-mobility, variable-height, hydro-pneumatic suspension system. An experimental Bradley with a high-mobility, hydro-pneumatic suspension system., KYMA capture “The vehicle itself is still on the drawing board,” Mark Schauer, a spokesperson for Army Test and Evaluation Command at Yuma Proving Ground, told KYMA television , a local CBS affiliate in the Yuma, Arizona area. “But we’re testing components that may be used in future vehicles.” Unfortunately, the OMFV program has run into its own troubles and canceled plans for a competition in January 2020 after only one bid met its requirements. The Army has now said it will reexamine its requirements and then issue a new call for proposals. “The most prudent means of ensuring long-term programmatic success is to get this multi-billion-dollar effort correct,” U.S. Army General John M. Murray, head of the service’s Futures Command, said at the time of the cancellation. “We are going to take what we have learned and apply it to the OMFV program to develop our path and build a healthy level of competition back into the program.” The Army has said it wants to begin actually replacing Bradleys with the final OMFV design in 2026. Even if the service meets that schedule, it will take time to replace the thousands of Bradleys now in service. Any delays in the OMFV program can only mean that the Bradley family of vehicles will remain in service that much longer. This, in turn, could push the Army to have to reconsider whether it makes sense to operate thousands of those armored vehicles that are incapable of accepting new defensive equipment for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",Air Force Isn’t Happy With Boeing’s Plans To Fix The KC-46 Tanker’s Troubled Vision System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that it is not sold on Boeing’s proposal for how to fix the troublesome Remote Vision System , or RVS, which boom operators on the service’s new KC-46A Pegasus tankers use to safely guide the aircraft’s refueling boom into receiving aircraft. The difficulties with the existing RVS presently preclude the KC-46As from taking part in combat operations overseas and top U.S. military officials are warning that there may soon be a worrying shortfall in available tankers, as other types get retired . That reality is now is driving renewed consideration of a plan to hire private contractors to provide aerial refueling services in various non-combat settings. On Jan. 31, 2020, Aerospace Daily was first to report the news that the Air Force had balked at Boeing’s plan to overhaul the RVS. In January 2019, the Chicago-headquartered plane maker agreed to develop a new version of the system, incorporating both software and hardware changes, and pay for that work entirely out of pocket. At that time, the company estimated it would take between three and four years just to complete the development of these improvements, which would then still need to be integrated into existing aircraft. As of December 2019, the Air Force had taken delivery of 30 KC-46As already. “The tanker is not capable of all of its missions and won’t be until the problems with the Remote Vision System are fixed,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jon Thomas, the Deputy Commander of Air Mobility Command, who also disclosed that the service was not happy with the proposed RVS plan, told Aerospace Daily . “It’s really hard for us to consider the KC-46 part of our operational capacity.” One of the Air Force’s KC-46A Pegasus tankers., USAF A working remote vision system is absolutely central to the KC-46A’s ability to perform its core aerial refueling mission. Unlike previous Air Force tankers, where the boom operator was actually situated in the rear of the aircraft and could directly see the relationship between the boom and the receiving aircraft, these same personnel on the new KC-46As sit in the aircraft’s main cabin. The present remote vision system fuses video feeds from a number of cameras positioned at the rear of the KC-46A and presents that view to the boom operator on a set of screens at their workstation. The video stream is presented in a hybrid 2D/3D format and operators wear special glasses to get the full 3D effect. You can read more about the system and how it is supposed to work in this previous War Zone piece . Boom operators sit at their workstations wearing their specialized glasses in the main cabin of a KC-46A., USAF Unfortunately, in testing, evaluation, and general training sorties, it has become apparent that various environmental factors, such as shadows and glare , make it difficult for boom operators to get a proper sense of what is actually happening at the back of the aircraft. This raises the risk of the KC-46A’s boom inadvertently striking receiving aircraft. These incidents are dangerous for both parties and could lead to aborted missions due to any resulting damage, especially to the sensitive skins and coatings that modern stealth combat aircraft rely on to keep as concealed as possible from enemy radars. There are also concerns that operators may suffer from eye strain, headaches, vertigo, and other vision issues after prolonged use of the system. Beyond the RVS, the KC-46A has also been plagued by other issues, including those tied to an increase in the force necessary to connect with receiving aircraft compared to previous Air Force tankers, which can also lead to boom strikes. Boeing has reportedly solved one critical issue involving cargo latches unlocking unexpectedly in flight, which also presented a serious hazard for KC-46As performing their secondary, but still important cargo and passenger carrying missions. “We require your attention and improved focus on the KC-46,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein wrote in a letter to Boeing earlier this month, Bloomberg recently reported. “The Air Force continues to accept deliveries of a tanker incapable of performing its primary operational mission.” This all might not necessarily be as much of an issue if the KC-46A program wasn’t years behind schedule already, a saga you can read about in greater depth in this past War Zone story . The Air Force is still planning to begin retire its oldest KC-135R Stratotankers , which the Pegasuses are supposed to replace. At that same time, the service is looking at cutting other legacy aircraft, such as the relatively small KC-10 tanker fleet, to help free up funding for various other priorities. A US Air Force KC-135, at right, refuels a KC-10, at left., USAF “We’ve got to figure out a way to mitigate the delayed fielding of the KC-46,” U.S. Army General Stephen Lyons, the present head of U.S. Transportation Command, said at a gathering at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington on Jan. 28, 2019 “That delay is built-in, and the Air Force had already planned on the retirement of some number of KC-135 Stratotankers and KC-10 Extenders, if we’re not careful we’re going to see a dip … in taskable tails for the joint force.” The Air Force is considering delaying the planned retirement of at least some KC-135s, but it’s unclear if that will help mitigate the situation. The future of the KC-10s, which the service had originally intended to replace with another tanker design that would come after the KC-46A, is uncertain. General Lyons said at the Atlantic Council that his command was looking at the possibility of leasing tankers from private contractors for non-combat missions, such as supporting training and test and evaluation sorties. “We wouldn’t be able to employ that capability in a contested environment, but nonetheless … much like we do on airlift, it would be able to take the pressure off,” he continued . “I haven’t seen the business case on that yet,” Lyons added . However, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps have already been utilizing contractor air refueling support, from a company called Omega Air , for almost 20 years, for exactly this reason. For months now, Transportation Command itself has also been in the process of outlining exactly what it might want from aerial refueling contractors on a much broader scale specifically to answer questions that their command officer and other senior officials might have. Various threshold and objective requirements from a draft contract for contractor aerial refueling services that Transportation Command is refining right now., TRANSCOM TRANSCOM The War Zone has written extensively in the past about the potential savings and operational benefits that could be had from shifting various non-combat aerial refueling tasks to contractors. Private companies certainly see a market emerging, too, with Omega Air recently acquiring its first boom-equipped tanker , which would allow it to support U.S. Air Force aircraft, and Lockheed Martin and Airbus announcing a partnership last year that included plans for offering new tanker leasing and contractor-operated tanker services in the United States. As The War Zone has noted in the past , it might even be possible for the Air Force to divest some or all of its KC-10 fleet straight into the hands of private companies, who could then operate them on a contract basis. The tanker that Omega Air just obtained is an ex-Royal Netherlands Air Force KDC-10 that is very similar to the Extender. Other boom-equipped tanker fleets, including KC-135Rs that other air forces around the world are retiring now , could also be options to build these private fleets. “We are taking a look at that,” Lyons said of contractor aerial refueling at the Atlantic Council event, despite his stated reticence to the idea. It’s “ worth a look ” he added. If delays and other troubles with the KC-46A persist, whatever officers such as Lyons may think of employing contractors, there may be few better choices available to make for remediating potentially critical shortfalls in aerial refueling tanker capacity.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 25, 2019",Here’s Our Analysis Of The Air Force’s New B-21 Stealth Bomber Renderings,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details about the U.S. Air Force’s new, secret B-21 Raider stealth bomber have so far been limited, but some have emerged since the service announced that it had picked Northrop Grumman to build it 2015. However, since then, there has only been a single piece of official concept art of the aircraft – that is until now. On Jan. 31, 2020, the Air Force, together with Northrop Grumman, released three new renderings of the B-21. All of them feature the same artist’s concept of the aircraft photoshopped into real pictures of hangars at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. In March 2019, the Air Force announced that Ellsworth would be the first base to host an operational Raider squadron. Whiteman and Dyess, which presently host B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and B-1 Bone supersonic bombers, respectively, are also set to get B-21s after Ellsworth. Here are the new renderings: USAF USAF USAF Though the renderings certainly still lack a certain level of detail, the B-2’s influence on the B-21 , including the position and style of the cockpit, is clear. There are a number of other very important features that are also now more visible. The B-21’s nearly flush inlets and blended conformal engine nacelles are more apparent now, a key low-observable characteristic that is somewhat revolutionary for the design. Boeing’s new MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone for the U.S. Navy also uses a type of flush inlet design, but one that is more straight forward than the B-21’s configuration. Flush and blended inlets, in particular, are notoriously challenging and complex to realize, since they can cause various airflow problems for an aircraft’s engines buried deep inside the fuselage. One of the few details about the B-21 program to emerge is that the inlets had, unsurprisingly, caused some consternation for Northrop Grumman’s engineers during the plane’s development. They do, however, offer immense advantages in terms when it comes to further reducing the radar signature of an aircraft. The very different inlet configuration on the B-2 versus renderings of the B-21 is apparent in this picture, which has been mirrored for easier comparison between the two., USAF Based on the new renderings, it is also apparent that the B-21 has a more abrupt chine line on its forward leading edge and lacks the more steeply sloping sides that blend the leading edge with the fuselage that are found on its predecessor, the B-2. The lack of the B-2’s beak-like nose is apparent. All these features offer additional stealth benefits. In addition, the renderings show that the B-21 has a main landing gear and gear door arrangement that is similar to that on the B-2, but which notably has main gear doors with serrated edges. The Spirit’s main landing gear doors are trapezoidal. The nosegear is very similar to the one found on the B-2, with a similar two-door setup, but with a different pattern of serrations along their edges. A side view of a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, clearly showing the trapezoidal main landing gear doors. The differences in the chine line and beak, as well as the inlet configuration again, on the B-2 as compared to the renderings of the B-21 is also visible., USAF Also, importantly, the B-21’s main landing gear are two-wheel designs, rather than the four-wheel ones found on the B-2. This reflects the Raider’s lower gross weight and smaller overall size than the Spirit, something The War Zone has discussed in detail in the past. What isn’t shown in this new perspective is the B-21’s diamond-like trailing edge, which differs from the B-2’s sawtooth trailing-edge, a feature that was revised as part of a hugely expensive redesign in the mid-1980s that aimed to give the B-2 low-altitude penetration capabilities. The new trailing edge will likely allow the new bomber to fly at much higher altitudes than its predecessor. You can read all about this critical ‘back to the future’ design choice in this past exclusive feature of ours. Original B-21 concept art showing its diamond trailing-edge. , USAF Much about the B-21 still remains unknown and it’s not clear when we may get a look at the actual aircraft, the first of which are under construction now. The Air Force expects to fly the B-21 for the first time in late 2021 , but it is very possible that that schedule could slip. Regardless, we will be seeing the jet sooner than later as it is slated to start its test program at Edwards AFB not long after its first flight. Still, years after the first piece of B-21 concept art, which had very limited detail, was released, we at least have a new and slightly more comprehensive look at America’s next stealth bomber.

The United States quietly withdrew Army National Guard M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles from Eastern Syria less than two months after making a very public show of sending the armored vehicles to that country late last year. This revelation comes amid continuing questions about the future of the U.S. military presence in Syria, in general. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel David Olson, a spokesperson for U.S. Army Central and Third Army, the service’s top headquarters for operations across the Middle East, confirmed to The War Zone that the Bradleys and other elements of the South Carolina Army National Guard’s 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, had withdrawn from Syria by the end of November 2019. The armored infantry fighting vehicles and accompanying infantry and other support elements had first deployed to sites in the Eastern Syrian province of Deir Ez Zor on Oct. 31, 2019. That came in the wake of a hasty withdrawal of other U.S. forces in the region in the aftermath of a major Turkish military incursion into Northern Syria, aimed primarily at ejecting the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) from the area. “A few M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles did deploy to Syria in late October 2019, but returned to Kuwait in November,” Olson explained. “They were part of a security force that protected the oil fields in Syria from ISIS until we withdrew our troops in November.” Olson also confirmed that there were no other elements of the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team still in Syria. 4-118th Infantry is part of the 30th, which first deployed to Kuwait at the beginning of October 2019 as part of a nine-month rotation in support of Operation Spartan Shield , a standing regional contingency operation. Bradleys and other vehicles assigned to 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, conduct a patrol in Syria in November 2019., US Army It is not entirely clear how long it took the Army to redeploy the Bradleys and other personnel from 4-118th Infantry from Syria to Kuwait. Publicly released pictures show at least some of the armored vehicles at the U.S. military-operated portion of Erbil International Airport in the city of the same name in Northern Iraq, about to be airlifted, likely to Kuwait, in December 2019. U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo aircraft had flown the vehicles and associated personnel and equipment into Syria at the beginning of the deployment.

An Iraqi Air Force C-130 Hercules airlifter is seen taxiing at right., US Army A US Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo aircraft offloads a Bradley in Syria on Nov. 1, 2019., US Army We also don’t know if any additional U.S. forces deployed to Eastern Syria to take over for the departing elements of the 4-118th Infantry. However, there are no Bradley-equipped units publicly forward-deployed to the region at present that do not belong to the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team and Lieutenant Colonel Olson says that the brigade as a whole does not have any personnel presently in Syria. There are still American troops in Deir Ez Zor, including at a site known as Green Village and another one within the Conoco gas field. On Jan. 24, 2020, U.S. Army Specialist Antonio Moore, assigned to the Army Reserve’s 363rd Engineer Battalion, part of the 411th Engineer Brigade, died when his vehicle rolled over at an unspecified location in the province. The Pentagon said that Moore was taking part in a “route clearance” operation, which involves patrolling roads to sweep for mines, improvised explosive devices, and other hazards to ensure they remain safe to travel on. The War Zone was among the first to report on the presence of dedicated Army route clearance units in Syria in 2017. A map showing the general zones of influence in Syria as of March 2019, boundaries that have changes dramatically since then. However it does still show a number of important locations, including the general location of both the Green Village and Conoco gas field forward operating locations, seen marked to the east of the city of Deir Ez Zor, the capital of the Syrian province of the same name., CRS Between 500 and 600 American personnel remain in Syria in total at a number of forward operating bases, according to a recent report from The Washington Post . Beyond the locations in Deir Ez Zor, other personnel are situated in the northeast corner of Syria , as well as at a garrison at At Tanf to the southeast near the borders with Iraq and Jordan. At the time of writing, U.S. Army Central and Third Army have not yet responded to follow-up questions about whether the withdrawal of the Bradleys and the rest of the contingent from 4-118th Infantry was scheduled or whether they left early in response to shifting operational requirements. So, it is possible that commanders on the ground determined that there was no longer a need for the additional firepower, protection, and situational awareness the armored vehicles offered with their 25mm Bushmaster cannons, TOW anti-tank missiles, and onboard electro-optical and infrared optics. As we at The War Zone had noted when the U.S. military first announced the deployment , the Bradleys also presented a major logistical burden, especially when forward-deployed to austere locations. It was always unclear how long the Army would be able to adequately sustain the armored vehicles and the rest of the contingent from 4-118th Infantry in Eastern Syria. Regardless, we do know that the U.S. military was still eager to highlight the presence of the Bradleys into November. “The most important story is the Bradleys,” U.S. Army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Cynthia King told reporters , as you can see in the video below, during an officially sanctioned visit to Deir Ez Zor to see the vehicles and learn about the U.S. mission in Syria during the second week of the month. “Combat power, that’s what the Bradley brings to the fight,” she continued. Of course, there is nothing, necessarily, to prevent the United States from redeploying Bradleys back to eastern Syria, if the need arises again. The U.S. military has now demonstrated its ability to move heavy armored forces to forward locations in the region on relatively short notice. Still, the short duration of the Bradleys’ time in Syria last year can only raise new questions about the future of the U.S. military’s mission in Deir Ez Zor, as well as the country as a whole. American forces and their coalition partners only recently resumed operations against ISIS terrorists following a halt to those activities in both Syria and Iraq in the aftermath of the drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani , then head of Iran’s Quds Force, in Baghdad on Jan. 3, 2020. U.S. forces throughout the Middle East had refocused their attention to defending themselves against any retaliatory attacks, a decision that seemed prudent in light of an unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strike aimed at American forces in Iraq on Jan. 7. The U.S. government now says that 34 troops were injured in that strike, including a large number of traumatic brain injuries. U.S. diplomatic and military personnel in Iraq have also been subjected to repeated rocket attacks in recent months, including one that occurred just overnight that caused minor damage and injured at least one individual within the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. “I frankly don’t know how long we’re going to be here,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, presently the head of U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to U.S. facilities in Syria, according to The Washington Post . “And I have no instructions other than to continue to work with our partner [the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF] here.” U.S. Air Force Major General Alexus Grynkewich, who is the Deputy Commander of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the official name of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, had told reporters on Jan. 23 that the SDF were the ones primarily responsible for securing what is now referred to as the “eastern Syria security area” in Deir Ez Zor. “The task to defend the oilfields, to make sure that ISIS can’t get access to those resources, that’s also being done in concert with the Syrian Democratic Forces, who frankly benefit from having access to those resources themselves as well,” he said. Syrian Democratic Forces personnel on parade at the Omar Academy in Deir Ez Zor, Syria, in 2019., US Army At the same time, President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to withdraw all American forces from Syria, which he has described in the past as little more than “ sand and death .” U.S. military personnel have already ceded a number of forward operating bases to Turkish forces, as well as their local partners, along with Russian troops, who are operating under a separate deal that Moscow cut with Ankara in late 2019. There have been an increasing number of altercations between U.S. and Russian forces in northeastern Syria in recent weeks, where American troops have sought to block Russia’s personnel from continuing their patrols into certain areas closer to the Iraqi border. There are still unconfirmed reports of an actual fistfight between the parties last month. The U.S. Special Representative for Syria Ambassador James Jeffery acknowledged “dustups” had occurred during a press conference on Jan. 24, but downplayed the apparent tensions. It’s worth noting that, despite their ostensible counter-ISIS mission, the Bradleys had also presented a more tangible threat to more heavily armed and armored Russian troops, as well as other contingents aligned with the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. In 2018, it took withering U.S. airpower to brush back Russian mercenaries and Syrian militiamen equipped with T-72 tanks and heavy artillery that had attempted to eject SDF units and their American advisors from the Conoco gas field in Deir Ez Zor. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jh1oe_Kdx8c “Our mission in Syria today remains the same as it was when we first began operations in 2014; to enable the enduring defeat of Daesh,” the CJTF-OIR public affairs office told The War Zone , using another name for ISIS, in response to questions about the Bradleys and the continued U.S. presence in eastern Syria. “ISIS fighters are still operating in the region and relentless pressure from our SDF partners is keeping them from resurging. We are maintaining our presence in northeast Syria and at At Tanf garrison to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and deny ISIS access to oil fields in NE [northeastern] Syria.” How the American military’s posture in Syria continues to evolve in 2020, especially given heightened tensions with Iran and its proxies throughout the Middle East, remains to be seen. What we do know for sure is that, at least for the moment, the presence of U.S. heavy armored forces in eastern Syria was brief, despite how heavily U.S. officials promoted the deployment. UPDATE: 1/31/2020 U.S. Army Central and Third Army spokesperson U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel David Olson has provided The War Zone with additional information about the deployment of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles and other elements of the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team to Syria. Approximately 100 members of the brigade actually are still in Syria “doing some logistical and support tasks in Syria,” Olson said, but confirmed again that the heavy armored vehicles were withdrawn last year. “So, they were not replaced” directly with additional forces, he added. “The Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFVs) were in Syria for a short period of time as part of a security force to guard oil fields. Commanders routinely reposition forces and equipment to respond to needs based on an assessment of mission requirements on the ground,” he continued. “In this case, the mission requirements changed so we removed the BFVs out of Syria.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Americas Around The Globe Middle East News & Features Syria U.S. Homeland"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 8, 2020",Here’s Why Patriot Missiles Weren’t Protecting US Troops In Iraq And Why They Still Aren’t,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military wants to send Patriot surface-to-air missile units to Iraq in the wake of unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at American forces in the country earlier this month, which the Pentagon now says caused dozens of injuries in addition to significant damage to facilities at Al Asad Air Base. However, the U.S. government still needs permission from authorities in Iraq to do so, approval that has so far not been forthcoming, something The War Zone ‘s Tyler Rogoway had raised as a likely issue immediately following Iran’s strikes. Discussions regarding the potential deployment of the air defense are ongoing, but come amid attempts by certain Iraqi factions to secure the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the country. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley explained the situation in response to a question from Fox News ‘ Jennifer Griffin at a press conference on Jan. 30, 2020. There were reports last week that the U.S. military was considering deploying Patriot systems to Iraq. There has been increasing attention in the press and among the general public on the issue of American air and missile defenses in the country after it emerged that there were no such assets in place when Iran fired a flurry of ballistic missiles at U.S. forces at Al Asad, as well as Erbil International Airport, on Jan. 7. Those strikes had been in retaliation for the U.S. decision to kill Qasem Soleimani , then the head of Iran’s Quds Force, on Jan. 3. General Milley told reporters at the press conference that U.S. government is “working with the Iraqi government” on the potential Patriot deployment. “The mechanics of it all need to be worked out, and that is ongoing,” Milley said, adding that he definitely felt there was a need for air and missile defense systems in Iraq. Iraqi gov't is blocking deployment of Patriot missiles to protect US troops. Me: ""Why have you not moved the Patriot missile batteries into Iraq?"" Esper: ""We need to make sure we have permission from the host government."" Me: You do feel you need them? Gen Milley : ""Yes."" https://t.co/G7WoF8yJa8 — Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) January 30, 2020 More Patriot air defenses likely heading to Iraq, Joint Chiefs  chairman Gen. Milley says. US is “working with the Iraqi government.the mechanics of it all need to be worked out, and that is ongoing.” — Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) January 30, 2020 . @JenGriffinFNC asks what a lot of readers have been asking me of late: Why isn't a Patriot missile battery stationed in Iraq? Milley says the Pentagon needs the permission of the Iraqi gov to do so, and those talks are ongoing. Do you feel you need them [there]? Milley: Yes — Oriana Pawlyk (@Oriana0214) January 30, 2020 Neither Milley nor Esper offered any details on how many Patriot batteries they were looking to send to Iraq or where they might be positioned. A typical U.S. Army Patriot battery includes up to eight trailer-mounted launchers, an AN/MPQ-65 multifunction phased array radar, and requisite fire control, communications, and other support equipment. The AN/MPQ-65 are capable of searching for and tracking potential threats, as well as cueing the system’s missile to engage them. A now somewhat dated diagram showing the basic elements of a Patriot surface-to-air missile battery, including eight launch stations (LS), radar station (RS), engagement control station (ECS), antenna mast group (AMG) supporting the unit’s communications, and electric power plant (EPP). Since this diagram was created, the Army has switched to using different vehicles to carry various elements of the system and introduced improved components, such as the AN/MPQ-65 radar, which supplanted the earlier AN/MPQ-53, but the basic organization remains largely the same., US Army There are also a variety of interceptors available for use with the Patriot system. The latest PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor, which entered full-rate production in 2018, is an improved hit-to-kill design, meaning that it destroys the incoming threat by physically smashing into it, rather than using an explosive warhead. The PAC-3 MSE, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , is well suited to engaging shorter-range tactical ballistic missiles, such as the ones Iran employed in its strikes aimed at U.S. forces in Iraq earlier this month. An infographic describing the general capabilities and features of the PAC-3 MSE interceptor., Lockheed Martin No matter what the size or composition of the projected force might be, the talks with Iraqi authorities are undoubtedly fraught with tension given calls for all U.S. forces to leave from certain factions with the country’s parliament, especially pro-Iranian parties, as well as the country’s own caretaker Prime Minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi. “The [American] troops’ attempt to deploy Patriot missile systems in their bases in order to beef up their combat capabilities is rejected and considered a violation of our sovereignty,” Karim Alawi, who sits on the Iraqi Parliament’s security and defense committee, reportedly told Baghdad Today last week. The possibility that diplomatic tensions were at least part of the reason why U.S. had not deployed Patriots to Iraq before or after the Iranian missiles strikes is something the War Zone ‘s Tyler Rogoway had raised on Twitter almost immediately thereafter. 1.) Aircraft can't 2.) No Patriot batteries in Iraq 3.) US Patriot batteries are guarding Saudi oil infrastructure 4.) The issue is likely at least partially diplomatic not just resource-oriented. — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 9, 2020 Given the U.S. government’s unilateral decision to kill Soleimani on Iraqi soil, Iraqi politicians and other government officials who are already predisposed to being wary of America’s continued military presence in the country may also have concerns about whether any American Patriots might pose a threat to Iraqi forces in the future, should relations deteriorate further. The U.S. military has already halted deliveries of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment, including items related to the country’s fleet of American-made F-16IQ Viper fighter jets, until such time as “the environment in Iraq is safe enough to resume” those shipments, Inside Defense reported on Jan. 27. At the same time, the Iraqi government did announce the resumption of combined operations with U.S. and other coalition forces against ISIS terrorists, which were suspended after the Soleimani strike, on Jan. 30. #Iraq resumes the joint operations with the international coalition due the continued activity of ISIS. Statement from PM office — Mustafa Salim (@Mustafa_salimb) January 30, 2020 For its part, the U.S. government has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to withdraw from Iraq completely. Still, there have been indications that American officials may be considering drawdowns or otherwise reshuffling forces inside the country. “We are down to 5,000 soldiers [in Iraq], and going down,” U.S. President Donald Trump had written in a Tweet on Jan. 29. There was also particularly bizarre series of events earlier in January, in which U.S. military officials apparently inadvertently sent a letter to their Iraqi counterparts discussion preparations for the removal of at least some U.S. troops. On the Iraq War Resolution being voted on tomorrow in the House of Represenatives, we are down to 5000 soldiers, and going down, and I want everyone, Republican and Democrat, to vote their HEART! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2020 While the issue of Iraqi approval for the potential Patriot deployment is certainly the most immediate hurdle to sending those systems to Iraq, there are other important factors at play, as well. For one, it’s hard to fathom how the U.S. military did not ensure this was taken care of earlier when the Central Intelligence Agency reportedly assessed that an Iranian ballistic missile strike on U.S. targets in the Middle East was one of the most likely responses to the U.S. killing Qasem Soleimani. The War Zone had also highlighted the threat Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal posed to U.S. base in the region, which was also what had prompted the U.S. Air Force to deploy  B-52 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, out of range of these weapons, after Soleimani’s death. It’s impossible that U.S. commanders in the region and at the Pentagon would have been unaware of this glaring lack of air and missile defenses in Iraq to respond to that scenario, which is exactly what happened. Even before it launched the strike that killed Soleimani, the U.S. government had been warning for months about intelligence pointing to increased risks of potential threats from Iran and its regional proxies, including the possible movement of ballistic missiles into Iraq. The Army had sent Patriot batteries to Iraq following the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003, which remained there for a time as part of the subsequent occupation, but the service removed them as the prospect of major air and missile threats evaporated. It’s unclear when exactly the U.S. military withdrew the Patriots from Iraq, but there is evidence that they were not being actively employed even before they were pulled out of the country entirely. One years old satellite image does appear to show an AN/MPQ-53 or AN/MPQ-65 radar in position at Al Asad, but possible Patriot missile launchers seen in the same imagery are not in a deployed configuration. The Al- Asad air base, had new radar and Patriot missile defence system in place. But was unable to shoot down any missiles. pic.twitter.com/ulTpE7PSjB — Hussain (@hussain_c313) January 8, 2020 Regardless, imagery that The War Zone exclusively obtained from Planet Labs of Al Asad in the immediate aftermath of the Iranian ballistic missile strikes on Jan. 7 confirms the Pentagon’s own statements that there were no Patriot missile systems at the base at the time. At least as of the end of 2018 , the Army was still operating land-based versions of the U.S. Navy’s Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system in Iraq in the counter-rockets, artillery, and mortars, or C-RAM, role, including one at Al Asad. These systems would not have been capable of engaging incoming Iranian ballistic missiles. The decision to proceed with the strike that killed Soleimani despite the obvious risks has become all the more galling as the Pentagon continued to revise its figures about the total number of U.S. casualties that resulted from the subsequent Iranian ballistic missile strikes. The U.S. government initially said that there were no casualties at all, but has now confirmed that at least 64 individuals have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries as a direct result of Iran’s strikes on Al Asad. More than 200 people were within the blast zones of the impacting missiles. Several Pentagon officials have previously told CNN that the number of diagnosed cases is likely to continue to change. Approximately 200 people who were in the blast zone at the time of the attack have been screened for symptoms. #Iraq #Iran — Hamdi (@HamdiAlkhshali) January 30, 2020 The entire situation also underscores the relatively limited number of Patriot units that the Army has available, in total. This is, in part, a product of significant cuts to U.S. military air and missile defense capabilities, in general, after the end of the Cold War, which were even more pronounced when it came to reductions in short-range air defenses . At present, the service has 18 Air Defense Artillery Battalions equipped with Patriot, each of which typically has between three and five batteries, depending on its exact organization. Two of these are dedicated training units. Five of them are forward-deployed overseas, two in Germany, two in South Korea, and one in Japan. A graphic showing the locations of US Army air defense artillery (ADA) battalions (BN) equipped with Patriot, as well as other field artillery (FA) and air and missile defense elements, forward-deployed overseas as of January 2019. The locations of forward-deployed Marine field artillery units are also shown., US Army This leaves just 11, around 60 percent of the Army’s total Patriot force, available to respond to contingencies around the world. Typical readiness cycles mean that not all of the batteries within these battalions would ready to head out an operational assignment at once, either. A number of these units are already on shorter duration deployments abroad, too. There are four U.S. Patriot batteries now in Saudi Arabia, according to The Washington Post . At least one of these was already in place by July 2019 , but the Army sent more in the wake of unprecedented Iranian-sponsored suicide drone and cruise missile attacks in September of that year. Their exact disposition is unclear, but the Pentagon had said they would help guard “critical military and civilian infrastructure” in the Kingdom. At least two batteries are at Prince Sultan Air Base . The other two could be at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, the sites that suffered the cruise missile and drone attacks in September 2019. All of these batteries were all in place in Saudi Arabia at the time of the Iranian ballistic missile barrage targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. Patriot units also rotate through deployments to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, too. US Army troops practice loading Patriot missile launchers at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates., US Army Underscoring the strain on available Army Patriot missile systems, in 2018, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis had directed the withdrawal of batteries from Bahrain, Jordan, and Kuwait, ostensibly to free them up for deployment elsewhere. This would have also left U.S. military facilities in those countries vulnerable to Iranian missile and drone strikes in the wake of the killing of Qasem Soleimani. The Pentagon is now reportedly looking at shifting the Patriot unit presently in Saudi Arabia to Iraq, which only further highlights the limited capacity of the Army’s overall Patriot force. Some may take issue with the fact that U.S. Patriots are presently guarding areas of Saudi Arabia, but were apparently not available to protect American troops in Iraq from the very likely possibility of an Iranian counter-strike of some kind following Soleimani’s death. While it’s certainly true that there are diplomatic barriers to sending the surface-to-air missiles systems to Iraq, it’s worth pointing out that the U.S. government ignored any such protocols when it decided to kill the Quds Force commander right outside Baghdad International Airport. American officials had also apparently disregarded potential diplomatic concerns when they approved earlier airstrikes on Iranian-backed Iraqi militias on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border in December 2019. Of course, It’s also important to remember that even if Patriot missile systems had been in place in Iraq at the time of the Jan. 7 Iranian ballistic missile strikes that this would not have provided an absolute defense against those threats. While the latest Patriot systems are vastly most capable than the much-maligned versions that were employed during the first Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991, there is simply no such thing as a perfect missile defense shield, something the War Zone has explored in detail in the past. It remains to be seen when, and if, the U.S. military will actually send Patriots to Iraq and what the exact composition and distribution of any such air defense force might look like in the country. There is clearly a need to provide at least some level of defense against air and missile threats aimed at American personnel in the country. Still, the attention the Pentagon is now giving to the issue is probably small comfort to the dozens of American personnel who now suffer from traumatic brain injuries following the Iranian ballistic missile strikes earlier this month.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 30, 2020",E-11A Pilots Died Flying An Aircraft From A Fleet So Small None Are In The U.S. For Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has identified the two pilots who died in the crash of a U.S. Air Force E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node , or BACN, aircraft in Afghanistan earlier this week . The announcement highlights the fact that all individuals who fly these highly specialized communications aircraft volunteer for this job and that there are so few of these planes that they’re all forward-deployed in Afghanistan. This means that aviators have no chance to train directly on an E-11A in the United States before they head to Kandahar Airfield to begin flying actual operational sorties. It’s important to stress that there is no indication that this Air Force practice of soliciting volunteers who may have limited immediate experience on the E-11A or similar aircraft types in any way contributed to the mishap in Afghanistan on Jan. 27. Much of the circumstances about that crash and its immediate aftermath remain unclear. On Jan. 29, 2020, the U.S. military officially announced that Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Paul Voss and Captain Ryan Phaneuf had died in the mishap. The E-11A, with the serial number 11-9358, had crashed in Afghanistan’s Ghazni Province on Jan. 27. Voss and Phaneuf were the only two individuals on board the aircraft when it went down, despite initial reports that there might have been as many as five people on board. The Pentagon has also denied claims since then that the Taliban shot the aircraft down and says the investigation into the incident is still ongoing. There is also no evidence to support the militant group’s assertion that a senior Central Intelligence Agency officer had been on the plane. The E-11A that crashed, along with the three remaining aircraft of this type that the Air Force operates, are all assigned to the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron at Kandahar Airfield. However, the Pentagon’s statement said that Lieutenant Colonel Voss was assigned to Headquarters, Air Combat Command, situated at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia and that Captain Phaneuf was a member of the 37th Bomb Squadron based at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. Headquarters, Air Combat Command is not a flying unit and 37th Bomb Squadron, part of the 28th Bomb Wing, flies B-1 Bone bombers , making it somewhat curious that members of both organizations would be in Afghanistan flying the E-11A, which are derived from the Bombardier BD-700 business jet. Stars & Stripes reporter Chad Garland helped explain the situation on Twitter. “Worth noting that the Air Force has said the pilots who fly the E-11A mission all volunteered,” he wrote in a Tweet after the Pentagon identified Voss and Phaneuf as those who had tragically perished in the crash. “They fly combat missions beginning from their first sortie in the unique modified Bombardier Aviation jet, which they don’t even get to fly until they reach Kandahar, per the USAF.” Pilots bound for the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron do get a month’s worth of training in a simulator before they go to Afghanistan. They then get a week of “in-theater indoctrination training” on the E-11A once they arrive. All of this only further underscores how the fleet of E-11As, just three aircraft now, is the perfect definition of a high-value, but very-low-density asset. Beyond these manned jets, the only other platforms that carry the Battlefield Airborne Control Node (BACN) payload are three EQ-4B Global Hawk drones. BACN is a very specialized aerial communications suite that allows the E-11As and EQ-4Bs to quickly send and receive information across various waveforms and between a wide variety of other aerial platforms and forces on the ground. In Afghanistan, the E-11As also just provide an extremely valuable communications relay capability in a country where the mountainous terrain can often limit the range of line-of-sight communications systems and data links. Helping to coordinate airstrikes is a big part of what the E-11As do in Afghanistan and that keeps them extremely busy , with what was then a four aircraft fleet supporting approximately 7,000 strikes in 2016 alone, according to figures the Air Force previously provided to The War Zone . The type flew its 10,000 sortie on Feb. 14, 2017. You can read much more about these manned and unmanned aircraft and their obscure, but vital missions in this highly in-depth War Zone feature . Newsweek reported that the plane was flying at a cruising altitude of 42,000 feet when the pilots issued a mayday call. Ghazni provincial government spokesman Arif Noori posited that the plane appeared to be flying north from the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron’s main base of operations in Kandahar to Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, according to CBS News . Pictures from the crash site in the Dih Yak district of Ghazni province showed that the plane had skidded along the ground for a considerable distance before coming to a rest, indicating that the crew might have attempted to make an emergency landing. It’s not clear if the aircraft was on fire before or after hitting the ground. Dih Yak is under the control of the Taliban, who claimed initially to have secured the crash site and reportedly fought off initial attempts by local Afghan forces to reach the aircraft. The U.S. military reportedly subsequently dispatched a special operations force made up of elements from the secretive Joint Special Operations Command , including members of Seal Team Six , according to Newsweek . That force faced no resistance in getting to the crash site and successfully recovered Voss and Phaneuf’s bodies. “The force also recovered what is assessed to be the aircraft flight data recorder,” U.S. Army Colonel Sonny Leggett, the top spokesman for U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A), added in a statement on Jan. 28. “The remains were found near the crash site, treated with dignity and respect by the local Afghan community, in accordance with their culture.” “U.S. forces destroyed the remnants of the aircraft,” Leggett added. Newsweek had reported that the special operators on the ground had destroyed what was left of the plane before departing the site, but that U.S. officials were considering using airstrikes, as well, to ensure that neither the Taliban nor anyone else could attempt to recover sensitive equipment or documents from the wreckage. It’s unclear if those strikes ultimately occurred. Hopefully, the analysis of the apparent flight data recorder will shed more light on this accident. In the meantime, volunteers from around the Air Force will continue flying the remaining E-11As in Afghanistan as they continue to provide vital communications support for U.S. forces in that country.

Details are still limited, but pictures and video footage circulating on social media shows that a U.S. Air Force E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node , or BACN, aircraft has crashed in Afghanistan. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident and the fate of the crew remain unknown. The aircraft reportedly came down in the Dih Yak district of Afghanistan’s Ghazni province at around 1:10 PM local time, Arif Noori, a spokesperson for the provincial government, told The Associated Press . Noori did not identify the aircraft or its owner and there were initial reports that an airliner from Ariana Afghan Airlines , the country’s flag carrier, was involved. Ariana had already denied those reports by the time the pictures and video footage, which clearly shows the burned-out fuselage of an E-11A, as well as a corresponding serial number on its tail, 11-9358, emerged. “U.S. Central Command is aware of the reports of a U.S. aircraft crash in Afghanistan,” Major Beth Riordan, a spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement, according to various outlets. “We are currently monitoring the situation and will provide additional information when possible.” The Taliban, who are in control of Dih Yak, have claimed they shot down the aircraft and that it killed everyone on board, including “high-ranking CIA officers.” There is nothing to substantiate any of these assertions and, despite the group’s insistence, the E-11A is not an intelligence-gathering aircraft. The Air Force has a total of four E-11As , including the one that has now crashed. These planes are based on the Bombardier BD-700 Global Express business jet, which are forward-deployed in Afghanistan assigned to the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron at Kandahar Airfield. These aircraft carry the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload, which allows them to act as highly specialized aerial communications nodes that can rapidly shift information to and from a wide variety of airborne platforms and forces on the ground. There are also three EQ-4B Global Hawk drones that carry the BACN package. The small number of BACN platforms makes them the very definition of a high-value, but low-density asset. You can read more in detail about all of these manned and unmanned aircraft and their obscure, but critical missions in this past War Zone feature . The loss of the E-11A comes amid a surge in airstrikes against the Taliban, even as the U.S. government works to negotiate a peace deal with the group, which could include American troop withdrawals . U.S. military aircraft employed approximately 7,423 munitions – a total that includes both bombs and missiles – during operations in Afghanistan in 2019, the highest such figure since 2011, according to U.S. Air Forces Central Command. This follows a trend dating back to at least 2018, when American aircraft employed 7,362 munitions. BACN has been an instrumental part of thousands of strikes already, including 7,000 in 2016 alone, according to figures the U.S. Air Force provided The War Zone with three years ago. On Feb. 14, 2017, one of the service’s E-11As flew the 10,000th BACN sortie in Afghanistan. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 11:35am EST Fox News has now reported that there were five individuals on board the E-11A at the time of the incident, according to U.S. officials, but it remains unclear if there were any survivors. Those same officials have denied the Taliban’s claims that the group shot down the plane. UPDATE: 11:55am EST General David Goldfein, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, has now publicly confirmed that the E-11A did crash in Afghanistan, but has not yet offered any details on the circumstances surrounding the event. It is possible that the aircraft may have been attempting to make an emergency landing and it definitely skid across the ground before coming to its final resting point. While there is no evidence that the Taliban shot the aircraft down, it would have been exposed to attacks from that group after the crash. Additional and graphic pictures reportedly from the crash site show what appears to be a badly burned body of one of the crew members. There are also pictures circulating online showing two bodies covered in blankets. UPDATE: 1:05pm EST U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has now also confirmed the E-11A crash and denied that the Taliban shot it down. There are still no details on the cause of the mishap and the fate of all of the crew members. UPDATE: 1:45pm EST The Taliban claim that they have secured the crash site and are searching for two possible survivors of the crash. There have no further updates from the U.S. government about the incident or the status of the aircraft’s crew.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have reported in the past on the incredible story of America’s secret Red Eagles MiG aggressor squadron from the Cold War period and even on the shadowy descendants of that program , but the presentation below, given by the man who founded and commanded the top-secret unit, Colonel Gail Peck, is an absolute must-watch. The talk happened on June 23rd, 2019, at the Museum Of Flight in Seattle. Peck, who wrote the definitive account of the Constant Peg program saga, titled America’s Secret MiG Squadron , describes in great detail how the program was launched, the way it went about its business once it was up and running, and the manner in which its efforts impacted the ability of the U.S. and its allies to slay their enemies in the sky. There is so much detail in this hour and 48-minute video, and Peck does such a great job adding color to an already very colorful story, that it really works as a great primer for anyone who hasn’t read his book and as perfect companion material for anyone who has. The story of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron that came out of Constant Peg is as much one about the birth of a clandestine air base as it is about the squadron itself. In fact, the secret MiG aggressor squadron was directly intertwined with the genesis of the F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jet program. Tonopah Test Range Airport and the F-117 are two of our favorite topics around here. To understand one, you have to understand the other. Peck allows us to better do that. Ironically, the F-117s are still flying from Tonopah , sometimes in an aggressor role , all these years after the MiGs and the ‘Black Jets’ cohabitated at the remote base. Also, make sure to stick around for the Q&A at the end, especially for his comments on flying different variants of the F-4 Phantom.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",Navy Missile Sub Has Begun Its First Patrol Armed With Controversial Low Yield Nukes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has reportedly sent an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine on patrol for the first time carrying Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles armed with the new and controversial low-yield W76-2 nuclear warhead . This news comes nearly a year after the United States announced it had produced the first of these warheads. Proponents say the warheads are necessary to give the U.S. government added flexibility to respond to certain crises, including limited nuclear strikes, but critics contend that they raise the likelihood of the United States employing nuclear weapons, to begin with. The Federation of American Scientists first reported the deployment on Jan. 20, 2020. The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Tennessee left its homeport at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia in late December 2019 for a deterrent patrol armed with an unknown number of Trident IIs carrying W76-2s. “We estimate that one or two of the 20 [Trident II] missiles on the USS Tennessee and subsequent subs will be armed with the W76-2, either singly or carrying multiple warheads. Each W76-2 is estimated to have an explosive yield of about five kilotons,” according to the Federation of American Scientists . “The remaining 18 missiles on each submarine like the Tennessee carry either the 90-kiloton W76-1 or the 455-kiloton W88. Each missile can carry up to eight warheads under current loading configurations.” So, the W76-2, with its estimated yield of five kilotons, has a yield 18 times smaller than the existing W76-1 and is more than 90 times smaller than the W88. NUKEMAP , a map tool that nuclear weapons historian Alex Wellerstein, presently a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, first put online in 2012, estimates that a W76-2 that detonates on the ground would create a fireball just over 490 feet wide, wherein anything would be incinerated, and cause varying levels of damage to anything within a circle around ground zero just under one and a half miles in diameter. By comparison, the W88’s fireball would be just under 2,330 feet wide and there would be degrees of damage across an area around 18 miles in diameter. The spread of deadly radiation and fallout would also be factors within these areas, as well as beyond, depending on prevailing weather patterns. A comparison of how Washington, D.C. might be impacted by the detonation of, from left to right, a W88, a W76-1, and a W76-2, as a generic example, according to NUKEMAP’s models. The gray outer circle is the maximum extent of light damage, such as broken windows. The yellow circle, clearly visible in the cases of the W88 and W76-1, is the extent of thermal raditation, which can cause third degree burns. The other colored bands cover more extensive damage and the spread of radiation, as well as the immediate fireball, outlined in red., NUKEMAP President Donald Trump’s Administration codified plans to develop a low-yield warhead for the Trident II missile in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review . The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the division of the Department of Energy directly responsible for overseeing America’s nuclear stockpile, announced it had built the first W76-2 at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas in February 2019. At that time it said that it planned to deliver the first of these warheads to the Navy by the end of the fiscal year, which wrapped up on Sept. 30, 2019. The official logo for the W76-2 warhead program. Mk 4A refers to the re-entry vehicle that carries the warhead., NNSA The exact configuration of the W76-2 is classified, but it is known to be a derivative of the W76-1, which was itself a product of a life-extension program for the original W76 warheads that NNSA also completed last year. The W76 and W76-1 are understood to be two-stage thermonuclear weapons and previous reports have posited that the new W76-2 may simply eliminate the second stage to produce a significantly lower yield. This would also help explain the speed at which NNSA could develop and field the warhead. An official infographic on the W76-1, which also uses the Mk 4A re-entry vehicle., NNSA “We estimate approximately 50 W76-2 warheads were produced, a low-cost add-on to improved W76 Mod 1 strategic Trident warheads which had just finished their own production run,” the Federation of American Scientists said in their report. At present, the Navy plans to eventually deploy Trident II missiles armed with the new warheads on its future Columbia class ballistic missile submarines, which are scheduled to begin sailing deterrent patrols in 2031. An artist’s conception of the first-in-class USS Columbia ., USN The Trump Administration and other proponents of the low-yield warhead have argued that there is a need for a more “flexible” deterrent option to respond to more limited nuclear strikes, including those involving an opponent employing tactical nuclear weapons in a battlefield context. The concern is that the U.S. government could be too worried about employing larger yield nuclear weapons to respond in kind to these strikes, creating a deterrence “gap” that opponents might be able to exploit. This development was driven in no small part by Russia’s purported “ escalate-to-deescalate ” doctrine. Experts continue to disagree over whether or not this policy actually exists. Concerns about advanced and novel Russian strategic weapons developments, as well as those in China , have prompted steady increases in U.S. government spending on modernizing deterrent capabilities in recent years , in general. On Jan. 28, 2020, Senator Jim Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma and the present the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the Trump Administration plans to seek another $20 billion for such efforts in the 2021 Fiscal Year, a 20 percent increase over the previous fiscal year’s budget, according to Defense News . Existing modernization plans related to America’s nuclear arsenal are already slated to cost at least $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years, spending that The War Zone has previously pointed out is very likely unsustainable over that period. On the other side, critics of the lower-yield W76-2 warn that it is inherently more “usable” and risks lowering the threshold for deciding to employ nuclear weapons. They also point out that the U.S. military already has various nuclear weapons with so-called “ dial-a-yield ” capabilities that allow for lower yields and the force does not need a new warhead to meet these requirements. Beyond that, there is no indication that America’s potential opponents would be able to discriminate between the launch of a Trident II missile armed with W76-2 warheads and one with larger yield W76-1s or W88s. With just minutes to decide how to react, those adversaries could feel forced to respond as if they were under imminent threat of a full-scale nuclear strike from the United States, rather than a limited one, for fear of losing the ability to retaliate. The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Rhode Island fires a Trident II missile, with no warheads of any kind fitted, during a test in 2019., USN A recent push by some members of Congress to cancel or curtail the W76-2 program as part of negotiations over the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the 2021 Fiscal Year, ultimately collapsed . Opposition to the low-yield warhead remains and there may be additional legislative efforts aimed at removing it from America’s nuclear arsenal in the future. In the meantime, however, the Navy’s Ohio class ballistic missile submarines look set to sail their routine deterrent patrols carrying Trident II missiles carrying the new, lower-yield warheads.

Chris Harmer,"Updated on Jan 30, 2020",Flying The First Night Of War In Iraq Without A Wingman And Two Polish Snipers In Back,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to war stories, where you were and what you did in the opening of a major conflict are as exciting and personal as it gets. In this case, it also happened to be the most bizarre experience I had in my entire military career. On March 20, 2003, as the U.S. kicked off its invasion of Iraq, I was at the controls of a U.S. Navy HH-60 Seahawk helicopter flying over southern Iraq. In the cabin of the helicopter were two of the most senior enlisted aircrewmen in our squadron. I had flown dozens of training events with these aircrewmen, including live-fire exercises using the M240 machine guns that were hanging off either side of the aircraft. Along with them were two Polish snipers. I had never flown any training missions with these snipers and had only met them just before launching. As far as I could tell, neither of the Polish snipers could speak English, at least not the standardized aviation checklist English we used in flight, and my last instructions before launching were that I should trust them to differentiate between friend and foe and let them shoot at any targets they deemed necessary. It wasn’t how I expected to fly the first night of the war, and certainly not how I had trained. Still, that was the situation, and I was determined to get the job done, or at least not screw it up. Our mission that night was to escort a small flotilla of U.S. Navy riverine craft that were clearing and securing the Khawr az Zubayr waterway that connects the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr to the Persian Gulf. It was an important and dangerous operation, and one we had to get done as soon as possible to allow heavy cargo ships to come in to support the forces moving towards Baghdad. In The Dark While On The Brink We had launched that night from a small, transient base located at Al Maghasil, Kuwait, located about ten miles south of the border between Iraq and Kuwait. During the first days of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), I and several other Naval Aviators and aircrewmen were stationed there as part of a small, ad hoc detachment of four US Navy HH-60H Seahawk helicopters tasked with supporting the initial objective of securing Umm Qasr, which is located about 30 miles south of Basra , and just north of the border between Iraq and Kuwait. In addition to the Navy helicopter detachment, there were several platoons of Navy SEALS, some Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators, as well as a contingent of U.S. Marines and U.K. Royal Marines. HH-60H Seahawk working with SEALs during training. , USN We had set up at Al Maghasil about eight to 10 days before the commencement of OIF. One of the first things I noticed was how difficult it was to get information. Back on the carrier, we had essentially unlimited bandwidth to access both open-source news services, like the now discontinued “Early Bird” the Pentagon put out, as well as classified intelligence. As we got closer to the invasion, my situational awareness of the broader events taking place got progressively worse. The closer you are to the front lines of the conflict, the less you know about what is going on elsewhere. While frustrating, it wasn’t a consequential problem. We were focused on our piece of the mission. With that said, our crew of Naval Aviators was definitely experiencing some culture shock due to the lack of easily accessible information. The makeshift camp at Al Maghasil had the bare minimum of communication connectivity to receive tactical level tasking and nothing more. Iraq’s Only Deepwater Port And Gateway To Oil Terminals While Basra is the largest city in southern Iraq and is located directly on the Shatt al Arab waterway, formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which acts as the border between Iran and Iraq, it does not have deepwater port capabilities. Umm Qasr is Iraq’s only deepwater port, as well as the gateway to Iraq’s two offshore oil terminals, Khor Al Amaya Oil Terminal (KAAOT) and its sister facility, the Al Basrah Oil Terminal (ABOT). At the time, KAAOT and ABOT represented approximately 90% of Iraq’s oil export capacity. During the First Gulf War, as Saddam Hussein’s forces left Kuwait they set hundreds of oil and gas wells on fire . This led to massive economic and environmental challenges as the government of Kuwait tried to recover from the invasion and occupation. As a result, an initial objective of OIF was to quickly secure both the deepwater port facilities at Umm Qasr, as well as the oil platforms at KAAOT and ABOT to ensure that Hussein’s retreating forces did not sabotage them. Seizing the port facilities and oil terminals intact was seen as a key enabling objective for the future economic reconstruction of Iraq and eventual independence and legitimacy of the new Iraq government. Umm Qasr, Google Earth Once we were set up at our austere base at Al Maghasil, we started to figure out who else was there. Along with Navy SEALS, Navy SWCC, U.S. and U.K. Marines, I started to see some other personnel whose uniforms and insignias were unfamiliar to me. They turned out to be from the Polish special operations force known as the Grupa Reagowania Operacyjno-Manewrowego (GROM) , which means Group for Operational Maneuvering Response. While I knew nothing about them, the way they moved and carried themselves was reassuring. They gave the impression of being calm and capable professionals. The forces at Al Maghasil were a small fraction of the total force that would conduct the assault on Umm Qasr. Some of the main assault elements were located further inland, with the balance of U.S. and U.K. Marines waiting on the big amphibious assault ships located in the Persian Gulf. Although we were well aware of the threat posed by Saddam’s still potent arsenal of Scud missiles, the consensus was there was little to no anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM) threat menacing the amphibious assault ships, so by a few days prior to the invasion, those ships had crept up very close to the far northern end of the Persian Gulf. That proximity to the objective obviously made the problem of movement from ship to shore much easier. Scrounging Helicopters From The Fleet As I detailed in a previous War Zone article, most U.S. Navy SEAL helicopter operations are typically supported by U.S. Army or U.S. Air Force units that are solely dedicated to special operations. However, as I pointed out in a follow-on piece, U.S. Navy carrier-based H-60 Seahawk squadrons are trained and equipped to support maritime-centric special operations missions. With respect to this helicopter detachment in the desert just south of Umm Qasr, we did have enough airframes to support Navy SEAL operations, but just barely. How we were able to do this was a big part of the story. What follows may seem like an excessive amount of detail on the logistics of the operation, but as we pointed out before, a Navy deploys on the strength of its maintenance operations. How we got four full mission capable (FMC) Seahawks into Al Maghasil and supported them for several weeks required a massive and complicated effort. HH-60Hs on the carrier deck., USN The primary purpose of the Navy carrier air wing is force projection. That’s why four aircraft carriers were in the Persian Gulf on day one of OIF, to provide fixed-wing sorties in support of ground operations. While the standard carrier air wing mix has varied over time , it typically includes about 50 strike fighter aircraft. At the time, I was attached to Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5), stationed aboard USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63). In our case, the strike fighter loadout was one squadron of F-14 Tomcats and three squadrons of F/A-18 Hornets . Supporting aircraft included a squadron each of E-2 Hawkeyes , which provided airborne radar control, S-3 Vikings, used for a combination of overwater radar coverage and in-flight refueling, and EA-6B Prowlers , providing electronic attack (jamming) services. Last but not least, there was one squadron of H-60 Seahawks onboard, with four airframes of the SH-60F variant optimized for Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) and three HH-60H airframes optimized for supporting Navy SEAL operations. We also used the HH-60H airframes to provide a defense against the constant threat of Iranian small boat swarm attacks. To get four total FMC HH-60H airframes at the temporary base at Al Maghasil, we took one each from the four carriers. Given the massive amount of other tasking the helicopter squadrons had – running cargo and personnel to and from shore, maintaining situational awareness of and deterrent to the Iranian Navy, keeping a 24/7 overwater Search and Rescue (SAR) alert manned – it was difficult, but we made it happen. A maintainer works on an HH-60H., USN Maintaining those four aircraft ashore was a complicating factor. We simply did not have enough maintenance personnel or spare parts to set up a maintenance operation at Al Maghasil, separate from the aircraft carriers. We solved that problem by rotating aircraft out every day or two, taking them back to the carriers, where each squadron had a full maintenance department to do inspections and maintenance before sending the birds back up to the desert. By rotating the HH-60H airframes out every day or two, we were able to keep four FMC aircraft in the rotation at Al Maghasil. The maintenance personnel back on the carrier were working 18 hour days for the duration of our time in the Persian Gulf, and as always, they deserve the lion’s share of credit for our success. Oil Platforms And Port Facilities Are Sniper’s Heaven As we got closer to zero hour, we started taking a more detailed look at the mission. In general, the main objective was taking Umm Qasr itself, along with three associated missions. The first was seizing the offshore oil platforms. The second was maintaining a semi-continuous reconnaissance mission over Bubiyan Island and the Al Faw Peninsula, which lay directly between Iran and Umm Qasr. Lastly, the third was clearing the waterway, the Khawr Abd Allah, that flowed south out of Umm Qasr into the Persian Gulf. I had been tasked with providing aerial cover for the small flotilla of surface craft that would be working up from Al Maghasil towards Umm Qasr along the waterway, so that was my focus in getting ready to execute the mission. Map of the Al Faw Peninsula and surrounding area. , UNEP In this case, clearing the waterway had two meanings: clearing it of potential enemy resistance and eventually physically salvaging and clearing shipwrecks that made it impossible for deep-draft ships to get to Umm Qasr. As we started looking at the objectives, it quickly became apparent that if the Iraqi forces decided to resist, they would have a perfect defensive position to work with. To start with, a deepwater port facility like Umm Qasr is just about as tailor-made as can be for hiding snipers. There were heavy cranes on the docks with a lot of buildings and warehouses to support the port operations. These presented platforms for snipers that were both elevated and heavily armored. Beyond that, we knew there were underground utility tunnels and conduits, but they were not clearly marked on the surface or charted on maps. We had some blueprints from when the port was originally built, but had no idea if what was depicted on the blueprints actually existed. One port area of Umm Qasr photographed in 2011. , AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP via Getty Images Before we even got to the port, however, we would have to navigate and clear the waterway leading to it. Saddam’s forces had sunk several large ships in the Khawr Abd Allah waterway just south of Umm Qasr, which precluded any deep-draft vessels from operating there.  It wasn’t a problem for us in terms of movement towards the target area, as both the U.S. Navy and U.K. Royal Navy had plenty of shallow draft vessels to work around the sunken vessels, but those partially sunken vessels were additional potential staging areas for snipers. As an example of this, the Iraqi Motor Vessel Hillah, a dredging ship, had been sunk just south of Umm Qasr. While the hull of the vessel was resting on the bottom of the waterway, the superstructure was still above the waterline, and it represented a perfect sniper blind. They could easily stash themselves somewhere in the superstructure, then wait for an opportune time to emerge and start taking potshots. Iraq’s Khawr Al Amaya Oil Platform (KAAOT) just after sunrise., USN While the plan to take down the oil terminals was fairly straight forward – insert SEALs via fast surface craft and helicopter fast rope simultaneously – it was fraught with danger. The oil terminals were also perfect for active defense. They were vast man-made islands featuring a maze of pipes, heavy steel that is perfect for cover, docking facilities for massive oil tankers, austere living facilities for the workers, and a labyrinth of other compartments. With a primary mission of securing the oil terminals before they could be sabotaged, speed was of the essence. It would have been easy to bomb the platforms, but the point was to take them intact, so that was out of the question. A US Navy Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) sits off a portion of the Al Basrah Oil Terminal, also known as the Mina Al Bakar Oil Terminal, in Iraq during the open phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom., USN Eventually removing the sunken vessels in the Khawr Abd Allah waterway was a follow on objective, which also precluded simply dropping bombs on the hulks in the waterway to clear them of snipers. We needed to keep those scuttled ship hulls intact in order to facilitate their future removal. This meant that we would essentially be doing a modified Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS) clearance operation on each ship hulk in the waterway. You Train Like You Fight… Until You Don’t We’ve all heard the sayings. Some version of, ‘the more you sweat in peace the less you bleed in war’ or ‘train like you fight,’ etc. Point being, in all our training leading up to OIF, we tried to make the scenarios as realistic as possible. One of the cardinal rules of aviation is you never fly solo over enemy territory. You always go into combat with a wingman, and as Jester told us in Top Gun , you never leave your wingman. So, in all my training scenarios, I had never prepared for the scenario I was presented with at zero hour. I was told, on the first night of the war, to go fly into Iraq without a wingman. Of course, I did it. The assault on Umm Qasr was scheduled to kick off shortly after sunset, along with the seizure of the oil platforms, the reconnaissance mission over Bubiyan Island and the Al Faw peninsula, and our little waterway clearance operation. As I walked into the command center for our final briefing, one of the senior SEAL officers pulled me aside and said: “We have a problem. We picked up a lot more activity on Bubiyan Island and the Al Faw Peninsula than we expected and we have to divert helicopters there right now to make sure this is not a flanking attack. Between that and the oil platforms, we have too many missions and not enough helicopters. Your call. You can fly as a dash three over the Al Faw Peninsula or you can go on your own to do an armed reconnaissance up to Umm Qasr. You won’t be completely alone, you will essentially be flying top cover on some of our boats going up the waterway as a clearance and reconnaissance mission. They are going with or without you. You have thirty minutes to decide.” An HH-60H’s receives some TLC at night., USN I knew the book answer was to go with the other helicopters as a third wheel, but I also knew we needed to know what was going on in the waterway between Al Maghasil and Umm Qasr and the small riverine craft going up there would obviously want us flying top cover, whether we were solo or not. After checking with my copilot and aircrewmen and making sure they were okay with it, we rogered up to flying solo over Iraqi territory on the first night of the war. As we did our preflight, I thought we had a pretty good handle on the mission. We were essentially going to stay over the waterway the entire time, as the riverine craft moved up the channel toward Umm Qasr. At each sunken ship hulk in the waterway, they would discharge 10 to 12 SEALS and/or Navy SWCC guys and certify no snipers were present. Then we would move up the river to the next hulk, and so on, until we got to the port facility itself. The riverine craft were heavily armed with .50 caliber machine guns, 7.62mm miniguns, 40mm grenade launchers, etc.  Between that and our two door-mounted 7.62mm machine guns and the two SEAL snipers I expected to carry with us in the helicopter, I thought we had more than enough defensive firepower to conduct our mission of reconnoitering the waterway up to Umm Qasr. A picture of US Navy Mk V Special Operations Craft (SOC) and Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB) carrying both US and Polish flags around the time of the battle of Umm Qasar., via Bellona Publications Depending on my fuel burn rate, at some point, I knew I would have to tell the small boats to suspend while we flew offshore to a ship that was waiting with a “green deck” to take helos aboard and refuel. We knew that clearing the waterway and port was not going to be a one night mission, but we thought we could at least get a pretty good start on it that first night. At the same time, other helicopters would be supporting the assault on the oil platforms at KAAOT and ABOT, and doing the reconnaissance of the Al Faw peninsula, so I thought if I got in any real trouble, i.e. got forced or shot down, I would at least have a decent chance of someone executing a quick-snatch Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) on us. If you are doing the math, right about now you are observing that this adds up to a lot more than four Navy helicopters. Indeed, at the last minute, we found out that other helicopters from multiple sources – U.S. Marines, U.K. Royal Marines, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force – had become available. They were folded into the overall operation. But for whatever reason, we still wound up flying solo with the waterway clearance mission. The closer we got to zero hour, the more our operations seemed unscripted and something of a free for all. The Rules Of Engagement Are Whatever And Your Snipers Don’t Speak English As helicopter pilots, we were particularly focused on Rules Of Engagement (ROE). Helicopters spend a lot of time escorting high-value units like aircraft carriers through constrained waterways at close range to potential enemies. Going into and out of the Persian Gulf via the Strait of Hormuz (SOH) can be nerve-wracking , especially since the Iranian Navy regularly trains on how to blockade the SOH . Every time a carrier transits the SOH, because of the constrained air and water space, the fixed-wing aircraft can’t fly, which means helicopters are the first line of observation and defense. As a result, helicopter pilots are hardwired into knowing or at least asking exactly what the ROE are in any given situation. This is especially true when traveling from a relatively benign environment overwater in the Persian Gulf into a live-fire zone which is what we expected the area around Umm Qasr to be. So, as we got ready to fly that first mission, I asked again about ROE. The senior SEAL briefer looked at me like I was insane. “ROE? Your mission is to come back alive and make sure the small craft don’t get ambushed. Your ROE is whatever you need it to be to get that outcome.” That worked for me, and I was glad to have the clarity. USN After sunset, the riverine craft pushed off from Al Maghasil. We gave them about an hour’s head start to work their way up towards the shipwrecks blocking the channel into Umm Qasr. As we were spinning up to launch, I didn’t see the two Navy SEAL snipers that were supposed to fly with us. One of the SEAL officers came up to me and said “Hey, we needed some extra help elsewhere, so we are out of bodies. Can you take a couple of the Polish snipers with you? They are good to go. Just trust them.” I laughed and said, “sure, why not?” So, that is how I started the first night of OIF, flying a single helicopter, without a wingman, over Iraqi territory, operating under “ROE whatever” with two Polish GROM snipers in the back, neither of whom spoke English. It wasn’t by the book, but it turned out to be effective, and that is all that counts. Polish GROM special operations forces in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom., USN Securing Oil Platforms and Ship Hulks Shortly after we launched, we heard that both oil terminals had been taken intact with limited opposition. I was relieved because I knew once the oil terminals were secured, the SEALS and SWCC operators and Navy helicopters could then transition to supporting our waterway clearance operation, which was going to take more than just one night. Still, for this first night, it would be just us and the two Polish GROM snipers. As we crept north, flying a racetrack pattern over the small flotilla of riverine craft below us, we could see a spectacular display of firepower to the west of Umm Qasr, but the port facilities were eerily quiet. USN As the riverine boats would approach each sunken ship, we would circle overhead. We had a Polish GROM sniper and a door machine gunner out each side of the helicopter available to provide suppressing fire, but never needed it. After about three hours of this slow, painstaking work, I let the riverine craft know I had to check off to go get gas. There were several Navy ships just south of Bubiyan Island, so it took me maybe 45 minutes total to fly out, land, get gas, and return. We did this cycle three times that night. We started flying about 2100, got gas at about 0000 and again at 0300 and 0600. We finally landed for good just after sunrise. It had been a heck of a night, with a lot of good work clearing the shipwrecks, and fortunately, we did not take any direct fire. After a quick debrief, we hit the tent to grab some sleep. Umm Qasr Captured, But Not Secure The initial operations at Umm Qasr went pretty well. The U.S. and U.K. Marines defeated the forces defending Umm Qasr fairly quickly and, consistent with the rest of the campaign, soon turned north in the race to Baghdad. That’s when the trouble started. In the first instance of what was to become the norm throughout Iraq, many potential combatants in Umm Qasr had declined to fight in the initial action, then started engaging in limited insurgent attacks once the main coalition forces moved on. This was in the far south of Iraq in majority Shia territory, so there was no allegiance to Saddam per se, but the locals clearly also did not want the United States sticking around as an occupying force. Pretty quickly it became apparent that Umm Qasr had been captured, but not secured. HH-60H about to head out on a night mission., USN This was still the first week of OIF, so the U.S. was way behind the power curve in establishing any kind of counterinsurgency doctrine or operations in support of it. Still, we knew we had to clear Umm Qasr of snipers and insurgents in order to get the port back up and running. In the short term, that would support the US war effort, and in the long term, support the economic and political reconstruction of Iraq. For the next four to five days, that’s what we did, working pretty much around the clock. We would fly up and down the Khawr Abd Allah, checking for any insurgent activity on the waterway or alongside it. The riverine craft continued to work on clearing shipwrecks and do initial preparation to salvage them along with sweeping the port for mines. The Polish GROM operators were working hard in the port itself, clearing out several pockets of insurgents. Back To The Boat Eventually, Umm Qasr and the surrounding areas were secured, which was our signal to head back to the carrier. In all, our little ad hoc helicopter detachment had worked out of Al Maghasil for about three weeks. We supported plenty of additional SEAL operations in Iraq, some as far north as the outskirts of Baghdad, but before we could get set up for that, we needed to reconstitute back at the carrier, debrief, get the aircraft through some deferred maintenance, and more. Overall it was a successful operation, and to this day, the only time I have flown a single ship mission with non-English speaking snipers over enemy territory was the first night of OIF.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced that the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska test-fired four Trident II missiles over the course of three days this week. The service does regularly test its submarine-launched ballistic missiles, but typically just in ones or twos. This larger test event comes as the United States is supposed to be getting close to fielding a new version of the Trident II with controversial lower-yield W76-2 warheads and amid an emerging arms race with Russia. In this most recent series of Trident II test launches, Nebraska fired two missiles on Sept. 4, 2019, and another two on Sept. 6, 2019. The submarine fired all of the weapons from an unspecified location off the coast of Southern California. Based on U.S. government warning notices to aircraft and ships, it appeared that the missiles may have come down in the Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii and/or near Guam. To date, there have been 176 total test launches of the Trident II, also known as the Trident D5. “These test flights were part of a Commander Evaluation Test (CET) whose primary goal was to validate performance expectations of the life-extended Trident II (D5) strategic weapon system,” according to a U.S. Navy release . “CETs and other flight tests are conducted on a recurring, scheduled basis to evaluate and ensure the continued reliability and accuracy of the system.” The UGM-133A Trident II missile first began entering service in 1990 and the missiles would have begun to hit the end of their original service life in 2024. This led to the D5 Life Extension program and Ohio class submarines began receiving the new D5LE missiles , which are expected to remain in service into the 2040s, in 2013. “The life extended missiles are now being deployed to the Fleet, but our work is not done,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, head of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs office, said in a statement . “The nuclear deterrence mission is the Department of Defense’s No. 1 priority, and for the U.S. Navy that means not only maintaining our current capability, but also developing the next generation of Trident missiles and shipboard strategic weapon system that will ensure a credible sea-based deterrent for the next 40 years and beyond.” The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska ., USN The Navy is already exploring what the next missile, referred to at present as the D5 Life Extension 2, or D5LE2, might look like. “[It] won’t look like the D5 that we’ve got today, it won’t be completely new, it will be somewhere in the middle,” Wolfe had explained in 2018. The service is expecting to have fully transitioned to the D5LE2 by 2042 and plans to keep those missiles in service through at least 2084. You read more about how these future missiles may differ from existing Trident IIs in this past War Zone piece . Still, while Trident II test launches are certainly routine, firing four missiles in less than a week is decidedly more uncommon. The last D5 test, which occurred in May 2019, involved USS Rhode Island , another Ohio class ballistic missile submarine, firing just a single missile . More than a year earlier, Nebraska fired off a pair of Trident IIs in another test. Of course, it is worth noting that this isn’t the first time the Navy has conducted a test like this. An unspecified Ohio class submarine fired four D5s over three days in what the Navy described as a Follow-on Commander’s Evaluation Test (FCET) in February 2017. It’s also important to point out that the Navy does not appear to announce every Trident II test event. There were five other test shots between the March 2018 and March 2019 launches, but it’s not quickly clear how many separate test events there were. USS Rhode Island fires a Trident II missile during a test in May 2019., USN The Navy did not say whether Nebraska ‘s latest test launches were related in any way to more intermediate developments with regards to the Trident II missile. On Sept. 4, 2019, officials from the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the construction, refurbishment, and disposal of nuclear warheads, said that the deployment of a new variant of the W88 warhead , the W88 ALT 370, for Trident II was facing a delay . The D5s can carry up to 14 W76-1 or W88 warheads, which have estimated yields of 100 kilotons and 475 kilotons respectively. A series of arms control treaties between the United States and Russia has led to reductions in the total number of warheads in each missile, with Trident IIs now typically armed with between five and six warheads each. As of 2015 , NNSA expected to complete production of the first example of the W88 ALT 370, which reportedly has improved arming, fuzing, and firing components, in December 2019. It’s not clear now when those warheads may begin to enter service. The Navy was also supposed to reach initial operational capability with the W76-2 warhead, which is redesigned to produce a lower-yield, by the end of this year . NNSA says it produced the first of these in February 2019. This is a particularly controversial development, which advocates say is necessary to provide the United States with a more flexible nuclear weapon to respond to more limited contingencies. Critics contend that such a weapon only raises the likelihood that the U.S. government will decide to employ a nuclear option, which, in turn, could easily lead to a larger crisis and potentially an all-out nuclear war depending on the adversary in question. You can read more in-depth about the issues and concerns at play in this debate in this War Zone story . The official logo of the W76-2 warhead program., NNSA The Navy did stress that Nebraska’s launches were not “in response to any ongoing world events.” Just in August, Russia conducted its own latest tests of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Project 667BDRM Delfin class ballistic missile submarine Tula fired a single R-29RMU Sineva liquid-fuel ballistic missile, while the Project 955 Borei class Yury Dolgorukiy launched an RSM-56 Bulava. Back in May 2018, the Yuri Dolgoruky notably fired off four Bulavas in a single salvo as part of a snap nuclear drill. China is also expanding its ballistic missile submarine fleets and developing a new submarine-launched ballistic missile to go with them. North Korea recently showed pictures of a modified early Cold War-era submarine modified to launch ballistic missiles , as well. Regardless of whether the launches were routine or not, this large test event also comes as the United States and Russia are finding themselves increasingly at odds over strategic arms control and other nuclear weapons-related issues and signs of a new arms race are already growing. The U.S. government has publicly said that it needs the W76-2 in large part to counter potential Russian developments, as well as the country’s purported “ escalate-to-deescalate ” doctrine. Experts continue to disagree about whether this policy actually exists. In addition, the bilateral Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, recently collapsed after more than three decades. Soon after, the U.S. military tested a ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missile. There are now fears that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which will expire in 2021 if not renewed, maybe also be in danger. Russia developing a number of new nuclear weapons, including a nuclear-powered cruise missile , reportedly at the center of a recent accident that killed at least seven people, and a nuclear-powered torpedo , neither of which would necessarily fall under New START’s existing provisions anyways. With all this in mind, even routine missile tests, such as Nebraska ‘s four recent Trident II launches, may carry an increasing geopolitical weight, whether the United States wants them to or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",Two Turkish Frigates Appear Off Libya Amid Reports Of Troops And Armor Landing Ashore,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Weeks after the Turkish government announced plans to send various forces to Libya to support that country’s internationally recognized government, there are now indications that those deployments are well underway. Two Turkish Navy Gabya class frigates have appeared off the coast of Tripoli, the official Libyan capital, and there are reports emerging now that Turkish troops and heavy armor are arriving in that city, too. Pictures showing the two warships  sailing together near Tripoli first emerged online on Jan. 28, 2020. Unconfirmed reports about the arrival of Turkish forces began to appear on social media hours later. On Jan. 5, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had said in a televised interview that an unspecified number of Turkish troops would be heading to Libya soon and, the day after, revealed that members of the country’s National Intelligence Organization, also referred to by the Turkish acronym MIT, were already in the country. These announcements had followed an agreement between Erdogan and the head of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj, last year, which included provisions for increased security cooperation and the possible deployment of Turkish Troops. The GNA has been locked in a civil conflict for years now with rogue general Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which has its main base of operations in the Eastern Libyan city of Benghazi and enjoys the support of the United Arab Emirates , Egypt, and Russia , among others. It’s not clear exactly which of the eight Gabya class frigates are presently operating off the coast of Libya or when they first arrived. There were reports as early as December 27 indicating that a Turkish military mission in and around the country could include an unspecified number of warships. TCG Goksu and TCG Gokova left their home ports at the end of December, bound for exercises off the coast Algeria that took place during the second week of January. They then remained in the Mediterranean to train with other NATO warships. TCG Gediz was also in the Mediterranean as of December 2019. Among other things, the two frigates, ex- Oliver Hazard Perry class ships that Turkey originally obtained second-hand from the U.S. Navy, could provide badly needed additional air defenses against LNA combat jets , which regularly conduct strikes on targets in and around Tripoli. These vessels, which Turkey put through a deep refit program and now have eight-cell Mk 41 vertical launch system arrays capable of firing RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), could also potentially engage larger drones that the LNA operates, as well. There are also now unconfirmed reports that Turkey has followed up this naval deployment with the insertion of a contingent of troops that includes tanks. There is no word yet on the exact size of this force or the types of vehicles it may have brought with it. Regardless, if true, this would be a much more significant Turkish force that had been expected based on previous reports, which had indicated that any such contingent would be primarily special operations forces arriving to perform advisory functions. At the same time, it is important to note that the term “tank” is routinely misapplied to various other types of armored vehicles and its possible that if a Turkish ground force is now deploying to Libya that it may be equipped with infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, or even mine-resistant armored trucks. There is also the potential that sources on the ground have mistaken the arrival of another shipment of Turkish-made vehicles, such as the BMC Kirpi mine-resistant truck, intended for the GNA for an actual active Turkish military intervention into the country. Turkey has been sending light armored vehicles, as well as drones and other weapons and ammunition to the GNA since at least May 2019 . Any new vehicles or other equipment could be bound for pro-Turkish Syrian forces who Erdogan government has been airlifting into the country to fight on behalf of authorities in Tripoli, as well. The arrival of the two Gabya class frigates and the reports of a major Turkish troop deployment following an abortive bid by Turkey and Russia to push their respective sides in the conflict into a ceasefire. Haftar had swiftly rejected the calls for a halt in the fighting, but traveled to Moscow on Jan. 13, ostensibly to publicly agree to the terms of the Turkish-Russian plan. He left the next day without having signed the agreement. There was hope that there might still be a ceasefire, with various world leaders subsequently convening in Germany for additional talks. Haftar and Sarraj both went to Berlin, but refused to meet with each other directly. By Jan. 27, it was clear that there would be no pause in the conflict in the immediate future. “Over the last 10 days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armored vehicles, advisers and fighters,” a statement from the U.N. Support Mission in Libya on Jan. 27, 2020, said. “The mission condemns these ongoing violations, which risk plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting.” Turkey now seems to be moving ahead with plans to reinforce the GNA’s defenses in and around Tripoli to ensure that the status quo, at least, remains intact in the near future. However, a large and overt Turkish troop deployment could prompt similar moves from Haftars foreign partners, which could further inflame the situation. Egypt , of the parties already actively involved in the conflict in Libya, is in the midst of its own separate spat with Turkey over maritime boundaries in the Mediterranean Sea, another controversial part of Erdogan’s agreement last year with his Libyan counterpart Sarraj. As the United Nations has already warned, Libya could, unfortunately, be looking at a new burst of fighting that could also have ramifications beyond the borders of the North African country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",President Erdogan Says Intel Operatives Are In Libya Ahead Of Turkish Troop Deployment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has publicly acknowledged that his country intelligence operatives have already been actively engaged in Libya a day after formally announcing plans to deploy Turkish troops to that country to support the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli. This comes as forces loyal to rogue General Khalifa Haftar appear to have taken control of the city of Sirte along the central Libyan coast. Haftar says authorities in Tripoli are illegitimate and has the backing of the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Russia, among others. Erdogan said that members of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization, also known by the Turkish acronym MIT, were working in Libya during a ceremony at the intelligence agency’s new compound in Ankara on Jan. 6, 2020. This is hardly surprising given that Turkey has been actively sending weapons, ammunition, and other military assistance to the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli since at least May 2019 . On Jan. 5, Erogdan had said in a televised interview that Turkish military forces would also be heading to Libya to support the GNA. A map showing the general locations of major cities in Libya, including the internationally-recognized capital Tripoli in the West and Benghazi, the ostensible capital of rogue general Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army in the East., Google Maps “There will be an operation center [in Libya], there will be a Turkish lieutenant general leading, and they will be managing the situation over there. [Turkish soldiers] are gradually moving there right now,” Erdogan said on CNN Turk on Jan. 5. “Right now, we will have different units serving as a combatant force.” Erdogan added that Turkey’s deployment was to “to support the legitimate government [of Libya] and avoid a humanitarian tragedy” and “not to fight.” Turkey’s parliament authorized Erdogan to deploy Turkish forces to Libya in support of the GNA on Jan. 2. That vote followed a formal request from Libya’s Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj. In November 2019, Erdogan and Sarraj had signed a deal covering a range of security and other issues , which included provisions for a Turkish military deployment, if Libyan authorities asked for one. Erdogan did not elaborate on the size or composition of the Turkish forces heading to Libya or the timetable for their arrival. There are unconfirmed reports that the deployment, at least initially, could be small, perhaps no more than 50 personnel, primarily for special operations forces units, tasked with training and advising GNA forces and otherwise coordinating Turkish assistance. This could include overseeing the delivery of more advanced military hardware, such as electronic warfare systems, and teaching Libyan forces to operate them. There have been specific claims that Turkey could deploy KORAL road-mobile electronic warfare jamming systems, which seems odd given that these are ostensibly designed to attack hostile radars. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) does have air defenses, including some number of Russian-made Pantsir-S1 short-range air defense systems, reportedly obtained via the United Arab Emirates, as well as older Soviet-era S-125 and SA-6 systems inherited from the previous regime of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. How functional the LNA’s S-125s and SA-6s, or the radars typically associated with them, are is unclear. The Turkish KORAL electronic warfare system., Aselsan However, in October 2019, Turkish authorities said that they had deployed KORAL as part of the country’s intervention into Northern Syria , which was aimed at Kurdish groups that have virtually no air defenses. This raises the possibility that KORAL may have broader functionality for jamming other target sets, including communications and other emitters, such as line-of-sight drone control links, or has useful direction-finding capabilities that could geolocate enemy forces by zeroing in on their radiofrequency emissions. Tools to counter unmanned aircraft, in particular, could be very valuable to the GNA. Drones have become a major feature on both sides of the Libyan conflict, for carrying out surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as strikes. Turkey has already notably supplied the GNA with a number of Bayraktar TB2s , which can carry small munitions, and work has been ongoing for weeks now on the construction of a new airstrip near Tripoli, curiously sandwiched between apartment blocks in a residential development, which looks well suited to supporting drone operations. You can read more about this site in this past War Zone story . With regards to Turkey’s forthcoming military deployment, its possible that Turkish advisers might find themselves directing GNA drone operations, or simply flying additional unmanned aircraft themselves, as well. Manned aircraft and helicopters do remain an important component of the conflict on both sides, as well, and LNA combat jets reportedly targeted the new airstrip outside of Tripoli on Jan. 3. An attack on a GNA military academy in Tripoli, which authorities there blame on another LNA airstrike, killed at least 28 people , as well. Haftar’s forces have denied involvement in the strikes on the academy, raising the possibility that one of the LNA’s foreign benefactors may have been responsible. There have been reports in the past that the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have conducted their own airstrikes against the GNA. This would make sense given the difficultly both the GNA and LNA have had in operating and maintaining their own already small fleets of combat aircraft, as well as the combat losses they have suffered. Beyond Turkey’s formal military deployment and military assistance to the GNA, authorities in Ankara have also facilitated the deployment of groups of Turkish-backed Syrian forces to Libya in the past week. Individuals who have agreed to go fight in Libya have reportedly received significant monetary incentives and the promise of Turkish citizenship. The Turkish intelligence operatives that Erdogan says are in Libya could well be coordinating the activities of these Syrian groups among their other duties, such as intelligence sharing with the GNA. In the meantime, while Haftar’s LNA has, so far, found itself unable to capture Tripoli in its latest offensive aimed at the Libyan capital, its forces have now wrested control of the city of Sirte and outlying areas, including the nearby Ghardabiya Airbase, from the GNA. ISIS-affiliated terrorists in Libya notably overran Sirte in 2016, prompting an American military response in support of GNA-aligned forces. The push into Sirte was reportedly enabled in part by the defection of an armed force known as the 604th Infantry Battalion, which had been ostensibly aligned with the GNA, but belongs to a separate Libyan faction referred to as the Madkhali groups . Madkhali militias have fought for both the GNA and the LNA, as well as other entities vying for control of the country. Images suggest that some of the factions that took part in the operation have been displaying the green flag of Gaddafi’s defunct regime. The long-time dictator was born near Sirte and was killed in the city in 2011 following a U.S. and NATO-led air campaign. The loss of Sirte is a significant blow to the GNA and is an important gain for Haftar’s LNA, eliminating a nagging threat to his forces’ northern flank that sits in a strategic location along the country’s central coastline. The operation to take the city follows the rogue Libyan general’s public calls for increased support for his faction in countering Turkey’s growing involvement in the conflict and prevents Turkey from reinforcing GNA positions there now. The GNA does remain in control of Misrata, roughly halfway between Sirte and Tripoli, but LNA forces control much of the surrounding area there, as well. How the introduction of Turkish forces does or doesn’t alter the balance of power in Libya now remains to be seen, but the primary focus for the GNA would now seem to be in ensuring that it remains in control of Tripoli and Misrata, if nothing else. The injection of fresh Turkish-backed Syrian forces may also lead to new GNA offensives in the near future. Uncertainty remains the word of the day in Libya, but it’s clear that the conflict there is only set to go in new and more complicated directions in the very near future.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 6, 2020",Details Emerge About The Secretive RQ-170 Stealth Drone’s First Trip To Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a decade after the U.S. Air Force officially confirmed its existence, details about the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone and its operational exploits remain extremely limited. Now, newly released documents offer additional insights into the deployment of some of these secretive flying-wing unmanned aircraft to South Korea in 2009. The Air Force officially ordered the deployment of RQ-170s to Kunsan Air Base in South Korea on Sept. 4, 2009. Elements of 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, the only unit publicly known to fly the Sentinels, as well as supporting personnel from other units, first touched down at the South Korean base on Oct. 2, 2009. These and other details are included in records related to the RQ-170 that The War Zone recently obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. The fact that RQ-170s operated from South Korea in late 2009 is not new, with South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo first reporting about the deployment in December of that year. In 2013, War Is Boring confirmed that the Sentinels had previously traveled to the Korean Peninsula based on previous documents the author obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. An undated picture of an RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone on Guam that the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act., USAF via FOIA However, it has long been known that certain details in the original JoongAng Ilbo report were wrong. This includes that the RQ-170s were only being test flown in the country at that time, rather than conducting operational sorties, and that the Air Force planned for the Sentinels to ultimately supplant its manned U-2S Dragon Lady spy planes, which remain forward-deployed in South Korea to this day. Much about the deployment still remains classified, despite the passage of time and even the prior official release of some information. For instance, Air Force censors removed any specific mention of the RQ-170 whatsoever, including in the subject line, from the official Air Combat Command deployment order, dated Sept. 4, 2009, despite having publicly released the title of that document seven years ago. We know that this is the document in question, because we requested it by name and the Air Force acknowledged that it was among the records it released to us with redactions. Regardless, from this heavily redacted document, we can see that the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, had issued a planning order for the RQ-170 deployment to South Korea on June 2, 2009. It’s not clear what, if any event or events, in particular, might have prompted Mullen and his staff to initiate this plan, but North Korea had conducted its second-ever nuclear test at its Punggye-ri test site on May 25 of that year. The regime in Pyongyang had also fired the Unha-2 space launch vehicle , the second in a series of large rockets the U.S. and other countries believed acted as a cover for work on technology for intercontinental ballistic missiles , from its launch facility in Sohae on April 5. Punggye-ri is in the northeastern end of North Korea, while Sohae is on the other side of the country along the coast of the East China Sea. Kunsan is also situated close to the East China Sea. The first page of Air Combat Command’s order regarding the deployment of the RQ-170s to South Korea in 2009., USAF via FOIA Previous documents the author obtained show that the Air Force had also sent a detachment of RQ-170s to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam earlier in 2009 , where they worked to develop concepts of operation for future Pacific deployments. Bill Sweetman and David Fulghum reported for Aviation Week in 2012 that the Central Intelligence Agency had also been involved in supporting the initial deployments of the Sentinels to Afghanistan, where the first public pictures of the drone emerged, and the Korean Peninsula. There is no mention of the CIA in the unredacted portions of the documents the Air Force released to The War Zone regarding the 2009 deployment to South Korea, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t involved. The Agency has long-standing ties to elements of the 432nd Wing, including the secretive 732nd Operations Group , which the Air Force created in 2012 to oversee the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, as well as a number of other drone units . We do know that the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as Air Combat Command itself, did produce risk assessments regarding the proposed missions in East Asia after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s office issued the planning order. The Air Force completely redacted or otherwise withheld details about these reviews – including a memorandum from then-Major General David Goldfein, who was Air Combat Command’s Director of Air and Space Operations at the time – and a “special operational airworthiness release” for the RQ-170. An almost completely redacted memo discussing risk assessments ahead of the deployment of RQ-170s to South Korea in 2009.., USAF via FOIA However, the Air Force did describe the NSA’s assessment as specifically looking into the “intelligence gain loss,” which suggests analysts considered the value of potential intelligence to be gained from employing the stealth drones operationally, almost certainly over North Korea, against what could be at stake if the drone’s capabilities were to be compromised. This kind of risk-reward assessment would make good sense for the deployment of any sensitive asset, especially one such as the RQ-170, the existence of which was not even publicly acknowledged until Dec. 4, 2009. It seems especially prudent in light of the loss of one of the Sentinels inside Iran two years later. Whatever the findings of the risk assessments in 2009 were in the end, Joint Forces Command ultimately ordered the deployment of the RQ-170s to Kunsan in South Korea on Sept. 4 of that year. “Airlift has arrived!” Major General Thomas Andersen, then Director of Requirements for Air Combat Command, wrote in an Email to then-Major General William Fraser, who was head of Air Combat Command at the time, on Oct. 2. “Airlift, with main body, logistics, and Air Vehicles arrived Kunsan AB,” Andersen continued. “Set up activities commencing.” USAF via FOIA The exact size of the contingent and how many Sentinels the Air Force ultimately sent is unclear. It’s also not clear if any contractors from the drone’s manufacturer Lockheed Martin supported the deployment to South Korea, although we can confirm now that the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron was, at least, conducting its basic day-to-day operations in the United States at the time with help from the company. A mention of Lockheed Martin providing contractor support to the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron from one of the documents The War Zone recently obtained via the Freedom of Information Act., USAF via FOIA However, the deployment order calls for the 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base, the wing that the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron falls under, to “provide one each (two total) QFEB2 security forces UTC for duration of deployment.” The Air Force Unit Type Code (UTC) “ QFEB2 ” is for a standardized 13-person Security Forces Squad that can provide “resource protection and weapon system security.” The requirement for “one each” and “two total” strongly suggests that Air Force sent two Sentinels to Kunsan, each of which required its own security force. Another page from the 2009 RQ-170 deployment order discussing security forces requirements. Air Force censors also completely redacted the tasks that the 99th Air Base Wing and the 480th Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Wing were supposed to perform. The 99th oversees operations at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, while the 480th, headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, but with units spread across the country, is responsible for various intelligence collection, processing, and dissemination activities., USAF via FOIA Somewhat curiously, despite the extremely sensitive nature of the RQ-170, the Air Force placed the drones, the ground control stations, and the other elements supporting the deployment under the control of the 8th Fighter Wing, the main unit at Kunsan. The 607th Air Operations Center at Osan Air Base, situated to the north of Kunsan, also helped oversee the Sentinels’ operations, but the 8th remained responsible for “mission planning and execution,” according to the deployment order. The portion of the deployment order discussion command relationships., USAF via FOIA The attachment of the RQ-170s and their associated personnel to the 8th Fighter Wing would help explain the existence of a unit patch for an “8th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron” that is tied to a deployment of the stealth drones to South Korea. It is unclear whether this squadron officially existed or if this was an unofficial or cover designation, but the patch features the same blackbird found on the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron’s official insignia, in this case standing over U.S. and South Korean Flags, as well as the Korean Peninsula in the background. The patch for the “8th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron,” at left, and the official insignia of the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, the only publicly known unit to fly the RQ-170, at right., Eric’s USAF Patches /USAF In addition, the Air Force’s deployment order says that U.S. and South Korean personnel not directly involved in the RQ-170’s activities on the Peninsula would only get unclassified information about the drones and their mission on “a need to know basis.” There was also mention of the potential for “static display and photography” with the approval of Headquarters, Air Force, but it is unknown whether or not the drones were actually shown to anyone, including South Korean officials. The portion of the deployment order that talks about operational security and public affairs protocols., USAF via FOIA There was certainly no public display or even official acknowledgment of the deployment to Kunsan at the time. Still, the author had previously obtained an undated picture of one of the Sentinels on Guam, seen toward the beginning of this story, possibly from the deployment of the drones there earlier in 2009, which shows that it has been possible to get approval for internal static displays and photography. Unfortunately, there is no additional information about the actual sorties the RQ-170s flew from Kunsan or how long the drones remained deployed there. The Sentinels are understood to have a modular centerline payload bay that can accept a sensitive active electronically-scanned array radar with a synthetic aperture imaging and ground-moving target indicator capability. The unmanned aircraft are very likely also equipped to be able to carry electronic intelligence systems and electronic warfare suites at the time and their capabilities have no doubt expanded since then . The RQ-170s would have offered an extremely valuable tool for collecting highly precise intelligence data on sensitive North Korean sites, including those related to the country’s nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. They may have also been employed to track the movements of important members of the regime in Pyongyang, including then-premier Kim Jong Il and individuals close to him, which might have exposed or underscored the significance of certain locations. A satellite image of Kunsan Air Base in South Korea., Google Earth It’s also interesting to note that an Email string from December 2009, regarding what was and wasn’t classified about the RQ-170 program following its official disclosure, which The War Zone also received as part of the recent release of documents, includes a message from an unnamed colonel in Air Combat Command’s Advanced Concepts Branch (A8Z) stating that the drone is not actually “very low observable,” or VLO, despite earlier comments from other individuals within the command about the unmanned aircraft’s stealthy qualities. This same Email also mentions Aviation Week ‘s contemporary reporting on the Sentinels. When it comes to stealthy aircraft, a very low observable design would be one where stealth is the absolute top consideration, which often comes at a high price and performance tradeoffs. A less extensive low observable design, while still stealthy, would balance those features against other factors, such as cost, reliability, and the sensitivity of the design elements and other technologies involved. A portion of the December 2009 Email chain The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act showing unnamed Air Force colonel within Air Combat Command’s Advanced Concepts Branch (A8Z) telling Major General Andersen that he would not describe the RQ-170 as “VLO” or “very low observable.” It also mentions Aviation Week ‘s reporting at the time. It’s unclear what the redacted portions may refer to, but they could be references to reports that the drones had been seen at the Area 51 test site. These could also be references to the drone’s time in Afghanistan. That the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron was based at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport at the time and was in the process of relocating elements to Creech Air Force Base was not classified, even at the time, and is unredacted elsewhere in the Email chain, making it unlikely that either of those locations are blacked out here., USAF via FOIA Another portion of the Email string showing the extent of unclassified details regarding the RQ-170 as of December 2009, including the statement that the drone was “VLO,” which the colonel from Air Combat Command’s Advanced Concepts Branch (A8Z) later said not to use to describe the platform., USAF via FOIA Of course, at the same time, this is only one Email and its not clear if this colonel’s position was a hard fact or opinion. It’s also possible that the officer was simply advising against publicly describing the drone as “very low observable” for operational security reasons. It’s also not clear if the Air Force has sent RQ-170s back to South Korea for more missions in East Asia, but it seems highly probable that the service has carried out additional deployments of the drones there over the past decade. A heavily redacted internal Air Force history covering the activities of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency during the 2013 calendar year, which the author obtained previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, did say that a still classified aerial intelligence platform was flying operations in the Pacific region at that time. The portion of the 2013 Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency history noting that “the aforementioned [redated]” was among the service’s aircraft flying “national collection missions” in the Pacific region., USAF via FOIA Even after more than a decade of service, the Sentinels remain an ideal, if not totally unique asset for penetrating into and loitering over denied areas, such as North Korea, to conduct intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance missions. Those kinds of capabilities would have been in extremely high demand amid North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons testing blitz that began in 2016. When the North Koreans fired the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time on July 4, 2017, the U.S. government reportedly watched “the missile being fueled w/ liquid fuel” just prior to launch. This would have been exactly the kind of mission the RQ-170 was designed to carry out, something The War Zone noted at the time . Just last month, U.S. aerial intelligence platforms also stepped up their monitoring of the insular regime again after a “strategic test” of a large rocket motor and threats to send the Trump Administration a “Christmas gift.” We also know that RQ-170s were flying over Iran and Pakistan in 2011, in the latter case surveilling the compound in Abbottabad where Al Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden before and during the U.S. special operations forces raid that led to his death that year. The drones have also been supporting various test and evaluation activities in the United States since then. All told, more than 10 years after the Air Force officially disclosed the RQ-170’s existence to the world, the majority of its operational history remains shrouded in secrecy. We have now been able to get more information about the deployment of the stealth drones to South Korea in 2009, which is hopefully a sign that more details about these unmanned aircraft and what they’ve been up to will continue to emerge in the coming months and years.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but a number of rockets have hit the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , Iraq, reportedly causing minor damage, but no casualties. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias in the country have been launching sporadic rocket attacks at various American military and diplomatic facilities for over a year now , but this would be the first publicly acknowledged instance where they actually hit a portion of the Embassy compound in Iraq’s capital over the course of those strikes. This comes as U.S. forces in the region remain on high alert following weeks of increased tensions with Iran and its proxies, including Iraqi militias, following an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian commander earlier this month and a subsequent Iranian ballistic missile strike aimed at U.S. personnel in Iraq. This latest rocket attack came at around 7:30 PM local time on Jan. 26, 2020, in Baghdad, with militants reportedly firing a total of five artillery rockets toward the sprawling Green Zone. This area of Baghdad, which was off-limits to the public for years following the U.S.-led invasion and subsequent occupation of the country in 2003, is home to various diplomatic missions and Iraqi government buildings. Initial reports did not indicate that any of the rockets fell within the Embassy compound, causing alarms to sound, but Iraqi and U.S. government sources reportedly later told various outlets that one of the rockets had hit a dining hall and another two fell nearby. CNN has reported that an initial damage assessment is still ongoing. There is video already circulating online reportingly showing the rocket attack, as well as warning sirens going off inside Forward Operating Base Union III , a U.S. military facility located near the Embassy compound. No group has claimed responsibility so far, but previous similar strikes aimed at American diplomatic and military personnel in Iraq have been tied to Iranian-backed militias in the country. #BREAKING up to 5 Katyusha rockets landing either close to US embassy or Green Zone area in Baghdad, Iraq pic.twitter.com/k6jibmyT9z — Yosef Yisrael (@yosefyisrael25) January 26, 2020 #Breaking ""Seek shelter"" We are still advised to take cover in Union III, just across the road from the #US embassy in Green Zone #Baghdad .

There has been no official statement yet from the U.S. State Department or the U.S. military. These would be the first rockets confirmed to have actually hit within the U.S. Embassy compound, despite Iranian-backed Iraqi militias launching an increasing number of attacks toward the Green Zone in recent months. Those same militant groups have fired rockets at other facilities that American diplomatic and military personnel use throughout Iraq on a somewhat regular basis tracing back all the way to 2018 . One of these earlier incidents, on Dec. 28, killed a U.S. contractor, Nawres Hamid , a naturalized American citizen who had emigrated from Iraq. The U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad was also subjected to an attack by a mob of individuals, including members of Iranian-backed militias, on Dec. 31. These incidents touched off a series of events that led first to a U.S. drone strike that killed the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani , in Baghdad, on Jan. 3, 2020. That, in turn, precipitated an unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strike aimed at areas that U.S. forces occupy at Al Asad Air Base and Erbil Airport in Iraq on Jan. 7. Despite initial reports, American officials now say that 34 individuals were injured in those strikes, which also caused significant damage at Al Asad. There are unconfirmed reports that earlier rocket attacks aimed at the Green Zone, including the most recent previous incident on Jan. 20, also actually struck the Embassy compound, but did not cause any casualties. #IRAQ : – @USEmbBaghdad not immediately available for comment -First time direct hit immediately reported but US source tells @AFP Jan 20 attack (not 21, per previous tweet) also directly hit the embassy – @AdilAbdAlMahdi , Halbussi swiftly condemn attack — Maya Gebeily (@GebeilyM) January 26, 2020 How the United States responds remains to be seen. U.S. officials had previously indicated that there hope was that targeted killing of Qasem Soleimani had made clear to Iran and its proxies that continued attacks on American forces in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East would not go unanswered. “You’re not allowed to just fire off 31 rockets at U.S. forces and – and we’re just supposed to consider it the cost of doing business,” Jonathan Rath Hoffman, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, told reporters on Jan. 16, 2020, referring to the strike that killed Nawres Hamid in December. “The impact of it [the Soleimani strike] though and being an overt and being an attributable action is that the Iranians have had to recalibrate the – the deterrence and that they now understand that there are some – that – that we’re not going to allow a progression of attacks.” We will continue to update our story as more information becomes available.

There have also been conflicting reports about how many rockets landed inside the Embassy compound in total. “The security situation remains tense and Iranian-backed armed groups remain a threat,” a State Departement Spokesman also told CNN , but did not specifically blame any of those militias for the rocket attack. “So, we remain vigilant.” NEW: A @StateDept spokesperson to @VOANews on the rocket attacks in #Baghdad : We are aware of reports of rockets landing in the International Zone.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",The B-52 Almost Got An Ahead Of Its Time Air-Launched Ballistic Missile Named Skybolt,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Interest in air-launched ballistic missiles has seen something of a renaissance around the world in recent years, notably in Russia , China , and Israel . At the same time, the U.S. Air Force is in the process of developing new, large, long-range, air-launched hypersonic weapons for its B-52 bombers that have similar general form factors to more traditional air-launched ballistic missile designs. However, the concept is nothing new and Air Force was planning to adopt a nuclear-tipped air-launched ballistic missile, known as the Skybolt, as a payload for its B-52s more than 50 years ago. In 1959, the Douglas Aircraft company won the U.S. Air Force’s first contract, worth $3 million at the time, or nearly $26.4 million today, to conduct an initial design study for Skybolt , which was originally known simply as Weapon System 138A , or WS-138A. Douglas subsequently subcontracted with Northrop, Aerojet, and General Electric to develop the guidance system, rocket motor, and reentry vehicle for the weapon, respectively. The Air Force had first begun laying the groundwork for Skybolt after the U.S. Navy began the development of the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile in 1956. There were fears within the former service that Polaris would obviate the need for strategic bombers, compounded by separate and growing concerns about the expanding capabilities and general density of Soviet air defenses. In 1957, the Air Force had initiated its first foray into the development of an air-launched ballistic missile as part of the Weapon System 199 program , or WS-199. Under WS-199, in November 1958, a modified B-47 Stratojet bomber successfully launched an experimental air-launched ballistic missile test article called Bold Orion , which the Martin company had designed, for the first time. The next month, another B-47 fired a two-stage Bold Orion prototype. Days after that test, a B-58 Hustler bomber conducted the first launch a different prototype design from Convair and Lockheed, known as High Virgo . McDonnell also built a missile for WS-199, the Alpha Draco , but it was never air-launched. A Bold Orion missile, an immediate predecessor to the Skybolt, mounted on a B-47 bomber., via spaceline.org High Virgo suffered a number of failures during testing between 1958 and 1959, largely due to its guidance and communications systems, and never flew farther than 310 miles, according to a report the Federation of American Scientists published in 2019. Bold Orion, however, successfully completed 11 of 12 test launches and the two-stage version demonstrated a maximum range of over 990 miles. The WS-138A program leveraged the experience gained during these experiments in the development of Skybolt, which the Air Force subsequently also designated GAM-87A. In February 1960, the Air Force authorized another $32 million, or around $281.1 million today’s dollars, for Douglas to move beyond the design stage and actually begin building prototype weapons. Douglas’ final Skybolt design was a two-stage ballistic missile, similar in broad concept to the Bold Orion. The weapon was more than 38 feet long with its aerodynamic tail cap and 35 inches in diameter. This actually made it shorter than North American’s GAM-77A Hound Dog air-launched cruise missile, which the Air Force had already put into service in 1960 as an interim standoff weapon for the B-52 ahead of the introduction of the GAM-87A. After launch, the GAM-87A’s tail cap would fall away and the first stage rocket motor would ignite, boosting it into a ballistic trajectory. That stage would then fall away and the second stage would take over with rocket motor with “a gimballed nozzle allowing it to maneuver in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and the vacuum of space where control surfaces cannot function,” according to the Federation of American Scientists’ report . An inertial guidance system would steer the weapon toward the target. The GAM-87A’s primary armament was originally going to be single W47 thermonuclear warhead , the same one used on Polaris, but this was eventually changed to a W59 , the same warhead on the Minuteman silo-launched intercontinental ballistic missile. The Air Force’s desired maximum range for Skybolt was approximately 1,150 miles, with an apogee around 300 miles high. Reaching a peak speed of Mach 15, the missile would have been able to cover this distance in just 12 minutes, according to the Federation of American Scientists . The weapon’s range and speed would have allowed B-52s to strike deep into Soviet territory, while also reducing the bombers’ vulnerability to hostile fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles. Being able to strike quickly and from multiple and unpredictable vectors at once offered significant advantages over ground-based ballistic missiles in fixed emplacements or silos . This was also true of the submarine-launched Polaris. The United Kingdom, which was facing similar concerns about the vulnerability of its strategic bombers, had asked to and was allowed to join the Skybolt program in 1960. The Avro Vulcan , one of the Royal Air Force’s three so-called “V bombers,” the others being the Handley Page Victor and the Vickers Valiant , was chosen to be the primary launch platform. The Victor and a modified Vickers VC10 airliner , which the Royal Air Force also operated as an aerial refueling tanker, were also considered as possible GAM-87A carriers, according to V Force – The History of Britain’s Airborne Deterrent . However, despite the clear interest and commitment of both the U.S. Air Force and the U.K. Royal Air Force, Skybolt quickly ran into technical difficulties and setbacks. In 1959, the Air Force had already canceled work on a more powerful B-58B Hustler variant, which was initially expected to be the primary launch platform for the GAM-87A, shifting focus to integrating the weapon on the B-52. Beyond the missile itself, Douglas needed to develop a new, specialized heavyweight pylon so the B-52 could carry two Skybolts under each wing, as well as loading equipment large enough to handle the weapons. A schematic of the special wing pylon for the B-52, which could carry two Skybolt missiles., Douglas The special trailing for positioning two missiles underneath the pylon in order to load them, with an operator shown giving a sense of the scale of the system., Douglas The Skybolt “program office asserted [the weapon] was ‘the most complex ballistic missile system ever to be developed by the United States’ due to the difficulty of launching the missile from a moving platform, the need to integrate the missile with the aircraft to in order to know its launch position precisely, and the need to operate in environments that could subject the missile to shock, vibrations, and rapidly changing conditions,” according to the Federation of American Scientists . “President Kennedy himself even stated that the system was ‘the most sophisticated weapon imaginable,’ involving ‘the kind of engineering that’s been beyond us.'” The first five flight tests failed in some fashion or another. In the first test in January 1962, the second-stage motor failed to ignite and the first-stage motor didn’t work in the second attempt. An electrical failure scuttled the third test and a data link failed during the fourth launch, precluding the collection of telemetry data to determine whether the missile had performed as intended. The fifth test launch, the first to actually involve a missile with a functioning guidance system, experienced failures with the weapon’s gas generator and hydraulic subsystem “causing flight to end prematurely,” according to an official, now-declassified internal Air Force history . The sixth launch, which took place on Dec. 22, 1962, was successful, but only saw the weapon fly out to a range of 800 miles, 350 miles short of the Air Force’s desired maximum range. By that point, under the new U.S.-military wide designation system that had gone into effect that year, Skybolt had gotten redesignated from GAM-87A to AGM-48A. Faced with the prospect of rising costs, including more than $1 billion in 1960s dollars to buy over one thousand of the missiles, and delays, then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara killed the program the very next day. He also said he felt that air-launched ballistic missiles offered “ no unique capability ,” especially over Polaris. By the end of the month, the Air Force had stopped all work on Skybolt. This quickly caused a crisis with the United Kingdom, which had canceled its own Blue Streak nuclear-armed air-launched ballistic missile program, as well as plans for an upgraded Blue Steel II standoff missile in favor of Skybolt. The country had also decided to begin retiring its American-supplied Thor ground-launched intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Skybolt was to form the core of the U.K.’s nuclear deterrent capabilities for years to come. The U.S. government subsequently agreed to supply Polaris missiles, which the Royal Navy would employ from its new Resolution class ballistic missile submarines. For the Air Force, the decision was certainly a rebuke, but the impact was decidedly less extreme. The service did still have the Hound Dog, by that point redesignated the AGM-28A, which would remain in service until 1976. Despite McNamara’s dismissal of the air-launched ballistic missile as a basic concept and his clear support for Polaris, strategic bombers never went away. In the 1970s, the B-52 also gained a new nuclear missile, the AGM-69A Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM), as well, to help reduce its vulnerability to hostile air defenses. Had the time come, Air Force B-52s would have flown to their targets, at low levels to help further mask their approach, attacking air defense sites with SRAMs along the way. You can read more about the AGM-69A in this past War Zone piece . This eventually gave way to more modern air-launched cruise missiles, such as the AGM-86B and AGM-129 Air-Launched Cruise Missile. At present, the AGM-86B is the only nuclear weapon the B-52 is authorized to carry , though it is expected to gain a new stealthy air-launched and nuclear-armed cruise missile in the coming years. The U.S. military did briefly return to the air-launched ballistic missile concept in the early 1970s, going so far as to conduct a successful test involving the launch of an LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, typically fired from a silo, from a C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft over the Pacific Ocean in 1974. The launch concept involved releasing the missile out of the back of the massive airlifter, after which a set of parachute oriented the missile into a near-vertical launch position. The missile’s main rocket motor then fired, carrying it to an apogee of 20,000 feet, before it fell into the sea below. The United States ultimately abandoned its air-launched Minuteman plans for good during negotiations with the Soviet Union over the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) treaty. However, the U.S. military has continued to use a similar procedure to launch ballistic missile surrogates from C-17 airlifters in support of missile defense system tests. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tZVxIOEpa4o As it stands now, the B-52 is still set to become a major launch platform for oversized weapons once again, but, at least for the moment, the plan is for these to have conventional warheads. Last year, one of these bombers conducted its first flight with a test article being used in the development of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW. This weapon looks very much like an air-launched ballistic missile, but has a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle as a payload that is capable of maneuvering inside the atmosphere at extreme speeds. The Air Force is looking to integrate other boost-glide vehicles, as well as air-breathing hypersonic missiles onto the B-52 in the future and is in the process of developing new heavyweight pylons to better accommodate these and other very large weapons in the future. Other countries have also been seizing on the concept and have put their own weapons into service, or appear to be getting close to that goal. Russia says it has deployed a limited number of Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, a derivative of the ground-launched Iskander-M, as well as modified MiG-31K aircraft to launch them. China has also shown off its H-6N bomber, which is specifically designed to carry oversized payloads, possibly including the DF-21D air-launched ballistic missile and the WZ-8 high-speed reconnaissance drone. Companies in Israel are developing Rampage and Rocks , which are smaller air-launched ballistic missiles intended for fighter jet-sized aircraft. So, more than five decades after Skybolt’s inglorious end, not only has the B-52 endured, the Air Force is now closer than ever to actually fielding similarly large, long-range weapons that use rocket boosters on the bombers. Other countries are now moving in the same direction, showing that Douglas’ air-launched ballistic missile was, in many ways, ahead of its time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 5, 2017",New Zealand A-4s Flew Crazy Formation Rolls While “Plugged-In” To A Buddy Tanker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Flight demonstration teams are a fixture of modern military aviation, performing routines at airshows and other events to help with recruitment and otherwise just promote engagement between the service that operates the aircraft and the public. These units typically draw on the skills of expert pilots to perform often iconic routines with unique or otherwise impressive aerobatic maneuvers. A prime example of this is the “plugged-in” barrel roll that Royal New Zealand Air Force’s now-retired A-4K Skyhawks used to perform. Martin Pert, the present team leader, or Red 1, of the Red Arrows , the U.K. Royal Air Force’s flight demonstration team, recently highlighted the plugged-in maneuver in a Tweet . The move involves one A-4K linking up with another one flying in front carrying a buddy refueling pod. The two aircraft than perform a barrel roll physically connected together with the trailing Skyhawk’s inflight refueling probe “plugged” into the drogue from the refueling pod underneath the other jet. Pert’s social media post was accompanied by a clip from an undated video, a longer version of which is seen below, showing the A-4Ks of the new-defunct Kiwi Red team flying a particularly elaborate version of the move with four more Skyhawks also flying in a close, arrow-shaped “Swan” formation, with two on either side of the two linked together jets. Probe-and-drogue refueling is complex and potentially dangerous under the best conditions, with it not being totally uncommon for receiving aircraft to have difficultly “catching” the drogue basket with their refueling probes or parts getting snapped off on either end. There is even work being done now to develop advanced stabilization systems to try to make the entire process easier. So, just linking up with the tanking aircraft reliably within the timing constraints of an air show routine is impressive before you add in flying in close formation and staying connected throughout a complete barrel roll. The Kiwi Red team performed the maneuver regularly starting around 1987-1988 and ending in 1990. The team had six A-4Ks and drew pilots and other personnel from the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s No. 75 Squadron. That unit had also acted as the official display team between 1980 and 1981, during which time they invented to plugged-in barrel roll, initially flying it with just two aircraft. On Oct. 24, 1989, Kiwi Red’s number 3 and 4 aircraft tragically collided in mid-air during a practice routine, killing one of the pilots, and prompting a review of the organization that eventually led the Royal New Zealand Air Force to disband it entirely in 1990. It’s unclear if the plugged in maneuver was a factor in the preceding accident. Regardless, New Zealand Skyhawks did continue to perform versions of the plugged-in maneuver after that point, however. Another video available online shows a pair of A-4Ks flying linked together in a less intensive fashion at an air show in 1995. The possibility of any future aerial performances involving New Zealand’s A-4Ks came to a halt for good in 2001, when the country retired the type. At the time, these Skyhawks were among the most advanced variants anywhere in the world, with the same AN/APG-66 pulse doppler radar found on more modern F-16A/B Viper fighter jets, as well as radar warning receivers, updated weapons and stores interfaces, and updated cockpit configuration that included multi-function displays, a more up-to-date Heads Up Display (HUD), and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) flight controls. The Skyhawk family has had an impressive run since the first versions of the aircraft entered service with the U.S. Navy in 1956. Other modernized A-4s remain in operational service in both Argentina and Brazil . New Zealand’s A-4Ks have since found their own second lease on life with Draken, a private company that provides “red air” aggressor services , notably to the U.S. military. The U.S. Navy had already operated other Skyhawk variants in this role itself for many years, which you can read about more in this past War Zone special feature . Draken’s pilots certainly continue to exploit diminutive Skyhawk’s impressive maneuverability in their mock duels with far more advanced aircraft, but days of A-4s wowing crowds by flying plugged-in together are over.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 5, 2020",Star Trek: Picard Is The Long Overdue Show We Desperately Need Right Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret , I am a huge Star Trek fan. It has been something that’s been with me nearly my entire life. To this day, when I just need a certain level of relaxation and familiarity, I will throw The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine on and let it rip. I have seen the episodes so many times, but I always walk away wowed, appreciative, and even excited about how good many of the stories were, even though they were produced on budgets that can be considered tiny compared to today’s mega television shows. You can learn a lot by watching Star Trek, including a lot about yourself and most importantly, who you aspire to be. Star Trek: The Next Generation eventually redefined what Star Trek was. At its center was one of the most morally sound characters in the history of fiction, Captain Jean Luc Picard, played by the now mega movie star Patrick Stewart. Hence, when I heard that he was returning to the role after nearly two decades in a new series and re-launching the up-to-date prime Star Trek timeline so many of us are so heavily invested in, I couldn’t have been more excited. It was literally like receiving a tremendous gift, albeit one that was overdue. A Galactic Detour Of Sorts I have sat for the better part of 20 years watching the franchise go in directions I was far from thrilled about. Star Trek Enterprise was better than it gets credit for, but it doesn’t compare where it counts most with its predecessors—in its atmosphere, tone, texture, and most of all, impact. It was killed right when it was finally finding itself, but in all honestly, it wasn’t a massive loss. Then J.J. Abrams took Star Trek into the glitzy action blockbuster realm. The best thing these films did was show what Star Trek could look like using cutting-edge special effects and a generous budget. Beyond that, they were at times mildly entertaining and at others, very frustrating. Overall the rebooted alternate “Kelvin” timeline films felt like a detour of sorts and they didn’t really represent what so many post- Next Generation fans came to love about the franchise. It was as if Star Trek The Original Series had mated with the latter Fast And The Furious films and this is what popped out nine months later. Paramount In the last few years, Star Trek: Discovery was born. Relegated to CBS ‘s streaming service, it had some interesting ideas and many unbelievably poor ones (have you seen or heard the Klingons?), but like Abrams’ Star Trek films, it gave us a clear idea of how incredible Star Trek can look with the latest production capabilities and a healthy budget brought to bear. Also, like the latest movies, it returned to a time frame around when the original series was set. Some really bizarre choices and the show’s premium on relentless action made it confusing at times and it lacked the really rich and slower storytelling of Star Trek past. Its second season was convoluted, but better than the first, with the highlight being Captain Pike played incredibly by Anson Mount, and the pre-Kirk USS Enterprise’s crew of characters that were far more interesting than Discovery ‘s. Simply put, Pike and company stole the show. In fact, I wish they literally stole Discovery ‘s budget and production crew. I would trade a Captain Pike spinoff over Discovery with glee. Hopefully, we will be getting one that can exist alongside Discovery, so that wouldn’t be necessary. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2EpuR90jOrs Now, in deep in the age of the streaming wars, CBS is betting huge on Trek. Discovery remains in production and a slew of other Star Treks shows , from animated to live-action, are also on their way to CBS All Access , the biggest of which is Star Trek: Picard. Rejoining The Prime Timeline In The Present, Finally. The big point to all this beyond a quick history of post- Nemesis Star Trek is that all of these properties have been set in the era of the original series or before. The characters that many of us grew up with and loved so much from The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine , and Voyager were abandoned in the hunt for reboots, prequels, and more soft reboots. While the studio somehow believed most people who actually wanted more Star Trek yearned for Kirk, Spock, and Bones, or even their forebears, I think it’s safe to say the vast majority of us wanted more from the era we had spent literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of our lives learning about. Finally, and I mean finally, the powers that be have realized what should have been a blatant reality. I mean, how couldn’t they by now? There are far more people around that grew up watching Picard and Riker than Kirk and Spock. Since Netflix became a thing, a whole new generation got hooked on these shows. The highly serialized Deep Space Nine , in particular, is far more potent when binged than when having to chase around re-run listings like many of us did over the years. That show remains eerily ahead of its time in countless ways and is absolutely awesome, even by today’s high television standards. More on that here . It’s amazing to think the Star Trek Nemesis happened 18 years ago. The movie wasn’t good and a break was needed, but one lasting nearly two decades?, Paramount The truth is, as time has moved one, The Next Generation has become perceived in a way similar to how the original series was in decades past. It is a classic, groundbreaking, highly engaging, and at times a remarkable example of television and science fiction storytelling. With this in mind, for many fans, it was obvious when Star Trek: Picard was announced that it would draw massive attention and anticipation. It was more ‘what took you so long?’ than ‘what bold risk!’ Look no farther than Seth MacFarlane’s The Orville to understand the pent up demand for a Next Generation -like era show. The fact that it is a totally off-brand and humorous take on many of The Next Generation’s themes and has still lasted three seasons, is significant. In fact, I would argue that The Orville is the best Star Trek in decades. The added benefit that everyone from The Next Generation is still alive, as well as many from Deep Space Nine and Voyager, and engaged in the Star Trek community means that Star Trek: Picard could, and should, turn into a whole new tangent of content for the already reinvigorated franchise, one that will likely be its most popular. But while it’s exciting to catch up with some of our favorite characters from the rich era of Star Trek that ran from 1987 to 2002, it’s more exciting that after 18 long and frustrating years, we can actually pick back up on the most extensive science fiction timeline any screen has ever seen. Jeri Ryan comes back as Seven Of Nine in Star Trek: Picard. After a controversial introduction, her character ended up being one of the biggest highlights of Voyager . , CBS In other words, hopefully, more spinoffs will come from this that will incorporate characters from all three series. Judging by the fact that Star Trek: Picard hasn’t even aired yet, but it has already been renewed for a second season, I think it is more likely than not. A Badly Needed Voice From A Past Next Generation Beyond the chronically unanswered demands of a huge fan base finally being satisfied, Star Trek: Picard could and should be far more than just a long-awaited sequel series with a hugely popular leading man. Picard’s character in Star Trek: The Next Generation had the best and most confident moral compass of any character I have embraced in fiction. Not only were his convictions deeply grounded, but his logic was absolutely consistent and uncannily on point. Somehow, this was the case without making him unnecessarily preachy or even cheesy. Such an accomplishment was the result of a magic potion of fantastic writing and Patrick Stewart bringing Picard to life and evolving the character over time. The result was a pulp-culture icon that really is worth listening to carefully. Picard was a quiet, reserved, powerful man that also had a few of his own demons and somewhat entertaining shortcomings. Above all else, he achieved huge respect of his peers and a sense of authority via his mind, not his muscles. He was a slight, not very tall, graying, but mostly bald man. Hardly the traditional swashbuckling science-fiction or fantasy hero we are accustomed to. His power came through intellect, and we believed it without question… Totally. Paramount This is the exact voice we need in a turbulent time in the country’s and the world’s history. We need to ask ourselves “what would Picard do?” in regards to the outlandish moral excursions we find ourselves mired in politically, militarily, and sociologically. I have no deep insight into what the new series will hold, but I can only hope that they take the Picard of the past and plunk him down in a far less certain world than the one portrayed in The Next Generation. We need a Picard operating in a broken system struggling to find its way again, not a perfect one. A system with faltering long-held institutions and decaying morality. That way our own struggles in these regards can be reflected back at us in a manner only great science fiction really can. As such, Star Trek: Picard could be so much more than just a good new Star Trek story with some beloved characters. It can have a real impact and help us better come to terms with the decisions that face our very real society. Above all else, no other character can provide clarity even in the murkiest situations. A retired Picard has a lot to think about in Star Trek: Picard, and that’s a positive sign., CBS The worst thing that could happen is that Star Trek: Picard just turns into another over-paced, action-packed, largely senseless adventure that has to swing a sledgehammer to make a point. But there in lies the opportunity—if the writers and production team behind the series are able to keep the prevailing “never enough action” forces at bay, and settle in with a more balanced, character-driven, and cerebral tone, that alone will make the show unique for the genre in this day and age. For Star Trek alone, it could redefine the franchise and set the bar at a new height. There are promising indications that the series may be heading in this direction, but we won’t know for sure until the show premieres this Thursday, January 23rd, on CBS All Access . For the sake of the Federation, and maybe even ourselves, let’s hope it does.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 25, 2022",British Streetfighter II Tank Has X-Ray Vision And Is All About The Urban Fight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Army recently showed off a new concept for a Challenger 2 main battle tank optimized for urban operations , dubbed Streetfighter II. The vehicle has an Israeli-made IronVision distributed vision system, which allows the crew to see in all directions even while riding inside with all the hatches closed and a mock-up of a launcher for the increasingly popular Brimstone anti-tank missile on top of the turret. Elements of the Royal Tank Regiment evaluated the Streetfighter II tank during exercises at Copehill Down earlier in January 2020. Copehill Down is one of the facilities within the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s expansive training area on Salisbury Plain and is set up to simulate what British forces refer to as Fighting In Built Up Areas, or FIBUA. In the United States, this is more commonly known as Military Operations in Urban Terrain, or MOUT . The British Army first began the Streetfighter project in December 2018 “One of the primary goals of Streetfighter is to identify capability gaps between ourselves and potential enemies and then to recommend technical solutions for those areas of possible tactic overmatch,” a member of the Royal Tank Regiment, identified only as Captain Quant, said in an official video presentation regarding the trials, seen below. “These are in areas like lethality, survivability, [and] situational awareness.” The Streetfighter II tank, which carries a blocky brown-white-bluish gray camouflage scheme reminiscent of the ones that British Army armored vehicles stationed in Berlin wore toward the end of the Cold War, builds on the original prototype that the British Army created for the program when it began just over a year ago. The most significant addition is the inclusion of the IronVision system, which Israeli defense contractor Elbit first unveiled in 2018. The company says that it has been working with the British Army to integrate IronVision on the Streetfighter II vehicle since January 2019, according to Jane’s 360 . IronVision consists of an array of electro-optical and infrared cameras positioned around the hull of an armored vehicle, which then feed into a specialized helmet-mounted display. The system then “stitches’ those feeds together, giving the individual wearing the helmet the ability to “see” right through the hull of the tank in any direction, day or night. This is similar in many respects to the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS) on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The added situational awareness that this offers to the crew, while also allowing them to remain protected inside the tank with all of the hatches “buttoned up,” is valuable, in general, but especially in urban environments. Dense, built-up areas, where conflicts are increasingly likely to occur , offer ample positions for hostile forces to hide, make quick attacks on the blind spots of passing vehicles, even those with dismounted infantry supporting them, and then rapidly retreat behind cover. Optics associated with a tank’s main gun or less comprehensive add-on sensor systems can only look in so many directions at once, and often with a very narrow field of view. Crew standing in open hatches or other personnel riding on the vehicle can help scan for threats, but they are also exposed to threats, including snipers. The original Streetfighter concept did have a mast-mounted 360-degree camera on the turret, but this still offered fixed fields of view and did not allow an operator the same kind of normal, natural freedom to simply “look” around that IronVision provides. The improved version of the concept tank does still feature a camera system slung on the barrel that offers an additional means of peering around corners, something the Danish military reportedly first employed operationally in Afghanistan on their German-made Leopard 2 tanks, as noted in the video below. The original Streetfighter vehicle also had an external tablet-style system mounted externally at the rear that infantry working with the tank could use to look through its sensors to get a better sense of the battlefield themselves, but it’s not clear if this system can pipe in the feeds from IronVision. Another member of the Royal Tank Regiment, identified simply as Corporal Towers, did highlight the improved ability, in general, for troops to communicate with those inside the tank and see what they see in the official video. Streetfighter II reportedly has a further updated communications suite, which likely includes data-sharing capabilities, as well. The original Streetfighter tank already demonstrated manned-unmanned teaming with a small unmanned ground vehicle, which offers another option for scouting ahead and investigating potential ambush sites or other hazards. This could even help investigate the interiors of buildings ahead of commanders sending in dismounted troops. The other major addition to the Streetfighter II configuration is a mock-up of a launcher for Brimstone anti-tank missiles on top of the turret. When the British Army put the tank on static display, it places one inert missile in the launcher, which looks to able to potentially accommodate at least two of these weapons. A product of the European missile consortium MBDA, Brimstone is a multi-mode weapon with both millimeter-wave radar and laser guidance systems, allowing it to engage threats at extended ranges day or night and in poor weather or on battlefields full of smoke, dust, and other obscurants. Brimstone is already in service with the Royal Air Force and will be part of the Armament options for the British Army’s forthcoming AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. MBDA is increasingly promoting the weapon, which is increasingly in worldwide popularity, in general, as an option for surface-launched applications , including on ground vehicles and boats. The missile’s ability to get to a general target area using inertial navigation and then autonomously spot and engage targets would give Streetfighter II a way to engage threats that the tank’s crew might not be able to attack with its 120mm main gun or .50 caliber and 7.62mm machine guns. It also simply offers the tank a standoff attack option. Curiously absent in the Streetfighter additions for the Challenger 2 is any type of active protection system, which are becoming increasingly prevalent around the world . These systems, which come in various forms, are generally capable of defeating incoming infantry anti-tank rockets and guided missiles. These weapons have become an increasing feature in many recent conflicts with non-state actors , as well as nation-state militaries , who are increasingly armed with advanced types. A hard-kill or soft-kill active protection system, or a combination of both, would seem to be an obvious choice to add to the Streetfighter II tank. Hard kill types use sensors tied to some form of an explosive array , projectile launcher , or maybe even eventually a directed energy weapon, such as a laser , to detect and physically knock down incoming rockets or missiles. Soft-kill systems use electronic warfare jammers or directed energy weapons to confuse, disable, or even damage guidance systems or other critical components to neutralize the threat. It also lacks remotely-operated weapon stations for machine guns or other weapons on top of the turret, another feature that is increasingly common on armored vehicles worldwide. These systems offer vehicle crews additional means to actually engage any threats they detect while remaining buttoned-up. It’s possible that weight may be a factor. The latest models of the Challenger 2 are already nearly 83 tons when fitted with applique armor kits meant to improve their overall survivability. Streetfighter II notably lacks this add-on protection, but does feature a bulldozer blade for clearing obstacles, which troops also used as an improvised mobile stretcher to evacuate wounded personnel in the recent trials at Copehill Down. Another British Army Challenger 2 test tank, known as Megatron, fitted with various applique armor systems, a soft camouflage covering that also reduces its infrared signature, a remote weapon station, and other features that could find their way onto modernized variants in the future., Crown Copyright The Challenger 2’s weight has already been an important factor with regards to the development of the upgrades to be included in the Challenger 2 Life Extension Program, or CLEP, which is intended to help keep the tanks in service through at least 2035, It has also impacted their general mobility. In 2016, the British Army separately hired BAE Systems in the United Kingdom and Krauss Maffei Wegmann in Germany to jointly work on a developing a new armored bridge layer that could support the weight of the latest up-armored variants. “I do hope this concept becomes reality,” the Royal Tank Regiment’s Corporal Towers said. “It makes our life on the ground a lot easier.” Streetfighter II is certainly an interesting concept and urban areas are only set to become a more common battlefield for any modern military. It will be interesting to see how it evolves and what additional features, such as active protection systems, might get added as time goes on and the British Army gets closer to potentially fielding operational examples of these modified tanks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 7, 2020",Russian Navy’s Top Officer Says Shadowy Zircon Hypersonic Missile Has “Childhood Diseases”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Navy’s top officer has said that the shadowy 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile is suffering from “childhood diseases” in its development, which will need to be resolved before it enters service some time in the coming years. This comes as the first at-sea test of the weapon has yet to take place, at least publicly, something previous reports had said was scheduled to occur before the end of 2019. Admiral Nikolai Evmenov, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, offered the update on Zircon in a recent interview with state-run media outlet RIA Novosti . He also said that unspecified “frigates,” likely the Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class ships as previous reports had indicated , were slated to be the first to test fire the 3M22s and carry them operationally. Russia had initially identified the Kirov class nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov , which is still undergoing a deep refit , as the first ship that would be armed with the new missiles. In March 2019, state-run news agency TASS had also reported that the first-in-class Admiral Gorshkov , which entered service in 2018 , would be the first ship to launch a Zircon at sea “at the end of 2019.” Evmenov did not explain what “childhood diseases” the Zircon might have or how much they’ve impacted its development schedule. He also did not give a firm date as to when the missiles might enter operational service, saying that they would be available to the fleet “in the coming years.” There were rumors that Admiral Gorshkov might have been preparing to conduct the first at-sea Zircon launch when the Russian Navy announced that it would head to the White Sea to test-fire various missiles in November 2019, but this does not appear to have taken place. “The frigate fired one cruise missile Kalibr and one missile Oniks from the onboard launchers. Both missiles hit the targets,” a press release from the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet, to which the frigate is assigned, said on Nov. 29. Kalibr is a subsonic land-attack cruise missile, while Oniks is a supersonic anti-ship cruise missile, both of which have been in Russian service for years now. There’s no clear indication that Gorshkov was ever due to fire Zircon during that testing period. Still, it is worth noting that the ship had already launched Kalibr missiles during the Grom-2019 exercise in October. TASS had also reported that the frigate’s White Sea sortie was supposed to include “trials to test-fire new missile armament.” A specially configured Il-20RT aircraft capable of collecting telemetry data also reportedly supported these activities in the White Sea, along with an Il-38 maritime patrol aircraft, that gathered visual imagery, which does indicate testing of new missiles or new variants of existing missiles, such as the Kalibr and Oniks. Evmenov had also told RIA Novosti in his recent interview touching on Zircon, that the Russian Navy was pushing ahead to integrate the combat-proven Kalibr on more ships as the development of the hypersonic missile continues. One of four Il-20RT telemetry aircraft used to support missile tests., Sergey Krivchikov via Wikimedia With regards to Zircon itself, there remains little publicly available information about it, including details about its capabilities or what it even looks like, for sure. In February 2019, Putin had said that the weapon would have a top speed of around Mach 9 and a range of approximately 620 miles. Russian media routinely uses graphics depicting the weapon as “ waverider ” hypersonic missile, a type of design that uses its own supersonic shockwaves during flight to maintain lift and stability. Hypersonic missiles and other flight vehicles that use this configuration typically use a conventional rocket motor to boost them to certain speed and altitude, at which point an air-breathing high-speed engine, such as a scramjet , takes over. A typical Zircon graphic, depicting a waverider-type design., via AINonline There are also unconfirmed reports that Zircon may have various novel features, such as a “plasma stealth” system to create a cloud of radar-absorbing ionized particles around some or all of the missile. You can read more about this concept in this past War Zone feature . Regardless, Russia is, by all indications, committed to the continued development of Zircon, no matter what difficulties it may be experiencing. In November 2019, Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko had also announced that, in addition to the Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, the Project 1155 Udaloy class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov and the Project 949A Oscar II class submarine Irkutsk would receive modifications in order to fire the 3M22 missiles. Any Russian ship that has or will receive the new 3S-14 vertical launch system, which has cells specifically designed to accommodate various weapons, could potentially fire Zircon in the future, as well. However, by Russian Navy commander Evmenov’s own assessment, Zircon is still years away from entering service on any ship or submarine.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 18, 2019",Stratolaunch Was Crafting Hypersonic Vehicles Before Its Official Pivot To High-Speed Testing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A research paper shows that Stratolaunch, the company that owns the world’s largest airplane, the Roc , was exploring using it as a platform to launch hypersonic research vehicles, in addition to space launch systems, more than a year ago. Last month, the firm, under new ownership following the death of founder Paul Allen , also co-founder of Microsoft, reportedly shifted toward primarily offering hypersonic test support rather than space launch services, which makes this work especially relevant now. Stephen Corda, a Senior Technical Fellow-Hypersonics at Stratolaunch, Curtis Longo, a Principal Engineer-Hypersonics at the company, and Zachary Krevor, the firm’s Vice President of Engineering, co-presented the paper on Roc’s potential for use in hypersonic testing at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’s International Space Planes and Hypersonics Systems and Technologies Conference in September 2018. They said that, at that time, at least two hypersonic vehicles were in development, the Hyper-A and the Hyper-Z. “Stratolaunch is investigating a variety of space launch vehicle configurations, all of which must operate in the hypersonic flight regime,” Corda, Long, and Krevor wrote . “These space launch vehicles share many technologies with vehicles that are designed to accelerate or cruise at hypersonic speeds within the atmosphere.” Hyper-A, the smaller of the two designs they described in the paper, was just over 28 feet long, had a wingspan of just under 11 and a half feet, and a maximum launch weight of around 6,000 pounds, according to the paper. Stratolaunch’s engineers described it as having a top speed of greater than Mach 6. Hypersonic speed is technically defined as being above Mach 5. An artist’s conception of the Hyper-A hypersonic research vehicle, showing the internal layout of its rocket motor and fuel tanks, as well as its projected specifications compared to those of NASA’s X-43A and the X-15 , which the US Air Force and NASA tested in the 1960s., Stratolaunch The larger Hyper-Z, with a projected top speed of more than Mach 10, was significantly larger, at 83 and a half feet long and with a wingspan of 32 and a half feet. Its maximum launch weight would be around 65,000 pounds, nearly twice that of the North American X-15 experimental hypersonic rocket plane that the U.S. Air Force and NASA used for research purposes during the 1960s. An internal schematic of the Hyper-Z hypersonic research vehicle., Stratolaunch A three-view drawing of the Hyper-Z hypersonic research vehicle, as well as its projected specifications., Stratolaunch Both designs were unmanned and powered by liquid fuel rocket motors that Stratolaunch was also developing at the time, according to the paper. Hyper-A and Hyper-Z would be recoverable and reusable, flying their routes autonomously and then landing like conventional aircraft at a designated point. The Stratolaunch paper says that Hyper-A could potentially be launched straight from the ground, without the need to be carried aloft by the Roc, but doesn’t explain how this would be feasible. Beyond the discussions about Hyper-A and Hyper-Z, it also has interesting details about the Roc mothership’s own performance and capabilities. The aircraft, which has a maximum gross takeoff weight of 1.3 million pounds, can carry a single payload on its main pylon, suspended under the center wing box that connects its two separate fuselages, weighing up to a whopping 500,000 pounds. A graphic depicting the massive Roc against various other objects, such as a blue whale and the SR-71 Blackbird ., Stratolaunch A graphic showing the large “box” available for payloads, which can weigh up to 500,000 pounds, under the Roc’s center wing box., Stratolaunch Even at its maximum takeoff weight, the Roc has a range of 1,000 nautical miles. A typical flight profile would involve traveling to a designated launch location, then ascending to the desired altitude and reaching the required launch speed, before conducting a pull-up maneuver to release the payload. “Typical release conditions [for a space launch] are a Mach number of 0.63 at an altitude of 30,000 feet,” the paper explained. For space launch, purposes, the vehicle would then boost itself into orbit and carrying out whatever its mission might be, such as releasing a small satellite. This whole process is commonly known as two-stage-to-orbit, which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone feature . The procedure for deploying the Hyper-A or Hyper-Z hypersonic test vehicles would be largely the same, but they would remain in the atmosphere the entire time.

It could be used as a platform to experiment with new high-speed airbreathing engines or carry shapes presenting smaller vehicles or hypersonic weapons to see how they respond to flight at speeds above Mach 5. The strain of flying so fast, which also generates extreme heat, means that it is valuable to have reusable platforms for exploring new materials or subsystems, as well. Additional payloads could include telemetry recording equipment and other sensors to collect valuable information during a test and datalinks to transmit it to personnel on the ground in near-real-time. The Stratolaunch paper describes the potential for loading Hyper-A and Hyper-Z with “hyper spot” canisters, which could contain “research electronics, systems, etc.” A table describing the possible testing purposes where a hypersonic research vehicle would be applicable, as well as how many of those would apply equally for research and development of space launch vehicles., Stratolaunch The U.S. Air Force is already developing the X-60A hypersonic research vehicle , which is smaller than the Hyper-A, for similar purposes. Other countries, such as Russia, also have hypersonic test vehicles for the same reasons. China recently revealed that it is working on a two-stage-to-orbit system that it could also use for hypersonic research and development purposes. It’s unclear if Stratolaunch is presently working on the Hyper-A or Hyper-Z. In January 2019, just three months after the company’s engineers presented their paper on its hypersonic test potential, the firm announced it was halting work on its entire family of proprietary space launch vehicles, including the Black Ice reusable spaceplane. It’s not clear if this also impacted work on the two hypersonic research vehicles.

Even if there are no plans yet to build either of those test vehicles, the experience gained from those efforts would be very valuable in the firm’s apparent new focus on offering hypersonic test services, evidence of which first emerged in December 2019. Two months earlier, the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan, Inc. holding company had sold Stratolaunch Cerberus Capital Management. You can read more about the sale and the implications of the shift away from space launch services in this previous War Zone piece . Whatever happens, it’s clear that Stratolaunch was interested in entering the hypersonic research and development space, which has expanded dramatically in recent years due to interest from the U.S. military, in particular, even before Paul Allen’s death and the subsequent sale of the company and its announced movement away from the space launch sector.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Did The Blue Angels’ New Fat Albert C-130 Just Buzz San Francisco Bay? (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last May, fans of the Navy’s flight demonstration team , better known as the Blue Angels, were heartbroken when the squadron’s long-serving KC-130T Hercules airlifter that went by the nickname of Fat Albert had to be retired without a replacement . Just a month later, the news hit that the Navy closed a long-in-the-works deal with the Royal Air Force to purchase one of its sidelined C-130J Super Hercules airlifters to take on the role. Now it seems that aircraft may have appeared for the first time and over a very high-profile locale—San Francisco Bay. Aviation photographer and our friend Paul Carter, who goes by the handle Planephotoman on Flickr , informed us of a particular flight he was following on plane tracking software this morning at around 9:30AM. The plane, a Royal Air Force C-130J C5 Super Hercules flying under the callsign ALBERT01, had flown up the California coast and swooped down into the bay area at low altitude, completed a number of maneuvers over the water, and then exited via the way it came in—over the Golden Gate Bridge. Paul notes that he saw the C-130 get below about 200 feet while tracking it over the bay. adsbexchange.com It had been rumored that the aircraft being tracked, registration ZH889, was going to be the airframe the Blue Angels would receive from the United Kingdom for conversion into the next Fat Albert. The Navy paid $29.7M for the second-hand C-130J and said it was hoping to take delivery the plane in the Spring of 2020. RAF C-130J C5 ZH889 during a display from flown in June 2006. , Peter Bakema/wikicommons We have reached out to the Blue Angels for confirmation and comment on this intriguing flight and the status of their next-generation Fat Albert airlifter, but it is a federal holiday, which may delay their response. At the same time, it’s hard to imagine that nobody saw a C-130 roaring over the bay at a couple of hundred feet off the water this morning. Maybe we will get some photos to help understand exactly what configuration this aircraft was in during its little surprise visit to San Francisco. It’s also worth noting that one of the team’s highest-profile events every year is San Francisco Fleet Week that occurs in October. During the festivities, the Blue Angels’ Hornets and Fat Albert fly remote shows, where the air show routines don’t take place over the airfield they are staging from, but over the water in front of huge masses of spectators. The ex-RAF C-130J is supposed to be in the team’s hands soon, if it isn’t already, and the Super Hercules will bring a whole new level of performance to the Fat Albert air show routine. Depending on what actually happened here, maybe that routine is already being flown, if even in just a test capacity. The old Fat Albert KC-130T over one of the team’s most beloved locales, San Francisco Bay., Blue Angels At the same time, it is worth stating that maybe this could be a bizarre coincidence and a RAF Hercules with an ALBERT01 callsign was doing some sort of flyover in the bay for a completely different purpose. But considering all the elements that have lined up, this seems somewhat improbable, especially considering that the RAF doesn’t even operate the C5 subtype anymore. Still, coincidences do happen. Also, the team is currently undergoing its winter training at NAF El Centro in Southern California. Fat Albert is traditionally present for much of this training. If the new Fat Albert has been delivered, it wouldn’t be far from the Bay Area. Regardless, with the Blues getting Super Hornets to replace their aging F/A-18 legacy Hornets, the 2021 season represents a historic moment for the 75-year-old iconic institution. We will update this post when new information comes available. UPDATE: 2:53PM PST— Apparently, the RAF has put C5 variant of the C-130J back in service as a replacement for a stretched -30 model that was lost. Maybe this was a Royal Air Force sightseeing tour? UPDATE: 11:23PM PST— Ok, so this appears to have been a RAF C-130J, or at least it is flying in RAF colors still. TWZ reader Michael Toews dropped us some pics of the Herc in question flying out of San Luis Obispo airport and noted it has been doing so for the last week. I was also able to get some tracking data to load on the aircraft (would not load this morning) and it has been flying some odd routes around the area, including a very similar profile over San Francisco Bay a week earlier. Michael Toews Michael Toews Michael Toews ads-b.nl ads-b.nl ads-b.nl ads-b.nl Another reader noted that RAF Hercs do some training in the area periodically.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 11, 2020",Lockheed Job Listing Offers New Details About Long-Range Ground-Launched Hypersonic Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Lockheed Martin job posting has offered new details about the design and development schedule of a tactical, ground-launched hypersonic weapon that the U.S. Army and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency are working on together. The company won the contract to proceed to the third phase of this program, known as Operational Fires, or OpFires, two weeks ago. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s defense editor and good friend of The War Zone spotted the job opening for a “Staff SRM [solid rocket motor] Propulsion Engineer” at Lockheed Martin’s facility in Grand Prairie, Texas, on Jan. 20, 2020, and shared it on Twitter . The posting itself is dated Dec. 17, 2019. This was in advance of the Maryland-headquartered defense giant officially getting the Phase 3 OpFires contract , worth just under $32 million, on Jan. 10. Phase 1 had wrapped up in 2019 and Phase 2, which involves further development and testing of various components of the system, is ongoing now. Phase 3 will involve Lockheed Martin integrating the various pieces into a complete weapon system and conducting an end-to-end test, presently scheduled to take place in 2022. “The [OpFires] Program will be entering Phase 3, Weapon System Integration and Demonstration Phase, a three-phase effort for integrated system design, development, and flight test,” the job listing says . “The propulsion engineer will need to have the ability to work with different suppliers, including the ability to evaluate the designs and technologies of motors in the 32-inch diameter size, and make recommendations for down-select on both rocket motor stages to both internal and external (DARPA) customers.” The intended “payload” in the OpFires system will be an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle . The rocket booster will propel it to an optimal altitude and speed, after which it will glide in a relatively level trajectory inside the atmosphere to its target at extremely high speeds. An artist’s conception of the OpFires system in action., DARPA The job posting further explains that Phase 3 will include two separate competitions to pick solid-fuel rocket motors for both the first and the second stage of the Lockheed Martin’s OpFires weapon design. It says that the first stage will have a traditional rocket motor, while the second stage will feature one with throttleable thrust. “The second stage motor development has been ongoing for DARPA as part of their Phase 2 activity, and the continued development of the second stage will transfer to Lockheed Martin oversight during Phase 3a – with a down-select of the current 3 designs,” Lockheed Martin’s job notice says. In October 2019, DARPA released video footage that showed subscale rocket motor tests that Aerojet Rocketdyne , a team consisting of Exquadrum and Dynetics , and the Sierra Nevada Corporation had conducted as part of Phase 1. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cKZAJyvGI8s Outwardly, OpFires is similar, in broad strokes, to the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), another road-mobile system that the Army is developing separately in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force and Navy, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . However, the LRHW will use the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), a conical, unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, as its warhead. The Air Force’s air-launched AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) and the Navy’s submarine-launched Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IR-CPS) weapon will also use this joint-service boost-glide vehicle. OpFires will use its two-stage rocket to launch DARPA’s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, instead. TBG is a more complex half-cone design, which aims to be faster, more maneuverable, and have greater accuracy than the C-HGB. An artist’s conception of DARPA’s previousl Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2). The Tactical Boost Glide vehicle is reportedly similar to this design., DARPA A rendering of a conical hypersonic boost-glide vehicle the US Army had developed under the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon program. The Common Hypersonic Glide Body is reportedly a similar design., US Army Ostensibly, the general mission of OpFires is similar to that of LRHW , as well. The goal of the road-mobile OpFires is to provide valuable long-range strike capability, especially against time-sensitive targets. The range and speed that a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle offers, as well as its ability to maneuver in the atmosphere to dodge defenses and otherwise hit targets from unpredictable vectors, present obvious benefits to commanders on the ground. DARPA has said in the past, that the TBG vehicle could have a maximum speed of up to Mach 20 , giving it the ability to hit opponents thousands of miles away in a matter of minutes. OpFires promises to be more capable and flexible than LRHW, because of the half-cone hypersonic boost-glide vehicle and, perhaps more importantly, the throttleable rocket motor. This is significant because the ability to throttle back the second-stage rocket motor means that this weapon system could have a shorter minimum range, meaning it could engage threats closer to the launch site, as well as a broader overall engagement envelope. Being able to hit widely different ranges with extreme speed and accuracy with the same weapon system would be very useful in a variety of operational scenarios, especially in any future distributed operations , where friendly forces may be situated across an especially broad area . One of the most readily apparent uses for OpFires would be as a ground-based tool to suppress or destroy hostile air and missiles defenses, mission sets also referred to as SEAD/DEAD, clearing the way for follow-on strikes by friendly aircraft and air- , sea- , or ground-launched missiles . Though any asset can perform this mission, aircraft and cruise missiles are the tools the U.S. most commonly employs for SEAD/DEAD operations . Using aircraft is inherently risky , even for modern stealth combat aircraft with standoff weapons , and existing cruise missiles are also slower and more vulnerable to hostile defenses than future systems, such as OpFires. The Army is already exploring how it might be able to use existing and future stand-off ground-based strike capabilities to assist in this mission using targeting information from aerial platforms, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , which you can read about in much greater detail in this past War Zone piece . OpFires concept art, seen earlier in this story, shows the use of space-based sensors for standoff targeting, as well. Phase 2 of OpFires is set to wrap up later this year, after which Lockheed Martin will begin Phase 3 and start actively testing various components and subsystems, including the chosen first and second-stage rocket motors. Those tests are set to continue into 2021 and lead to a Critical Design Review, after which, DARPA and the Army hope that the final design will be ready for actual flight testing in 2022. This is also when the Army intends to test the LRHW for the first time, though the service is planning to rush that system into service , at least to a limited degree, by 2023. When OpFires might actually become operational is unclear. All of this comes amid a massive surge, in general, in the development of hypersonic weapons across the U.S. military, as well as among potential opponents, such as Russia and China . Still, OpFires is an especially interesting program that promises unique capabilities and flexibility over other hypersonic weapons that the United States has in the works.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Congress Poised To Cancel Non-Nuclear Version Of Air Force’s Future Stealth Cruise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the latest annual defense policy bill, covering the 2020 Fiscal Year, which eliminates the Congressional requirement for the U.S. Air Force to develop a conventionally armed variant of its future nuclear-tipped Long-Range Stand-Off air-launched cruise missile, or LSRO. It is very likely that this decision is linked to the development of a new extreme-range variant of the AGM-158 Joint Air-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM-XR , which will be able to hit targets over 1,000 miles away and is scheduled to be out of testing in 2023. The Air Force also just recently retired the last of its existing AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missiles, or CALCMs, which the conventional LRSO was originally slated to replace sometime after 2030. The House passed the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, on Dec. 11, 2019, two days after the House Armed Services Committee announced that it had agreed to a final version of the bill with their counterparts in the Senate. The Senate will have to now vote on it and, if it passes there, it will head to President Donald Trump’s desk, where he is likely to sign it into law given the strong bipartisan support behind it. The new NDAA amends pre-existing laws covering the LRSO program to demand only that the Air Force develop a weapon that “achieves initial operating capability for nuclear missions prior to the retirement of the nuclear-armed AGM–86.” The LRSO must still be “capable of internal carriage and employment for nuclear missions on the next-generation long-range strike bomber,” referring to what is now known as the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The full text of the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA’s provisions regarding the LRSO., US Congress There are few publicly available details about the requirements for the LSRO, which Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are presently competing to build. The missile will have a very stealthy design to make it more survivable against the increasingly threatening integrated air defenses entering service around the world, especially among potential neer-peer opponents, such as Russia and China. This will be the U.S. Air Force’s first stealthy cruise missile to enter service since it retired the state-of-the-art AGM-129A Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM), which The War Zone recently profiled , in 2012. The LRSO will also likely include improved guidance and navigation capabilities that can react autonomously to threats in their environment and retain high accuracy even in GPS denied situations. It could also feature a new nuclear warhead. The existing nuclear-armed AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) carries a single W80-1 variable yield thermonuclear warhead, but are expected to eventually get refitted with upgraded W80-4s . Those same updated warheads could very well find their way into the Air Force’s new air-launched cruise missile, which is expected to begin entering operational service in 2030. A separate provision of the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA also requires the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to, in cooperation with the Administrator for Nuclear Security, to provide Congress with a report within three months detailing ways to leverage work on the LRSO program to support the U.S. Navy’s new nuclear-armed Sea Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM) program and to increase commonality between the two weapons. You can read more about the separate SLCM program in this past War Zone piece . The full text of the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA’s provisions regarding the SLCM., US Congress It’s the decision to remove the requirement for a conventionally-armed variant of the LRSO that could have much farther reaching ramifications for other cruise missile programs. It’s worth noting that without the Congressional mandate, the Air Force could still decide to pursue a conventional LSRO version in the future, but there are indications that the service has already been looking at alternatives in the near future, especially given that it has already retired the AGM-86C/D. Lockheed Martin is already under contract with the Air Force to develop an extreme-range version of its AGM-158 JASSM, known as the JASSM-XR , which the service hopes will have completed its development in 2023. While we don’t yet have a first estimate of the maximum range of this variant, it will reportedly be in excess of 1,000 miles, more than 400 miles greater than the present AGM-158B JASSM-Extended Range , or JASSM-ER. The AGM-86C/D CACLMs had a publicly stated maximum range of only around 600 miles. The JASSM-XR will also be able to carry a 2,000-pound class warhead, twice the payload weight of the JASSM-ER. The AGM-86C carries a 3,000-pound class blast fragmentation warhead, while the AGM-86D has a 1,500-pound class penetrating warhead for busting bunkers and other hardened targets. A look at the evolution of the capabilities of the AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM)., DOD All told, the JASSM-XR promises longer legs than the CALCMs, but with a smaller payload capacity by weight compared to the AGM-86C specifically. At the same time, improvements in conventional warhead design, offering greater lethality in smaller packages , which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone story , could help mitigate the use of a physically smaller warhead. It also presents a much lower risk and faster track to acquiring a replacement for the AGM-86C/D than a conventional variant of the LRSO. In addition, it’s interesting to note that technically, having retired the CALCMs before the formal passage of Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA, the Air Force is already in violation of the law, which presently demands that the service reach initial operational capability with a conventional LRSO variant before getting rid of those missiles. This strongly indicates Congress’ decision was based, at least in part, on information it received on the progress of the JASSM-XR program or other alternatives. A conventional cruise missile design with a smaller form factor than the AGM-86C/D could also provide increased flexibility in terms of the launch platform. For some time now, the Air Force’s B-52 bombers have been the only aircraft certified to carry any variant of the AGM-86. One potential new launch platform for a future CALCM replacement could be the B-1B bomber, which is already certified to carry the JASSM and JASSM-ER. The Air Force has recently been experimenting with ways to increase its ordnance carrying capabilities, which you can read about in this previous War Zone piece . A picture from a recent US Air Force event where personnel talked with industry about potential new ordnance carrying capabilities for the B-1B. The aircraft on display had an external pylon fitted that was armed with an AGM-158 JASSM, as indicated here by the red arrow, as well as a modified internal bay set up to accommodate oversized weapons., USAF Beyond practical factors, there had been critics of the conventionally-armed LRSO who had warned that there were risks of potential opponents mistaking incoming conventional missiles for nuclear ones and responding accordingly and who are now likely to be placated by this decision. It’s worth noting, however, the Air Force had already employed CALCMs on multiple occasions since those weapons first entered service in 1991 without any such issue. A conventional air-launched cruise missile to replace the AGM-86C/D, whether its the JASSM-XR or another design, could also have sea- and ground-launched applications, as well. The Navy is presently refining its requirements for a Next Generation Strike Weapon (NGSW) that could replace the venerable BGM-109 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile and the U.S. Army is now in the market for a ground-launched cruise missile following the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , between the United States and Russia, which had prohibited weapons in this class with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles, earlier this year. In August 2019, the U.S. military launched a Tomahawk from a trailer-mounted version of the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System found on various U.S. and foreign naval vessels. Lockheed Martin has already designed its AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), an anti-ship derivative of the JASSM, to work with the Mk 41 and it is possible that the JASSM-XR could work with those launchers, too. This wouldn’t preclude the development of new, dedicated launchers, as well. All told, the removal of a Congressional requirement for a conventional variant of the LRSO could open the door to alternative designs, including ones that could find their way into ground- and sea-based launchers, as well as getting air-launched from aircraft.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 20, 2019",White House Asks Navy To Include New Unmanned Vessels In Its Ambitious 355 Ship Fleet Plan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The White House has told the U.S. Navy to come up with a proposal for counting at least some of its unmanned surface vessels and underwater vehicles among its so-called “ Battle Force ,” the portion of its fleet that has historically included larger, manned, traditional warships, such as aircraft carriers and destroyers , and supporting ships. This would be a major shift that would create a more realistic path for the service to meeting the ambitious Congressionally-mandated goal of a 355-ship Battle Force fleet and would help solidify the already growing importance of unmanned platforms in its future concepts of operation. Bloomberg was first to report that the Office of Management and Budget, which sits under the Executive Office of the President of the United States, had issued the directive in a memorandum earlier this month. On Dec. 6, 2019, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly had announced in a separate memo that finding a way to create a 355-ship Navy within the next 10 years was among his five immediate objectives. Earlier in the year, the Navy had already released a plan to reach that milestone by 2034. The service has around 290 ships in its Battle Force now and expects that to rise to 301 by the end of the 2020 Fiscal Year. The OMB memo calls for a “legislative proposal to redefine a battleforce [sic] ship to include unmanned ships,” along with revised “capability and performance thresholds” for what vessels can get counted in that total. Getting Congress to agree to amend the existing legal language that enshrines the requirement for the Navy to have 355 ships to included unmanned platforms would help ensure that the plan receives the necessary budgetary support in the coming years. The Navy’s planned Battle Force inventory per its shipbuilding plan in March 2019. This notably does not include unmanned platforms., USN It’s important to note that what OMB is asking for isn’t guaranteed to get Congress’s approval, but it does indicate that the Navy is increasingly looking at unmanned surface vessels and underwater vehicles as both a very real and economical way to expand its overall force structure and as functionally important components of what will be increasingly distributed operations in the future, something the War Zone has highlighted on a number of occasions in the past. There have already been indications that the Navy has been moving in this direction with regard to the definition of the Battle Force. Modly’s Dec. 6 memo even had strong hints of this by calling for a “greater global naval power, within 10 years”, with “355 (or more) ships, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs,) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs).” Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly’s top three priorities and five immediate objectives from a memo his issued on Dec. 6, 2019., USN Modly, in his previous capacity as Undersecretary of the Navy, had already been among those to question whether a 355-ship fleet made up of traditional vessels still made sense and whether it might be necessary to change long-standing definitions around the Battle Force to better reflect modern realities and technologies. “We have a goal of 355, we don’t have a plan for 355. We need to have a plan, and if it’s not 355, what’s it going to be and what’s it going to look like?” he said on Dec. 5 , just a day before issuing his memo. It’s hard to see how else Modly could even realistically envision getting to 355 ships by 2030 with the current definitions. The plan the Navy detailed in March about how it expected to meet this goal within the next 15 years was already questionably ambitious and extremely costly, with little flexibility for fluctuations in shipbuilding schedules or budgets, something the War Zone explored in-depth at the time. In October 2019, a report from the Congressional Budget Office showed that the total costs could be even higher than expected. The Navy has already been laying the groundwork for its future unmanned fleets, notably creating Surface Development Squadron One in May, which has the job of exploring new naval surface warfare tactics techniques and procedures, including manned-unmanned teaming. The unit, which you can read about more in this past War Zone story , will eventually be the home of the Navy’s first two Sea Hunter experimental drone ships, along with manned vessels including all three Zumwalt class stealth destroyers, two of which are in service now, and the first two examples of both the Freedom and Independence class of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The Navy had already relegated those latter four ships to training and test roles. The first-in-class USS Zumwalt sails, in the foreground, sails with the first-in-class USS Independence ., USN In 2017, the Navy had also stood up Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Keyport, Washington to perform the same general mission, but with regards to unmanned underwater vehicles. As of November, the service was working toward establishing Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron Two, which will be base don the East Coast. In December 2018, the Navy issued a request for proposals for an actual production Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel (MUSV) design. The two Sea Hunters , which are 132 feet long and displace around 145 tons, are supposed to provide a stepping stone to the operational MUSVs, which will be a similarly-sized craft. The first Sea Hunter experimental unmanned surface vessel., DARPA Five months later, the service released another announcement asking for proposals for a Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV), which will be a significantly larger 2,000-ton displacement design. The Navy is already testing unmanned ships of a similar size, in cooperation with the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), as part of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program. The second phase of those experiments, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story , began in October. The two unmanned ships the Navy and the Strategic Capabilities Office have been testing under the Ghost Fleet Overlord program., USN On the unmanned undersea vehicle front, the Navy announced in February 2019 that it had hired Boeing to build a fleet of Orca large displacement drone submarines. The initial order is for four Orcas , with the last to be delivered in 2022. You can read all about the Orca initiative here. This all rightly reflects the Navy’s growing acceptance that it simply will not be able to meet all of its operational demands in an economical fashion by solely using manned ships. This is a reality that will only become more pronounced as technology improves and ships and submarines , as well as their various systems , become ever more expensive. It’s one that has also been increasingly impacting planning for what future air and ground forces will look like, and the increasing integration of manned-unmanned teaming into the concepts of operations to go along with them, as well. Artist’s conceptions of two unmanned ship concepts from shipmaker Austal. Shipyards are also noticing the trend toward unmanned platforms., Austal Whether or not Congress will be swayed remains to be seen. The latest annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, covering the 2020 Fiscal Year, which President Donald Trump is set to sign into law today, calls for reduced funding for both the Large and Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel programs. An unnamed source told Defense News that this was, in part, linked to backlash from legislators to a curious and ultimately abortive plan to retire the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman early ostensibly in order to free up funds for, among other things, unmanned platforms. “In view of uncertain LUSV concepts of operations, requirements, technical maturity — including many [first-of-a-kind capabilities] — the contrast between a proven aircraft carrier and its air wing and unproven unmanned surface vessels is stark,” the source said to Defense News . The Navy had wanted money to buy two LUSVs this fiscal cycle, but lawmakers have notably rolled those plans back to just one. The service still hopes to purchase as many as 10 LUSVs in the next five years. “Now, I’m not sure when we’re looking at a scenario where we’re dealing with a great power like China or Russia , where we’re going to have distributed responsibilities, whether that’s the right strategy for us,” Then-Undersecretary Modly had said in October of 355 ship fleet with traditional warships. “As technology advances and we have the ability to have fairly large unmanned platforms out there that have significant lethality, do we include them in our ship force count?” All told, the final answer to that question, at least according to the Navy, looks more and more likely to be yes.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 13, 2019",Navy Confirms Boat Swarm Seen Alongside Carrier Group In This Satellite Image Was Iranian,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has confirmed that “multiple” small Iranian boats ran alongside the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships from her strike group as she sailed through Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman earlier this month, as seen in commercial satellite imagery. The service has rejected reports that any of the Iranian craft harassed or otherwise acted provocatively toward the carrier, saying the activity was within “normal behavior patterns.” Still, the image of 18 small boats in very close proximity to Lincoln and her escorts is eye-opening and a stark reminder of the inherent risks of each transit through the Strait. A PlanetScope satellite belonging to private satellite imagery firm Planet Labs, part of a constellation that takes images of much of the Earth every day, caught Lincoln making the transit out of the Persian Gulf by way of the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 4, 2019. The image circulated for days in various formats on social media, causing considerable debate within the open-source intelligence community about what exactly was going on in the frame. Some media outlets , including in Iran , picked up on the narrative that the IRGC had “harassed,” or at least “escorted,” the Carrier Strike Group out of the Strait in a successful challenge to the United States amid a new spike in tensions between the two countries. We can now put this debate to rest. “During the transit, multiple Iranian vessels followed the U.S. ships through the strait,” U.S. Navy Commander Joshua Frey, a public affairs officer for U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), told the War Zone in an Email. “Their activity was within normal behavior patterns for Iran and did not threaten the Abe [Abraham Lincoln] strike group.” The satellite image shows what could be as many as 18 boats following Lincoln around 20 miles northwest of Oman’s Musandam Peninsula and some 30 miles from Iran’s Qeshm Island. Location of the carrier in the December 4th satellite image. , Google Earth The bulk of the Iranian boats were in a neat formation to her rear, off the port side of the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Leyte Gulf , which was also sailing behind the carrier. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Farragut was leading the three-ship group. Other craft are seen alongside the port side of the carrier and the destroyer, as well as trailing behind to the starboard side. Some of them appear to be very close to the Navy ships, around approximately 1,000 feet in some cases. No other American ships or boats, or any allied or partner vessels, were accompanying these elements of the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, according to Commander Frey. Planet Labs’ satellite also captured a commercial oil tanker sailing separately in the shipping lane in front of the American warships. A filtered and enhanced version of the Planet Labs image that has been circulating online showing USS Abraham Lincoln in the middle of USS Farragut , sailing in front, and USS Leyte Gulf , following behind.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The original, unedited image., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Commander Frey categorically said “no” in response to a query about whether the Iranian boats had made any provocative maneuvers toward the carrier or its escorts, harassed it, or otherwise impeded its transit into the Gulf of Oman. “Interaction between U.S. and Iranian vessels was limited to routine queries via bridge to bridge radio,” he added. This sounds similar to an incident that occurred in September 2018 in the Strait of Hormuz involving the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and her escorts. In that case, Iranian state media released video footage purportedly showing small boats “harassing” the carrier. The Navy does not appear to have ever responded to those claims. https://youtube.com/watch?v=n2wR5-RB_is The following month, an Iranian anti-ship cruise missile-armed Peykaap class fast attack craft sailed with 300 yards the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Essex while then-U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) at the time, was on board. “I think they’re trying to watch what we’re doing, they’re trying to understand what’s happening out here, they’re trying to characterize it to fulfill their own [intelligence] collection responsibilities,” Votel subsequently told reporters. The exact number and type of Iranian boats that shadowed Lincoln in the Strait of Hormuz this month remains unclear. The naval component of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGCN, operates a wide variety of speedboats and other small craft, including types armed with anti-ship missiles, such as the Peykaaps , and semi-submersibles capable of carrying mines and torpedoes. These fleets of small boats also often carry anti-armor guided missiles, shoulder-fired man-portable surface-to-air missiles , and unguided rockets, among other weapons. The U.S. government has accused the IRGCN of using some of its small boats to launch a number of attacks on commercial oil tankers using limpet mines in the Gulf of Oman earlier this year. A portion of an official US Navy identification guide for Iranian warships and smaller craft, including the various boats in the IRGCN’s inventory., USN On Dec. 17, the Navy did release pictures of a pair of Mk VI patrol boats escorting Lincoln out of port in Manama, Bahrain, where NAVCENT is headquartered. The captions for these pictures said that the Mk VIs had conducted a “high value asset (HVA) escort transit” with the carrier, initially suggesting that these boats , which have range of 750 nautical miles, might have accompanied the carrier all the way into the Gulf of Oman. However, an HVA escort transit simply refers to when naval security forces ensure that larger, high-value ships, such as carriers, safely enter and exit harbors, which are inherently constrained environments where the risks of close-in threats, such as explosive-laden suicide boats , are especially pronounced. A US Navy Mk VI patrol boat, seen at the bottom right, conducts “high value asset (HVA) escort transit” with the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on Dec. 2, 2019., USN Another Mk VI pulls alongside of the USS Abraham Lincoln in Manama, Bahrain., USN A view of the carrier from one of the Mk VI patrol boats during the high value asset (HVA) escort transit on Dec. 2., USN The two Mk VIs that took part in the high value asset (HVA) escort transit sailing together in Manama, Bahrain on Dec. 2., USN “U.S. Navy warships making this kind of transit anywhere in the world are always prepared to defend themselves,” Commander Frey, the NAVCENT public affairs officer, said. “In light of recent provocative, irresponsible and illegal actions in the maritime domain, we always maintain a heightened state of readiness when operating in the vicinity of IRGCN forces.” Photos the Navy released earlier in December of the transit itself do not show any of the Iranian boats, but typical close-in force protection measures are visible. This includes personnel keeping watch onboard Farragut , as well as an MH-60R Sea Hawk equipped with a .50 caliber machine gun and four Hellfire missiles leaving the destroyer for a patrol around the elements of the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group. The helicopter’s armament would have been ideal for engaging small boats. An MH-60R Sea Hawk takes off from the USS Farragut as the destroyer leads the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Leyte Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz., USN The large number of Iranian boats that were present as Abraham Lincoln transited the Strait of Hormuz this month is particularly notable given that, in recent years, the Iranians have all but abandoned the long-standing practice of actively harassing American ships in the region with small boats in favor of doing so with drones and, to a lesser extent, with manned aircraft and helicopters . Employing unmanned aircraft carries significantly lower risks for the regime in Tehran. In July, amid another period of heightened U.S.-Iranian tensions, Iran flew at least one small drone within a “threatening range” of the Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer . Marines on that ship subsequently used an electronic warfare jamming system to bring down the unmanned aircraft. Activity onboard the USS Boxer during its transit in July 2019. The electronic warfare jamming system that Marines used to knock down an Iranian drone is visible at on the flight deck to the right., USN Though no other friendly ships accompanied the Lincoln , Leyte Gulf , and Farragut , aerial assets, including U.S. military manned aircraft and drones almost certainly monitored their progress. Maritime patrol planes and unmanned aircraft , as well as bombers and combat jets , have also been flying regular patrols in the region with a particular eye toward Iran for much of the year. This has included U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles armed with cluster muntions, a loadout that is also well suited to engaging boat swarms, something The War Zone was first to report . US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles carrying cluster munitions and other weapons refuel during a maritime patrol in the Middle East in June 2019., USAF Regardless, the large number of IRGCN boats in the general vicinity of Lincoln and her flotilla earlier this month, actively threatening her or not, only underscores the very real threats that these small craft pose to Navy ships, as well as other warships and commercial vessels, in the narrow confines of the Strait of Hormuz. That the Navy considers this “normal behavior patterns” only further reinforces this. The boats also represent just one of the capabilities that Iran could bring to bear in the waterway. Anti-ship cruise missiles , short-range ballistic missiles , midget submarines , suicide drones , mines , and more all also present significant threats, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Iran has also long specifically threatened the U.S. carriers that regularly deployed to the Persian Gulf, as well. The IRGCN notably conducted a swarming boat attack against a mock aircraft carrier during its “Great Prophet IX” exercise in 2015. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkbS4BQxTgg This all raises questions about why the Navy did send one of its most prized and politically sensitive military assets through the Strait without its own small boat escorts, such as the Mk VIs, to provide screening. The service also has larger Cyclone class patrol craft forward deployed in the region, as well as various types of other boats that are smaller than the Mk VI that could still have provided additional close-in security for at least portions of the transit. It also shines a light on the still limited capabilities of the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships, which the service had envisioned being forward deployed to the Middle East to provide exactly this kind of additional support. The main mission sets for the Surface Warfare Modules for the two classes of LCS was supposed to be defeating swarming boat attacks . Eleven years after the first Littoral Combat Ship was commissioned, the class of ships still does not deploy to the Middle East. All of this is even more glaring considering that the transit occurred at the same time that flurry of reports emerged about new U.S. intelligence about potential attacks on American forces throughout the Middle East from Iran or its regional proxies. The Lincoln Carrier Strike Group had only moved into the Persian Gulf in late November 2019 in the first place, the first time it had done so since arriving in the region in May, almost certainly due to the increased risks the ships would face simply by being in this constrained littoral environment. It’s possible that things may only become more complex in the future, as well. Tomorrow, the regular Iranian Navy will begin its first-ever trilateral naval exercise with Russian and Chinese forces, which could point to increased maritime cooperation between those three countries in the region. The United States itself is also still looking to expand the number of participants in its latest maritime security construct in the region, known as Operation Sentinel , which is ostensibly aimed at deterring Iranian aggression. A number of American allies and partners have or are planning to send forces to the region to conduct their own independent operations. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NUsjvcH2GQc Looks like the Chinese destroyer Xining has arrived in the Gulf ahead of exercises with Russia and Iran. I believe this is Chabahar Port in southeastern Iran, but not totally certain. pic.twitter.com/DPlEaySW12 — Henry Jones (@hthjones) December 27, 2019 “The Strait of Hormuz and Arabian Gulf are international bodies of water and the U.S. conducts all transits and operations in full compliance with international law,” Commander Frey, the NAVCENT spokesperson, said. “Our presence demonstrates the U.S. and its regional partners’ commitment to the free flow of legitimate commerce, maritime regional security, and freedom of navigation.” Increasingly harsh U.S. sanctions on Iran, which have already further fueled tensions and provocative behavior, such as restarting uranium enrichment activities earlier this year, make it very unlikely that the IRGCN’s “normal behavior patterns” toward Navy ships in and around the Strait of Hormuz will change any time soon. So, despite the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group’s safe transit into the Gulf of Oman earlier this month, the large number of Iranian boats shadowing it shows that there certainly remains a real risk that, if the security situation were to seriously devolve, it could lead to much more dangerous closer encounters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2020",AH-64 Gunships And Extra Marines Race To U.S. Embassy In Iraq After Militant Mob Attacks (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army AH-64 Apache gunships conducted a show of force and are now patrolling in the skies around the American Embassy in Iraq after a mob, led by Iranian-backed militiamen and including Iraqi security forces personnel, launched an attack on the compound, vandalizing outer portions of the facility and setting fires. The Embassy is on lockdown, but is not being evacuated at present, as the U.S. military sends Marines to reinforce military personnel and private security contractors already on scene. This attack follows U.S. airstrikes this past weekend against Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-supported militant group that is part of Iraq’s state-sanctioned Popular Mobilizations Forces umbrella organization. The attack began on Dec. 31, 2019, after the group marched into the sprawling Green Zone in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, a heavily guarded area housing Iraqi government facilities and various foreign embassies that only became open to the general public last year. Initial reports described the incident as a protest against the U.S. airstrikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah. Mourners of some of the individuals killed in those strikes were reportedly present initially. The U.S. government has blamed Kata’ib Hezbollah and other militias that have received assistance from Iran for a number of rocket attacks in recent years, including a barrage targeting the K-1 base in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, which killed a U.S. contractor on Dec. 27. Video and pictures showing the mob setting fires, smashing windows, and writing graffiti on the exterior walls of the compound and attempting to get in have evoked images of Iranian militants seizing the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and taking Americans hostage in 1979, as well as the fatal terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi , Libya in 2012. However, the U.S. State Department says that the main Embassy compound remains secure and that there have been no breaches . The State Department and the Pentagon have reiterated the U.S. government’s right to defend itself , if necessary, and have also called upon Iraqi authorities to meet their obligations to protect foreign diplomatic facilities. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote in a Tweet on Dec. 31. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!” As already noted, the U.S. military is moving to reinforce security at the Embassy, including sending the two AH-64s from Taji Air Base , just to the northwest of Baghdad. A contingent of approximately 100 Marines are also headed there now. These personnel are coming from the U.S. Marine Corps’ dedicated crisis response unit – Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command, or SPMAGTF-CR-CC – in neighboring Kuwait, which is forward-deployed there for exactly this type contingency. MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors assigned to SPMAGTF-CR-CC are flying the force straight to the Embassy compound. Other forces might follow. The Marine Corps also has specialized Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams, or FAST Companies , on-call to provide enhanced security for diplomatic posts. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in 2012, the U.S. military also instituted a new, global response plan, known as Operation New Normal , to better respond to these types of incidents in the future. The U.S. State Department maintains its own extensive security elements in Iraq, including a fleet of contractor-operated helicopters and aircraft , which could help evacuate the Embassy if necessary. You can read more about this and the crisis response assets available to the U.S. government in the Middle East in this past War Zone story . Iraqi authorities have called for the mob to disperse, but it is unclear if Iraqi security forces are willing or able to take more active steps to defuse the situation. During recent protests in Iraq, demonstrators could not even get into the Green Zone without facing tear gas and much worse , which strongly indicates that Iraqi personnel at least stood aside so the mob could attack the Embassy in the first place. Pictures show that some members of the Iraqi military unit tasked with guarding the Green zone actively took part in the vandalism, as well. “While we condemn the U.S. airstrikes on Iraqi military units, and acknowledge that symbolic funeral marches for the martyrs is a solemn act of remembrance, those taking part must stay away from diplomatic buildings and compounds,” Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi said in a statement. “Iraqi security forces will respond to any act of aggression or harassment against foreign embassies in Iraq, and those responsible will face the full force of the law.” Iraq has now deployed elements of the country’s Counter-Terrorism Service, widely seen as the most capable and politically reliable of Iraq’s security forces, to provide additional security at the American Embassy and disperse the mob. In addition, whether or not Iran had a direct hand in planning or approving the attack, it’s influence on the situation is clear. One of the attackers spray-painted “Qasem Soleimani is my leader” on an outer wall, referring to the head of the Quds Force, the extra-territorial arm of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . The Quds Force has been heavily involved in training and equipping Kata’ib Hezbollah and other elements of the Popular Mobilizations Forces. “ Death to America ” chants, a popular refrain during protests in Iran, though hardly limited to that country, have also been heard. The immediate situation around the Embassy remains extremely fluid, but it does clearly reflect larger emerging tensions between the United States and Iraq. Pro-Iranian elements of the Iraqi government have been calling for the departure of American forces from Iraq on and off for months now and those same groups have renewed their calls from the U.S. military to leave the country. In the immediate aftermath of the American strikes, Iraq’s National Security Council held an emergency meeting over the “sinful” U.S. actions and declared that they would review the country’s security relationship with the United States. More importantly, the U.S. airstrikes against Kata’ib Hezbollah provoked a broader outcry from Iraqis, many of whom saw the unilateral American military operation as a violation of the country’s sovereignty. This is even more notable considering that average Iraqis have been protesting for months against corruption and sectarian influences, especially Iranian meddling , in their own government. How the U.S. government responds to this incident at the Embassy, which still very much playing out, will likely set the tenor for how things go in the coming days and weeks. Trump has now said the United States will hold Iran responsible for this new provocation and his more hawkish supporters in Congress are also calling for additional action at least against Iranian-backed proxies. Whatever happens, U.S.-Iraqi relations, and the future of the U.S. military’s presence in the country, are definitely entering an increasingly dangerous and uncertain period. We will continue to update this story as it develops. UPDATE: 3:00pm EST— The U.S. military has released images of a Marine Osprey delivering personnel to the Embassy compound, shot through an infrared camera on an aircraft orbiting above. Kata’ib Hezbollah has also issued a statement framing the violence as a “fight against the embassy of evil and American conspiracy in Baghdad” and within the context of a broader regional Shia Islamic struggle. This includes the Alawites in Syria, a group to which Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and many in his regime belong to. UPDATE: 4:50pm EST— President Trump has reiterated his threat toward Iran over the attack on the Embassy, but has also thanked Iraqi authorities for helping in the response. UPDATE: 5:25pm EST— CNN is reporting that the U.S. military is preparing to send a brigade-sized contingent, which could mean a force with between 4,000 and 5,000 personnel in total, made up primarily of soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, to Iraq and potentially other areas in the Middle East. The 82nd does always have one of its brigades on a high alert posture, known as the “Division Ready Brigade,” for rapid deployment anywhere in the world in response to a crisis. Reuters is reporting that the actual deployment could be smaller than a full brigade. The 82nd does also keep smaller elements of the Division Ready Brigade on even higher alert status. UPDATE: 6:30pm EST— Fox News is reporting that approximately 500 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division are headed to Kuwait to help bolster security in the region. Plane spotters using online flight tracking software have also spotted three U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III airlifters departing from Pope Airfield, part of Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, which is the 82nd’s home base. UPDATE: 7:40pm EST— The U.S. military has now released a full video of Marines arriving at the Embassy earlier in the day. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper says that approximately 750 personnel are deploying to the region in total in response to the attack in Baghdad, but it’s unclear if this only refers to the troops from the 82nd Airborne Division that are heading to Kuwait now.  He added that additional forces could arrive in the coming days, as well. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had also echoed President Trump’s earlier remarks and blamed Iran directly for “orchestrating” the attack. Previous reports had indicated that Iranian elements might have pushed Kata’ib Hezbollah and others to march on the Embassy. The situation remains fluid with elements of the mob now encamped around the Embassy despite pleas from Iraqi authorities to disperse. UPDATE: 8:40pm EST— Secretary Pompeo has named the Iraqi actors that the U.S. government holds responsible for the Embassy attack and says did so at the direction of Iran. They are: Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, head of Kata’ib Hezbollah and Deputy Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee that oversees the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Qays al Khazali, a militant who fought against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and was detained by coalition forces between 2007 and 2010. Hadi al Amari, head of the Badr Brigades, another Iranian-backed militia group that is now part of the PMF. Faleh al-Fayyad, Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee and founder of the Ataa Movement political party. Muhandis, in particular, does have strong connections to Iran’s IRGC and Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani personally and has spent considerable time living in Iran over the years. Hadi al Amari has similar ties , including having fought for Iran against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New satellite imagery, which The War Zone exclusively obtained from Planet Labs, shows two B-52s at the U.S. air base on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, where they are out of the reach of Iranian missiles. These are the first of six of the bombers that the U.S. military is deploying to the remote base amid heightened tensions with Iran and now in the wake of unprecedented Iranian missile strikes targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. The imagery in question is dated today, Jan. 8, 2020 at 11:09AM. The first reports that the U.S. Air Force was sending six B-52s to Diego Garcia on Jan. 6 and plane spotters using online flight tracking software noticed the first two aircraft heading out that same day.

These vessels are pre-loaded with various vehicles, weapons, ammunition, and other equipment and are in place in order to be able to help U.S. forces rapidly respond to a crisis. As The War Zone previously reported , the obvious reasoning for sending the bombers to the base on Diego Garcia, which is part of the United Kingdom’s British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), was to keep them out of the range of any potential Iranian missile strikes on bases on the Arabian Peninsula. You can read more about this and the U.S. military’s presence on Diego Garcia, in general, here . Dated image of B-52s at Diego Garcia during the early days of the Global War On Terror., DoD This decision now seems especially prudent given Iran’s act of firing at least 16 short-range ballistic missiles at two bases U.S. forces occupy in Iraq overnight in retaliation for the U.S. drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force, last week.

Qiam short-range ballistic missiles were employed in the recent strikes in Iraq. There are also reports that Iran may have fired Fateh-110 or Zolfaghar ( Zulfiqar ) short-range ballistic missiles, as well., DOD In brief remarks earlier today in response to the Iranian missile strikes in Iraq, U.S. President Donald Trump revealed that an unspecified “early warning system” had given U.S. forces in Iraq advance notice of the missile strikes, allowing them to seek cover and avoid suffering any casualties. The President was very likely referring to U.S. early-warning infrared satellites, namely the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) constellation, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . We were first to discuss this reality last night in our rolling coverage on the strikes, stating: Something to remember is that there is a tremendous amount of intelligence data to analyze from America’s space-based early warning network of infrared sensing satellites alone. Where the launches emanated from and where the missiles impacted, even the ones that missed, would have been recorded. The system can detect smaller infrared events as well and its data that could be used to help confirm if the Ukrainian airliner was indeed shot down. This same network, which is about to get even more capable , would have given near-instant warning that a launch was underway, which in turn gave American and allied troops time to take cover and prepare for the incoming bombardment. You can read all about this system in this past piece of ours. Other reports say that signals intelligence and other sources and methods gave American personnel additional notice that an attack could be coming soon. Plenty of SBIRS data to analyze after this. Launch location & impacts etc. Could help with understanding what happened to the 737. Would have provided U.S. personnel & allies in Iraq early warning to take cover before the missiles arrived. More on it here: https://t.co/wLXLAtBVFf — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 8, 2020 NEW per @CBSDavidMartin : A DOD official says the US had “multiple hours” warning of an attack, plenty of time for troops to take shelter in bunkers. This warning came from a combo of satellites and signals and communications intercepts – the same systems that watch for NK tests — Sara Cook (@saraecook) January 8, 2020 Satellite imagery The War Zone has also exclusively obtained of Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, the main target of the recent Iranian missile strikes, does show a number of hangars and other aviation-related structures destroyed and damaged. This shows that even with advance warning, it can still be difficult, if not impossible to fully safeguard aircraft and other assets from incoming strikes, underscoring the value of having additional elements safely positioned outside the range of hostile forces should a much broader strike have occurred. The B-52s at Diego Garcia can carry dozens of stealthy conventionally-armed cruise missiles and potentially nuclear weapons , depending on which specific aircraft the Air Force has deployed. They are clearly meant to be a signal to the regime in Tehran about the United States’ capacity to retaliate, even in the wake of an Iranian first strike against Ameican bases in the Middle East. At the same time, it is important to stress that the presence of the bombers on Diego Garcia does not necessarily mean that a bomber strike on Iran is imminent. In brief remarks earlier today in response to the Iranian missile strikes in Iraq, U.S. President Donald Trump only announced plans for additional sanctions on the regime in Tehran. “These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior,” Trump added, before noting various examples of Iranian aggression in the past six months or so, including unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in September 2019, the seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz in July 2019, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ shoot down of a U.S. Navy drone flying over the Gulf of Oman in June 2019. The United States will immediately impose additional sanctions on the Iranian regime. pic.twitter.com/Y47COReXr2 — The White House 45 Archived (@WhiteHouse45) January 8, 2020 He also called on the remaining parties to the international deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program to abandon it, as the United States already did in 2018 , and negotiate a new arrangement in its place. Iran has also recently announced plans to further roll back its compliance with this agreement, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but insists that it could still reverse course if its own demands, including sanctions relief, are met. Concerns are growing that Iran could be positioning itself for a rapid “ breakout ” toward building a nuclear weapon, though public U.S. intelligence assessments have repeatedly stated that there are no clear indications that Iran has an active nuclear weapons program, at present.

It’s part of the every 60day less-for-less aimed at pressuring the EU to step up its game. — Rouzbeh Parsi (@rparsi) January 5, 2020 In addition, Trump said he would be seeking additional cooperation from NATO in containing Iran and otherwise responding to the regime’s aggression. the President said that he was not seeking war with Iran and also said that it and the United States had a shared interest in the defeat of ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, Trump noted that “we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression,” which could potentially include military strikes, as well as non-kinetic options, such as cyberattacks. Over the weekend the President had threatened a major retaliatory strike against Iran, but only if it killed U.S. personnel in any future strike. Regardless, even if the U.S. and Iranian government succeed in de-escalating tensions between them, there remains the possibility that Iranian-backed proxies throughout the Middle East may launch attacks on American interests or those of its allies and partners, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. There have already been mounting concerns for U.S. military personnel in Lebanon, which is home to the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, which has also threatened to retaliate over Soleimani’s death. There have been reports that the government in Cyprus announced has agreed to allow the United States to station a rapid reaction force there, which would be well-positioned to respond to any crisis in Lebanon or elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean. #BREAKING Cyprus agrees to host US rapid response unit for any Mideast evacuations pic.twitter.com/GAt4qPG6dQ — AFP News Agency (@AFP) January 8, 2020 “To the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future – one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world,” Trump said in the closing portion of his remarks earlier today. “The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.” It remains to be seen how both Iran and the United States, as well as their regional partners, proceed following the missile strikes in Iraq. The two B-52 bombers on Diego Garcia, as well as the four others still reportedly set to deploy there, certainly give the U.S. government some of those additional options that Trump referred to in his speech.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel says that an upgraded version of its combat-proven Iron Dome defense system successfully knocked down all of the simulated targets it faced in a recent series of tests. Israeli officials say that the updates will ensure that the system, which entered service nearly a decade ago, will be able to engage “evolving threats in the region,” which include terrorists armed with ever-improving rocket and missile capabilities, the growing danger posed by small unmanned aircraft , and more. The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced that the tests had occurred on Jan. 12, 2020, but did not say when or where specifically they had taken place. The Directorate of Defense Research and Development and the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) conducted the testing program in cooperation with Iron Dome’s manufacturer, Rafael. The Israel Defense Forces first declared that the defense system, which it had developed with significant assistance from the United States, was operational in March 2011. “We have completed a series of tests with a success rate of 100 percent,” Rafael’s Vice President Pini Yungman said in a statement . “The system intercepted all threats, which were simulated in an area secured for the purpose of the experiment.” The test targets “simulated the future threats that the system may confront,” according to Israel’s Defense Ministry . “When we deliver it to the Israel Defense Forces, the Air Force will be equipped to confront evolving threats in the region,” Moshe Patael, the head of IMDO, said in his own statement . He further added that these first deliveries of the upgraded Iron Dome systems would begin in the near future. Israeli authorities have not offered any specific details on the improvements to Iron Dome. The complete system, at present, consists of launchers firing fast and agile Tamir interceptors , as well as associated air defense radars. Tamir has an active radar seeker to home in on its targets and receives additional targeting information in flight via a data link for increased precision. It employs a high explosive blast fragmentation warhead with a proximity fuse to actually destroy the threat. You can read more about how Iron Dome works in detail in this past War Zone piece . Rafael Since its entry into Israeli service in 2011, Iron Dome’s primary job has been countering rockets, artillery shells, and mortar rounds, also known as C-RAM. In this role, it forms the core of the low-end of Israel’s layered missile defense network . However, it has already reportedly demonstrated its ability to engage other target sets, including cruise missiles . Improvements to Iron Dome could include further opening up Tamir’s engagement envelopes and other updates to better allow it to engage different types of threats. Israel’s most immediate adversaries, especially the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah , have made significant strides in recent years in expanding and improving their own rocket and missile arsenals, which presents new challenges for the country’s entire multi-tier missile defense architecture. There is also an increasing risk that those groups, among others, may field new systems, such as suicide drones and cruise missiles , that Iron Dome may not be best equipped to respond to in its present form. Iran, Israel’s chief regional opponent, has been particularly active in proliferating unmanned aircraft , rocket , and missile technology to its proxies throughout the Middle East. In September 2019, Saudi Arabia, and, by extension, the world, saw just how serious these emerging threats could be when it suffered unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil-related sites. The United States accuses Iran of carrying out those strikes itself and using proxies to provide plausibility deniability of its direct role. More general improvements to Iron Dome’s ability to reliably detect incoming threats and engage them, especially where there is a large volume of targets, would be important, as well. Israeli officials say that Hezbollah, which is based in neighboring Lebanon, has more than 100,000 rockets of various types, which threaten to simply overwhelm the country’s defenses, including its Iron Dome batteries. The Lebanese terrorist group has notably threatened attacks on Israel in response to recent U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, as well as in the event of any U.S. retaliation to the subsequent Iranian missile attacks aimed at U.S. personnel in Iraq. Improving the probability of achieving a kill also reduces the total number of interceptors needed to ensure the destruction of a single target, which in turn effectively increases the magazine depth of the system. This would also improve the overall cost-effectiveness of Iron Dome. Contrails from Hamas rockets and Tamir interceptors knocking them down seen over the Israeli city of Ashkelon in 2018 during a spike in fighting between Israel and the terrorist group., Ilia Yefimovich/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images “Throughout the last decade, we have conducted dozens of interceptions as part of a framework of tests and more than 2,000 operational interceptions,” IMDO head Patael said. The Israeli Ministry of Defense says that Iron Dome has successfully intercepted approximately 85 percent of all targets it has faced over the course of its operational history. Concerns about opponents developing and employing countermeasures to Iron Dome, beyond just large scale attacks, can only be growing after nearly a decade of having the system in operation. Israel has been a pioneer in multi-mode seeker systems and could potentially be looking to integrate such a system onto Tamir. Adding an imaging infrared seeker to the interceptor, for example, would give it an alternate method of finding its target in the event of a jamming attack that blinds its radar guidance system and should provide a high probability of kill overall. There is now an increased risk that Tamir’s engagement capabilities, in their existing form, may be compromised, at least to some degree. In November 2019, reports emerged that seeker and fuse sections from a Tamir interceptor had fallen largely intact in the Gaza Strip following a Hamas rocket attack, giving Israel’s adversaries a particularly worrying opportunity to examine how these systems work up close. Any such updates that expand Iron Dome’s capabilities or improve its general performance will no doubt be of interest to existing and potential foreign customers, as well. The U.S. Army notably announced last year that it would buy two batteries worth of the defense systems, primarily for use in the counter-cruise missile role. The Army subsequently said that it did not see Iron Dome as a long-term solution to its needs, but added that it might still acquire more in the future for lack of readily available alternatives. It’s Iron Dome batteries could easily see action overseas against a variety of threats. They would be particularly well suited to operations in Iraq, for instance, where Iranian-backed militias were firing rockets at bases where U.S. forces are stationed on a regular basis even before the strike that killed Soleimani. The recent Iranian missile attack targeting American troops in that country underscored the pressing need for improved air and missile defenses and more of them to shield American troops from various threats, in general. For Israel, the updates to Iron Dome show that the country continues to invest in the system and view it as an important part of its air and missile defense capabilities in light of various emerging and evolving threats. With these latest upgrades, and likely additional ones in the future, it wouldn’t be surprising if the system serves in Israel, as well as in other countries, for another decade.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 23, 2020",The Air Force’s B-52H Bomber Force Has Said Goodbye To Its Nuclear Bombs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force manual has confirmed previous reports that the service’s iconic B-52H bombers are no longer authorized to carry nuclear gravity bombs . The only nuclear weapon these aircraft are presently certified to carry is the AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missile, which is set to eventually get replaced by a new stealthy missile under development now under the Long Range Stand Off program, or LRSO. Hans Kristensen, who is Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists was first to spot the updated information about the B-52H’s nuclear loadouts in the latest version of Air Force Instruction 91-111, which is dated September 2019. This manual, titled “Safety Rules for U.S. Strategic Bomber Aircraft,” is unclassified and also includes basic information on approved weapons for the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber. “Removal of B61-7 and B83-1 [nuclear gravity bombs] from B-52H approved weapons configuration,” the manual states bluntly in the list of major changes between it and the preceding, and now superseded, 2017 version. The document makes clear later on that the AGM-86B with the W80-1 warhead is the only remaining approved nuclear weapon for the B-52H. It also says that the B-2A’s only authorized nuclear weapons are the B61-7 and the B83-1 bombs. The only approved nuclear weapons for the US Air Force’s B-2A and B-52H bombers, according to the September 2019 edition of Air Force Instruction 91-111., USAF The Federation of American Scientists’ Kristensen had also been first to notice evidence that the remaining nuclear-capable B-52Hs – 46 of the total fleet of 76 aircraft – had been stripped of their nuclear bombing mission back in 2017 . It’s unclear when the Air Force made the decision and when it was actually implemented. Documents from the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear Security Administration, the arm of the Department of Energy responsible for overseeing American’s nuclear stockpile, dating as far back as 2016 do not list the B-52H as a delivery platform for B61 or B83 bombs of any kind. “The B61 strategic bomb, carried by the B-2 bomber, is an essential component of air-delivered strategic deterrence,” Dr. John Harvey, then Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs, told members of Congress in 2013, without any mention of the B-52, suggesting that those bombers could have lost the nuclear bomb-dropping mission even earlier. However, the last version of Air Force Instruction 91-111, which was dated February 2017, did say that the bombers were still at least technically authorized to carry nuclear bombs at that time. A B-52H drops a B61 nuclear bomb., via FAS B61 nuclear bombs., DOD That the Air Force made this decision, no matter when it exactly occurred, is not necessarily surprising. The service has had concerns about the ability of its B-52s to be able to penetrate through hostile air defenses as far back as the 1950s, which spurred the development of large nuclear-armed long-range cruise missiles and air-launched ballistic missiles . In the 1960s, the B-52s, among other aircraft, gained the ability to launch the nuclear-tipped AGM-69A Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM). The idea was that the bombers would literally nuke the defenses in their path as they flew at low-levels, helping to further mask their approach, to their primary targets. You can read more about the SRAM in this past War Zone story . This eventually gave way to the idea of bombers making low-level approaches before launching more modern nuclear-armed cruise missiles, including the non-stealthy AGM-86B and the stealthy AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile , the latter of which was retired in 2012, primarily due to its high costs. You can read more about the history of the AGM-129, and its stealth design, which was state-of-the-art for the time, in this previous War Zone piece . An undated picture of a B-52H bomber on display with its available armament options, including a “clip” of four B61 bombs on a dolly, at left and one with B83 bombs on a rotary launcher that fits inside the bomb bay, to the right. At far right there appears to be another “clip” with a pair of B28 bombs, which were removed from service in 1991. Toward the center, there is also a wing pylon loaded with AGM-86-series cruise missiles, seen to the left of the fuselage, as well as another rotary with more AGM-86s, seen to the right of the fuselage., USAF Another image showing various nuclear weapon options for the B-52., via FAS All told, even though nuclear bombs had remained an approved option for the B-52s for decades, by every indication, the AGM-86B had steadily become its primary strategic weapon due to continuing concerns about their vulnerability to ever-improving modern air defenses . Even with regards to conventional weapons, outside of missions in largely permissive airspace , the B-52Hs are primarily launch platforms for stand-off weapons . This only looks set to continue with the introduction of new air-launched hypersonic weapons , such as the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, and possibly other outsized weapons, which have also necessitated the development of new extra-large underwing pylons for the B-52H. The Air Forceexpects the future Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) nuclear-armed cruise missile to replace the AGM-86B in the coming years, as well. Unlike the AGM-86B, the LRSO will also be an option for the B-2A, as well as the future B-21 Raider stealth bombers. It is possible that the Air Force could give the B-52Hs the ability to employ nuclear bombs again with the future introduction of the precision-guided B61-12, but this seems remote, at best. In his 2013 testimony, Dr. John Harvey had said that the B61-12 had a “modest standoff capability” due to its precision guidance system, but that it would only help enable “safe aircraft escape” from ground zero, not reduce the delivery platform’s vulnerability to hostile defenses in any way. A prototype B61-12 bomb body., USAF Furthermore, the United States presently intends to retain the B83-1 in the stockpile “at least until there is sufficient confidence in the B61-12 gravity bomb that will be available in 2020,” according to the U.S. military’s most recent Nuclear Posture Review, which came out in 2018. It seems extremely unlikely that the Air Force would have removed the B83-1, which will remain in inventory even as the B61-12 begins to enter service, from the B-52H’s approved armament options if there was any desire to retain its nuclear bomb-dropping capability. All told, while the Air Force intends to keep the B-52Hs flying through at least 2050, at which point the type will have spent nearly a century in service, times have already changed and the days of the venerable bombers and their crews training to plod their way through air defenses to drop nuclear bombs on their targets are all but certainly gone for good.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2020",The Pentagon May Finally Get The Fighter-Sized Stealth Aerial Target Drone It Badly Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A small California-based aviation firm has announced that it recently completed engine and flight control testing on the ground on a stealthy unmanned aircraft known as the Fifth Generation Aerial Target, or 5GAT. The firm says that this design, which it originally developed as a stealth aerial target, could also serve in the “ loyal wingman ” role with manned combat jets and perform other operational missions. Aviation Week was first to report that Sierra Technical Services had completed its first prototype 5GAT and had finished the various testing on Jan. 13, 2020. FlightGlobal subsequently published another report on these developments with additional detail about the unmanned aircraft’s capabilities. The company says it hopes to fly the drone for the first time by the end of March of this year. “We ran both engines all the way to [military] power at the same time,” Roger Hayes, Sierra Technical Service’s President told FlightGlobal . “We tested out our flight controls – elevons and rudders – and everything worked well.” Sierra Technical Services Sierra Technical Services has not yet provided the exact physical specifications for the 5GAT, but has said in the past that it is dimensionally similar to a T-38 Talon jet trainer. A PowerPoint presentation from 2012 says the drone is only about 20 pounds heavier than the empty weight of a T-38, as well. The 5GAT is also powered by a pair of General Electric J85 engines that actually came straight from a T-38, too. Additional components came from F-5 and F/A-18 jets, according to AviationWeek , which has helped keep costs low. Sierra Technical Services has not given a hard figure, but says that unit price for the drones will be under $10 million. Still, despite this use of parts from other aircraft, the 5GAT’s overall planform is considerably different from any of those designs, especially its rear-positioned diamond-shaped wings and intakes, which loosely resemble those of the F-22 Raptor . Pictures from the company website indicate that the drone uses honeycomb composite structures in its construction, as well as snaking intakes that hide the fan faces of the J85 engines, both features common to modern stealthy aircraft. 5GAT prototype., Sierra Technical Services Sierra Technical Services A honeycomb composite structure used in the construction of the 5GAT., Sierra Technical Services One of the 5GAT’s snaking engine intakes., Sierra Technical Services Sierra Technical Services also has not provided many specifics about the drone’s performance, including its top speed. The company says that the two J85s allow it to fly at high-subsonic speeds and could potentially enable it to break the sound barrier. “It would probably go supersonic without much trouble, but none of the structure was analyzed or designed for supersonic [flight], nor were the inlet lips.” Hayes, the firm’s President, explained to FlightGlobal . For comparison, the T-38 is capable of flying at up to Mach 1.3 for short periods. Hayes also said that the 5GAT was capable of performing maneuvers up to 7.5 g and -2 g, but only for short periods. “It cannot sustain plus 7.5 g or negative 2 g. The aircraft will bleed off energy very quickly due to limitation of the thrust from these engines,” he said. “We can make 7.5 g turns, but not sustain them for very long – that is basically a typical operational scenario.” All of these features and capabilities are in service of the mission that 5GAT was originally intended for, which is acting as a surrogate for new and emerging stealth fighters and other advanced combat jets , and even drones , that U.S. military fighter pilots are increasingly likely to encounter in any future large scale conflict. The drone itself has been in development since at least 2006 , when the U.S. Air Force first funded a design study for a low-cost, stealthy target drone to better reflect advanced opposing aircraft. An interesting team, which included former employees of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design bureau and students from the Air Force Academy , crafted the original conceptual design. Early 5GAT concept art., USAF The Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, subsequently took charge of the program. In March 2017 , in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), it finally awarded Sierra Technical Services a contract to build an actual prototype. Almost exactly two years later , DOT&E and USACE exercised an option in that contract and agreed to buy a second 5GAT prototype. Now, Sierra Technical Services says it is also hoping to expand its plans for 5GAT to using the drone as a low-cost loyal wingman , which would work in groups with manned aircraft , and potentially in other optional roles, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. 5GAT does not have space for an internal weapons bay in its present configuration, but it can carry stores on pylons under the wings, though doing so would impact its stealthy signature. The ability to carry internal electronic warfare and expendable countermeasure payloads, as well as other electronic systems, does appear to be part of the design. Concept art from the firm’s website, seen at the top of this story, shows one of the unmanned aircraft firing decoy flares to defeat an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile that an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , seen in the background, had fired. ITEA “We can carry all kinds of electronics, artificial intelligence gear, [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] equipment,” Hayes said in his interview with FlightGlobal . The mention of “artificial intelligence gear” is particularly notable given the Air Force’s plans to develop an AI-driven flight control system, called Skyborg , that could be used on various unmanned aircraft, as well as potentially turn manned designs into pilot-optional ones. The service has said that it plans to test Skyborg first on Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie drone , but Sierra Technical Services could offer 5GAT as another option for that testing program. Hayes also made clear that his company, which actually helped in the design of the XQ-58A, is interested in competing against that drone for other Air Force projects, including the service’s experimental loyal wingman efforts. “It will be able to fly faster than an XQ-58 Valkyrie. It will be able to be more maneuverable than an XQ-58 Valkyrie as well,” he said. Having a stealthy, more maneuverable loyal wingman option would be somewhat logical for certain applications. Even as an unarmed node that can be more readily risked emitting RF energy from radar and electronic warfare systems in a high-end contested battlespace, a drone that can push forward ahead of stealthy and non-stealthy fighters for short periods of time, could be beneficial. Still, overall, 5GAT seems like a less refined design in terms of a possible attritable unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) capability compared to the XQ-58 and one that is a bit more niche in nature, at least in the potential combat operations sense. In addition, this aircraft appears to use a conventional launch and recovery method – basically taking off and landing on a runway – while the Valkyrie is runway independent, launching via a rocket-assisted method and landing via parachute and cushioning system . This takes away some of the potentially game-changing flexibility that the XQ-58 offers. As such, where the 5GAT seems most beneficial, at least in its present form, is for presenting a stealthy and relatively fast and maneuverable target for training and development applications. And this was its primary mission from the start. Just emulating a 5th generation enemy target alone would be a huge help as the need for stealthy adversary assets is growing fast. While F-35s , and even F-117s , at least to some degree, can stand in for this role, they will always be limited when it comes to volume . Stealthy cruise missiles are a major threat, as well, not just fighters and attack aircraft. 5GAT should be well suited for representing that threat in an economical and reusable fashion. An artist’s impression of a future aggressor F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, in the rear, flying with an F-16C aggressor., Via Nellis AFB CO Facebook page With this in mind, being able to mix in swarms of 5GATs with manned adversaries would be extremely beneficial and more cost-effective than the all-manned alternative. In other words, such a capability would allow for the presentation of highly complex and challenging threat scenarios for 5th generation fighter pilots and ground and sea-based air defenses without the huge cost of actually putting large numbers of 5th generation adversaries in the air. Maybe even more important is that 5GAT could also stand in as a standalone enemy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) swarm that is networked together to achieve its maximum potential – a reality that our forces will be facing in the not so distant future. Its use for more traditional weapons development testing is clear, as well. All told, 5GAT represents a critical capability that the Pentagon really does need. It can grow in many directions within its intended target role, but it could also evolve outside of it in the future. New variants could bring weapons capability and even higher performance down the line, as well. So, it really is best to see the 5GAT effort as somewhat related to the Valkyrie, but more complementary than competitive to it. Just doing what it was originally designed to would be a huge help as it is. What we still don’t know is the range, control interface capabilities, and just how stealthy 5GAT actually is. We also don’t know just how cheaply 5GAT could be purchased in larger numbers. By better knowing 5GAT’s limitations, we will get a clearer understanding of its real potential.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 9, 2019",Watch DARPA’s Air-Launched And Air-Recovered “Gremlins” Drone Take Its First Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first of DARPA’s X-61A “Gremlins” reusable, air-launched and air-recovered drones has made its inaugural test flight. The highly ambitious and potentially game-changing program helmed by Dynetics accomplished the major milestone in November of 2019. A video of the test flight has just been released. It shows a C-130 belonging to International Air Response launching an X-61A Gremlins Air Vehicle off one of its wing pylons. The jet-powered drone flew for an hour and 41 minutes, but the craft was lost due to a malfunction with its parachute recovery system. Five drones were built as part of this phase of the program, so the malfunction shouldn’t impact its planned test objectives. The flight test comes after a change of venue was needed following the powerful earthquakes that struck Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake near Ridgecrest, California, last summer. The program was looking to shift the test flights to Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, which they did according to the press release below. You can read all about this in this past piece of ours and everything you need to know about the Gremlins program here and here . Check out the video of the historic flight, as well as a video primer on how the system works, below: The official press release from Dynetics reads: The test took place at Dugway Proving Ground near Salt Lake City, Utah. Testing operations involved one captive-carry mission aboard a TBM, Inc. C-130A and an airborne launch and free flight of the X-61A that lasted one hour and 41 minutes. The test objectives included: ·      Demonstrating a successful launch of the GAV from the C-130 ·      Demonstrating a rate capture, wing deployment, cold engine start, and transition to stable, powered flight ·      Collecting data on GAV subsystem operation and performance ·      Verifying air and ground-based command and control systems, including data link performance and handovers between air and ground control ·      Deploying the GAV docking arm ·      Demonstrating the flight termination and ground (parachute) recovery of the GAV (demonstration system only – not part of the operational system) The X-61A flew as predicted with no anomalies, achieving all test objectives that relate to the operational system. At the end of the mission, the engine was shut down and a drogue chute successfully deployed to terminate flight. Unfortunately, the vehicle was lost during the ground recovery sequence due to a failure to extract the main chute. Managed out of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), the overarching goal of Gremlins is to accelerate the ability to perform aerial launch and recovery of volley quantities of low-cost, reusable unmanned aerial systems (UASs). This test is the next step toward the completion of the program’s Phase 3 demonstration objectives, which include a final flight test to demonstrate the ability to recover four GAVs in under 30 minutes. “This flight marks a historic milestone for Dynetics and the Gremlins program,” said Tim Keeter, Dynetics Gremlins program manager. “The GAV flew beautifully and our command and control system kept us in total control of the GAV for the entire flight. The loss of our vehicle validates our decision to build five GAVs for Phase 3; we still have four remaining. Overall, I am proud to see all the hard work pay off and we are excited to continue this momentum towards the first airborne recovery in early 2020.” The Gremlins team celebrated a number of milestones in 2019 including a successful flight test of the docking system in February. In March, they executed the first flight of the GAV avionics system, installed onboard the Calspan Variable Stability System (VSS) Lear Jet as a dress rehearsal for this November 2019 test. Dynetics also hosted a stakeholder’s day highlighting a live engine test in July and received a U.S. Air Force-assigned X-61A designation in August. The Dynetics team was one of four companies awarded Phase 1 in 2016. Phase 2 was awarded in March 2017 to two of those four performers, and Phase 3 followed in April 2018, naming Dynetics the top performer. “This flight test validates all the engineering design work, analysis, and ground testing we have performed in the past two and a half years,” Brandon Hiller, chief engineer for the X-61A said. “We have a lot of confidence in the vehicle’s performance and overall design going forward, and the telemetry data from the flight compares exceptionally well to our modeling predictions. Our team has done a superb job to achieve first flight of this unique aircraft in such a short amount of time, and we are eager to get this new capability into the hands of the DoD.” The Dynetics Gremlins team consists of companies that represent best-in-class capabilities for their roles on the program – Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems, Williams International, Applied Systems Engineering, Inc., Kutta Technologies, Inc., Moog Inc., Sierra Nevada Corporation, Systima Technologies, Inc., and Airborne Systems. This is a downright exciting capability that was the realm of science fiction up until very recently. We will keep you up to date with new information as the Gremlins flight test program unfolds.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Space Force just launched, but there is still so much to figure out. Some of which is far more mundane than “dogfighting in space,” including creating a culture, lore, and a sense of common morale unique to the service. Space Force’s personnel will also need uniforms. Now, the Pentagon’s newest command has given us a sneak peek at what at least one of its uniforms will look like and they are very much not out of this world. If you were hoping for Starfleet-like jumpsuits with rank pips on the collars, you are going to be very disappointed. Instead of any trace of spacey or futuristic motif, Space Force troops will look like they are preparing to fight alongside the Ewoks of the forest moon of Endor instead of taking on the Empire’s star destroyers orbiting above. Or a more down-to-earth way of looking at it is they will look nearly identical to their Army and Air Force counterparts. Military.com’s Hope Hodge Seck had one of the first reports on Space Force’s somewhat mundane new uniforms. She describes what we are seeing in the image as such: “Above the left breast pocket in Navy embroidery reads: U.S. Space Force. … The uniform depicts four-star rank, indicating that the uniform belongs to Gen. John “Jay” Raymond, the first commander of U.S. Space Force. It also has the Command Space Operations badge embroidered above the service nametape. On the left sleeve of the uniform is the United States Space Command patch , denoting the military’s newest combatant command, formed shortly before Space Force itself activated Dec. 20. And above that patch is a forward-facing full-color American flag patch — a departure from the muted backward-facing flags that soldiers and airmen wear on their right shoulders in OCP [ Operational Camouflage Pattern ] uniform.” Some info on the OCP uniforms used by the USAF and Army. Space Force appears to have signed on too. , USAF The actual design of the uniform and its camouflage is a variation of those currently used by Army and the Air Force. Of course, this is Space Force’s utility uniform, the more formal uniforms may get a bit more customized flare. Still, considering the mission, one would think that green and brown camouflage may be a bit odd. A dark uniform that is more tailored to the daily tasks of must Space Force personnel seems to be more logical considering the service’s overarching mission set.

Chris Harmer,"Posted on Jun 9, 2022",Jonny Kim Is The SEAL-Mathematician-Doctor-Astronaut We Desperately Need Right Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The American Special Operations Forces (SOF) community is full of overachieving type A personalities equipped with insanely advanced technology, such as underwater jet boots and stealthy helicopters . In a development that is sure to add to the already considerable reputation of this elite cadre of American warfighters, former Navy SEAL Jonathan “Jonny” Kim recently completed NASA training, has been formally designated as an astronaut, and is now awaiting his first assignment to fly into space . Going from SEAL to astronaut is one heckuva transition, but it’s what Jonny did between leaving active duty and signing on with NASA that is so unique and impressive. No, he didn’t become an author! These days, it seems like every other Navy SEAL who leaves active duty writes a book about the experience. Amazon currently has 438 SEAL biographies listed. Not that they aren’t all entertaining, informative, and inspiring, but at a certain point, the market is saturated and the situation is destined for parody . To be clear, Jonny Kim, who was born and raised in Los Angeles to Korean-American immigrants, had a very successful career in the SEAL teams that could easily have been turned into a book. Like all SEALS, Jonny attended Basic Underwater Demolition School (BUDS) in Coronado, California. While there, he went through the same training as all SEALS do, including open ocean swimming and diving, hand to hand combat, land navigation, marksmanship, and all the other skill sets today’s SOF warriors require to operate on the modern battlefield. While each SEAL has the basic ability to do all of the functions required of SEALS, after completing BUDS and being assigned to a SEAL team, each individual SEAL is specially trained in a specific task, such as sniper, heavy weapons operator, interrogator, etc. In Jonny’s case, after he was assigned to SEAL Team 3, stationed in Coronado California, he received extra training as a medic and as a sniper. During multiple deployments to the Middle East, including over 100 combat missions for which he was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star with Combat “V,” his primary responsibility was to be the first line of medical response should any of his teammates require assistance. Not surprisingly, this experience led directly to his decision to pursue medical school. While deployed to Ramadi, Iraq, in 2006, one of Jonny’s close friends was shot in the face. Jonny did everything he could to keep his friend alive, administering first aid with the limited equipment and drugs he had on him. Jonny knew his friend needed immediate intensive medical care. While Jonny was able to get his friend to a physician, it was not soon enough, and his friend died. That feeling of helplessness, seeing his friend suffer and not being able to save him, stayed with Jonny, and he eventually decided to apply to medical school as a result. Since Jonny did not have an undergraduate degree, medical school was not yet an option. He applied for and was accepted to the Seaman to Admiral program , a Navy program that provides enlisted Sailors who have demonstrated exceptional performance and leadership potential a fully funded undergraduate college degree. For Jonny, that meant leaving the SEAL teams and reporting to the classrooms at the University of San Diego (USD). There, he earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in just three years. Following graduation, he was commissioned in the Navy’s Medical Corps. Next stop? Harvard Medical School. That’s right. Just three years after tearing around the Middle East, Jonny was enrolled in what is universally acknowledged as the most prestigious medical school in the world. While enrolled at Harvard Medical School, Jonny decided to apply to the NASA astronaut program. Even with his stellar record, being accepted was no sure thing; his selection class of 12 astronaut candidates was screened from over 18,000 applicants. Accordingly, while waiting to hear back from NASA, Jonny continued with his medical career. Having seen first hand during his combat deployments how medical professionals can save lives in extreme circumstances, once he finished medical school and was certified as a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Jonny chose to pursue advanced training in emergency medicine. He started a four-year course of training as a resident physician in emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. After completing his first year in the emergency medicine program, he was notified of his acceptance to the astronaut program. Naturally, he decided to put his medical training on hold and accepted the invitation from NASA. Being selected as an astronaut candidate is an amazing accomplishment in and of itself, but that’s just the beginning of a lengthy and challenging process. After accession into the program, candidates are evaluated at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for about two years . During that time, they complete International Space Station systems training, extravehicular activity skills training, robotics skills training, Russian language training , and aircraft flight readiness training. If successful, they are then officially designated as astronauts and are eligible to be selected for a specific space mission. Once assigned to a specific mission, astronauts complete advanced training unique to that mission. This process of baseline training followed by advanced training is not unlike his first career as a SEAL, or even his second career as an M.D. Every SEAL completes Basic Underwater Demolition School (BUDS) in Coronado, California. This provides a baseline of common skills, techniques, and terminology. From there, however, SEALS are assigned to specific SEAL teams that may have different specialties, and each SEAL team tailors its training to its upcoming deployments . In a similar manner, every M.D. completes essentially the same curriculum in medical school, then goes on to advanced training, depending on what the assigned specialty is. It works roughly the same way with astronauts. Once they complete the baseline training as astronauts, they proceed to advanced training unique to their specialty or mission. So what’s next for Jonny? At this point, he’s certainly interested in the progress of NASA’s plan to restore a domestic manned spaceflight capability. With the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA lost its “in house” capability to send U.S. astronauts into space on its own equipment. As a temporary solution that is now nearing a decade in use, NASA contracted with the Russian space agency Roscosmos to provide launch services for U.S. astronauts to get to the International Space Station (ISS). A recent spate of failures on the Russian Soyuz family of rockets have put the ISS at risk of having to operate in unmanned mode with no astronauts on board. Needless to say, NASA is very interested in avoiding that unpleasant scenario and is actively working on the Commercial Crew Development Program to restore America’s ability to launch astronauts into outer space onboard domestically manufactured space vehicles. The two competing models in the NASA program are the SpaceX Crew Dragon space capsule , and the Boeing CST-100 Starliner crew capsule . Both of these space vehicles have gone through extensive research, development, and testing, and are nearing certification to carry humans. The initial focus of this program is to get U.S. astronauts to the ISS. If both space vehicles prove capable, the mission sets will probably expand beyond the ISS to other manned space flight missions. As far as Jonny’s initial service assignment as an astronaut, like all members of his astronaut class, he entered training as part of the Artemis program, through which NASA is actively pursuing a return to the Moon. Manned missions in the Artemis program will use the Orion space capsule . In contrast to the Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner craft, which are strictly transfer vehicles intended to get astronauts from earth to the ISS, Orion is optimized to support astronauts for long-duration missions that go beyond low earth orbit . As of now, Orion can support missions of up to 21 days duration, more than enough to get from Earth to the Moon and back. Eventually, NASA hopes to build on the success of a return to the Moon with a mission to Mars. While his life so far has been nothing short of amazing, what many people notice about Jonny Kim is that he is an extremely humble man who describes himself as a servant of a greater cause, who never forgets where he came from. Of his decision to join the Navy and become a SEAL, in an interview with the Annals of Emergency Medicine, he said “Going into the Navy was the best decision I ever made in my life because it completely transformed that scared boy who didn’t have any dreams to someone who started to believe in himself.” Even though he is now in what is widely considered the most elite group of people on the planet, astronauts, he still maintains an air of humility and a focus on service. At this point, while SEAL/mathematician/M.D./astronaut Jonathan Kim is on track to be assigned to a long-duration space flight that goes beyond low earth orbit as part of the Artemis program, he does not yet have an assigned mission. That means he might be assigned to a manned mission to the moon or a developmental mission that goes beyond low earth orbit, but not all the way to the moon, or a mission to the ISS in low earth orbit. We’ll be sure to follow his progress and give you an update when he gets assigned to his first mission. But above all else, this guy’s insane resume and accomplishments at such a young age really highlight what is possible if you give it your all, regardless of your ethnicity or background. And he hasn’t even flown into space yet! We need real role models and heroes these days, not just movie stars or pro athletes. By all accounts, Jonny Kim fits the bill.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 15, 2020",Makers Of The Famous Minigun Give Us Our First Look At A .338 Magnum Gatling Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dillon Aero has revealed that it is working on a new Minigun-style machine gun chambered to fire .338 Norma Magnum ammunition. U.S. Special Operations Command is separately testing more traditional machine gun designs in this same caliber, which has previously been more commonly associated with sniper rifles . The Arizona-based gunmaker posted a picture of the still-experimental prototype on its official Facebook page on Jan. 15, 2020. The company says it will show the gun publicly for the first time at the upcoming 2020 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, which opens next week. Dillon Aero is best known as one of the few remaining manufacturers of versions of the iconic 7.62mm Minigun machine gun , which General Electric first designed and built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Though Dillon Aero has not yet released any specifics about its .338 Norma Magnum weapon, it is clearly another electrically-powered Gatling gun-type machine gun. While the Minigun has six rotating barrels, the .338 caliber design only has five. Miniguns, and other modern Gatling guns , typically have rates of fire of thousands of rounds per minute. Dillon Aero Dillon Aero has not said if it developing the weapon in response to a requirement from a prospective customer, but it is perhaps not surprising that they are experimenting with a design that fires this particular ammunition. Since 2017 , U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has been eying adopting a new, more traditional light machine gun in .338 Norma Magnum. Since then, the command has been evaluating designs from General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems and Sig Sauer . The aim of SOCOM’s program is to acquire a gun that can effectively engage targets beyond the range of its existing 7.62mm machine guns , but that is also lighter than the .50 caliber M2 machine gun . The M2 presently provides longer-range firepower, but its weight and bulk largely limit it to applications where it is mounted on vehicles, watercraft, and helicopters and preclude it from use by small teams during dismounted operations. However, the lightweight .338 Norma Magnum machine guns that SOCOM is testing now could also replace 7.62mm weapons, including the Minigun, in certain vehicle , boat , and helicopter door-mounted applications , as well. The .338 caliber ammunition would offer valuable added range no matter how the guns are employed. A Gatling gun-style .338 Norma Magnum machine gun would provide that same ability to engage targets at extended distances, while also offering the benefits of a thousands-of-rounds-per-minute rate of fire. Miniguns are already in widespread use within the U.S. military, especially with special operations forces , and elsewhere around the world , in both ground and aircraft-mounted applications because of the large volume of fire they can put out. Though Miniguns and other similar weapons use up large amounts of ammunition quickly, they can also rapidly suppress opposing forces or help break up sudden ambushes, as well as just quickly saturate entire areas during raids and other direct action and combat rescue operations. Dillon Aero also makes Minigun-armed gun pods for helicopters and light attack aircraft, another good role for a .338 caliber gun of this type. The range limitations of 7.62mm are even more pronounced in this context and a longer-range weapon would allow rotary and fixed-wing aircraft to strafe targets from further away or at higher altitudes, helping to keep them more separated from threats on the ground. The more powerful Norma Magnum ammunition is also more accurate at those extended ranges, which could be important for gun runs on enemy forces situated very close to friendly units or innocent bystanders, especially in dense, urban environments. Dillon Aero’s Minigun pod on display mounted on the company’s Mission Configurable Aircraft System (MCAS) armament system., Joseph Trevithick Dillon Aero is almost certain to reveal more about this interesting new design after it public debuts at SHOT Show next week. It already appears to be indicative of growing interest in machine guns of all types in the .338 Norma Magnum caliber. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2019",Replacement For F-35’s Troubled ALIS Cloud-Based Brain Rebranded ODIN And Is Still Years Away,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon says that a replacement for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s long-troubled cloud-based computer brain is finally coming. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy have said that the existing system is one of, if not the most significant factor in the abysmal mission capable rates for their respective F-35 variants and a major contributor to the growing sustainment costs for the aircraft. Unfortunately, the upgraded system is not expected to be in widespread use until 2022 at the earliest. Bloomberg was first to report that Ellen Lord, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions and Sustainment, had revealed the existence of a replacement in the works for the F-35’s existing Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), on Jan. 14, 2020. Lord had talked to reporters about the new Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN) after leaving a Congressional hearing on the F-35 that was not open to the public. ODIN is a forced acronym that Lord said was a reference to the Norse god of the same name, according to Bloomberg . The Pentagon is developing ODIN “with the voice of the maintainer and the pilots at the forefront of the requirements list,” Lord later told Reuters . “We have heard our maintainers on the flight lines loud and clear when they say they want to spend less time on administrative maintenance on ALIS.” Despite often being described as the computer brain inside the F-35, ALIS is a much broader system that encompasses physical components on the aircraft and on the ground, as well as the cloud-based network backend that links them all together. The Joint Strike Fighter’s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, which also developed ALIS for the U.S. military, has described it in the past as akin to a “smartphone” that is responsible for running “more than 65 applications that do everything from managing operations and training to maintenance and supply chain.” Maintenance personnel definitely do use ALIS to collect information about the “health” of individual aircraft in order to perform various day-to-day tasks, such as isolating potential problems and order spare parts from the depot. It’s how Lockheed Martin sends out software updates for the F-35’s various systems, as well. However, the system also serves as the upload and download point for operational data packages for the aircraft, which includes planning information such as the location of potential threats and general routes to and from mission areas. After a sortie, ground crews can then extract that information, plus additional data gathered from the F-35’s powerful sensor suite, for debriefing purposes and to support planning for future operations. You can read more about how all this works in detail in this past War Zone piece . The Joint Strike Fighter’s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, which also developed ALIS for the U.S. military, has long billed the system as helping to streamline maintenance and other operational activities. In principle, the networked system should allow personnel to more readily spot problematic maintenance trends and rapidly exchange important mission data between units. A member of the US Air Force uses a laptop to review maintenance data from the ALIS system., USAF In principle, ALIS has done anything but make the lives of personnel assigned to Air Force F-35 units, especially their maintenance, easier. “I can guarantee that no Air Force maintainer will ever name their daughter Alice,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said during a public talk at a conference in February 2019. After years of work and billions of dollars to try to fix its underlying software, ALIS has remained a broken mess that is difficult to use and often displays information that is flat out wrong, leaving maintenance personnel struggling to diagnose problems and wasting time ordering the wrong parts or mistakenly sending perfectly serviceable components back to the depot. On top of that, the system has to contend with the fact that not all F-35s are configured the same way as a product of a concept known as concurrency , wherein Lockheed Martin started building aircraft with the idea that upgrades and fixes would be added into the jets during depot maintenance down the line. So, for example, as of April 2019, it took 188 days on average for depot-level repair of F-35 parts, more than twice as long as the Pentagon’s desired maximum timeframe, in large part because of issues with ALIS, according to the Government Accountability Office . General parts shortages and cascading maintenance backlogs have only exacerbated the issue. GAO In 2018, U.S. Air Force training units at Eglin and Luke Air Forces Bases simply stopped using ALIS altogether, relying on separate databases instead, because of these and other problems. These issues with ALIS have also, in turn, contributed to extremely low availability rates for F-35s across all the services. ALIS has also posed nagging cybersecurity and operational security risks , the latter of which has led some foreign Joint Strike Fighter partners to develop their own firewalls to limit how much data they exchange with it. As then-Air Force Secretary Wilson’s remarks last year made clear, these issues are very well-known . The month before she publicly quipped about how much maintainers hate ALIS, the Air Force had announced that it had begun development of a replacement under a program called Mad Hatter . It’s unclear whether or not this is related to the new ODIN effort that Undersecretary of Defense Lord says is also now in progress. It’s also not clear how much ODIN leverages from ALIS and how closely related the two systems might be, despite the name change. “The goal [of Mad Hatter] is not simply to fix ALIS within the constraints that define it,” Will Roper, the Air Force’s top acquisition official, had told Defense News regarding that program, in February 2019. “It is to make the operator – the maintainer – more efficient, to make their user experience more pleasant.” Chassis Plans Beyond that, it remains to be seen when ODIN might produce any real results and when an upgraded system might actually find its way to actual F-35 units. Lord told Reuters that she only expected the new computer system to be available to all Joint Strike Fighter units across the U.S. military by 2022, if everything goes to plan. Representative John Garamendi, a California Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee’s Readiness Subcommittee, which held the recent hearing on the F-35, also told Reuters he felt that the Pentagon was working on “a very tight time frame.” Lord also added that deployable versions of the system would not be ready in 2022. This means that it’s unclear when forward-deployed F-35 units and Marine and Navy Joint Strike Fighters operating from amphibious warfare ships and aircraft carriers will actually start using ODIN and how this might impact their operations. The Marines and Navy are already facing issues due to the fact that various stocks of spare parts the services had previously purchased to support afloat operations are no longer usable in the more current configurations of their respective F-35B and C aircraft, another byproduct of concurrency. If there’s any silver lining to the present situation, F-35 units have already demonstrated that workarounds are available, if time-consuming. This could actually be valuable experience for conducting operations in instances where ALIS, or the future ODIN replacement, are suddenly unavailable for any reason. All told, the Pentagon, as well as the Air Force, Marines, and, Navy, are clearly eager to put the ALIS saga behind them. Unfortunately, any improvements still appear to be years away, leaving F-35 units stuck with ALIS, or convoluted workarounds using other systems, in the meantime.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 7, 2021",This One Navy F-16N Aggressor Had An Electronic Warfare Suite Only Found On Israeli Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s purpose-built F-16N aggressors remain arguably the most fascinating variant of the highly diverse F-16 Viper family. The type’s remarkably short, but hard flown career, lasting just a decade, didn’t allow it to see much change in configuration. But at least one F-16N, Bureau Number 163268, received a very curious and noticeable electronic warfare system upgrade around 1993. So, what was this mysterious system and how did it end up on a random Topgun F-16N? Here’s the story. Make sure to read the definitive account on the Navy’s F-16N and what it was like to fly in this past War Zone special feature . The unique electronic warfare system’s most prominent feature is a pair of blade-like antenna appendages on each side of the F-16N’s inlet structure. Because the aircraft’s running lights are also placed in that position, they are integrated into the edge of the streamlined antenna fairings. A pair of larger than normal antennas are also situated on both sides of the F-16s nose. F-16N RAPPORT III intake fairing installation. , Reader submission Beyond its visual appearance, the electronic warfare system on this lone F-16N—the only one we are certain received it—has a very colorful past. The system, which is known as the AN/ALQ-178 Rapid Alert Programmed Power management of Radar Targets III, or RAPPORT III, was originally developed by Loral, which eventually ended up in Lockheed hands. The all internally-mounted suite provided both passive radar warning receiver and active jamming functions into a single integrated system. It is capable of automatically detecting, classifying, locating, and countering hostile emitters. RAPPORT III’s first customer was supposed to be the Belgium Air Force. That ended up not happening, but Israel embraced the at the time cutting-edge system and saw great success with it on their F-16Cs during operations over Lebanon. A version of it later went on to equip the Turkish Air Force and it was evaluated in the 1990s for use in a number of American fighters. The last U.S. version of the system was dubbed the AN/ALQ-202 and it could have equipped most tactical jets in the Pentagon’s stable at the time. Loral Ad The best history we found on the system was from a Forecast International document on electronic warfare systems from the early 2000s. It gives a good overall synopsis of the system and its peculiar past: The Rapid Alert Programmed Power management of Radar Targets (RAPPORT) electronic countermeasures system was the only internal integrated system of its type developed and produced by one manufacturer. Development began in the early 1970s for a competition sponsored by the Belgian AirForce. The installation targeted 85 Mirage 5BA and BR aircraft. In June 1975, (then) Loral was selected as the contractor and production began in 1978. In 1979, the Belgian Air Force tentatively decided to install a more advanced model, RAPPORT III, in all Belgian F-16s from the 53rd production aircraft, with the previous aircraft to be retrofitted. Because of budget problems, the program was postponed, and funding of RAPPORT III stopped by the Belgian Air Force. ALQ-178(V) RAPPORT II production was completed in 1985 at 100 systems, with most installed on Belgian F-5BA/R aircraft. Experience with RAPPORT II was instrumental in deciding to adapt RAPPORT III in lieu of the standard US Air Force countermeasures suite for the Belgian F-16s, which would have used the ALR-69(V) and ALQ-119(V). The ALE-40(V) chaff/flare dispenser was retained. The first production contract for RAPPORT III was awarded in December 1983. The $88 million contract was awarded by Israel. The Israeli Air Force installed the system in its F-16s and used it with remarkable success against the Syrian Air Force during the Lebanon campaign. Under a special agreement, the Belgian Air Force was kept informed of the RAPPORT III’s performance and subsequently decided to install the system on its own F-16s. F-16C Barak seen equipped with a version of Rapport III still in 2017. , MathKnight and Zachi Evenor In mid-1985, the Belgian Air Force announced plans to restart the RAPPORT III program. The production plan granted the Teamco Co exclusive production rights, and the company set up manufacturing facilities in Belgium. From 1988 on, the Belgian Air Force provided the bulk of RAPPORT III funding. The total Belgian program for the RAPPORT III was valued at $180 million for 108 systems. In late 1988, after expending $33 million in development funds, Belgium dropped the RAPPORT III program because of escalating program costs, selecting Carapace, a combination RWR/jammer from France as a follow-on to RAPPORT II. In 1989, Loral announced that the government of Turkey had placed a $325 million order for the self protection electronic countermeasures system for its new F-16s. The name RAPPORT III was replaced by the nomenclature ALQ-178(V). Turkey selected it to equip a major production run of F-16s. First deliveries were made in 1992. Loral and Kavala (a Turkish holding company) formed a joint venture to produce ALQ-178(V) Self-ProtectionEW Suites (SPEWS) in Turkey. The joint venture was known as Mikrodalga Elektronik Sistemler (MiKES), and a production facility was operational by 1993. In 1998, MiKES announced that it would manufacture the ALQ-178(V)5 EW protection system for the Turkish Air Force’s Block 50 F-16s, rather than simply assemble the systems from components provided by Lockheed Martin (as it did with the ALQ-178(V)3). In 1993, Loral offered a significantly enhanced ALQ-178(V) (the ALQ-202(V), Loral Autonomous Jammer – LAJ) as an alternative to the terminated ALQ-165(V) ASPJ [Airborne Self Protection Jammer]. The enhanced and repackaged system was offered to both the US Navy and international F-16 and F/A-18 customers. The company offered to pay the cost of a competitive fly-off between the LAJ and ASPJ. Test flights of the ALQ-178(V)3 began at Eglin AFB, Florida, in February 1993. The tests were completed in August. The ALQ-178/202(V) was offered to South Korea and Egypt for their F-16s, and to Finland and Switzerland for their F/A-18s. In 1994, Finland and Switzerland decided to procure the ALQ-165(V) ASPJ instead in a combined FMS/commercial program. South Korea followed suit in early 1997. The US Navy awarded a contract for the Integrated Defensive ElectronicCountermeasure (IDECM) electronic warfare system for the F/A-18E/F in November 1995, eliminating any chance that the ALQ-202(V) would be procured for US F/A-18s. Considering what we know about the system’s complicated history and the timing of the F-16N photograph, shot in October of 1993 on Topgun’s ramp at NAS Miramar, the jet is most likely equipped with a variant of the RAPPORT III that was tested just a couple of months prior. Using a Navy F-16 for some of the testing would have been very efficient as the system wouldn’t have to be integrated onto a new Navy platform, such as the Hornet or Tomcat. Still, it isn’t clear how long the Topgun Viper retained the system or what the conclusions its evaluators were. Considering the combat record of the system and its success with at least a handful of air arms, it likely gave Navy fleet fighters opposing it a run for their money. F-16N equipped with AN/ALQ-178 on the Topgun ramp at NAS Miramar in October of 1993., Peter Boschert There has been a decades-long debate over equipping fighters with internal electronic warfare suites or relying on podded systems. It can be far more expensive and harder to upgrade internal systems, but they can be tailored to the airframe and the aircraft’s mission more tightly and don’t cause the drag penalty that an external podded system does. In addition, they don’t occupy valuable stores hardpoints. On the other hand, internal systems, which take up space and add weight to the aircraft, are always installed, even when they are not needed. F-16CJs with ALQ-131 electronic warfare pods on their centerline stations., USAF Up until the last decade or so, podded systems were remarkably popular even for relatively modern 4th generation fighters. In fact, they were so effective that they could turn even older fighter jets into highly formidable foes when their use was combined with creative cooperative tactics . But the increasing importance of electronic warfare and the incredible situational awareness a fully integrated digital electronic warfare and surveillance suite provides has meant that internal systems are becoming very hot items. In fact, they have been a key component of keeping new and upgraded 4th generation fighter designs relevant, with aircraft like the F-15 , F-16 , Super Hornet , and foreign offerings featuring various forms of these systems. They also often feature advanced towed decoys and other emerging expendable countermeasures capabilities . Taken as a whole, they are known to be absolute game-changers in terms of survivability. 5th generation fighters, with their high degree of sensor fusion, have these systems as a necessity. So, in some ways, RAPPORT III was ahead of its time and helped blaze a trail for the advanced internal electronic warfare suites that are so prevalent in today’s fighter market. That being said, at least one F-16N, even if for just a period of time in the early to mid-1990s, was the most formidable aggressor Viper on the block. And considering the stripped-down hotrod-like F-16N’s already notorious reputation, that’s really saying something.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For military and aerospace technology aficionados, proximity to the weapon systems they are so interested in is highly valued.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 17, 2020",Special Operators Are Eying This Machine Gun To Solve A Number Of Problems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Gunmaker Sig Sauer says it has delivered a number of its MG 338 machine guns to U.S. Special Operations Command, along with sound suppressors and ammunition for them, after the weapons passed an important safety certification. Two years ago the Command, in cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps, first announced it was looking to buy new machine guns chambered for the .338 Norma Magnum cartridge, typically used in sniper rifles , to fill a gap in capability between existing 7.62mm and .50 caliber types . Sig Sauer announced that the MG 338 had successfully met U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) safety requirements on Jan. 15, 2020. In May 2019, SOCOM said it would begin a limited user evaluation of prospective .338 Norma Magnum machine guns in October of that year. That testing, which may include limited combat trials, is supposed run through May of this year, after which the command will make a formal decision about whether it wants to proceed with the program, which it has officially dubbed the Lightweight Machine Gun-Medium, or LMG-M. SOCOM has also begun acquiring new “assault” machine guns in the 6.5mm Creedmoor caliber that will meet a similar requirement for a weapon better suited to engaging targets beyond the range of existing 5.56mm types and traditional 7.62mm designs. “For the first time in decades the U.S. Military certified a new machine gun, ammunition, and suppressor at the same time, bringing new innovation, portability, and increased lethality to our ground forces, with all components coming from one company,” Ron Cohen, Sig Sauer’s President and CEO, said in a statement. “This certification was achieved following the outstanding performance of the complete MG 338 system through the rigors of the extensive function, durability, and safety tests set forth by USSOCOM.” Sig Sauer says its new .338 caliber machine gun weighs around 20 pounds, making it lighter than even the L variant of U.S. military’s standard 7.62mm M240 machine gun, which uses titanium components to reduce its weight. This would also make it lighter than the Mk 48 machine gun , which SOCOM previously led the development of as a lighter-weight alternative to the M240-series. It is also substantially lighter than the M2 .50 caliber machine gun. Despite its lightweight design, the MG 338 will also be able to effectively engage targets significantly further away than existing 7.62mm types. SOCOM has set its effective range requirement for the machine guns at between 6,500 and 8,200 feet. By comparison, the maximum effective range of the M240L is around 5,900 feet, according to the manufacturer. A US Army soldier fires an M240L machine gun., US Army To help handle the strain of firing the more powerful ammunition in a lighter-weight package, the MG 338 also features a recoil mitigation system that includes a barrel that shifts backward with each shot to absorb some of the force. It also has a relatively slow rate of fire of around 600 rounds per minute to help keep it controllable. Sig Sauer says that the MG 338’s controls, such as the charging handle and safety lever, are ambidextrous and that it can be configured to feed its belted ammunition from the left or the right side of the gun. This could help allow it to be mounted in various positions on ground vehicles and watercraft , including on mounts designed to hold multiple guns at once. It could also readily serve as a helicopter door gun. A US Navy special operator stands behind a mount with two M240 machine guns on a Special Operations Craft-Riverine during a training exercise. The MG 338 could work in a similar mounted configuration., USN The MG 338 can be converted to fire 7.62mm ammunition, as well. This would allow special operators to conduct various types of general training, such as basic familiarization with the gun and its controls, without having to use more expensive .338 Norma Magnum ammunition. SOCOM plans to decide in June whether or not to proceed with its plans to actually acquire machine guns in this caliber. If it does move ahead with the program, a formal request for proposals would go out later this year. Sig Sauer would not necessarily be alone in that formal competition. A briefing slide on the LMG-M program that SOCOM presented in May 2019., SOCOM General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems was among the first to propose the idea of a .338 caliber machine gun and has been working on prototypes of what it calls the Light Weight Medium Machine Gun, or LWMMG, since at least 2009. It introduced a new, improved version just last year as part of its own submission to SOCOM’s limited user evaluation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4vXH-RiEk Whatever design wins the final LMG-M contact, which SOCOM says it could award in 2021 and could result in the purchase of as many as 5,000 of the guns, could lead to additional immediate sales. As noted, the U.S. Marine Corps has been involved in this project since at least 2017. Sig Sauer has said that it might look to pitch the gun to the U.S. Army , too, which is in the process of testing a slew of new small arms as it looks to replace various existing systems, such as the M4 carbine and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon . The winner of the LMG-M deal would also be well poised to market their winning design overseas to any country with similar requirements. Sig Sauer has already been making significant inroads in the U.S. military, most notably winning the contract to produce the new standard issue pistol for the U.S. Army, a design now slated to become the default sidearm across all the services . The company is also competing in the Army’s competition to replace the M4 and M249. Sig Sauer’s entries into the US Army program to replace the M4 carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon., Sig Sauer In addition, Sig Sauer has already secured a different SOCOM contract for a new personal defense weapon, called the Rattler, which is derived from its increasingly popular MCX rifle line . You can read about in more detail about that gun in this past War Zone story . Hopefully, as SOCOM’s limited user evaluation continues, we will get more details about special operators’ experiences with the MG 338, as well as any other competing designs, which could give them valuable longer-range firepower in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 10, 2020",This Massive Desert Base Is China’s Version Of America’s Nellis Air Force Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As China’s military capabilities continue to rapidly expand and mature, so do the bases that support and test them. Case in point, the Dingxin Test and Training Base, a sprawling facility located Gansu Province, in the Gobi Desert, an area that has long been a military and weapons testing stronghold for the People’s Liberation Army. The base is one of the most unique in China as it supports the development of tactics and weaponry and advanced training of People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) units in high-end, complex scenarios. Live fire drills are also a big part of what goes on there. The base hosts a fleet of aggressor fighters, as well as full-scale aerial target drones, the latter of which are converted largely from stocks of antique MiG clones. As such, Dingxin is roughly analogous to Nellis Air Force Base in the United States, with a bit of Eglin Air Force Base and Edwards Air Force Base mixed in. With relative seclusion, wide-open airspace, expansive training range complexes, and good weather for year-round flying operations, Dingxin is home to the country’s highest-profile fighter and attack aircraft exercises , including the annual air-to-air focused Golden Helmet and air-to-ground focused Golden Dart competitions. Large force employment (LFE) exercises like Red Sword, roughly similar to the United States Air Force’s Red Flag , and Red and Golden Shield, which include advanced competitive training for Chinese surface-to-air missile , anti-aircraft artillery, and electronic warfare units, also occur at and near the base. The installation is located next to Jiuquan City on the southern end of the expansive Shuangchengzi missile test range, an area full of unique facilities, some of which are quite intriguing, to say the least.

Google Earth A closer view of the pads (rotated 90 degrees off true north)., Google Earth Maybe the most curious installation near Dingxin is what appears to be a moated mountain-bunker-like fortress located just two miles to the northwest edge of the sprawling air base. Google Maps At first glance, the facility appears to have apertures similar to Iran’s ballistic missile caverns and it also has some sort of parking facility on top of it. Initially, our thoughts were that it was some sort of a heavily fortified bunker, and it could very well serve in that role. At the same time, the structure to the right of the parking area almost looks like grandstands. This led us to wonder if this is a VIP review area for wargames that go on above the target areas located just to the south. Possibly. But the real origin story of this clearly fortified installation is way more interesting than our theories as to its current use. It turns out that this is one of over a dozen highly-fortified moated fortresses that appear as almost ancient-like structures in the region, but were actually built in the 1960s and 1970s during a time of great tension between Russia and China. Grand General Lin Biao led the Chinese military’s initiative to build a number of these fortifications, the majority of which are in Gobi Desert in the region that surrounds Dingxin Air Base. The majority of them are mainly abandoned, but some have been repurposed by the Chinese military, and for good reason. They were incredibly expensive to build. The mountains are manmade and underneath them lies a labyrinth of chambers and passageways that can house and sustain large groups of soldiers and command staff for long periods of time. The complexes are steel and concrete reinforced and go quite deep underground, making them remarkably resilient. They were built in flat areas that were easily defendable and were packed with all types of artillery and weaponry used to keep a marauding army at bay. This included anti-aircraft artillery, tank guns, and other heavy weapons. These are truly massive fortifications. The man-made mountains are longer than an aircraft carrier. When they were built, the area was less arid and the moats would fill in naturally due to spring water and other local water sources. With all this in mind, it’s no surprise that a few of the moated fortifications have been adapted by the PLA for more modern uses. Google Earth Google Earth Google Earth Google Earth Dingxin Test and Training Base truly sits at the heart of China’s air combat capabilities. As People’s Liberation Army forces adopt more and more western-like concepts of technology, tactics, and training, it will only become more important, and as a result, it will continue to expand. The region as a whole, although fairly desolate, has always been incredibly important to China’s military, but this will only expand as its capabilities become more complex and sensitive in nature. China’s rapid development of its space programs only makes the region all that much more critical to Beijing, as well. With all that being said, China’s potential adversaries and friends alike are keeping a close eye on developments at the base and its surroundings for indications of how the country’s rapidly expanding combat capabilities will continue to morph in the years to come.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 27, 2020",Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet Takes Flight With New Infrared Search And Track Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has announced that one of two F/A-18F Super Hornet testbeds that it is using in the development of the Block III upgrades for the U.S. Navy flew with an infrared search and track system, or IRST, for the first time late last year. This successful flight test comes as the company moves closer to delivering the first of these initial jets, which have other Block III updates installed, such as conformal fuel tanks , in the near future. On Jan. 15, 2020, the Chicago-headquartered plane maker revealed the IRST test had occurred, but did not say when specifically beyond “late 2019.” The Navy had originally planned for the IRST system to be included in the Block II Super Hornet upgrades, but ultimately deferred it to the Block III effort. On Jan. 7, Jane’s 360 had also reported that the Navy expected to receive the first of the F/A-18F testbeds before the end of the first quarter of the year. “The IRST Block II sensor gives Navy fighters extended range and increasing survivability,” Kenen Nelson, the Director of Fixed Wing Programs at Lockheed Martin, which builds the IRST21 sensor that the Block III Super Hornets will use, said in a statement . “This technology will help the Navy maintain its advantage over potential adversaries for many years.” The complete IRST system consists of a FPU-13 drop tank with the IRST21, also known as the AN/ASG-34, installed in the front portion, which the Block III Super Hornets will carry on their centerline station. The FPU-13 with the IRST sensor installed can carry 330 gallons of fuel as compared to a standard 480-gallon centerline tank. Conformal fuel tanks , another part of the Block III upgrade package, will help offset this lower amount of total fuel in the tank. A graphic showing the IRST21 installation in the FPU-13 drop tank for the US Navy’s Block III Super Hornets., Lockheed Martin Boeing had previously proposed an internal IRST system mounted in the nose, which would have required the elimination of the Super Hornet’s 20mm M61A2 Vulcan cannon . The Navy subsequently decided to pursue the podded option instead and has been testing prototype versions , in cooperation with Boeing, since 2009. Mounting the system on a centerline tank allows for far easier upgrades and future modification work and it offers a better field of view than an under-nose mounted alternative. Most importantly, it means the sensors to be swapped between airframes easily, which is a welcome capability for an advanced IRST as the targeting data it collects can be sent to other aircraft in a formation. In other words, each aircraft having its own IRST is a far more costly proposition, but it offers limited advantages in some air combat scenarios compared to having half the formation carrying it and sharing the information the pods collects to the other fighters. When it comes to the Block III Super Hornets, the IRST systems will also be tied into the new networking functionality that these aircraft will also be receiving. So, while a single jet with the IRST sensor would only be able to get a bearing and azimuth to the target, Boeing has said that fused information between two aircraft will be able to provide both range and altitude, enough data to actually engage the threat reliably. The Super Hornets will also be able to do all of this while scanning passively with their radars shut off, making them less vulnerable to detection by their opponents. Alternatively, the IRST pod will be able to help cue the Super Hornet’s other sensors to look at one piece of sky at the same time. For instance, if a target was detected by IRST, the aircraft’s AN/APG-79 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar could then work to also target that contact and the aircraft’s targeting pod could be automatically slewed to try to find and identify it visually. You can read more about the enhanced capabilities that the entire Block III package will offer in these past War Zone features . The IRST system, in particular, is an extremely important part of the Block III upgrades and will give the Super Hornets a valuable tool for detecting and tracking stealthy targets, which are increasingly a potential threat to U.S. fighter jets. China has already fielded its first stealth fighter, the J-20 , and Russia is still pushing ahead in its plans to acquire substantial numbers of the Su-57 advanced combat jet, which has some stealthy features , and there is the potential for both countries to export these or other stealthy designs . One of the two F/A-18F testbeds that Boeing is using in the development of the Block III upgrades equipped with conformal fuel tanks., Boeing via Janes 360 Beyond scanning for stealthy aircraft, IRST sensors also have the benefit of not being susceptible to electronic warfare attacks. This makes them valuable backups to traditional radars when facing even non-stealthy aircraft in environments where there is heavy jamming and electronic warfare activity. The U.S. Air Force is also acquiring a podded version of the IRST21, using Lockheed Martin’s propriety Legion Pod , for its F-15C Eagles. Podded IRST sensors are very likely to migrate to other types of aircraft beyond just the Super Hornets and Eagles in the future, as well, and you can read more about the enhanced capabilities that these systems will offer U.S. fighter pilots in this past War Zone piece . A US Air Force F-15C Eagle carrying a Legion Pod, which also features the IRST21 sensor., USAF At present, the Navy still expects to reach initial operational capability with the Block III Super Hornet in 2021 and have one squadron of the upgraded jets per Carrier Air Wing by 2024. Boeing had told Jane’s 360 last week that the delivery of the first F/A-18F testbed aircraft was still “on schedule” and was slated to occur before the end of March 2020. The two testbeds will feature some, but not all of the Block III updates. The picture Boeing released along with its announcement of the IRST flight test shows an F/A-18F with the tail number 123 carrying the podded system. A previous photo that the company provided to Jane’s 360 , seen earlier in this story, shows the second aircraft, tail number 125, equipped with the conformal fuel tanks. It’s not clear what other additions the two jets may have already, respectively, or are set to receive before they get delivered to the Navy. The service will use both of them to begin exploring new concepts of operation around the added capabilities, as well as to help develop a training curriculum to transition pilots from their existing Block II jets to the improved aircraft. By all indications, we’ll be seeing more of the two F/A-18F testbeds this year, and hopefully learning more details about the impressive new capabilities the Block III upgrade program is set to offer, as the Navy moves steadily closer to getting the first of its fully updated Super Hornets later this year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 26, 2019",Navy Littoral Combat Ship Will Soon Be Armed With A Laser Weapon System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says the Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship USS Little Rock will get a 150-kilowatt class laser weapon system from Lockheed Martin this year. This would make Little Rock the third of the service’s warships to be fitted with a high-power laser of some kind, following the installation of two different designs on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey and the San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious ship USS Portland last year. The War Zone was first to report that both of these vessels had gotten their respective lasers . U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Richard Brown, Commander of Naval Surface Forces, told reporters about the impending laser installation on Jan. 13, 2020, as first reported by USNI News . At around this exact time last year, the officer had announced plans to have Little Rock deploy in early Fiscal Year 2020, which officially began on Oct. 1, 2019. If that schedule remains the same – this ship notably suffered damage after smacking into a moored vessel in Canada last year shortly after the Navy took delivery of it – the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) could be receiving its laser very soon, if it hasn’t already, and be preparing to deploy. It is most likely headed for a cruise in Latin American waters, where its primary mission could be chasing drug smugglers, according to USNI News . Vice Admiral Brown did not say what laser the Navy would install on Little Rock, but the most likely candidate would seem to be a variant or derivative of Lockheed Martin’s High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance system, or HELIOS. Previous reports have said this laser is in the 60-kilowatt class, but that the manufacturer was looking to increase its power to the 150-kilowatt class. An artist’s conception of HELIOS installed on a US Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer., Lockheed Martin As its name implies, HELIOS blends an optical dazzler, which can blind and confuse optics on hostile ships, aircraft, and drones, as well as optical seekers on missiles and other munitions, together with a high-energy laser capable of actually disabling and destroying certain targets, such as small unmanned aircraft and swarms of small boats. Integrating HELIOS onto Little Rock would make good sense as it is one of two remaining lasers in the Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLoS) that have yet to find their way onto a ship. In November 2019, USS Dewey emerged equipped with what appeared to be the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system. USS Portland is now armed with the prototype developed under the Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program. The service has also said that there is no immediate plan for an at-sea demonstration of a design developed under the Ruggedized High Energy Laser (RHEL) effort, the last of the four NLoS efforts. USN However, if this is the case, it would also represent an important acceleration of the Navy’s plans for HELIOS, which it also refers to as the Surface Navy Laser Weapon System (SNLWS) Increment 1. Previously, the service had said that it would install this laser onto an Arleigh Burke class destroyer sometime in Fiscal Year 2021 . “The big thing we’re looking at is, what is that opportunity to pull things in – so for instance with directed energy, between the HELIOS, being able to get that onto a DDG [ Arleigh Burke ], and then some scalable laser technology that we’ve been working on, what’s our opportunity to deploy a laser sooner on an LCS, and the opportunity to potentially use one of those weapons modules to do that as opposed to having to design it someway into the ship?” Joe DePietro, Lockheed Martin’s Vice President and General Manager of Small Combatants and Ship Systems, told USNI News in August 2019. “Use some of that power, space, and weight of the mission package to be able to field another capability – which was inherently the thought process behind the design of LCS, to be able to integrate those new technologies faster because of the modularity of the ship.” USNI News has also reported that Lockheed Martin may have been able to accelerate the integration of HELIOS, or a derivative thereof, onto a Freedom class LCS because of the ship’s purpose-built modular design, which means it has significant available space and power generation. This was originally intended to support various mission modules, which have become a saga unto themselves that you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Lockheed Martin’s shipbuilding division also designed and continues to build the Freedom class ships, giving it a deep existing knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of these vessels. Still, DePietro’s mention of “scalable laser technology” raises questions about whether a Freedom class LCS would actually be able to support a 150-kilowatt class system, such as HELIOS, which the Navy has previously indicated would require the power generation capabilities of a significantly larger ship. So, it’s also possible that Vice Admiral Brown misspoke and the Lockheed Martin laser Little Rock is getting will be something else, perhaps with more limited capabilities, such as ODIN, which is just an optical dazzler. Adding a laser to Little Rock could be a stepping stone to adding them to other ships in the Freedom class, as well as other similarly sized ships, such as the Independence class LCSs and the Navy’s future FFG(X) frigates . The service has already indicated that it is interested in integrating 150-kilowatt class lasers onto whatever frigate design it chooses in the end and Lockheed Martin has already bailed on competing with a ship of its own to focus on providing key systems for the remaining entrants. DePietro had told USNI News that he saw adding a laser to one of his company’s LCSs another way to counter complaints about the ships’ limited capabilities and vulnerabilities , even in lower-risk scenarios, as well. The Navy has similarly been rushing to add RGM-148A Naval Strike Missiles to both classes of LCS to improve their offensive punch. Of course, HELIOS by itself also simply reflects the Navy’s growing interest in laser weapon systems , in general. The service already has plans to use the systems it develops under the umbrella of the Navy Laser Family of Systems as stepping stones to even more capable designs. Little Rock now looks set to be the next part of this new chapter in laser-armed naval operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2020",Here’s The Story Behind That Mysterious Navy “Cube” Croatian Fishermen Pulled From The Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week, a Croatian fishing boat, the Marian II , caught a mysterious orange cube belonging to the U.S. Navy in its nets while trawling in the Adriatic Sea. The crew had no idea what it was and subsequently returned it to its owners onboard the Pathfinder class survey ship USNS Bruce C. Heezen without getting any details about its purpose, prompting speculation and discussion in the press and on social media. The War Zone has now confirmed that Heezen was testing new underwater survey equipment in Croatian territorial waters at the time, with the approval of that country’s government, and that it had deployed this device in support of that mission. Marian II ‘s crew first recovered the cube , which is an oceanographic float, a type of buoy, on Jan. 6, 2020. In an Email to The War Zone , Travis Weger, a spokesperson for Military Sealift Command Europe and Africa, which is overseeing Heezen ‘s activities in the region, confirmed local media reports that the Navy had compensated the fishermen “for damages and lost time” before they returned the device, but did not say how much money they received. “ Bruce C. Heezen was executing an oceanographic survey, which was coordinated with Croatian authorities,” Weger explained. “Oceanographic surveys and fisherman interaction are common and professional in the maritime environment.” Weger said that the purpose of the buoy, which has a transponder attached, was to help in ensuring the accurate positioning of sidescan sonars that Heezen and other six ships in the Pathfinder class use to map the bottom of the ocean. He also said that the survey ship had “deployed the float in Croatian territorial waters to test upgraded systems,” but did not specify the exact make or model of the systems in use. Pictures of the float that the Croatian fisherman took after recovering it show a yellow tubular object on top of the buoy, which also has a metallic sea anchor. The float also has two vertical tubes, one of which, in this case, had a green-colored object inside. The cube also had a shipping label on it, which showed it had been shipped from the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. In addition to being a NASA rocket test facility, Stennis also hosts the Naval Oceanographic Office , which is responsible for collecting oceanographic data and processing it for various uses across the Navy and the rest of the U.S. military. A picture of the cube-shapped buoy, as well as its sea anchor., Darko Kunac Bigava via Morski.hr Another view of the buoy, showing the yellow and green objects., Darko Kunac Bigava via Morski.hr A closer look at the yellow and green objects., Darko Kunac Bigava via Morski.hr The shipping label on the buoye., Darko Kunac Bigava via Morski.hr Previous reports have already identified the yellow object as a Kongsberg cNODE transponder. This would fit with the Navy’s statement. The buoy also has two vertical tubes, one of which contained what appeared to be a Teledyne Marine R12K Acoustic Transponding Release, according to an initial analysis by H.I. Sutton, an expert in underwater military systems of all kinds. The company’s website says that this system is for “deep water asset recovery.” This system is connected to the sea anchor and releases that weight on command using a “ secure acoustic command ” so Navy personnel can recovery the buoy. All of this further fits with information from online ship tracking software that had shown Heezen sailing in very deliberate patterns near the Croatian island of Mljet, which are typically seen during underwater mapping and other oceanographic survey activities. Sutton has also noted that this same buoy has been employed in surveys using the Environmental Acoustic Recording System (EARS) to record ambient underwater noise, but there is no indication that this system was in use in this particular instance. That this mysterious cube has turned out to be part of an underwater mapping operating may seem underwhelming, but these kinds of surveys are exceptionally important for maritime operations below the waves, as well as above them . Having accurate charts of the topography of the seabed “serves to aid in safe navigation and effective mission planning,” Weger noted in his statement to The War Zone . The kind of information is extremely valuable for submarine and anti-submarine operations, as well as amphibious and littoral activities, all of which require a precise understanding of routes that are clear of potential underwater hazards. It’s worth remembering that in 2016, the Chinese navy grabbed an underwater drone that another Pathfinder class ship, the USNS Bowditch , had been operating in the Pacific near the Philippines. At the time, in its analysis of the incident, The War Zone noted that Chinese officials could have been interested in determining the kind of information it was gathering, as well as sending a message to the Trump Administration over its support for Taiwan and just asserting the country’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea. It’s not clear if Heezen was operating off the coast of Croatia because that area is of particular interest to the Navy or because it offered optimal conditions to test its upgraded oceanographic systems. However, the Navy has reported an uptick in Russian submarine activity , in particular, in the Mediterranean, as well as in the Atlantic and Arctic regions. This had already prompted the service to create reactivate U.S. 2nd Fleet, which recently reached full operational capability and is heavily focused on countering this subsurface activity. “The beauty of the platforms that I operate with – particularly the late-generation Virginia class submarine, which is the best in the world, has the ability, flexibility, agility, dwell; it can stay places for a long time submerged, stealthy; and it has speed, it gets places fast, so I can move it around like a chess piece on a chessboard,” U.S. Navy Admiral James Foggo, who serves as the head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa, as well as NATO’s Allied Joint Force Command Naples, told reporters in December 2019. He added that he had taken “a zone defense approach” to keeping tabs on his Russian counterparts. These are exactly the kind of tactics that require a solid knowledge of any underwater objects of interest, natural or man-made, as well as general depths and other oceanographic information. Knowing where submarines can and cannot operate, or hide, to begin with, makes it that much easier to search for and track potential underwater threats. Other baseline oceanographic information, such as typical ambient acoustics in various areas gathered using EARS, can further help ships, submarines, and aircraft in the detection of opposing subs. How much noise a submarine generates , and keeping it to a minimum , is absolutely essential for its survival in combat. All told, while the Heezen and this cube-shaped buoy may have been conducting what outwardly seems to be a relatively mundane underwater mapping mission, the data that this and the other Pathfinder class ships collect is absolutely vital for Navy operations, especially submarine and anti-submarine warfare.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 11, 2019",Behold The Navy’s New TH-73A Training Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Italy’s Leonardo has won the U.S. Navy contract to supply helicopters for its Advanced Helicopter Training System program, or AHTS, also known as TH-XX. The new helicopters, which will be designated TH-73As, will replace the service’s aging Bell TH-57B/C Sea Rangers, which have been in service since the 1980s. The Navy announced the award, worth almost $176.5 million, on Jan. 13, 2020. This contract covers the purchase of an initial batch of 32 helicopters, as well as spare parts, ancillary equipment, and support services, with deliveries continuing through 2021. The service expects to eventually buy up to 130 examples in total as part of a deal that could be worth up to $648 million. It first released its request for proposals for the new AHTS helicopter in January 2019 . “Today marks a great team effort to procure and deliver a helicopter trainer for the next generation of helicopter and tilt-rotor pilots for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard,” James Geurts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition, said in the statement . “I’m proud of the aggressive work the team did to leverage the commercial industrial base to get this capability to the warfighters, and our nation, at the best value to the taxpayer. This effort is key to ensure the readiness of our Naval Aviators for decades to come.” Leonardo Leonardo Leonardo Leonardo’s TH-73A is a variant of the single-engine AW119 helicopter, which the company had originally branded as the TH-119 . The TH-73A beat out other offerings from the incumbent Bell and Airbus Helicopters. Bell had offered a version of its Model 407GXi , while Airbus had pitched a version of its H135 series and pledged to build it at the same U.S. facility where it builds the UH-72A Lakotas for the U.S. Army. Those helicopters are based on the H145 series. The Navy’s Test Pilot School also operates a small number of UH-72As. The videos below contain additional information about the TH-73A’s capabilities. “The new Leonardo TH-73A helicopters are the cornerstone of AHTS, which is the planned replacement to address the capability and capacity gaps of the current aging TH-57 Sea Ranger helicopter training platform,” U.S. Navy Captain Todd St. Laurent, the Naval Undergraduate Flight Training Systems  Program Manager said in his own statement .  “The TH-73A will provide a modern helicopter training platform that will serve rotary and tiltrotor training requirements into the foreseeable future. These new helicopters will ensure the Navy has [the] capacity to train several hundred aviation students per year at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whiting Field in Milton, Florida.” The Navy initiated the AHTS program in response to growing demand for helicopter and tilt-rotor training, while the aging TH-57s have been increasingly troublesome to support. The service has a requirement to train at least 600 rotary-wing pilots every year through 2040, according to Breaking Defense . That number is almost certain to grow, especially with the acquisition of the CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor to replace the C-2A Greyhound fixed-wing aircraft in the Carrier Onboard Delivery role. US Navy TH-57 Sea Rangers., USN Leonardo will primarily build the helicopters through its U.S. subsidiary AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corp., which is based in the Pennsylvania city of the same name. This is the same firm that is building the Air Force’s new MH-139A Grey Wolf helicopters, a variant of Leonardo’s AW139, in cooperation with Boeing. The Italian company was the dark horse contender in the Air Force competition and the TH-73A represents another significant contracting victory. Now we just have to wait to find out what name the Navy will choose for its new helicopter that will be responsible for training a new generation of Navy and Marine helicopter and tilt-rotor pilots, as well as Coast Guard rotary-wing aviators.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 5, 2020",The USAF Uses Huge Swords Fit For He-Man And The Thundercats To Honor Officers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Social media is aflutter after Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the U.K. Member of Parliament for Brighton Kemptown from the opposition Labor Party, picked up a ceremonial mace in the House of Commons in protest of the country’s top leadership and their efforts to extract the country from the European Union. The gilded weapon represents royal authority and the House of Commons officially can’t hold formal debates unless it’s sitting there in its proper place. The act of symbolic defiance got Russell-Moyle booted from the chamber for the day. But before any of us Americans have too much of a laugh at archaic British traditions, it’s worth noting that we have many of our own. The U.S. military alone has a whole collection of traditions and rituals, some old, some new, from challenge coins to the assignment of heraldry to re-enlistment ceremonies , and more. Some of these aren’t even that old. Case in point, the U.S. Air Force’s Order of the Sword and its ceremonial weapons, which typically look better suited to a pulp high fantasy novel, video game, or cartoons such as He-Man , She-Ra , or the ThunderCats than a modern-day military gathering. Youtube GIF Youtube Gif Ostensibly, the Order, which awarded its first honor in 1967, is a way for Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO) to recognize the work of commissioned officers that has benefited the Air Force’s enlisted corps. This all makes good sense and provides a good way to highlight officers engaging with their subordinates in positive and productive ways that should be a model for others across the service. There are some reports that indicate the Order may have lost a sense of its original mission over the years, though, becoming more of an award that a select number of senior NCOs now increasingly hand out only to general officers at major commands as a matter of course. For instance, as of 2016, seven consecutive U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) commanders had received the accolade and it seemed highly unlikely that each one of them had made especially notable achievements with regards to their enlisted personnel. Regardless, the ceremonies themselves, where officers typically receive a plaque or something similar, or even a framed sword, to mark their achievement, are, by far, the best-known aspect of the Order. Units keep much larger and gaudy swords – called Master Swords – on hand to mark these events. These aren’t just huge swords like Claymores of the past, as you’ll see below. The Air Force Special Operations Command Master Sword. , USAF The Air Force Academy Master Sword., USAF The Air Education and Training Command Master Sword., USAF The Air Force Global Strike Command Master Sword., USAF The Air Force Mobility Command Master Sword., USAF The US Air Forces in Europe Master Sword., USAF A cursory search around the internet has not provided a good explanation for who started the ritual within the ritual of the swords or why. Like any good tradition, the origins of the Order itself are murky. Official Air Force news items marking the induction of new officers into the Order offer various descriptions, harkening back both to the Middle Ages and the Revolutionary War. When now-retired U.S. Air Force General Herbert Carlisle received his award in 2016, when he was head of Air Combat Command, the service gave this typical description : “The Order of the Sword is the highest honor and tribute enlisted Airmen can bestow upon a commissioned officer. It is patterned after two orders of chivalry founded during the Middle Ages in Europe and still in existence today – the Royal Order of the Sword and the Swedish Military Order of the Sword. In 1522, King Gustavus the First, of Sweden, enjoined the noblemen he commissioned to appoint officers to serve him – accountants, builders, craftsmen, teachers, scribes and others responsible for conducting the ordinary daily affairs of the kingdom. The system worked so well it was incorporated into the Swedish army as a way to establish and maintain a cohesive, disciplined, well-trained force to protect lives and property in the kingdom. These ancient enlisted personnel would honor their leader and pledge their loyalty by presenting him with a sword.” These traditions were then passed on to the U.S. military during the Revolutionary War by individuals who had served in the British military and by European allies. There’s only one problem, though. As others have rightly pointed out before , the origin stories that cite the U.K. Royal Order of the Sword and the Swedish Military Order of the Sword simply don’t make sense. For one, there is simply no Royal Order of the Sword in the United Kingdom. The Swedish Military Order of the Sword is real, but didn’t exist until 1748, hundreds of years after King Gustavus I purportedly began the Medieval tradition, and hasn’t inducted any new members since 1975. Furthermore, Prussian-born Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, better known by the title Baron von Steuben , is credited with formally establishing the U.S. military’s NCO corps as an advisor to the Continental Army and Chief of Staff to General George Washington during the Revolutionary War . His Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States , more commonly known as the “ Blue Book ,” remained the core U.S. military manual until 1812. But if all of this backstory is overwrought and esoteric, it’s still nothing compared to the ceremonial swords that appear to be made for giants. If you have any stories of your own about the Order or have a better understanding of how it and its increasingly large and ornate blades came to be, please let us know in the comments!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AGM-114R9X, the now infamous Hellfire missile derivative that deploys large sword-like blades instead of high explosives to kill its target with surgical precision, has had its first known operational use in Afghanistan. The strike targeted a Taliban commander. Just days ago, two more American soldiers were killed by the extremist group in Afghanistan. The War Zone was the first to report that some sort of new exotic weapon was used on an attack on a terror kingpin in Syria three years ago. After a two year lull in further reports, the subsequently identified AGM-119R9X started to show up again, striking high-value targets will identical precision and leaving behind its signature octopus-like impact profile. Images taken at the site of one such attack unveiled exactly how this weapon was configured. You can read our report on it here and a subsequent one on what we know about the development of this unique and gruesome weapon here . The latest known strike using this weapon occurred less than a month ago . But all of these uses have occurred in Syria, that is until now. Afghanistan’s Ariana News reported the following (translated) on January 12th, 2019: “A key Taliban commander was killed as a result of an air strike by Afghan forces in Kunduz, the Interior Ministry said. The ministry said in a statement that Afghan forces carried out an air strike last night in Imam Saheb district of Kunduz province. The Taliban’s chief financial officer for the northeast of the country was killed in the incident. The statement said the man was named “Mohabullah” and was a Pakistani citizen. The Taliban have not said anything so far. The Afghan Defense Ministry added that Afghan forces are stepping up their operations against Taliban fighters. The Taliban has not yet said anything about the incident.” The AGM-114R9X gives commanders in Afghanistan a weapon with a whole new level of ability to strike high-value individuals even when moving through relatively densely populated areas with minimal chances of unintended casualties. This latest strike is also further evidence that the use of this weapon is expanding fairly rapidly. It isn’t clear if the delay in doing so between the first known strike and the recent increase in them starting last May had to do with technical limitations or political ones, or both. Either way, America’s “Ginsu Missile” is becoming more of a staple than an oddity. Expect to see much more of it in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",American Destroyer Sounds Collision Alarm As Russian Ship Gets Aggressive In The Middle East (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has revealed that a Russian Navy spy ship “aggressively approached” the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Farragut in the North Arabian Sea yesterday. This follows a similar incident between one of the Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruisers and a Russian Navy Udaloy class destroyer last year in the Pacific. The Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which is responsible for overseeing U.S. naval activities in the Middle East and parts of the Indian Ocean, released video footage of the incident, which it says occurred on Jan. 9, 2020. The Navy did not name the Russian ship involved and no hull number is visible, but it appears to be one of two Project 18280 Yuriy Ivanov class spy ships. In the video, sailors can be heard identifying it as an “AGI,” or an intelligence-gathering auxiliary, as well as saying that it got within 200 yards of the Farragut . The American destroyer is presently operating in the North Arabian Sea as part of the Truman Carrier Strike Group . “On Thursday, Jan. 9, while conducting routine operations in the North Arabian Sea, USS Farragut (DDG 99) was aggressively approached by a Russian Navy ship,” a Tweet from U.S. Fifth Fleet’s official Twitter account read. “ Farragut sounded five short blasts, the international maritime signal for danger of a collision, and requested the Russian ship alter course in accordance with international rules of the road.” “The Russian ship initially refused but ultimately altered course and the two ships opened distance from one another,” additional posts added. “While the Russian ship took action, the initial delay in complying with international rules while it was making an aggressive approach increased the risk of collision.” In June 2019, the Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chancellorsvill e had a similar run-in with Russian Navy Udaloy class destroyer Admiral Vinogradov in the Phillippine Sea. It was not clear at that time whether this might signal an increased willingness on the part of Russia to more aggressively challenge American ships at sea. Russian aircraft have performed aggressive maneuvers toward both U.S. military aircraft and ships in Europe and the Middle East on a number of occasions in the past six years or so. Russia had conducted four days of naval exercises with both Iran and China, starting on Dec. 27, 2019, but there is no indication that the presence of this Russian vessel was related to those drills. It could simply be shadowing the Truman Carrier Strike Group. However, it comes as Truman and her escorts are likely to be on especially high alert given the greatly increased tensions in the Middle East between the United States and Iran. This incident follows a succession of unrelated events that led first to a U.S. drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, outside the Baghdad International Airport last week. This, in turn, had prompted unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at U.S. forces in Iraq on Jan. 8, 2020. We will update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 2:55PM EST— CNN reports that the Russian intelligence ship came within 180 feet of the USS Farragut , substantially closer than the 200-yard figure heard in the official video. In the incident in the Pacific last year, Admiral Vinogradov sailed within 50 to 100 feet of the USS Chancellorsvill e. While these distances may seem relatively large, it’s worth remembering that the Farragut , which displaces 9,200 tons, is, at its great width, 66 feet wide and just short of 510 feet long. The Project 18280 Yuriy Ivanov class spy ships are smaller, but still displace around 4,000 tons. Ships of these sizes can be relatively slow to maneuver , increasing the risks of a serious and potentially deadly accident when they come into such close proximity.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 6, 2020",American Officials Say Intelligence Points To Iran Shooting Down Ukrainian Airliner (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. officials say they are “confident” in intelligence that an Iranian surface-to-air missile brought down an airliner belonging to Ukraine International Airlines. Ukrainian investigators had already said that they were considering this possibility as they explore the incident, which followed a recent and unprecedented Iranian missile strike targeting U.S. forces in Iraq . This all comes as Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which carried out the strikes on targets in Iraq, says that it was on high alert for an immediate American counter-attack and was prepared for an ensuing conflict that might have lasted days or weeks. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, a Boeing 737-800, crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport at approximately 6:12 AM local time on Jan. 8, 2020. The flight was heading to the Ukranian capital Kyiv and had 176 crew and passengers on board, all of whom died in the subsequent crash. Video footage that subsequently emerged showed the plane engulfed in a fireball before it hit the ground. The incident occurred hours after the Iranian missile strikes aimed at American troops in Iraq first began. Newsweek was among the first to report that U.S. defense and intelligence officials, as well as an Iraqi official, had told them that they also believe an Iranian surface-to-air missile brought down the 737. CBS News and other outlets have now also reported that U.S. officials believe this is what happened, based on various sources of intelligence. These include indications that Iranian air defenses activated their radars at around the time of the crash and at least two infrared signatures from possible surface-to-air missile launches seen by U.S. satellites. The satellites also reportedly saw the plane itself bursting into flames. The latter information very likely came from U.S. early-warning infrared satellites, especially the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) constellation, the capabilities of which the War Zone has explored in detail in the past. These same satellites were very likely among the early warning systems that U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say helped ensure U.S. personnel in Iraq had time to seek shelter and escape any casualties from the Iranian missile strike. The War Zone was the first to discuss how SBIRS or other space-based early warning systems could help in determining what happened to PS752, as well as help prevent casualties from the Iranian missiles, as part of our live coverage of the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq, stating: “Something to remember is that there is a tremendous amount of intelligence data to analyze from America’s space-based early warning network of infrared sensing satellites alone. Where the launches emanated from and where the missiles impacted, even the ones that missed, would have been recorded. The system can detect smaller infrared events as well and its data that could be used to help confirm if the Ukrainian airliner was indeed shot down. This same network, which is about to get even more capable , would have given near-instant warning that a launch was underway, which in turn gave American and allied troops time to take cover and prepare for the incoming bombardment. You can read all about this system in this past piece of ours.” An initial report from a Ukranian team investigating the accident say that they cannot rule out the possibility that Iranian air defenses shot down the airliner. They also say that they are looking into whether a terrorist bombing or some sort of engine failure was the cause. Unconfirmed Ukranian media reports say that sources among the investigation team have said that there is no evidence of an engine fire or and engine “ overheating ,” as Iranian media reports have claimed. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also said publicly that he cannot say “categorically” that the airliner was not shot down, but insisted it was too early to say for sure one way or another. 63 Canadian nationals were on the flight, the largest single national contingent onboard behind Iranian citizens. It remains unclear what weapon may have brought down the Ukranian airliner, but unconfirmed pictures have emerged online since purporting to show part of a 9M331 missile near the crash site. This missile is associated with the Russian-made Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile, which NATO also refers to as the SA-15 Gauntlet. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates a number of Tor-M1 systems. These are capable of engaging targets at short-to-medium ranges. PS752 would have been flying relatively low at the time of the crash, having just taken off from the airport in Tehran. Iranian officials have already categorically denied that it shot down the aircraft, highlighting the large number of Iranians onboard and describing reports of a shoot down as “ psychological warfare .” Outlets in Iran were first to report the crash and almost immediately stated that a “technical fault” was responsible. Iranian officials have also since said that the aircraft appeared to turn back toward the airport in Tehran before plummeting into the ground and that air traffic controllers never received a distress call. Iran has reportedly recovered the black boxes from the aircraft, but says that they are damaged. The aircraft’s manufacturer, Boeing, has said that it is seeking additional information, but the lack of formal diplomatic relations with Iran, as well as extensive U.S. sanctions, means the company cannot readily send its own personnel to the country to assess the situation. The regime in Tehran has already stated that it is not interested in American help with the investigation, anyways. Ukraine has asked the United Kingdom to aid in determining exactly what happened. All told, while the publicly available evidence may remain circumstantial, it is not hard to see how Iranian air defender may have mistakenly shot down the airliner. Earlier today, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps’ Aerospace Force, which primarily oversees the country’s ballistic missile arsenal, said that his forces had been on alert for an American counter-attack following the initial missile strikes on bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and they had been prepared for much larger conflict. There had also been reports that the Iranian Air Force had scrambled combat jets to guard the country’s skies against possible retaliation. Iranian air defenders could very well have made an error in identifying PS752 as a threat. This would hardly be the first time that an incident like this has occurred. In a particularly infamous recent incident, a mixture of Russian and Russian-backed forces in Ukraine shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over that country in 2014, possibly believing they were aiming at a Ukrainian military aircraft. In 2018, Syrian air defenders also shot down a Russian Il-20 surveillance plane while attempting to respond to Israeli airstrikes. Iran itself is no stranger to such things, with the regime in Tehran often bringing up the U.S. Navy’s shootdown of Iran Air Flight IR655 in 1988. This remains an extremely controversial incident that the United States maintains was a tragic accident. American and Iranian officials reached a settlement in international court over the shootdown in 1996, agreeing to pay compensation to the families of the passengers. Iran most recently made major public references to IR655 following President Trump’s threat over the weekend to strike 52 targets in Iran, including cultural sites, representing the 52 Americans Iranian revolutionaries held hostage in Tehran between 1979 and 1981. An accidental shootdown of a commercial airliner by Iranian air defenders would be extremely embarrassing to the Iranian regime, which has sought to present itself as the objective victim of American aggression since the U.S. drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, former head of Iran’s Quds Force, in Iraq last week. It’s unclear how the crash of PS752 might impact U.S.-Iran tensions now as more evidence continues to emerge suggesting Iranian forces shot it down. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 1:25PM EST— President Donald Trump has not confirmed the reports that U.S. intelligence points to Iran shooting down the Ukrainian airliner, but has now told reporters that it was flying through a “rough neighborhood” and “I have a feeling that…something very terrible happened.” The United Kingdom has said that it is looking into the new information and that it is “very concerning.” Canadian officials have also reportedly received the U.S. intelligence and find it “credible.” UPDATE: 2:25PM EST— An video has emerged on social media purporting to show an Iranian surface-to-air missile impacting flight PS752, but there has been no verification of its authenticity as of yet. UPDATE: 3:30PM EST— Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has now publicly said that his country has evidence, including intelligence from its allies, that points to Iran having shot down the Ukrainian airliner. It “may well have been unintentional,” he added. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made similar remarks. UPDATE: 8:10PM EST— The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will reportedly take part in the investigation into the fate of PS752. There are also unconfirmed reports that Iran may have cleared the crash site and bulldozed the remains of the wreckage into a single large pile, which, deliberately or not, could have compromised physical evidence that the aircraft was shot down. UPDATE: 1/10/2020— More reports have emerged that the crash site has been virtually cleared, rather than cordoned off and preserved for a deep forensic investigation, and that there is no security in place to prevent scavengers or anyone else from removing potential evidence of what happened to flight PS752. In addition, an interesting New York Times report from 2012 has re-surfaced that details a very similar incident in 2007, in which one of Iran’s then largely new Tor-M1 systems accidentally fired on commercial airliner near the country’s nuclear facility in Natanz. Thankfully the missile in that case missed. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Land Surface-To-Air Missile Systems"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The tragic loss of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 , a Boeing 737-800 with 176 souls on board, increasingly appears to have been a horrific mistake . Video of the airliner careening into the ground ablaze at around 6:12AM local time on January 8th, 2020 has permeated news headlines. It has also served as an unexpected and horrific aftershock to the unprecedented Iranian missile strikes on U.S. forces in Iraq that occurred just a few hours prior. Many are asking how an airliner taking off normally from a major international airport located on the outskirts of a capital city could simply be swatted out of the sky. Clearly, nobody has the complete answer to that question at this time, but there is certainly a lot to comprehend and ponder until we do. The Mindset Of Iranian Air Defenders I don’t think most people comprehend just how unique the situation was and had been for those tasked with defending Iranian airspace at the time of the supposed shootdown. For nearly a week, Iran’s air defense network had been on high alert. Following the airstrikes on Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and the assassination of Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, the biggest crisis between the U.S. and the country in decades was unfolding. The rhetoric between the two bitter foes had quickly reached new heights with direct threats from President Trump about striking 52 target sets , some of which could include cultural sites important to the Iranian people and regime. American military might, including heavy airpower , was pouring in the region. A spark could ignite a war at any time—even one caused by a relatively minor miscalculation. An aerial blitz, even a limited one, from the U.S. would look unlike anything Iranian air defenders had ever seen. The U.S. relies heavily on stealth technology, electronic warfare , and pointed cyber attacks that could make a familiar radar scope look alien in an instant. Stealthy aircraft and cruise missiles may appear fleetingly on those same scopes depending on the range, aspect, and type of sensor trying to track and engage them. Getting a shot off fast may be the only way of attempting to counter such a threat, if you are lucky enough to ever detect it at all. Iran’s military forces are far from homogeneous in quality and readiness. It is hard to predict how proficient the individuals at the controls of any given Iranian surface-to-air missile battery truly are, especially during a crisis when reserve forces are activated. The system suspected of shooting down the airliner, the relatively short-range Tor-M1, is not a high-end weapon, it is used mainly for point defense and for accompanying ground forces on the move. The quality of operator is likely significantly lower than those found in Iran’s long-range air-defense units that operate more capable and higher-end strategic air defenses, such as the S-300 and other indigenous systems. After a week of being on extreme alert already wearing down their effectiveness, and with their country having just launched a truly unprecedented ballistic missile strike on U.S. forces in Iraq, even though the American president swore vengeance if such a strike were to occur, the stress and fatigue levels were likely very palpable. In fact, the ballistic missiles flew into Iraq at roughly 3AM local time and dawn was coming soon when the 737 went down three hours later. That makes for a long, very tense night after a long tense week, and if the U.S. were to retaliate, those weapons would arrive before sunrise. For the Iranian air defenders, the window of vulnerability was closing, but as a result, the risk of such a strike was also being compressed into that shrinking timeframe and magnified. For the personnel sitting in that cramped road-mobile air defense system on the western approaches to Iran’s capital city, which is rife with relevant targets, it would be an immeasurably nerve-racking situation that they would found themselves in around 6AM on January 8th, 2020. Their SAM system was radiating gobs of RF emissions and positioned in the likely flight path of incoming American combat aircraft and missiles, making them a certain target for combat jets tasked with clearing an avenue for other attacks. Their radar, blazing like a bright flashlight in a dark room, was literally telling hostile forces where their location is, what they are, and that they need to be destroyed. Under those circumstances, death would likely come by a Mach 2 flying AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) launched off an F-16CJ or more likely via a slower, but highly accurate GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb launched from the weapons bay of a stealthy F-35. It was one horrible place to be and the worst time to be in it. It was also a breeding ground of circumstances that invites a hair-trigger and potentially devastating miscalculation. Technical Unknowns Beyond the human factors involved, there are major technological unknowns that could have contributed to such a disaster. Iran imported just over a couple of dozen Tor-M1 air defense systems from Russia in 2007. So, these aren’t ancient SAM systems necessarily, but just how modern they were when they got delivered and what upgrades or tinkering they have been through, isn’t widely known, nor is their overall mechanical condition. The tinkering part is key as Iran has a fairly remarkable albeit at times puzzling organic weapons development industry that has been known to clone foreign systems into local production. They also modify foreign weapon systems to better suit their needs and sustainability demands. How much modification work had occurred on these systems in the 12 years since they have been delivered or how such work has modified their effectiveness, one way or another, is another unanswered question. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rLfmNOOBYLE More importantly, we don’t know exactly how deeply intertwined the Tor-M1 units are with Iran’s greater integrated air defense system (IADS). In other words, the degree to which a Tor-M1 battery was operating independently of a greater aerial surveillance and command and control architecture is unknown, but it is a key factor that could have contributed to making such a mistake. I would bet that this system was operating without the benefit of any deep integration with a large IADS, which makes some sense when you think about its primary road-mobile, infantry-guarding mission set. Clearly, if indeed an Iranian SAM took the plane down, the crew’s situational awareness was compromised, both in terms of the overall tactical picture and what was going on with normalized air traffic in the immediate vicinity of the battery. We know for a fact that multiple flights continued to depart in the hours following Iran’s missile barrage and leading up to the shoot-down, so it’s not like the 737 appeared following a lengthy pause in operations at the nearby airport. Then there is the question of technical issues with the battery itself. The doomed 737 was doing exactly what a 737 would when departing from that airport. The Tor operators would have seen that flight profile so many times that it would be burned into their consciousness—that is if the crew was familiar with the area. But even still, they watched the flights depart before the 737, and they didn’t shoot those down. With all this in mind, it seems probable more than possible that some sort of mix of malfunctioning gear and/or a lack of networking, paired with glaring human factors, lowered the crew’s ability to distinguish friend or foe and make quality decisions under complex circumstance to the point of catastrophe. Sad Precedent The depressing truth is that these types of incidents are hardly unheard of. The shooting down of MH17 over Eastern Ukraine surely comes to mind first. There are some similarities with this incident and the SA-11 Buk system used in that engagement is more akin to the SA-15 Tor-M1 than not. If the battery was operating independently of a greater integrated air defense network, that would also be another parallel. But it isn’t just about America’s adversaries possessing potentially lower quality of gear, less well-trained personnel, and making blundering decisions under stress. Case in point, the American guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes infamously shot down Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988 during another highly tense situation. The ship was equipped with the most modern air defense system the world had ever seen and was staffed with a crew made up of sailors from world’s preeminent Navy, yet still, a confluence of stress, timing, and confusion, often referred to as the “fog of war,” resulted in the deaths of 290 innocent people. During a running gunfight with Iranian fast boats, the cruiser’s crew mistook the Airbus A300, which was squawking properly and had been in English communication with air traffic control as normal just seconds before being shot down during its short flight between Bandar Abas and Dubai, for an Iranian F-14 Tomcat on a bombing run. The Airbus’s low altitude route, maxing out at around 14,000 feet, for the short flight, was a contributing factor to the confusion, although the Airbus was not even descending at the time the SM-2 missile struck it. Bandar Abas was also a major operating point for Iranian Tomcats. There were a number of other contributing factors, as well, which you can read all about here , including communications issues and unanswered warnings from the Vincennes . Regardless, it was a terrible thing that neither side wanted to see happen. The loss of the Airbus A300 is still very visceral to the Iranian people and the regime uses the tragedy to stir-up anti-American sentiment to this very day. But above all else, the incident should work as a reminder that it isn’t always just failed or dated technology and badly trained personnel that can cause such a disaster. A series of unfortunate factors and missed opportunities for recognizing major issues can truly create a deadly cocktail that gets stirred up and poured too fast to realize what was even drank. Beyond this especially relevant example, there are plenty of friendly fire incidents by various militaries, including the U.S. and its allies, where even the most advanced radar systems and military aircraft equipped with specialized identification friend or foe (IFF) gear couldn’t stave off tragedy. Whether it be the loss of a RAF Tornado GR.4 to an American Patriot battery during the opening of Operation Iraqi Freedom or the shooting down of an Indian Mi-17 helicopter by an Indian surface-to-air missile during last year’s flare-up of aerial violence with Pakistan near Kashmir, there is a well-documented and continuing history of these events. Harsh Reality If indeed Iran shot the plane down as it is increasingly believed, they are directly responsible for such a terrible miscalculation, but it didn’t happen on some random Tuesday morning. It happened during the highest point of tension between the two countries in decades. It may be quite inconvenient for some people to come to terms with the fact that this occurred, at least indirectly, because the U.S. and Iran cannot figure out a way forward that doesn’t include being on the brink of war with one another periodically. The fact is that when the geopolitical situation is allowed to degrade to such a perilous point, the chances that major mistakes may occur skyrockets. And those mistakes can have huge impacts on countries and people who are not even involved with the ongoing crisis. The whole thing should serve as a powerful warning of the cost brinksmanship and how even limited conflict can spill into unintended areas, resulting in highly unfortunate consequences. Thankfully no Americans died in the ballistic missile attacks on U.S. occupied facilities in Iraq on January 8th, 2020, and neither did any Iranian soldiers. But 176 people that had nothing to do with any of it may very well have died as a result of those actions and the situation that proceeded it. It just takes the wrong people in a position of great responsibility at the wrong time to transform the great potential for a horrific loss into reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 20, 2021",Air Force Displays Model Of Exotic And Potentially Revolutionary Hybrid Electric Airlifter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory recently displayed a model of what it is calling a Distributed Propulsion Concept Vehicle that uses gas turbines to produce power for arrays of electric fans. The Air Force has said that this experimental aircraft design, which offers benefits in terms of added redundancy performance, fuel economy, and more, could be a stepping stone toward a “vision vehicle” for a new short takeoff capable cargo aircraft. This is something the service has been chasing in various forms for nearly four decades. The War Zone has previously chronicled those developments, which also involve stealthy and vertical takeoff and landing capable designs, in great detail in a two-part feature that you can find here and here . Guy Norris, Aviation Week ‘s Senior Editor, spotted the model at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’s SciTech Forum and Exposition, which opened in Orlando, Florida on Jan. 6, 2020. He was nice enough to share his pictures of it on the show floor with us here at The War Zone . The model that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) put on display is a tailless design with prominent canards over the cockpit. The fuselage is also chined, which points to a stealthy design goal. The main wings feature broad central “boxes” with sponsons in between them and more slender, swept outer sections. The two wing boxes on either side of the fuselage each contain seven separate sections where electric-powered fans would go. Courtesy Guy Norris Courtesy Guy Norris Courtesy Guy Norris The exact origins of the design that AFRL’s model depicts are unclear, but it does bear some resemblance to the XV-24A LightningStrike , an unmanned, vertical takeoff and landing capable concept that Aurora Flight Sciences, now part of Boeing, together with Rolls-Royce and Honeywell, developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Vertical Take-Off and Landing Experimental Aircraft program, or VTOL X-plane. In addition to arrays of fans built into the main wing, the LightningStrike concept also had additional fans mounted on canards on either side of the forward fuselage. Both the main wings and canards could rotate upward for vertical takeoff and landing. However, the XV-24A featured a hybrid, distributed propulsion concept with a gas turbine in the center of the fuselage with the primary job of driving the electric generator necessary to provide power for the electric fans, rather than generating thrust. DARPA canceled the XV-24A program in 2018, ostensibly due to a lack of interest from both the U.S. military and commercial companies, as well as reports of difficulties in the development of its generator. AFRL’s model shows a different configuration that is extremely similar, if not identical, to those found on designs from one company, in particular, Empirical Systems Aerospace, Inc., or ESAero . Since its founding in 2003, this company has been promoting various concepts that use gas turbines mounted somewhere along the outer wing to drive the electric generators to power the fans. The sponsons on AFRL’s model are similar to ESAero designs using turboshaft engines to drive the generators, though other concepts the company has developed have used piston engines , as well. Other ESAero concepts featuring fan array and main wing configurations similar to AFRL’s model., ESAero A schematic of a typical distributed propulsion configuration., ESAero ESAero has promoted the basic concept as offering the potential for significant improvements in both performance and fuel efficiency , as well as reducing pollution and simply being quieter. The configuration also offers important redundancy benefits given the large arrays of smaller fans, rather than a small number of traditional engines. Since at least 2016, the company has also been working on an all-electric experimental design for NASA, the X-57A Maxwell , which is a highly modified Tecnam P2006T light aircraft. The X-57A project is an outgrowth of NASA’s Leading Edge Asynchronous Propeller Technology (LEAPTech), which began in 2014. The planned final configuration for the X-57A will feature six small fans on each wing, as well as a pair of larger electrically-driven propellers, one on each wingtip. The smaller fans will help provide sufficient lift during takeoff and landing, but will be shut off during the main phase of flight, with the two wingtip propellers alone providing forward thrust. NASA hopes to the X-57A will eventually offer “a 500 percent increase in high-speed cruise efficiency, zero in-flight carbon emissions, and flight that is much quieter for the community on the ground.” That the Air Force is also exploring distributed propulsion concepts that mirror the ones that ESAero has been working on over the years is hardly surprising. The company has already done extensive research and development work on its distributed propulsion concepts under contract to NASA and AFRL, including as part of the latter’s Revolutionary Configurations for Energy Efficiency (RCEE) program. It’s also interesting to note that the firm has also done separate work on hybrid wing body concepts for Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design division. Skunk Works has proposed hybrid wing body designs to the Air Force as the basis for future advanced transport aircraft as part of various programs, such as Speed Agile , which you can read about in much greater depth in this past War Zone story . It’s not clear whether the model that AFRL displayed reflect the proposed short takeoff and landing capable “vision vehicle” in any way. There are markings painted on top of the central wing boxes that could indicate doors for ducting for a blown air system that could provide important extra lift. There are also indicators of large flaps on both the leading and trailing edges of the wing boxes that could generate even more lift. A diagram showing the blown air system on the ShinMaywa US-2 flying boat, which has extremely good short takeoff and landing performance. AFRL’s “vision vehicle” based on the model it displayed could use a similar combination of blown flaps and air forced over the wings and other surfaces from other sources to provide similar additional lift., ShinMaywa A high-efficiency tactical cargo plane that has greater range and increased fuel efficiency over comparable existing aircraft would already be appealing to the U.S. Air Force, which has a great interest in reducing logistical demands for airlift and other air operations. Such a design could be extremely valuable in future expeditionary and distributed operations, especially in areas where access to established airfields with robust infrastructure may be limited due to enemy strikes or other factors. A design that adds impressive short-field performance would open up the potential for operations in even more austere locations. The reduction in acoustic signature that the distributed propulsion concept offers could be beneficial to reducing the vulnerability of the aircraft. Aviation Week ‘s Guy Norris is set to publish a piece on AFRL’s follow “vision vehicle” concept in the near future, which will offer additional insight into the Air Force’s distributed propulsion plans.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 27, 2019",Surveillance Plane Joins Intensifying Hunt For Mystery Drones Over Colorado And Nebraska (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone was among the first to report back in late December 2019 that eyewitnesses throughout northeastern Colorado had begun seeing formations of large drones flying at night in complex grid-like patterns over rural areas and farmland. Since then, the sightings have multiplied and the drones have begun appearing in neighboring Nebraska, as well. What was at first a curiosity has become a concern, especially after local law enforcement agencies, the FAA, DEA, the U.S. Army, and the Air Force all stated to have no knowledge of the drone activity. It seemed that something far more covert or possibly illegal might be occurring. Just this week, the FAA officially launched a task force to identify the operator of the drones, which includes Colorado’s most sophisticated surveillance aircraft, and has begun searching for some sort of command truck or van that may be controlling or at least monitoring the mysterious nighttime drone activity. Initial eyewitness reports from just before Christmas last year suggested that the drones appeared to be roughly between three and six feet across and featured bright and strobing lights in various colors. Estimates suggested the drones flew only a few hundred feet in the air at speeds between 30 and 40 miles per hour. Some witnesses even claimed that some of the drones appeared to hover in place for long periods of time. Wyatt Harman, a witness who chased the aircraft after they flew over his home east of Denver, told NBC ’s “Today “ news program on New Year’s Eve 2019 that the drones were “unnerving” in their flight capabilities. “They can sit there and hover,” Harman said. “They can descend very fast. They can take off very fast.” Many observers initially speculated that a private company, a branch of the military, or a governmental organization was testing some type of broad-area surveillance or navigation system, although there was nothing to actually suggest that an individual or small group couldn’t possess the same capability with off-the-shelf commercial drone technology and some substantial funds. The drones have been seen in Northeast Colorado, Southwest Nebraska, and as far east as Hall and Saunders counties in Nebraska., Wikimedia Commons The drone sightings have continued and grown remarkably throughout Colorado and Nebraska, recently being spotted in several more counties in southwest Nebraska and on the outskirts of the metro Denver area . There is no mystery as to if the drones are actually being seen. Law enforcement and other officials have seen them and, apparently, they are almost laughably easy to see yourself. Case in point: on Jan. 7, local NBC affiliate WOWT in Omaha went out looking for the drones and readily caught them – or some sort of plane they misconstrued as one – on camera outside Mead, Nebraska, flying low with their engines easily heard. Make sure to watch WOWT’s video report by clicking here . Onlookers on the ground also told WOWT that when they pulled out their cameras to photograph the aircraft, the drones turned off their lights and maneuvered away from onlookers below. Many witnesses have described the craft as shaped somewhat like a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, while others like Carlton Britton, Sheriff of Sedgwick County in Kansas, bizarrely described one of the drones as a rectangular “ black box ” with lights on its sides. A still of one of the drones captured by Omaha NBC affiliate WOWT, brightness and contrast adjusted., WOWT It’s worth noting that individual witness accounts of objects flying at night are highly unreliable and are often exaggerated. They must be taken with a grain of salt. But the sheer geographical size of this phenomenon and the large number of witnesses, including police, make the fact that it is happening undeniable. In addition, there has been no shortage of expert theories as to what is going on here, ranging from the absurd to not so absurd, but none of them are without major controversy. Both Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, and the state’s Governor Jared Polis have publicly called for an investigation into the sightings. The drone mystery has gotten serious enough that the FAA and sheriffs from several Colorado counties recently held a closed-door meeting to discuss the incidents with other government officials and form a task force to begin formally investigating these unexplained aircraft. While press were banned from the meeting, Los Angeles-based FAA spokesperson Ian Gregor afterward told reporters that the meeting was simply to share information and form a plan to move forward with the investigation: Today’s meeting was really for a wide variety of agencies to get together to share information and to discuss how we can best collaborate going forward to try and find out exactly what’s going on. We have contacted drone companies, we’ve contact UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] test flights. We’ve contacted companies that have waivers in the area to try to see if they could be the source of these reports, and so far we’ve been unable to determine that any of those entities [were] the source of those reported flights. Both the Nebraska State Patrol and the Phillips County Sheriff’s Office in Colorado have issued statements following the meeting assuring the public that the task force will involve local, regional, and national partners including the FAA and FBI in order to monitor the drones and identify who may be flying them. The Phillips County Sheriff’s Office statement mentions specifically that law enforcement agencies are now looking for a “command vehicle” in the form of a “closed box trailer with antennas” or a large van. They have asked for people to report any strange vehicle with this description that is unfamiliar to the area. This may exist, but by our previous analysis, the drones are more likely flown autonomously along a pre-planned route via autopilot, not by a man-in-the-loop control arrangement. In addition, the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control has supplied at least one of its two multi-mission Pilatus PC-12 turboprops , which operate out of Centennial, Colorado. The MMA, or multi-mission aircraft , are equipped with Wescam MX-15HDi sensor balls featuring three separate cameras, including infrared and electro-optical types with wide and narrow fields of views. The MX-15HDi is sensitive enough to detect a small campfire from 28,000 feet and even though they wouldn’t have a very hot infrared signature, the MX-15HDi’s medium wavelength infrared sensor could identify a drone type and track one it as it flies low over the ground, especially considering they are lit up, to begin with. It could also allow the PC-12 to spot and follow any potential command vehicles on the ground in the vicinity of the drones – if such a vehicle does indeed exist. In addition to the sensor ball, the plane features onboard broadband internet, enabling real-time data sharing with the Colorado Wildfire Information Management System (CO-WIMS). The plane typically operates around 20,000 feet and has a loiter time of over five hours. The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control’s PC-12 MMA., NWCG.GOV The MMA is used primarily to track and monitor smokey wildfires , but can also serve in search and rescue, wildlife management, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Colorado’s MMA program was stood up on Sept. 1, 2014, and in 2015 the MMAs flew over 380 hours, detected dozens of fires, provided fire intelligence on more than 40 missions, and assisted with seven search and rescue missions. Earlier this year, both aircraft were mobilized to Alaska to provide fire intelligence and support on fires in central Alaska. According to Fox 31 Denver, the plane has already conducted at least one flight in the area in which the drones have been operating. Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control spokesperson Caley Fisher declined to comment on whether or not the MMA was involved in the search for the drones or their owner, however. “We do not discuss the investigative techniques or technology we’re using,” Fisher said. “We are actively monitoring reports of suspicious activity and will take action based on the level of activity and information being gathered.” Fisher also stated that the operation has so far “found no verification of suspicious drones.” A still of one of the drones captured by Omaha NBC affiliate WOWT., WOWT Undisclosed flights by the U.S. military or another government agency are one thing, but unidentified unmanned aircraft flying in complex formations over huge swathes of terrain and operated by unknown parties are quite another. As The War Zone has reported continuously over the years , the weaponization of small drones is becoming one of the most pressing and elusive threats the Pentagon and law enforcement agencies are trying to deal with and they are very late to the game in doing so. We reached out to both the FAA and F.E. Warren Air Force Base, which controls the vast intercontinental ballistic missile fields that surround it and is located near the epicenter of these sightings, for more information. F.E. Warren flat out denied having anything to do with it in any way. They seemed just a puzzled as we were and said they were eagerly awaiting the FAA and local agencies’ investigative findings. They also said they knew of no contractor affiliated with them that would be doing it, either. The FAA was far more nebulous in what became somewhat of a contentious exchange. There has been some debate even among seasoned drone operators over the rules surrounding operations of these drones and if they are indeed breaking the law for a number of potential reasons, but the question of flying at night seems to be the most contentious. After repeated attempts, the FAA would not answer simple questions regarding this issue or clarify the rules for us. It was a strange exchange that seemed to be counterproductive and nonsensical. Some were a bit troubled by our first report on this issue and the concerns we raised regarding the situation. Now that this is very much a real thing and not just people seeing lights in the sky here and there, it seems that the powers that be have finally come to that same conclusion, as well. And that is a very welcome development. The fact that it took weeks even to get an air asset involved is quite strange, but at least that capability is now in play. There are many other counter-unmanned aircraft systems that are passive in nature that could also be beneficial. It seems odd that this budding industry hasn’t been called to assist in the investigation and show off their new hardware in the process. We will continue to monitor the bizarre and still-developing situation out of Colorado in the hopes that this task force will be able to identify the operators of these drones. ​ UPDATED: 5:30PM PST— The Clay County Emergency Management Office in Colorado posted the following message to their Facebook page on January 8, 2020. We don’t know the accuracy of the information, but it paints a good picture of the confusion the drones are causing for some residents of Colorado and Nebraska and the difficult position it puts local law enforcement agencies in: January 8, 2020 Drone action plan for today. Our elected leaders at the county and state level are aware of the drone issue and I saw an article yesterday that shows Senator Deb Fisher has asked FAA directly for an explanation. I know CO elected officials have made the same request. Your local and state officials are as invested in finding who is responsible for these drones as you and I are. CO has excellent video footage of the drones when they were out in CO. We have great data on the drones in our area. I won’t elaborate as I suspect that the company running these are monitoring public discussions on social media. We all want information, but do not be chasing the drones. These drones are doing nothing but flying around. So why the big secret? Why do new stores put up paper in the windows so we can’t see what they are doing inside until the grand opening? They just don’t want us to know and as a drone expert pointed out by rules and regulations related to drone flight, they are not required too. Now, if I was the CEO, seeing the negative impact it is having on a community I would be rethinking that idea as I know for one, that when it comes out who is behind this, I am not going to be involved in their product. It may be the best, but the tactic and position of secrecy they are taking is not helping any of us. Their silence is requiring us, as intelligent human beings, to fill in the void of information with “what if”. That can make us uncomfortable. All of us, including me. Trying to find a solution, an answer. I had someone tell me not my circus, not my monkeys yesterday when I asked for their input. He is not part of our system in Clay County. Fine, his choice. People are all over the map on this. Those working this proactively, have the same lack of information we have and are building leads based on the information law enforcement and emergency managers are documenting. I did step out of my lane today and suggested an investigative tactic that I as your emergency manager would like to see them utilize. I am consulting with many levels on our behalf, sharing our concerns, and working for answers. Next steps: The local, state, and federal task force is working in CO and NE. They are the lead agency on this I investigation and operation. We have been asked at the local level to move past the drones flying in our county, to tangible data. 1. Official observers are out and watching for drones and tracking their activity. We have an identified group working as a network here in Clay County and they are doing a great job. They share what they are seeing with me and we work together for this project. The seeing drones in the air is covered by the observation team. 2. New information came in last night associated with a helicopter landing in Harvard and activity in the Harvard area. No injuries, nothing out of what we have been seeing. a. People did report on FB to me that they saw contrails in the sky behind the drones. b. Flying in multiples close to town was new. c. The helicopter was new and important and was reported. 3. You can call our Dispatch Center with unusual activity associated with the drones. a. Keep in mind, our dispatch center is manned by one staff member. b. When the drones arrived last night, our dispatcher was dealing with multiple calls about the drones, and other regular activity in the county. c. When the helicopter landed, she was dealing with more 911 calls, officers out on contacts, and the drones. d. She had to cook and serve dinner to the prisoners being housed in the CC jail. e. We had a report of a drone go down in southeast Clay County. She had to notify us and several law enforcement officers and myself went to investigate. It was gone before we got there. At that same time a fire outside of a residence in Clay Center came in via 911. CC Fire responded and resolved that issue quickly. At the time this is going on as well officers were out with a male who was armed with a concealed handgun. And one of their radios stopped working and she could not raise him. 4. Our non-emergency line to CC Dispatch is 402-762-3928. a. Call if you see a drone on the ground. b. Call if you see something that I have not talked about on FB the last few days. i. The helicopter is a good example. c. If you get video of the craft, not the flashing lights way up in the sky, but flying low enough that you see the aircraft, shape, color and configuration of it. d. If common sense tells you this is something different and we need to know. 5. After participating in major cases before you follow up on every lead. Unnecessary leads confuse the view of the case and take extra time and staff to try and prove them, to find out they were an errant report. Here is how we can edit ourselves. Using common sense is a good marker. They know we have drones in our county. Do I need to call? Nope! 6. The State Patrol Tweeted out this site that you can go to, so you can file a direct report with them. The issue with that is, once it is with them, they can not share it back to us. If we don’t know locally, we can not add the pieces of the puzzle together to keep you updated on what is occurring. That piece you share with that site, may be the one I am needing to connect it all. I send all your reports to them in my reports. We keep our records of what we do and send them multiple updates daily. I was just notified that the agency who pushed out the web site should not have done that, as we were told yesterday. It is for official use only. My apologies. When I saw it on Twitter and on news stations I figured I had missed a memo. Someone else missed the memo of not sharing it. Meanwhile, the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office posted their own drone warning to Facebook, advising residents not to shoot at the drones and adding that the command vehicle reports are unsubstantiated, adding in a comment that “the vehicle and trailer descriptions are based on pure speculation. It may be accurate; but there is no information, at this time, that supports it.” UPDATED: 1/9/2020 — On Tuesday, January 7, a Flight for Life medical helicopter pilot nearly collided with a suspected drone after flying within 100 feet of an unidentified small aircraft. Pilot Kirk Peebles and his crew were responding to a routine medical call near Fort Morgan, Colorado northeast of Denver when the close call occurred. Peebles told NBC affiliate 9News.com that the drone flyby happened so fast his crew didn’t have time to respond or identify what type of aircraft it was. “A drone just went right under us,” he said. “Probably about 100 feet.” Peebles and his crew fly out of St. Anthony’s Hospital in Lakewood, Colorado. Despite using night vision and flying with a vigilant crew, the drone went entirely undetected until the close call happened. “I’m always on the lookout. That’s the nature of the business and what we do,” said Peebles. “They’re looking for aircraft constantly for me. Things that I might not catch right away.” For a pilot like Peebles who has to respond to medical emergencies quickly and with little warning, these mystery drones pose a serious threat. “They’re not telling anybody who they are, what they’re doing,” said Peebles. “What I care about the most is our survival, our ability to do the mission, and do it quickly and safely.” Following Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ second (D) State of the State address given on January 9, local reporters asked the governor what he thinks the outcome of the drone panic will be. Polis said in light of the near-miss with the Flight of Life helicopter, the drones are no longer simply a “novelty” and now clearly pose a public safety threat: Just today, I talked to our Director of Public Safety to do more state monitoring. We used one of our state planes to do flyovers a couple days ago, looking for heat signatures, we didn’t detect any. We’re going to be doing that again. I was most concerned when I saw an article, I think it was today or yesterday, that there was a near miss from a Flight for Life helicopter and a drone that was operating. This is no longer a novelty. I think we need to figure out what’s going on before any accident occurs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 1, 2020",Watch The Boom On Boeing’s Troubled KC-46 Tanker Nearly Smack An F-15E (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The KC-46 Pegasus tanker program has been a bewildering boondoggle. Now the Air Force says it will be years before it is fully operational as a host of critical design deficiencies continue to plague the program. Testing showed that some of these issues can have adverse impacts on the thirsty aircraft refueling from the KC-46. These include battering the receiving aircraft itself and scraping its skin with the boom. Although we don’t know when the video below was shot or the exact situation surrounding beyond that the aircraft shown is a test F-15E, it depicts a tense incident in which a KC-46 boom appears to slip off the Strike Eagle’s refueling receptacle, with its control surfaces nearly banging into the fighter’s canopy. View this post on Instagram A post shared by KC-135 Boom Operators (@kc135_boomer) At the heart of the KC-46 design are the boom and Remote Vision System. The latter of which has boom operators wearing 3D glasses and sitting in front of screens at stations in the front of the 767 derivative to control refueling operations ( read all about it here ). Both of these key components, the boom and the Remote Vision System, do not meet the USAF’s expectations and are being redesigned. This is occurring as the jets continue to be delivered. The video above may depict one continuing issue the KC-46 has with requiring more force to connect with the receiving aircraft than its predecessors, which can cause impacts of the boom on the receiving aircraft. USAF Flightglobal.com explained the issue as such: Boeing is redesigning the actuator to address hardware specification flaws coming from the service’s initial design requirements. Designing and retrofitting the aircraft will likely cost more than $300 million, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in June 2019. Programme officials told GAO that developing a solution, and receiving Federal Aviation Administration certification, would likely take three to four years. The boom’s issues became apparent during developmental flight testing, when pilots of lighter receiver aircraft – such as Fairchild Republic A-10s and Lockheed Martin F-16s – reported they needed more force to connect and disconnect their aircraft from the boom, as compared to older tankers, like the KC-135 and KC-10, says GAO. The additional force required can cause the receiving aircraft to suddenly lunge and collide with the boom, damaging the aircraft’s glass cockpit canopy or tail. It can also damage the boom. You can read more about the KC-46 boom’s woes with ‘thrust resistance’ in this past piece of ours . At the same time, it’s important to remember that aerial refueling is hard and incidents happen regardless of the platform , especially in testing when flaws are usually identified. The fact some of those highly critical flaws are not remediated even as the KC-46s are being delivered, and won’t be in the near future, is the major issue. On a positive note, the KC-46 can begin carrying passengers and cargo again. These important missions were restricted for months due to the discovery that the floor latches that keep cargo locked in place were inadvertently releasing. A major shift in cargo could send the plane careening out of control or it could injure or kill passengers flying in the cabin. A fix is now being retrofitted to the budding fleet that the Air Force is satisfied with. Also, on December 22nd, 2019, a KC-46 made the type’s first around the world flight. All this is well and good, but the jet’s primary mission is refueling a wide array of aircraft in flight. As it sits now, its ability to do that to the standards the USAF requires is still very much a work in progress. UPDATE: Boeing has informed us that the boom did not make contact with the canopy of the Strike Eagle and they gave us some additional info about the test depicted in the video clip: No part of the air refueling boom ever hit the fighter’s canopy, nor did it “slip off.” The operator views the image in 3-D. The video in your article is 2-D, so there is no depth to the image. The KC-46 boom operator initiated a disconnect and the boom operator flew the boom clear of the receiver with a minor contact in the area around the receptacle. This happened during a procedure called “Contact/Disconnect Testing.” Incidental contacts that occur during testing are not unusual, as seen on disconnect here. This is why we test. This event had no effect on the certification of the KC-46A and F-15E. This was simply a valuable test condition that helped determine the compatibility of the tanker/receiver pair. F-15E was cleared as a receiver on October 30th, 2019. Another source noted that this was a corner of the envelope point that is unlikely to occur in the future during normal operations. The test is meant to go beyond the normal operational limits of the refueling hardware and sometimes unique occurrences are found, as is shown in the video.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery that The War Zone has obtained from Planet Labs shows damage to various hangars and other structures at Al Assad Air Base in Iraq following Iran’s unprecedented missile strikes aimed at U.S. forces in that country overnight. U.S. and Iraqi officials have said that the strikes, which also involved missiles fired toward Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, caused minimal damage and no U.S., coalition, or Iraqi casualties. Approximately 5,000 U.S. personnel are situated in Iraq, with roughly 1,500 of them situated at Al Assad, which supports a wide range of fixed-wing, helicopter, and drones operations, among other activities. Various other members of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS are also present at the base, as well as Iraqi forces. The image of the base from January 8th, 2020. We will be posting it in higher resolution and in smaller segments at the bottom of this post for you to look at shortly., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Imagery of Al Asad taken on the morning of January 8th, 2020, showing at least four primary impact areas., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION This imagery stands in a certain contrast to reports earlier today from U.S. military officials indicating that they thought Iran had deliberately targeted certain areas of Al Assad with an eye toward avoiding casualties. Even if the Iranians had intended to cause limited damage and no loss of life, firing ballistic missiles at that base, as well as Erbil, would have still presented inherent risks that the regime in Tehran was clearly willing to accept. Beyond that, Iran choosing targets based on the likelihood that the strikes would cause minimal casualties or to achieve other specific effects would indicate that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has confidence in the performance and accuracy of its extensive missile arsenal. Judging by the imagery, they have good reason to be. We already knew the latest short-range ballistic missile systems from Iran were quite accurate, but the pinpoint targeting of key aviation facilities is very telling. At the same time, it was stated that 14 weapons were fired at Al Assad, three of which failed, but we still only have spotted less than half the impact areas at this time. It is also possible that Iran assigned multiple missiles at each target for better effects and redundancy. It remains unknown what types of missiles Iran employed, but Iraqi authorities have recovered parts of what strongly appear to be Qiam short-range ballistic missiles. There are still reports that variants or derivatives of the Fateh-110 series were employed, as well. It remains unclear how many missiles Iran fired in total, as well. Earlier today, U.S. officials had increased their estimate of the total number of missiles from 15 to 16, four of which apparently failed in flight. One of the weapons struck Erbil, while the remaining missiles reportedly hit Al Asad. Iraqi news reports say that Iran may have fired as many as 22 missiles. It is also worth noting that the top stage of the Qiam missile, housing the warhead, separates from the rest of the missile in flight, meaning that pictures of “crashed” lower stages may not necessarily mean those weapons failed. The U.S. government has also now confirmed that it did not shoot down any incoming missiles. It did not, at least at the time of the strikes, have any ballistic missile defenses in place in Iraq ostensibly because its forces were postured to fight ISIS, which does not have these weapons. This, however, seems curious given numerous reports in the past six months or so about intelligence indicating that Iran or its regional proxies might be moving missiles into position to attack U.S. interests in the Middle East or those its allies and partners. A breakdown of the high-resolution image of Al Assad taken on January 8th, 2020 will be posted below shortly and we will add more analysis about the strikes after we look more closely at the imagery. UPDATE: 10:30AM PST— We found another impact site. Dead on hit of another soft aircraft shelter on the CV-22 flightline. Note, both hangars to each side are also damaged. There will be aircraft damaged and lost from this attack. PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It is only very slightly degraded due to its conversion from TIFF to JPEG. Skysat is 0.8 meter resolution although atmospherics have an impact the quality of the image overall. IMAGE LINKED HERE. UPDATE: 2:50PM PST— U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that, in his personal opinion, Iran was aiming to kill American personnel and destroy U.S. equipment with its missiles strikes on Al Asad and Erbil. This contradicts earlier reports that U.S. officials believed that the Iranian regime had deliberately chosen targets to try to avoid causing casualties. Milley also credited unspecified “defensive countermeasures” and “defensive techniques” as helping prevent casualties, in addition to early warning capabilities and timely intelligence. He did not elaborate, but it is possible that he was simply referring to shelters where personnel took cover during the strikes. Despite some reports , there are no indications that the United States had any air or missile defenses, such as Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, at Al Asad, in particular, with which they could have tried to shoot down the incoming missiles. Fox News had already reported that this was the case and further analysis of the satellite image The War Zone obtained does not show any evidence of Patriots in place. It does remain curious that this was the case given multiple reports about U.S. intelligence indicating the potential for Iran or its regional proxies to launch attacks with unspecified missiles last year. It is also worth noting that after the unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on Saudi Arabia in September 2019, which the U.S. government blames on Iran directly, the U.S. Army deployed Patriot missile systems to that country , where they remain in place. Regardless, it is worth remembering that, even if Patriots or some other ballistic missile defense system , had been in place at the time, it is very unlikely that they would have been able to successfully intercept all of the incoming Iranian weapons. This is something The War Zone has discussed in general terms in the past.

One such evolution is putting the aircraft through a battery of tests inside the very science fiction-looking anechoic chamber. Anechoic chambers are built to deaden any ambient electromagnetic radiation so that interactions among the aircraft’s electronic systems can be closely evaluated and problems can be identified and remediated. In one of the two past stories we have written on anechoic chambers, the following description of the role of the triangular structures that line these facilities’ interiors is given: “The chamber is filled with polyurethane and polyethylene pyramids, radar absorbing material designed to stop reflections of electromagnetic waves. The size of the pyramids, which are painted dark blue or black, varies depending on the particular frequency and test procedure being conducted. Aircraft systems can be tested and verified that they work properly prior to actual flight test.” The HH-60W’s anechoic chamber testing occurred over seven weeks at Eglin Air Force Base’s Joint Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (J-PRIMES) hangar.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 8, 2020",Iran Strikes Back: Missiles Rain Down On American Forces In Iraq (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but Iran has launched a missile attack against U.S. forces in Iraq, including Al Asad Air Base, in retaliation for the American drone strike t hat killed Qasem Soleimani , a top Iranian commander, last week. A major rocket barrage on Al Asad, which sits around 115 miles west of Baghdad, may have also preceded the strikes. U.S. President Donald Trump has already threatened a major response , including potential strikes on cultural sites, against Iran in the event of any such attack. Al Asad, also known as Ain Assad, hosts a large number of U.S. military personnel, as well as significant numbers of fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and drones. It is also the base that U.S. President Donald Trump traveled to in 2018 in his first visit to Iraq. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, as well as Iran itself and its other regional proxies, had vowed to retaliate against U.S. forces throughout the Middle East over the death of Soleimani, who had been head of the Quds Force, last week. The Quds Force is responsible for providing aid and assistance to foreign terrorist and militant groups and otherwise conducting covert activities outside of Iran. The exact scale and scope of the attack is unclear, but Iranian state media has confirmed that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, of which the Quds Force is a part, carried out the attack. Reports say that as many as 10 ballistic missiles may have been launched toward Al Asad. There are also reports that additional missiles were fired toward Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region. U.S. defenses there may have shot at least one of these down. The U.S. military, as well as the U.S. State Department, makes heavy use of portions of the airport in Erbil and the U.S. consulate there is a major diplomatic facility. There are additional reports of additional missile strikes on other targets in the country, as well. Before the missile attacks, there were also reports of more than 30 rockets falling in and around Al Asad, but it’s unclear if this refers to the Iranian missiles. There were reportedly three waves attacks on the base in total. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have been firing rockets at bases housing U.S. forces on a semi-regular basis for years now. An attack involving 30 or more rockets would be in line with an earlier attack on K-1 base in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk in December 2019. That attack killed a U.S. military contractor and reportedly led to the U.S. government’s decision to kill Soleimani. All of these incidents confusingly follow apparently false reports of attacks on the consulate in Erbil and Taji Air Base to the north of Baghdad. U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly monitoring the situation with his national security team. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had just said earlier in the day that “I think we should expect that they [Iran] will retaliate in some way, shape or form” in the near term. At noted, Trump has already threatened to respond to any such Iranian attack. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 7:30pm EST The Office of the Secretary of Defense has issued an initial statement saying that Iran fired “more than dozen ballistic missiles” at “at least two Iraqi military bases housing U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil.” Additional footage reportedly showing the launch of the missiles in Iran, as well as impacting in Iraq, continue to emerge on social media. Iran reportedly dubbed the strikes Operation Martyr Soleimani. The codename to launch the operation was reportedly Ya Zahraa, or “O! Zahraa,” a reference to Fatimah al-Zahra, the youngest daughter of the Prophet Mohammed and a particularly significant figure in Shia Islam. UPDATE: 7:50pm EST Iranian media is reporting that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has fired another wave of missiles. This report coincides with news of possible strikes on Taji Air Base north of Baghdad. There is still no word of any U.S. casualties, but there are reports emerging of Iraqi casualties. Iranian media has also reported that the missiles the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has employed are Fateh-110 short-range ballistic missiles, which have a maximum range of around 186 miles (300 kilometers). Iran has notably fired Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles, a derivative of the Fateh-110, at targets in Syria on at least two occasions, once in 2017 and again in 2018 . The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has also issued its own statement directed to the American people urging them to “call the American troops to go back home” so as to “not let them to endanger the American troops’ lives by participating in warmongering policies.” UPDATE: 8:05pm EST VOA’s Carla Babb has now retracted her initial report that Taji Air Base was struck. This could indicate that Iranian media reports of an additional wave of missiles was simply a reference to one of the initially reported waves. Pictures have also emerged reportedly showing the remains of one of the missiles near Erbil. This could be the one that reportedly shot down there earlier. It may have also simply malfunctioned. Experts also say that the missile in question appears to be a liquid-fuel type, rather than a solid-fuel one, such as the Fateh-110. One possible option would be the Qiam short-range ballistic missile, which Iran has also used in past strikes on Syria . There are also now unconfirmed reports that U.S. combat jets have departed Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and that the Iranian Air Force has scrambled aircraft. American aircraft appear to be patrolling across Iraq, while Iranian jets are remaining in their own airspace, though. UPDATE: 8:35pm EST There continue to be no reports of U.S. casualties from the Iranian strikes, but casualty and damage assessments are still underway. Whether or not an American were injured or killed in the missile barrage will be a major factor in how and when the U.S. decides to respond. At the same time, Iran has threatened additional retaliation, including via regional proxies, against both Israel and the United Arab Emirates, if the United States conducts its own strikes. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has now issued a prohibition on all U.S. commercial and civilian air operations over Iraq, Iran, the Persian Gulf, and the Gulf of Oman due to the heightened risks of military activity and potential for misidentification. UPDATE: 9:15pm EST U.S. Central Command now says that Iran fired a total of 15 missiles, four of which failed in flight. Of the remaining 11, 10 struck Al Asad and one hit Erbil. UPDATE: 9:45pm EST Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has issued a statement justifying the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq as “proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN [United Nations] Charter.” Article 51 details the inherent right of all nations to individual and collective self-defense. Zarif also said that Iran does not seek further escalation, but pledged to “defend ourselves against any aggression.” Separately, at an off-the-record background briefing following the missile strikes, the Department of Defense would not confirm what types of missile Iran or a number of other details about the incident. A number of additional videos have also now emerged of the rockets hitting Al Asad. UPDATE: 9:50pm EST President Donald Trump has now sent out a Tweet regarding the strikes, confirming that there are still no known U.S. casualties at present. He also said he plans to make a full statement tomorrow morning. UPDATE: 10:35pm EST CNN is now reporting that there were no Iraqi casualties in the end. This could be a major factor in how the Iraqi government also chooses to respond to this situation. Unless officials in Baghdad agreed to the Iranian strikes, the missiles were technically directed at Iraqi bases and the strikes were in violation of Iraq’s sovereignty. There are also unconfirmed reports that a Boeing 737 with 180 people aboard, possibly belonging to Ukranian International Airlines, has crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s airport. Iranian media is reporting that the plane suffered an unspecified technical issue. There was also a magnitude 4.9 earthquake in Iran’s Bushehr province relatively close to the country’s Bushehr nuclear power plant, but all indications point to a natural event. Another earthquake occurred in the same general area last month. UPDATE: 11:45pm EST Pictures from the crash site of Ukranian International Airlines flight PS752 are now available. Boeing has issued a statement saying that it is aware of the incident and is seeking additional information. UPDATE: 12:36pm EST Something to remember is that there is a tremendous amount of intelligence data to analyze from America’s space-based early warning network of infrared sensing satellites alone. Where the launches emanated from and where the missiles impacted, even the ones that missed, would have been recorded. The system can detect smaller infrared events as well and its data that could be used to help confirm if the Ukrainian airliner was indeed shot down. This same network, which is about to get even more capable , would have given near-instant warning that a launch was underway, which in turn gave American and allied troops time to take cover and prepare for the incoming bombardment. You can read all about this system in this past piece of ours. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 2:01pm EST An official line out of Iran seems to be emerging that claims 80 were killed in their ballistic missile barrage. The quote from Al Jazeera reads : Iranian state television claimed that at least 80 “American terrorists” were killed in attacks involving 15 missiles Tehran launched on US targets in Iraq, adding that none of the missiles were intercepted. The claim could not be independently verified and the state television did not provide evidence of how it obtained that information. Citing a senior Revolutionary Guards Corps source, the state television also said Iran had 100 other targets in the region in its sights if Washington took any retaliatory measures. It also said US helicopters and military equipment were “severely damaged”. We also have a bit on the breakdown of passengers aboard the doomed 737: And a better picture of one of the missiles: UPDATE: 3AM EST Iraqi security forces say nobody died in the ballistic missile barrage and the number of weapons was 24: Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Embassy in Iran sure seems quick to rule out a shoot down.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The airbase on Diego Garcia, part of America’s sprawling military outpost in British Indian Ocean Territory , was once a bustling hub of bomber and tanker activity during the years that followed the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Unbelievably, for years the U.S. the Air Force flew thousands of sorties from the remote locale some located 2,000 miles from Afghanistan and 3,000 miles from Iraq in what had to of been one of the most boneheadedly inefficient air combat operations of all time. Eventually, they realized basing these aircraft in the Persian Gulf, far closer to the action, would provide way more persistent combat capabilities, save lakes of jet fuel, and preserve precious flight time on America’s aging bomber fleet. Now, after its aprons stood largely empty aside from the regular logistical and sporadic global airpower flights, American bombers are heading back to the atoll, and for good reason—it’s out of reach of Iranian ballistic missiles. The move comes as part of the continued build-up of U.S. forces in the Middle East and increasingly dire rhetoric between Washington D.C. and Tehran following the deadly strike on Iran’s Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani last week. Here’s the reality folks: Iran has throngs of ballistic missiles, many of which are extremely hard to target as they are road-mobile or hidden literally inside highly fortified mountain fortresses . In fact, they can even be launched from these subterranean strongholds. If a major war erupted between Iran and the U.S., and/or its Sunni Arab allies, within minutes, ballistic missiles will rain down on critical bases throughout the regions and especially on airfields. The approach to Diego Garcia’s strategic runway. , Via Commondreams.org Yes, there are some missile defense capabilities in place in the region, and more are coming in the future, but none have anywhere near the ability to repulse the varied and plentiful barrages Iran can put up on relatively short notice. The idea that this isn’t the case is utter fiction. Add in wave upon wave of cruise missiles and suicide drones , and you get the picture. Huge fixed bases are very vulnerable to Tehran’s military capabilities, but only out to a certain distance from Iranian borders. The graphic below is from the Pentagon’s latest Missile Defense Review. Note, Diego Garcia is outside the reach of even Iran’s longest-range missiles. No other U.S. base setup to sustain bomber operations is closer to Iran than Diego Garcia. DoD With that in mind, positioning all your regional airpower at vulnerable bases and aircraft carriers that are well within the reach of Iran’s ballistic and cruise missiles is anything but wise. So, it seems, the Pentagon leveraged Diego Garcia once again to provide not just a ready force of bombers that can launch dozens of stealthy cruise missiles at Iran’s most heavily defended targets and air defenses if called upon, but also one that can do so if Iran neuters American airpower in the Persian Gulf region, even if just temporarily, due to a missile onslaught. Such an Iranian offensive could come after a conflict kicks off or as a first strike. It wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t mention that some B-52Hs can also carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . It really isn’t relevant to the tactical picture when it comes to Iran, but it is to the strategic one. It is a glaring reminder to Tehran that the U.S. could do horrific amounts of damage with a single cruise missile volley if it wanted. It is well assumed that Diego Garcia is configured to handle nuclear weapons, unlike the Persian Gulf bases. B-1Bs launch from Diego Garcia during the early years of the Global War On Terror., USAF/Getty Images The Indian Ocean base is also one of just a handful of places on earth that is equipped for sustained B-2 Spirit operations. It has a quartet of large climate-controlled clamshell hangars known as B-2 Shelter Systems (BS22s) to accommodate the stealth bombers. Sustained operations out of Diego Garcia would be necessary if a major conflict with Iran broke out, even just for one significant reason. A 2006 satellite image showing B-52s and KC-135s on the ramp at Diego Garcia. A similar scene is about to occur with six B-52 bombers arriving there in the coming days. Note the B-2’s BS22s., Google Earth While the B-52s can do incredible damage even from standoff distances, during a conflict with Iran the B-2 will be specifically used to drop GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on Iran’s deeply buried and highly fortified mountain missile complexes, command and control sites, and those used to support its nuclear program, like Fordow . The 30,000lb weapon, which the B-2 can carry two of, was specially designed and continues to be upgraded for this exact task and with Iran in mind. That reality has even been used as a propaganda tool by the Pentagon. It allows for the destruction of very deeply buried targets without the use of nuclear warheads. In other words, no other munition, aside from a penetrating nuclear weapon, can destroy those sites. You MOP it, nuke it, or take it in a ground assault. B-2 dropping a MOP. , USAF There have been no reports of B-2s being forward deployed just yet and we may never get an official acknowledgment of such a move like we did with the B-52s. But if war were to break out, the B-2s would very likely use Diego Garcia at least as a forward-arming, refueling, and maintenance point. Of course, the airfield is just one of the island outpost’s many features. Its lagoon is used to host one of two of Military Sealift Command’s Prepositioning Ship Squadrons. A small armada of cargo vessels sits idle in the lagoon, loaded with munitions and equipment, ready to respond to a crisis on short notice. The island also supports space operations and other sensitive missions. It was widely rumored to be a black site that worked as part of the CIA’s rendition program during the early Global War On Terror years, as well. But the utility that its big airstrip located in the center of the Indian Ocean, with the Middle East and Africa to its north and west, and Asia to its east, remains its most high-profile and critical capability. The fact that six B-52Hs are headed there during the worst crisis with Iran in half a century is another reminder of that fact.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid confusion and uncertainty about the future of the U.S. military’s presence in Iraq, Russia has unsurprisingly swooped in to re-up its offer to sell the country S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems, as well as other air defense weapons. The U.S. government’s recent decision to kill Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian commander responsible for overseeing assistance to terrorist and militant groups overseas, has raised the potential for the Iraqi government to expel American forces, which would open up a vacuum that Russia and others are already looking to fill. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported this week that the Kremlin had offered S-400s to Iraq to “ensure the country’s sovereignty and reliable protection of airspace.” That phrasing is an obvious reference to the U.S. drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, which Iraq’s Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi and other senior officials have since decried as a violation of the country’s sovereignty. “Iraq is a partner of Russia in the field of military-technical cooperation,” Igor Korotchenko, a member of the Russian Defence Ministry’s public council and Russian media personality who’s regular style of dress has earned him the nickname “ The Terminator ,” told RIA Novosti . “The Russian Federation can supply the necessary funds to ensure the sovereignty of the country and reliable protection of airspace, including the supply of S-400 missiles and other components of the air defense system, such as Buk-M3, Tor-M2 and so on.” Iraq has been in on-again-off-again negotiations with Russia over a purchase of S-400 systems since at least February 2018 . In May 2019, Iraqi Ambassador to Russia Haidar Mansour Hadi implied to state-run media outlet TASS that an order for the air defense systems with close to being formalized. Four months later, he walked those comments back, saying the deal was “not on the table yet,” according to Iraqi Kurdish outlet Rudaw . The Buk-M3 is a medium-range surface-to-air missile system, while the Tor-M2 is a short-to-medium range surface-to-air missile system. Both systems are road-mobile making them elusive when it comes to targeting. Iraq already operates Russian-made truck-mounted Pantsir-S1s , air defense systems that feature both short-range surface-to-air missiles and 30mm automatic cannons. A Buk-M3., Vitaly Kuzmin A Tor-M2., Vitaly Kuzmin Whether or not Iraq is any more interested in the S-400s, or other Russian air defense systems, now than it was last year remains to be seen. It’s also worth noting that the Iraqi military has already acquired various other Russian-made combat aircraft , helicopters , armored vehicles , infantry weapons, and other military hardware over the years, as well. Iraqi authorities have purchased various systems from China , the Czech Republic , and South Korea , among others, too. However, Russia’s latest offer comes at a time of particular crisis between Iraq and its principal source of military assistance, the United States. Though there are real questions about the legality of the vote, Shia Iraqi lawmakers, many of whom are publicly supportive of the country’s close relationship with Iran, forced a resolution through the country’s parliament this week calling for American forces to leave the country in response to the strike that killed Soleimani. Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi, whose own authority is in question given his official resignation and current status as caretaker head of state, subsequently delivered this request to the U.S. government. Yesterday, in a series of events that are still not fully clear, U.S. military officials in Iraq sent a memorandum that appeared to indicate American forces would begin withdrawing in the coming days and weeks. The Pentagon has now said that it is only repositioning troops within Iraq and that there are no plans, as of yet, to pull out completely. However, there are reports that Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi is treating the letter he received as a formal notice. There are also now reports that the Arabic language version he got is different from the English one seen in pictures widely circulating on social media, further adding to the confusion. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap sanctions on Iraq if it follows through with its plans to eject American forces. This could including restrictions on the sale of weapons and other military hardware, as well as services, which could make it difficult for Iraq to operate and maintain various American-made systems. Especially complex assets, such as the country’s F-16IQ Viper fighter jets and M1 Abrams tanks , could become useless in very short order due to a lack of spare parts and contractor maintenance support. In the meantime, U.S. forces in Iraq have already suspended activities related to the fight against ISIS terrorists, including training Iraqi security forces personnel. Regardless of the formal legal status of the Iraqi government’s request, it may be increasingly untenable for American troops to remain in the country if the powers that be in Baghdad take an increasingly hostile position to their presence. The NATO-led training mission in Iraq has also halted its activities in light of security concerns. Other countries , such as the United Kingdom, are taking additional steps to safeguard the military and diplomatic personnel in Iraq. All of this presents openings for Russia to offer to fill the emerging vacuum in security assistance to the Iraqi government. The Kremlin isn’t the only country taking note, either. Yesterday, Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi met with the Chinese Ambassador to Iraq, who also said that Beijing was ready to play a role in assisting Iraq’s security forces. Iraqi S-400s, especially, together with any increasingly adversarial relationship with the United States, could certainly present a significant potential threat to U.S. military aircraft, or those belonging to its allies and partners, continuing to operate over the country to conduct strikes against ISIS or any other targets. Russian S-400s, as well as its other air defenses, in Western Syria have similarly long presented a barrier of sorts to U.S.-led coalition air operations against ISIS and other terrorist groups in that part of the country. Using stealth aircraft and stand-off weapons could mitigate the threat, and there is always the option to directly target any hostile air defense sites during a mission, but their very presence changes the risk conclusion and might make certain operations more difficult, if not impossible, depending on the exact circumstances. All told, whether Iraq does or does not respond favorably to Russia’s latest offer to sell it the S-400, as well as other air defense systems, the Kremlin, among others, is certain to try to exploit the current crisis between the United States and Iraq to try to expand its influence in Baghdad at the expense of the United States.

Reports are emerging that the U.S.-led coalition ostensibly fighting ISIS has begun preparing to withdraw at least forces from Iraq, but U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has insisted that the United States has not decided to pull out troops from the country, yet. This all follows a meeting between Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Matthew Tueller earlier today in which the Prime Minister reportedly asked the United States to start these preparations following a vote the day before in Iraq’s parliament ordering the expulsion of American forces from the country. Iraqi lawmakers took that action in response to the U.S. government’s decision to kill a top Iranian commander near Baghdad International Airport last week. The Washington Post ‘s Mustafa Salim was among the first to obtain the memo, which says it comes from U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General William H. Seely III, the commander Task Force-Iraq. This is the U.S. component of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the official name of the American-led coalition fighting ISIS in both Iraq and Syria.

During this time, there will be an increase in helicopter travel in and around the International Zone (IZ) of Baghdad [the Green Zone].

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 6, 2020","1 U.S. Serviceperson, 2 Contractors Dead, 6 Planes Struck, Including Rare Spy Plane, In Kenya Attack (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An attack on a military outpost in Kenya where U.S. troops are stationed, as well as its associated airfield, has left a U.S. servicemember and two contractors dead and six aircraft and helicopters damaged or destroyed. This includes a secretive U.S. military de Havilland Dash-8 twin-engine turboprop configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The terrorists who carried out the raid also damaged or destroyed vehicles and fuel tanks. Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda’s franchise in Somalia, carried out the attack on the base , known as Camp Simba, and the nearby airfield, typically referred to simply as Manda Bay after the nearby body of water of the same name, occurred in the early hours local time on Jan. 5, 2020. The terrorists reportedly used a suicide car bomb to breach the main facility and also stormed the airstrip, both of which are situated roughly 60 miles southwest of the Somali border. One U.S. service member and two Department of Defense contractors died in the attack, according to U.S. Africa Command , while another two U.S. military members were injured and are, at the time of writing, in stable condition and being evacuated. There is no word yet on any Kenyan casualties, but the country’s authorities have said that at least eight Al Shabaab terrorists died in the ensuing skirmish. U.S. and Kenyan authorities had earlier since issued statements that forces from both countries had successfully repelled the attackers. “The attack on the compound today involved indirect and small arms fire. After an initial penetration of the perimeter, Kenya Defense Forces and U.S. Africa Command repelled the al-Shabaab attack,” AFRICOM’s statement read. “Reports indicate that six contractor-operated civilian aircraft were damaged to some degree.” the general location of both Camp Simba and the Manda Bay airfield., Google Maps A satellite image giving a general look at the location of the Manda Bay airstrip and Camp Simba to the north., Google Earth The full extent of the damage remains unclear. The Associated Press , citing an initial Kenyan police report the outlet had seen, had reported that an unspecified U.S. “Cessna,” as well as a Kenyan Cessna Grand Caravan , and two unknown U.S. helicopters, along with various American vehicles had been destroyed. Pictures that have emerged that show what appears to be the remains of a Beechcraft King Air that was destroyed and burned out during the attack, as well as a pair of M-ATV mine-resistant vehicles that very likely belong to U.S. forces. This could be the aircraft that the Kenyan police report described as a U.S. “Cessna.” Some reports have suggested that this could be a U.S. Air Force C-146A Wolfhound special operations transport, but the tail section seen in the image notably lacks the “stinger” style tail seen on that aircraft, along with other differences. In addition, AFRICOM has only said so far that the destroyed and damaged aircraft were contractor-operated, which the Wolfhounds are not. Contractors do fly a mix of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the Manda Bay to provide transport, casualty evacuation, and personnel recovery support to American forces and their local partners in Kenya and neighboring Somalia, where U.S. special operations forces and other troops are fighting Al Shabaab and training Somali personnel to do the same. At least one contractor-operated Bell 412 helicopter is based there, which could be among the U.S. helicopters that reportedly got destroyed in the raid. US special operators work with a contractor-operated Bell 412 helicopter during a training exercise in 2019 near Camp Simba., SOCOM Al Shabaab has also released its own pictures from the attack, clearly showing a specially configured de Havilland Dash-8 in front of what appears to be the burning fuel tanks. We don’t know how severe the damage to this plane is, but one picture does show smoke coming out of the cockpit and an Al Shabaab terrorist appearing to be putting or trying to put something inside.

This U.S.-government owned, but contractor-operated Dash-8, a DHC-8-202 model, belongs to a secretive fleet of U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft known as SOCOM Tactical Airborne Multi-Sensor Platforms, or STAMP, which The War Zone was first to report on . These aircraft are known to support shadowy Joint Special Operations Command. At present, the STAMP fleet includes two DHC-8-202s, as well as three Beechcraft King Airs. The paint scheme on the aircraft in the images Al Shabaab posted online, white with a large blue cheatline with a smaller red one underneath, matches the Dash-8 that presently carries the U.S. civil registration code N8200L. You can read more about this particular plane in this past War Zone piece . The other STAMP Dash-8, N8200R, has a similar paint job, but with the colors of the cheatlines reversed.

A satellite image from April 2019, showing various aircraft at Manda Bay, including at Beechcraft King Air at the top of the runway about to take off., Google Earth Whatever the final damage assessment is and how many aircraft and other assets Al Shabaab succeeded in destroying or damaging, the attack is a particularly brazen statement of the group’s very real ability to strike outside of Somalia. Kenya, which is a significant member of the African Union-led operations targeting Al Shabaab in Somalia, has suffered a number of attacks on both military and civilian targets on its own soil from the group in recent years . Just last year, the terrorist organization launched a major attack on an upscale Dusit D2 Hotel and associated business complex in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, killing 21 people and wounding another 28. After that operation, Al Shabaab announced the beginning of a campaign it dubbed “Al-Quds (Jerusalem) will never be Judaized,” a reference to a pledge to ultimately eject Israel from the city of Jerusalem, a common refrain among Islamic extremist groups. The Somalia terrorists said that the raid on Camp Simba and Manda Bay was part of this same campaign. There is no indication that this is tied to the ongoing crisis between the United States and Iran. This also comes as the U.S. military has significantly expanded both facilities in recent years, which coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to designate a swath of southern Somalia as an “area of active hostilities” in 2017. This enabled the U.S. military to dramatically increase its operations there and has led to a spike in airstrikes , including using drones, on Al Shabaab targets since then. Aircraft flying from Manda Bay have been providing important persistent surveillance capabilities over southern Somalia in support of those operations. Left to right, Manda Bay in 2014, 2018, and 2019., Google Earth U.S. forces first began operating from Camp Simba and Manda Bay more than 10 years ago, with the U.S. Navy initially being responsible for overseeing operations at these facilities. In addition to using the airstrip as a launch point for aerial reconnaissance over neighboring Somalia, American forces have used the main base as a training base for both Kenyan and Somali forces . In 2017, overall responsibility for both sites passed to the U.S. Air Force, which established the 475th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron to oversee day-to-day activities at Manda Bay. In August 2019, this unit raised the American flag over the airfield, in a ceremony that marked its transition to an “enduring” base, meaning the U.S. military now treats it as a semi-permanent operating location. Despite this existing plan to continue operations at this site for the foreseeable future, Al Shabaab’s attack has demonstrated a clear need for U.S. and Kenyan forces to reassess their defensive posture going forward. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Author’s note: The original version of this story said that three Americans had died. U.S. Africa Command has not yet specified the nationalities of the two Department of Defense contractors. The story has been amended to reflect this. UPDATE: 1/6/2020 U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, commander of U.S. Africa Command, has categorically denied claims on Social Media that Al Shabaab killed him during the attack on Camp Simba and the Manda Bay airstrip. The U.S. military has not yet formally released the identities of the U.S. serviceperson and two Department of Defense contractors who died in the attack. However, the family of U.S. Army Specialist Henry Mayfield, Jr., has told various media outlets that he was the serviceperson who was killed. It’s is not known yet what unit Mayfield was assigned to at the time. Authorities in Kenya have insisted that no Kenyans died in the attack. AFRICOM has also now said that five aircraft and helicopters were completely destroyed and another was damaged in the attack. The command had initially said only that six aircraft and helicopters had received varying degrees of damage. There are also now reports that three suspected Al Shabaab terrorists attempted to breach a British military-operated training camp in Kenya, as well, but were detained without incident. The British Army maintains a standing training element in Kenya, known as the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK), at a site north of the capital Nairobi. UPDATE: 1:20pm EST U.S. Africa Command has released a new statement stating that elements of the East Africa Response Force (EARF) have deployed to Camp Simba and Manda to provide additional security in the aftermath of the attack. The EARF is a contingency force based at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti that is drawn from rotating units and, despite its name, provides a dedicated rapid reaction capability to support U.S. operations across Africa, as necessary. “Contrary to various open source reports, U.S. Africa Command does not assess yesterday’s attack by al-Shabaab is linked to Iran,” the press release added. “While Iranian involvement is not suspected in the attack, U.S. Africa Command has observed other nations, including Iran, seek increased influence in the Horn of Africa.” UPDATE: 5:30pm EST The U.S. military has now officially announced that U.S. Army Specialist Henry Mayfield, Jr., assigned to the 1st Battalion, 58th Aviation Regiment, part of the 164th Theater Airfield Operations Group based Fort Rucker, Alabama, died in the attack. The Pentagon has still not released information about the two Department of Defense contractors who were killed.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 388th and 419th Fighter Wings that call Hill Air Force Base in Utah home have just executed a massive readiness drill that included an ‘elephant walk’ of a whopping 52 F-35As. The exercise coincides with the wings reaching full strength following the transition to the F-35A, a process that began years ago. The elephant walk and the massive number of flights that usually go along with it are all about sortie generation and displaying a level of readiness that could be leveraged during a full-blown crisis. Both wings held a similar exercise in November of 2018 with 35 aircraft, which was highly impressive, but 52 is a whole other story. Just the amount of hardware on the runway in terms of billions of dollars is staggering. That same runway in the image is also quite fresh as a major rehabilitation of it wrapped up this summer . This kept many of Hill’s resident aircraft away, including being sent on combat deployments , as flying needed to continue during the construction period. We know that large waves of launches and recoveries are also part of the drill as the base gave local residents a heads-up in advance of the increased level of activity in the hours to come.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 4, 2020",Trump Threatens Attacks On A Symbolic 52 Iranian Targets If Tehran Strikes Back (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since the targeted assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani just two days ago , the rhetoric between Washington D.C. and Tehran has taken a massive turn for the worse. Now, with Iran indicating that it is looking to exact a major toll on the U.S. over Soleimani’s death in the coming days and weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn a red line that will be nearly impossible to step back from if the Iranians do decide to act. In a series of tweets, Trump laid out his retaliatory plan as a warning to the Iranian regime: Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently…. ….hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have….. ….targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran &  the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats! Twitter The message adopts a tone similar to what we hear from actors such as Iran when it references symbology with the targeting plan and the inclusion of cultural sites that are important to the Iranian people, which are symbolic by there very nature. It is important to note that what Trump is describing could be a war crime, depending on the exact nature of the targets he is talking about. Deliberately striking targets with no military value is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. At the same time, his message puts forward a crystal clear warning as to what will result from any significant reprisal. Regardless, some will cheer this as being as tough as possible on Iran and talking in terms of strength that some say is the only language they understand. At the same time, it does set up an inflexible situation that would likely lead to an all-out war if Iran forces Trump’s hand. In other words, we are in the realm of brinksmanship of the highest level now. Trump’s comments follow threats from Iranian officials , as well as Iranian-proxies in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East, in the aftermath of Soleimani’s death. “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission, but a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands,” the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader, had said in a statement yesterday. The U.S. decision to kill the Quds Force commander “will trigger a strategic revenge response that will definitely end U.S. presence in the region,” Hossein Salami, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), of which the Quds Force is a part, said earlier today. Members of the IRGC also raised a red flag, symbolizing the promise to avenge Soleimani’s killing, in place of the usual blue one, over the Jamkaran Mosque in the Iranian city of Qom, an immensely holy site in Shia Islam. It remains unclear where and when that response might come, and in what form, something The War Zone has talked about at length in our previous reporting on this crisis. Trouble is certainly brewing in Iraq itself, with Kata’ib Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia group, warning Iraqi security forces to stay away from any bases they share with American forces starting tomorrow night, with the obvious implication that they plan to strike these facilities targets in some fashion. Kata’ib Hezbollah is at the center of the present crisis. The group being responsible for a string of recent rocket attacks on Iraqi bases hosting American troops, one of which killed one American contractor last month, as well as a mob attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. These events prompted series of American responses , including the strike that killed Soleimani, as well as Kata’ib Hezbollah chief Abu Mahdi al Muhandis. This same Iranian-supported militia, which technically operates under the auspices of the Iraqi government’s Popular Mobilization Forces, has also threatened to publish the name and address of any Iraqi parliamentarians who do not vote in favor of legislation to eject the U.S. military from Iraq, an implicit death threat. Iraqi lawmakers are due to take up legislation to this effect in the coming days. There are already reports that Iraqi authorities have imposed restrictions on the movement of American personnel, but it is unclear the extent of those measures or how they have been implemented. With both Soleimani and Muhandis dead, and with the United States increasingly appearing to be conducting an active campaign targeting Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members and Iranian proxies in Iraq and elsewhere in the region, it is also increasingly possible that any response will be at least partially distributed in nature, with various groups acting with minimal coordination or entirely independently. A number of notably Iraqi militants were absent from a joint public funeral for the Quds Force commander and head of Kata’ib Hezbollah in Iraq today, potentially due to concerns for their safety. Kata’ib Hezbollah’s ultimatum also came amid rocket attacks near the U.S. Embassy and Balad Air Base, which is situated some 40 miles to the north of Baghdad and where a relatively small number of American military personnel are based. There were no U.S. casualties from either attack, but there were civilian casualties from the rockets that fell near the Embassy and members of Iraq’s security forces were wounded by the rockets that struck Balad. Tensions have been running high in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq all day. During the funeral for Soleimani and Muhandis, a fistfight reportedly broke out between Iraqi militia members and members of the country’s Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), an elite, predominantly U.S.-trained force that has long been described as the country’s most capable and politically reliable. All told, the situation is extremely fluid. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has declared three days of mourning for the “martyrs” and Soleimani’s body is now headed back to Iran for a state funeral that will coincide with the end of three days of mourning over his death there. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 1/5/2020 Iraq’s parliament has now voted in favor of expelling U.S. forces from the country. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi addressed the country’s lawmakers ahead of the vote and urged them to do so. He also claimed that Qasem Soleimani was only coming to Iraq with a message from Iranian leadership meant for Saudi Arabia. Iraq has been mediating between the two countries. The Iraqi Prime Minister offered no evidence to support his assertion regarding Soleimani’s visit, but the U.S. government has also, so far, declined to release any information supporting its position that the Quds Force leader came to Iraq to direct attacks on American interests and presented an imminent threat. The U.S. government had said that the official assessment was clear, but is too sensitive to release in any part due to the sources and methods involved in the collection of the intelligence. When and how Iraq might follow through on expelling U.S. forces remains to be seen. Separate political turmoil in the wake of months of protests has left the country with a caretaker government at present that does not have authorities to sign the measure parliament has passed into law. In the meantime, the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS has already announced that it is suspending its operations in Iraq due to force protection concerns.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 19, 2020",Night Stalker Chinook Special Operations Helicopters Have New Laser Countermeasures System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Directional infrared countermeasure ( DIRCM ) systems, which use lasers to blind and confuse the seeker on infrared-homing missiles, are becoming an increasingly ubiquitous feature on U.S. military helicopters and other aircraft . Now a picture has emerged that is one of the first to show an MH-47G Chinook from the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, also known as the Night Stalkers , with such a defensive suite, known as the AN/AAQ-24 . The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command, which oversees the 160th, posted the picture of the DIRCM-equipped MH-47G on its Instagram page on Jan. 3, 2020. The caption does not say where or when the picture was taken. Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24 system , the most recent versions of which are somewhat confusingly referred to as the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system, consists of two pointer-trackers and an array of warning sensors all linked to a central control unit. The sensors detect incoming heat-seeking missiles and then cue the pointer-trackers to engage them by firing a low-power modulated laser beam into their seeker, causing them to fly off course. The light gray sensor turrets are visible mounted at the rear of the MH-47G Chinook’s side sponsons. The warning sensors are visible around the nose, the sides of the forward fuselage behind the cockpit, on the front rotor housing, as well as the turret mounts themselves. One of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s MH-47G Chinook helicopters equipped with the AN/AAQ-24 directional infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) system., US Army Its name notwithstanding, subvariants of the AAQ-24 system have been in service on a wide array of U.S. Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force aircraft and helicopters, including the Air Force’s highly specialized VC-25A “Air Force One” and C-32A “Air Force Two” jets, as well as with foreign militaries , for years now. U.S. Special Operations Command first approved an urgent operational needs statement outlining a requirement for these systems for special operations aircraft and helicopters, including the 160th’s MH-47s and MH-60s, in 2015. The following year, SOCOM began considering the available options, before ultimately settling on the AN/AAQ-24. It’s somewhat curious that the urgent SOCOM requirement for DIRCM systems only came in 2015, given that these systems had already been in increasing use, including within the U.S. military, starting in the late 1990s . SOCOM was directly involved in the development of the original version of the AN/AAQ-24, as well, according to Northrop Grumman . When it comes to the 160th’s MH-47s, specifically, these helicopters are already the most heavily modified and well-protected Chinooks in the world, with specialized features to reduce their vulnerability, specifically to shoulder-fired, short-range, heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS . These include shrouds on the engine exhausts to reduce their infrared signature, numerous flare dispensers, missile warning sensors, and more. SOCOM’s urgent request did coincide with increasing operations in Iraq and Syria. In those countries, there had been a particularly pronounced concern about the proliferation of MANPADS, including among non-state actors, such as ISIS. These missiles are also a growing threat elsewhere around the world . New types increasingly feature counter-countermeasures, such as advanced imaging infrared seekers, which make them less vulnerable to traditional decoy flares . As such, this makes DIRCM suites a valuable addition, especially to helicopters, in general. It’s not clear how long the 160th has actually been using the AN/AAQ-24 on its MH-47Gs. There is at least one other set of pictures , dated January 2019, showing one of the special operations Chinooks equipped with this DIRCM system available through the Defense Visual Information Distribution System (DVIDS). A 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment MH-47G Chinook equipped with the AN/AAQ-24 DIRCM suite (the red arrow points to one of the pointer-trackers) at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in California during Exercise Yuma Horizon 19 in January 2019., USMC It’s also interesting to note that the U.S. Army began flight testing an AN/AAQ-24 installation for conventional CH-47F Chinooks in July 2017, but that work got “halted because of poor system performance” before the end of that year, according to a report from the Office of the Direction of Operational Test and Evaluation. “Incorrect ATW [Advanced Threat Warner] sensor placement on the CH-47F aircraft caused poor system performance.” The Army was also working on AN/AAQ-24 installations for the AH-64 Apache gunship and UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopter, at the same time, efforts that also ran into setbacks . A number of Apaches and Black Hawks did ultimately enter service with their respective subvariants of this DIRCM system, though. It’s unclear if the Army ultimately resolved those issues or if the configuration the 160th is using on its MH-47Gs is a version of the one developed for the regular CH-47Fs. The MH-47G airframe is not identical to the CH-47F, with the special operations variant having notably larger side sponsons. It also has various additional features on the nose and forward fuselages, such as a sensor turret, in-flight refueling probe, and radar . The AN/AAQ-24 configuration for the MH-47G does appear to use a standardized mount to attach the pointer-trackers to the side sponsons. Canada’s CH-147F Chinooks , for instance, uses an earlier generation of the Northrop Grumman DIRCM system that features different pointer-trackers, but uses the same general mounting arrangement. A Canadian CH-147F Chinook with an earlier generation of the AN/AAQ-24 DIRCM system., Canadian Forces India’s new CH-47Fs have the same mounts, as well, with pictures showing Passive Airborne Warning Systems (PAWS) series of warning sensors from Israel’s Elbit installed on them at present. PAWS and its variants are associated with versions of Elbit’s Music series of DIRCM systems, a version of which Indian CH-47Fs look set to receive in the future. An Indian CH-47F Chinook. The standard mount used in various DIRCM systems is seen on the side of the sponson toward the rear with a pair of Elbit PAWS-series warning sensors already installed., Boeing The U.S. Army had intended for the AN/AAQ-24 to serve as an interim replacement for the older BAE Systems AN/ALQ-212 Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM) system on its CH-47F, as well as its AH-64s and UH-60s. The service is now planning to install the Common Infrared Countermeasures (CIRCM) system on all of its helicopter types. The CIRCM is another Northrop Grumman product, which is already entering service on its UH-60M Black Hawks. You can read more about the ATIRCM and the CIRCM programs in this past War Zone piece . A regular US Army CH-47F Chinook equipped with the AN/ALQ-212 Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM) system. One of the two black-colored pointer-trackers is visible toward the rear of the helicopter’s side sponson., US Army It’s not clear whether the 160th is also planning to eventually move from the AN/AAQ-24 to the Army-standard CIRCM. Whatever the case the Night Stalker’s MH-47Gs now have an important additional defensive capability available to protect them from the threat of MANPADS.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Our good friend and highly experienced sonarman, Jive Turkey, continues to run one of the most interesting YouTube channels for anyone who is fascinated with the art of undersea warfare. A year ago, we featured an interview with Jive and posted some of the incredible “whiteboard” explainer videos he produces on everything submarines. Just last summer, he filled us in on the unique danger fire poses to submariners and has lent his expertise to us even on some of the more “exotic” underwater issues . Now he has posted a fascinating explainer of the differences between propellers and pump-jet propulsors used for propulsion on submarines and how detecting them on sonar differs, as well. Propellers and pump-jets are among the most important and sometimes sensitive components of a submarine class. The highly intricate design art that gives birth to these systems balances efficiency and speed, and even weight, against acoustic signature. It’s a fascinating mix of material science, mechanical engineering, and hydrodynamics. Elaborate propeller configurations, some of which include unique vortex diffusers that you can read all about here , are still commonplace on many submarines, but the pump-jet, with its unique advantages, has become increasingly in demand on larger submarines. Most importantly, they allow for higher speeds without noisy cavitation —which is a huge advantage when it comes to keeping from being detected while traversing vast swathes of ocean. German Type 212 screw with its boss vortex diffuser., AP Pump-jet propulsors also feature better efficiency across most all but the low-end of a submarine’s performance envelope. They protect the blade elements contained within them. They can also be handy in shallow water, especially if they have a nozzle or deflecting surfaces for thrust vectoring. There are drawbacks, as well. They are heavy, making them ill-suited for many smaller submarine designs, and they are costlier and more complex than a propeller. Russia modified a single Kilo class diesel-electric submarine, B-871 Alrosa , with a fairly advanced pump-jet design. , Uncredited Uncredited Regardless, the pump-jet has come into its own after decades of far less widespread, but often experimental use. The two-thirds of the Royal Navy’s Trafalgar class and later the U.S. Navy’s Seawolf class were among the first standard production submarine designs to rely on the pump-jet propulsor configuration. Today, many other classes have followed suit. The U.S. Navy’s Virginia class uses a similar arrangement as will the upcoming Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarine that is currently in development. Overseas, the feature is becoming far more commonplace among allied and non-allied designs, with pump-jets being found of boats like the Russian Borei class and French Barracuda class . The Royal Navy’s Astute class is equipped with a pumpjet., Crown Copyright With that being said, I’ll let Jive better explain the differences between the propulsion types, especially in regards to their tell-tail sound signature, in this awesome explainer video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=mv0RjBfs-7c Make sure to follow Jive Turkey on Twitter and at his Patreon site.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 3, 2020",New Details About Strike On Top Iranian Commander Emerge As Americans Are Told To Flee Iraq (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force, posed an “imminent” threat and that a drone strike that killed him and the other occupants of two SUVs outside of Baghdad International Airport in Iraq “saved American lives.” At the same time, repercussions from the unprecedented U.S. military operation are being felt, with the increasing possibility that the Iraqi government might order American forces out of the country and the State Department itself urging American citizens to leave as soon as possible. The United States has also formally decided to send thousands more troops to the region to bolster security as countries throughout the Middle East brace for any number of responses from Iran and its proxies. A drone under the control of the Joint Special Operations Command, reportedly an MQ-9 Reaper , carried out the mission. The Iranian regime has now confirmed that Soleimani along with four other members of the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), died in the strike. The Quds Force is the part of the IRGC responsible for conducting and coordinating terrorist and militant activities outside of Iran. “Highly classified information from informants, electronic intercepts, reconnaissance aircraft, and other surveillance” went into the planning of the strike, according to The New York Times . “I can’t talk too much about the nature of the threat,” Secretary Pompeo said in an interview on CNN ‘s “New Day” on Jan. 3, 2020. Pompeo did describe the threat as “imminent” and stressed that it was directed at American interests in the Middle East, but declined to elaborate. “It was the time to take this action so we could disrupt this plot… The risk of doing nothing was enormous, the intelligence committee made that assessment,” he added. “We will do our best to release everything we know that’s appropriate that doesn’t put anyone at risk.” “General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more…but got caught!” U.S. President Donald Trump also wrote in a series of Tweets. “He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself.” It’s not entirely clear how long the strike on Soleimani had been in the making. The New York Times has reported that the White House approved the plan to kill the Quds Force commander on Dec. 27, 2019, immediately after a rocket attack on K-1 base in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, which killed a U.S. contractor and wounded American troops. An earlier statement from the Pentagon about Soleimani’s death had blamed him and the Iranian government of masterminding a rocket attack on K-1 base. That incident had already prompted American airstrikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, which actually carried out the attack on K-1, on Dec. 29. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close confidant of U.S. President Donald Trump, also told Fox News on Jan. 3 that he had received a briefing about a potential targeted strike “when I was down in Florida.” Reporters had spotted Graham at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 30 and 31, 2019. This further indicates that the actual planning for the operation underway beforehand. This would also mean that the Trump Administration had decided to strike Soleimani before the subsequent attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Dec. 31. The U.S. military had also said that the Quds Force commander orchestrated that incident, which was ostensibly in response to the airstrikes. Members of Kata’ib Hezbollah and other Iranian-supported militias in Iraq operating under the umbrella of the Iraqi government’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), along with their supporters, carried out that attack, as well. In the aftermath of the Embassy attack, the U.S. military sent portions of a U.S. Marine Corps crisis-response force from Kuwait to bolster security at that diplomatic compound. It also announced that it would be deploying personnel from one brigade of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, as well as supporting troops, which together form what is now called the Immediate Response Force (IRF), a rotating extremely high-readiness global response contingent that is on alert at all times, to various locations in the Middle East. Plane spotters using online flight tracking software also noticed the apparent deployment of special operations forces from Europe to the region. The massive air bridge to bring all these personnel and equipment into the theater, which involves U.S. military airlifters and other aircraft flying through various air bases and civilian airports on their way to various locations in the Middle East, as well as Turkey, and back again, is still ongoing. This is likely to continue in the near future as the U.S. military has now confirmed that it will send thousands more troops to the region. It appears that this is just a formal decision to send the remaining elements of the brigade-sized IRF, which consists of between 4,000 and 5,000 personnel, though additional units may be preparing to deploy, as well. These deployments , especially activating the IRF, had also seemed somewhat excessive given that the Iraqi militias had caused no casualties during their attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad and had only done relatively limited damage to exterior portions the overall Embassy compound. However, it now seems very prudent in light of the response from Iran and its regional proxies to the death of Soleimani. It’s important to note that Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, Kata’ib Hezbollah’s leader and the Deputy Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee, which oversees the PMF, was also killed in the U.S. drone strike, which has already prompted additional calls for revenge from Iranian-backed elements in Iraq. Qasem Soleimani, at right, speaks with Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis, during the funeral for Soleimani’s father in Iran in 2017., Fars News Agency “If we get word of attacks or some type of indication, we will take preemptive action, as well to protect American forces, to protect American lives,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had told reporters on Jan. 2 before the strike on Soleimani. “So, the game has changed.” It’s also worth pointing out that reports had emerged in early December 2019 that the U.S. government had new streams of intelligence indicating increased threats against American interests in the Middle East from Iran and its proxies. Only limited details about this new information subsequently emerged, but there were 11 rocket attacks on bases in Iraq housing American forces that month, including the one on K-1, all tied to Iranian-backed militias. Whatever the case, Soleimani has been on the U.S. government’s radar for decades now and American officials had considered targeting him on a number of occasions in the past. Retired U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal says that he opted not to strike the Quds Force commander in Iraq in 2007, when he was commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, for a number of reasons, including potential political blowback. At that time, the Quds Force was aiding groups in Iraq fighting the U.S.-led coalition there, as well as engaging in attacks directly. President George W. Bush reportedly vetoed a proposal from the Central Intelligence Agency and Israel’s Mossad to assassinate him in Syria the following year over similar concerns. The CIA and Mossad did kill Imad Mughniyeh , the second in command of the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah in the Syrian capital Damascus, which was also part of the plan. All told, it’s not surprising that the fallout from killing Soleimani just in Iraq that is already unfolding lines up well with these known concerns dating back to the George W. Bush Administration. Making things particularly complicated is the Iraqi government’s own strong connections with Iran and that the strike also killed an official representative of the Iraqi government, Kata’ib Hezbollah’s chief Muhandis. Iraqi authorities had already been publicly critical of the U.S. military’s unilateral strikes against Kata’ib Hezbollah and the country’s Prime Minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, has now issued an even more strongly-worded statement in response to the new strikes near Baghdad’s airport. “The assassination of an Iraqi military commander holding an official position is an act of aggression against Iraq, and the Iraqi people,” he said. “The assassinations violate the conditions governing the presence of US forces in Iraq whose role is to train Iraqi forces and assist in the fight against Daesh as part of the Global Coalition,” he continued. “We have today requested that the Council of Representatives (Parliament) holds an emergency session to take the appropriate legislative measures in a manner that preserves the dignity, security, and sovereignty of Iraq.” Pro-Iranian members of Iraq’s parliament have been calling for the removal of U.S. forces for various reasons on and off for the last year or so and have now renewed their calls to do so. Muqtada al Sadr , a controversial Shia cleric and influential Iraqi politician , who was in Iran at the time of the strikes that killed Soleimani, has declared his intention to reform the Al Mahdi Army and Al-Yom Al-Maw’oud militias, which fought against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq in the mid- and late-2000s. Secretary Pompeo has insisted that killing Soleimani, who was a key player in coordinating Iranian support for terrorists and militants across the Middle East, as well as the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad, has left the world a safer place overall. However, the State Department is now reportedly considering evacuating its personnel from Iraq and has told U.S. citizens to stay away from the Embassy in Baghdad. The U.S. government has also issued an alert advising all Americans to leave the country as soon as possible, preferably by air, for fear they may become targets of terrorist attacks or kidnappings . Those are just two asymmetric options available to Iran and its regional proxies against Americans in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. You can read more in-depth about the various different avenues Iran has to respond to, short of an all-out war against the United States that it cannot hope to win and that would be devastating for all involved, in the War Zone ‘s previous reporting about the strikes that killed the Quds Force commander. For its part, Iran has declared three days of mourning for Soleimani and appointed his deputy of some 20 years, Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, to be the new head of the Quds Force. The Iranian regime has promised “severe revenge” for the American strikes and it seems hard to see how they will not retaliate in some fashion the future against the United States, as well as any of its allies or partners, especially Israel and Saudi Arabia , it sees as also being responsible. “Just as Israel has the right of self-defense, the United States has exactly the same right,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement commending President Trump personally on taking action against the Quds Force commander.” Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security, and self-defense.” Saudi Arabia does not appear to have issued a formal statement as of yet. “With knowledge of the operations and threats to the security of the region and the threats posed by terrorist militias that require their cessation, the Kingdom, in light of the rapid developments, calls for the importance of self-restraint to ward off all that may lead to aggravating the situation with its unbearable consequences,” an unnamed source told the country’s Al Arabiya news network. Other prominent American allies have largely avoided lauding the strikes outside the airport in Baghdad, which, by every indication, the U.S. carried out unilaterally. The United Kingdom has notably called on “all parties to de-escalate.”  France has also said the American operation has made the world a “ more dangerous ” place. The United Kingdom and France, along with Germany, Russia, and China, make up the remaining international partners to the controversial deal over Iran’s nuclear program. These countries are no doubt concerned that the strikes could lead Iran to further escalate its violations of the terms of that agreement, steps the regime in Tehran has been pursuing for months now already in an effort to pressure the parties into granting it sanctions relief and other concessions. In the meantime, Iran and its proxies in Iraq seem to be immediately focused on burying their dead, but it seems hard to see how de-escalation will be on their minds in the near term. UPDATE: 3:30pm EST— President Trump has now said that he does not seek war with Iran or regime change in Tehran, but has also threatened to conduct more strikes against Iranian interests, if necessary, saying that other targets are “identified” already. The U.S. State Department has now designated the Iraqi militant group Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq as a terrorist group, as well. Brothers Qays and Laith al-Khazali, who head the group, received their own designations. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had previously named Qays al-Khazali as one of the Iranian-sponsored actors responsible for the attack on the Embassy in Baghdad. He had notably fought against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, first as a member of Muqtada al Sadr’s Al Madhi Army, before forming Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq. This group was responsible for various terrorist attacks, kidnappings, and other acts of sectarian violence against the coalition and other Iraqis. Coalition forces detained Qays between 2007 and 2010, when he was released in a prisoner swap . There are reports that Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq fighters are preparing for attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq now and that they believe American troops will be leaving the country soon. In the meantime, American oil workers, among others, have begun to follow the advice of the U.S. government and leave the country. The increasingly worrisome security situation may make it difficult to do so, at least by air, in the future, with Royal Jordanian Airlines and Gulf Air both suspending flights to Baghdad indefinitely. Elements of the U.S. Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, based in Italy, is also reportedly now on alert for a possible deployment to Lebanon in light of increase security concerns there. UPDATE: 6:15pm EST— U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien has now told reporters that the United States chose to strike Soleimani because he was planning attacks on U.S. military and diplomatic personnel, but declined to offer any specifics. He also said that the Trump administration had used the authority within the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Iraq, originally enacted to enable the American-led invasion of the country in 2003 and subsequent occupation. NBC News is reporting that the potential attacks were set to come against American interests in Lebanon and Syria and it remains unclear what information indicated that the threats were imminent. U.S. military officials have also told CNN that coalition operations against ISIS in Iraq are only proceeding on a “limited” basis as the immediate focus for American forces has shifted to force protection. Depending on how long this crisis lasts, and whether it leads to the U.S. military’s expulsion from Iraq, the terrorist group could exploit the situation and regroup. O’Brien added that he hoped the Iraqi government would not choose to eject U.S. forces. The “U.S. has invested enormous amounts of blood and treasure in helping the Iraqi[s] build up a democracy,” he said. In the meantime, the U.S. military is continuing to move more forces toward Middle East. The U.S. Navy has now scrapped a combined exercise in and around Morocco and is instead sending the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan , as well as other elements of its Expeditionary Strike Group and the embarked 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit further east. UPDATE: 6:35pm EST— There are unconfirmed reports emerging now of an apparent airstrike against another small convoy carrying Popular Mobilization Forces members near Taji, Iraq, north of Baghdad. It is very possible that details about this incident will change soon, but Shubl al-Zaidi, commander of Kataib Imam Ali, another Iranian-backed militia under the PMF umbrella, was reportedly riding in one of the vehicles. Hamid al-Jazaeri, deputy head of Saraya al-Khorasani, which has fought in both Iraq and Syria and has ties to the Quds Force, was also reported to have been in the convoy. UPDATE: 7:10pm EST— There are conflicting reports about who may have been riding in the convoy that was struck in Taji. Some sources say Shubl al-Zaidi is in Lebanon and Hamid al-Jazaeri has released an audio recording denying his death. There are also separate, unconfirmed reports that a strike claimed the life of a top IRGC official in Yemen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 4, 2020",World Holds Its Breath After An American Strike In Iraq Kills Top Iranian Commander (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. military strike on a pair of SUVs near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq has killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, the division of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for militant and terrorist activities outside of the country. It is difficult to imagine that the Iranian regime won’t feel compelled to take some form of action against any and all powers it holds responsible, possibly beyond the United States, to include its regional allies and partners, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia . This, in turn, could easily prompt responses from those actors, creating a dangerous spiral of escalation, at least in the near future. “At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,” a statement from the Pentagon said. “General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” This statement also blames Soleimani and the Iranian government directly for directing the rocket barrage on the K-1 base in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Dec. 27, 2019, which killed a U.S. contractor and wounded a number of American troops. Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, which the United States has also designated as a terrorist group, carried out that strike. The full Pentagon statement., DOD That incident had already led to a series of escalating events, starting with U.S. airstrikes against Kata’ib Hezbollah this past weekend. Just days ago, Kata’ib Hezbollah and its supporters launched an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in retaliation, prompting the United States to begin deploying thousands of additional troops to the region. The Pentagon statement said that Soleimani directed the Embassy attack, which caused no casualties and minor damage, as well. “This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” the Pentagon statement continues in regards to the strike near Baghdad’s airport. “The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.” President Donald Trump had previously Tweeted out a picture of an American flag and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, wrote his own post all but stating that the U.S. government had carried out the operation in response to repeated threats from Iran and its proxies in Iraq. There remain conflicting reports about whether a helicopter or a drone actually carried out the strikes. U.S. forces in Iraq have also reportedly sought to confirm Soleimani’s death directly, something that is an important part of the post-strike process for any targeted killing. The strikes reportedly killed a number of other notable individuals in addition to Soleimani, including Abu Mahdi al Muhandis , Kata’ib Hezbollah leader and the Deputy Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee, the Iraqi government entity that oversees the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). The bulk of the PMF consists of Iranian-backed militias, which received support from the Quds Force. The PMF’s top spokesperson and head of its protocol office, Mohammed Ridha, was also killed. There are unconfirmed reports that a senior member of the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah also died. Iraqi authorities have denied reports that U.S. forces had arrested other important Iraqi militants who had taken part in the Embassy attack. There also remains some confusion over whether or not there were additional rocket attacks targeting Baghdad Airport and other nearby locations, which you can read about more in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on tonight’s events. “Let me speak directly to Iran and to our partners and allies. To Iran and its proxy militias: we will not accept continued attacks against our personnel and forces in the region,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had told reporters earlier in the day. “Attacks against us will be met with responses in the time, manner, and place of our choosing. We urge the Iranian regime to end their malign activities.” There are already reports emerging that Iran will seek to retaliate for Soleimani’s death and it’s hard to see how they could not. The Quds Force commander was an extremely well-connected and influential member of the Iranian regime. He also regularly engaged actively with Iranian-backed terrorists and militants across the Middle East, who are also likely to now take action. It remains to be seen what form that response will take. Though Iran and its proxies cannot win a conventional conflict against the United States, they had already demonstrated a number of potential asymmetric options last year, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Crops’ shooting down a U.S. Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman in June 2019. The United States has also blamed Iran directly for carrying out unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia three months later, as well as a string of attacks on commercial oil tankers during the year. Iran could use its considerable arsenal of ballistic missiles to threaten various countries in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, both of which host U.S. forces , as well. Though the U.S. intelligence community has not assessed that Iran has an active nuclear weapons program , there are long-standing reports that it may have stockpiles of chemical weapons, which it could load onto these weapons. Iran also routinely threatens to blockade the strategic Strait of Hormuz , which it could do using a combination of ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles , midget submarines , suicide drones , mines , swarming boat attacks , and more. This body of water links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and that serves as a transshipment point for 20 percent of the world’s oil and an equally significant portion of global natural gas. The price of a barrel of crude oil rose by over a dollar following the strike in Baghdad. Simply seizing commercial ships and taking their crews hostage could be another option. Iran’s proxies could also launch terrorist attacks or a wave of kidnappings across the Middle East and potentially beyond . Iranian-backed militias in Iraq reportedly briefly abducted two French journalists following the attack on the U.S. embassy earlier this week, possibly believing they were Americans. Non-kinetic alternatives, such as cyberattacks , could be another part of the equation. If Iran were to pursue any of those options, it would almost certainly beget at least similar responses, though the United States has now shown a willingness to take increasingly disproportionate steps in its ostensible goal of deterring Iran. Major escalatory actions from either side also increasingly run the risk of drawing in other regional or even global actors who have a stake in the situation, such as Russia or China, in some way. There is also the danger that third parties could find themselves caught in the crossfire from future tit-for-tat military or terrorist attacks. With regards simply to Iraq, there had already been renewed calls to eject U.S. forces from the country in response to the airstrikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah, which is technically operating under the auspices by the Iraqi government. Months of protests, notably from demonstrators largely opposed to Iranian influence in the country, have already weakened the Iraqi government and this recent series of events, culminating in Soleimani’s death, have put it in an extremely disadvantageous position. Whatever happens now, it is safe to say that the geopolitical situation in the Middle East, and likely beyond, has dramatically and fundamentally changed in ways that are still very much unfolding. UPDATE: 12:45am EST— Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed “ severe revenge ” and said that Soleimani’s death will prompt those “resisting” the United States and Israel to redouble their efforts. He also declared three days of mourning. A meeting of Iran’s National Security Council is now underway, as well. The Iranians also summoned the Swiss ambassador to issue a formal complaint about the U.S. action. Since the United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Iran, the Swiss government acts as a go-between. U.S. defense officials have confirmed that a drone operated by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) carried out the strike. They have also said that the United States is well postured to respond to Iranian retaliation. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has lauded the strike and is a major supporter of the Trump Administration, also called for taking all the steps necessary to safeguard U.S. forces in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 3, 2020",Congress Demands Aggressor Jet Modernization Plan Before Adversary F-35s Head To Nellis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s move to assign some of its oldest F-35As to a new aggressor squadron appears to have support in Congress based on the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that was recently signed into law, but it also has some caveats that could alter the initiative’s current trajectory. It is no secret that the Air Force is in need of a stealthy aggressor capability to mimic emerging threats abroad, especially those from China . We were among the first to report on its plan to reassign nine early low-rate production (LRIP) F-35As to Nellis Air Force Base where they would become the core of a reconstituted 65th Aggressor Squadron alongside the existing 64th Aggressor Squadron . You can read all about the need for this capability and the USAF’s plan for realizing it in this past article of ours. Now Congress wants a better idea of what the USAF has in mind in terms of a roadmap for modernizing its entire aggressor capability. As such, no transfers of F-35As for aggressor duties will be authorized until the Chief Of Staff of the Air Force submits a detailed strategy to do this. This must include things like potential basing options and justifications for the F-35s, as well as an analysis for increasing the size of the two aggressor squadrons the USAF already has—made up of Block 30 and Block 42 F-16C/Ds—from having 18 aircraft in their primary inventories to 24. Maybe the most promising part of Congress’s demands is that it wants to know how the existing aggressor force will be upgraded to better match real threats around the globe, something that is badly needed. Items specifically mentioned for upgrade include “aircraft radar, infrared search-and-track systems [IRSTs], radar warning receiver, tactical datalink, threat-representative jamming pods” as well as “other upgrades necessary to provide a realistic advanced adversary threat.” With even lower-tier adversaries gaining these capabilities, the fact that the Air Force’s aggressors don’t possess many of them is a major issue, as our readers are well aware of. The relevant section in the NDAA reads as such: SEC. 149. AIR FORCE AGGRESSOR SQUADRON MODERNIZATION. (a) Sense of Congress.–It is the sense of Congress that– (1) it is critical that the Air Force has the capability to train against an advanced air adversary in order to be prepared for conflicts against a modern enemy force, and that in order to have this capability, the Air Force must have access to an advanced adversary force prior to United States adversaries fielding a 5th-generation operational capability; and (2) the Air Force’s plan to use low-rate initial production F-35As as aggressor aircraft reflects a recognition of the need to field a modernized aggressor fleet. (b) Report.– (1) In general.–The Secretary of the Air Force may not transfer any low-rate initial production F-35 aircraft for use as aggressor aircraft until the Chief of Staff of the Air Force submits to the congressional defense committees a comprehensive plan and report on the strategy for modernizing its organic aggressor fleet. (2) Elements.–The report required under paragraph (1) shall include the following elements: (A) Potential locations for F-35A aggressor aircraft, including an analysis of installations that–(i) have the size and availability of airspace necessary to meet flying operations requirements; (ii) have sufficient capacity and availability of range space; (iii) are capable of hosting advanced-threat training exercises; and (iv) meet or require minimal addition to the environmental requirements associated with the basing action. (B) An analysis of the potential cost and benefits of expanding aggressor squadrons currently operating 18 Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) to a level of 24 PAA each. (C) An analysis of the cost and timelines associated with modernizing the current Air Force aggressor squadrons to include upgrading aircraft radar, infrared search-and-track systems, radar warning receiver, tactical datalink, threat-representative jamming pods, and other upgrades necessary to provide a realistic advanced adversary threat. Unless major changes to the current plan are made following the delivery of the required studies, this really shouldn’t slow down the standing up of the 65th Aggressor Squadron as the jets weren’t set to be transferred until 2022 anyway. What it will do is push the Air Force to really get smart about enhancing its overall aggressor capability so that pilots will face similar threat representations to those they would see in actual combat. Nellis-based F-35As., USAF AESA radars , proprietary data-links, and especially IRSTs, the latter of which has the ability to negate radar-evading stealth technology , albeit with some limitations, really need to become standard equipment for these units as soon as possible. They already use quite advanced podded electronic warfare systems, including those from Israel, but staying on the leading edge of this shadowy realm of warfare is key. The good news is that all of this is “off-the-shelf” capabilities that can be easily acquired and integrated onto the F-16 airframe. The Air Force has just moved ahead with its purchase to buy hundreds of new AESA radars for some of its F-16C/D fleet, so the aggressor requirement could be added. The same can be said for the most recent iteration of the IRST21 sensor , which the 64th Aggressor Squadron tested during one exercise years ago. It has recently entered production for the F-15C/D and F/A-18E/F fleets and it is being tested on the F-16 in its latest podded form. It’s worth noting that not every aggressor F-16s would need these systems. A capable data-link system can share the sensor data from these systems across a formation of aggressor aircraft and beyond. In other words, it’s not necessary to buy an AESA radar set and IRST pod for each aircraft in the aggressor squadrons’ inventories. By equipping say a third of their fleet with these systems, but all of them with enhanced data-links, the rest of the aircraft will benefit from these capabilities when they fight alongside the planes equipped with them. The inclusion of upgraded electronic warfare and situational awareness enhancing threat warning systems is also critical to keeping the force relevant for years to come. F-16C of the 64th Aggressor Squadron based at Nellis AFB. , USAF Also, the addition of airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) assets should be included in this report. The aggressors currently lack this capability, relying on a ground control intercept (GCI) concept of operations as well as their own onboard sensors. This has severe limitations over a system that includes an airborne radar and control platform. AEW&C aircraft are proliferating around the globe and China is betting heavily on them for its future air combat needs and Russia is increasing its capabilities in this area, as well. With this in mind, integrating an AEW&C capability on a regular basis with the aggressor squadrons should become a priority going forward. Of course, all this comes down to money, but the fact that Congress wants the Air Force’s wishlist is a good sign that funds would be allocated to realizing at least part of it. The NDAA also doesn’t mention the rapidly increasing use of private adversary support contractors to augment the organic aggressor squadrons’ capacity and capabilities. This trend will only become more prominent as time goes on and even though it doesn’t have to do specifically with the status of the USAF’s own aggressor squadrons, it needs to be factored in any future roadmap for them. The 18th Aggressor Squadron is based at Eilson AFB in Alaska. , USAF The oddest part about Congress’s demands is the base studies. Sending the F-35A aggressors to Nellis is a no-brainer. The base sits at the heart of the flying force’s tactics development and training universe. It’s home to the Weapons School and a constant rotation of high and low-profile exercises, such as Red Flag and JFEX. Beyond that, the Nevada Test and Training Range is the most capable overland range in the world and supports all types of testing and training year-round. It also has the highest fidelity array of replicated adversary threats anywhere in the world. Bedding-down the first F-35 aggressors anywhere else seems counter-intuitive on virtually every level. Additionally, it would be surprising if some of the justification information hasn’t been gathered and produced already. We also know that the USAF does have some stealth aggressor capability in the form of the F-117 Nighthawk . But that airframe is quite limited compared to a high-performance, sensor-laden, sensor-fusion capable, stealth fighter like the F-35A, especially one tweaked specifically for adversary duties. There are also a tiny handful of F-117s flying, so they can only be used for very specialized roles and scenarios. Regardless, there is more good than bad in the NDAA when it comes to the future of the Air Force’s aggressor force and hopefully coming up with a cohesive plan for it will allow it to get more attention and more badly needed funding.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 3, 2022",Explosions Rock Baghdad International Airport As Tensions Soar Following Embassy Attack (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain thin and elements of the story are bound to change as it unfolds, but a number of explosions have rocked the area around Baghdad International Airport in the Iraqi capital. This comes as American forces are pouring into the region in response to a militant mob’s attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad two days ago. That incident was in response to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed Iraqi militias this past weekend, which were in retaliation for an early rocket barrage on a base in the northern city of Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded American troops. The exact number of weapons fired and the target or targets of the strikes is unclear. Initial reports indicated that between three and four rockets landed near the airport. Reuters and others subsequently reported that an Iraqi base where American troops are also stationed was one of the main focuses of the attack. U.S. military helicopters, possibly AH-64 Apaches, also reportedly took off from an unspecified location nearby following the attack. Apaches had conducted shows of force , including firing flares, over the Embassy during the incident there on Dec. 31, 2019, and have been patrolling the general area since then. Other rockets may have reportedly hit portions of the airport itself, such as the runway or inside a cargo handling area, as well as an access road just outside. There are also unconfirmed reports that the rocket attacks at Baghdad airport caused Iraqi security forces and civilian casualties. The airport would not a surprising target given that, as noted, dozens of U.S. military airlifters and other military aircraft have been heading toward Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean regions since the attack on the Embassy on Dec. 31. This major air bridge has flowed through commercial airports and bases in Europe and then to military facilities, including in neighboring countries such as Kuwait and Jordan. Curiously, two SUVs that belonged to the the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the Iraqi government-sanctioned umbrella organization that oversees various militia units, including Iranian-backed forces, were also destroyed on the access road during the incident. The PMF has issued a statement that Mohammed Ridha, the head of its public relations and protocol office, as well as unspecified “guests” were killed. This raises the possibility that the SUVs were the target of a separate attack or that the initial reports of a rocket attack at the airport were in reference to the strikes on Ridha and his associates. Online flight tracking software also appears to show flights heading to the airport despite some reports that it had ceased operations in light of the attacks. Based on the details available about this new incident, at least so far, the reported rocket attacks on Baghdad’s airport and the Iraqi base nearby have all the hallmarks of rocket attacks that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have launched against American diplomatic facilities and bases where American troops are stationed in the country in the past few years . There had been a spike in such attacks recently and the one on the K-1 base in Kirkuk this past weekend was the eleventh such attack in December 2019. It remains to be seen how the United States and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq might respond to the reported rocket attacks and the strikes on the PMF SUVs, respectively, and depend in no small part on exactly how the incidents unfolded. Earlier in the day, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had t hreatened further retaliation in response to any future attacks from Iran or its proxies in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. “To Iran and its proxy militias: we will not accept continued attacks against our personnel and forces in the region,” Esper said. “Attacks against us will be met with responses in the time, manner, and place of our choosing. We urge the Iranian regime to end their malign activities.” However, This threat did not appear to dissuade Iranian-backed groups in Iraq. Later in the day, a spokesperson for Kata’ib Hezbollah, the militia group the U.S. government says was behind the K-1 base attack and was the target of the subsequent American airstrikes, also said that the militants were “waiting [for] orders to target American bases in Iraq.” UPDATE: 8:25pm EST— It is important to stress that they are unconfirmed as of yet, but there are growing reports, including now from Iraqi state television, that Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, the extra-territorial arm of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), died in the strike on the two SUVs are Baghdad International Airport. In addition, Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, the leader of Kata’ib Hezbollah and the Deputy Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee that oversees the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), was also said to have been killed. Be warned, some graphic photos follow below. It is hard to overstate how significant this would be, if true. Qasem Soleimani has been overseeing Iranian support for militias in Iraq, as well as Syria and Lebanon, among other countries and is among the most influential figures in Iran today. Abu Mahdi al Muhandis has strong ties to the IRGC and Soleimani personally and has similar influence among the other Iranian-backed elements of the PMF. No one has claimed responsibility for the strikes on the SUVs, but if Soleimani and Muhandis did die, it is hard to see how Iran and its regional proxies could not launch counterattacks throughout the region on the actors they would see as the most likely perpetrators, including the United States and Israel. This, in turn, could easily lead to spiraling escalation, at least in the near term. UPDATE: 8:45pm EST— Newsweek is now reporting Soleimani and Muhandis’ deaths, citing U.S. government officials.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 15, 2023",Germany Has Fewer Than 10 Tiger And 12 NH90 Helicopters Ready For Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A report has emerged that shows just 15 percent of Germany’s Tiger attack helicopters and only around 12 percent of its NH90 transport helicopters were mission capable as of November 2019. The German Armed Forces, or Bundeswehr , has blamed Airbus, which provides contract maintenance services for both types, for the low availability rates, but this also comes as German authorities continue to struggle to improve readiness across the country’s military . German newspaper Bild was first to report on the low readiness of the two German military helicopter types on Jan. 1, 2020. A leaked Bundeswehr report that the outlet obtained said that eight out of 53 Tigers and 12 of 99 NH90s were “ready-to-use.” Germany took delivery of its first Tiger in 2005 from what was then known as Eurocopter, which morphed into Airbus Helicopters in 2014. The German military received the first NH90 , which NHIndustries, a consortium that includes Airbus, produces, in 2006. Airbus could “only partially meet the contractual obligations” regarding maintenance, the report said, according to Bild . This “incomplete or delayed performance” was a key factor in the readiness problems, the Bundeswehr complained. Germany’s Tigers go through a phase maintenance process after ever 400 flight hours, while personnel conduct similar checks on the NH90s after 600 hours. Bild says that Airbus contractors are responsible for half of these checks on the Tiger fleet and around 90 percent of them with regards to the NH90s. Personnel reassmble an NH90 after its arrival in the northwestern African country of Mali in 2017., Bundeswehr This is hardly the first time that the Bundeswehr has pointed the finger at Airbus over readiness and other issues with regards to its Tigers and NH90s. In October 2019, the German military grounded all of the NH90s it had received prior to 2018 over concerns about their tail rotors. It is very likely that this contributed to the readiness issues for that type. German officials have also complained in the past about lapses in quality control in NH90 production, leading to the delivery of helicopters with extremely limited operational capabilities. In 2017, a Tiger assigned to the German contingent in the northwestern African country of Mali also crashed, killing both the pilot and the co-pilot, when its main rotor fell apart in midair. An investigation that wrapped up the following year found that Airbus maintenance contractors had improperly serviced the helicopter before the accident. At the same time, the German military has been struggling with negative readiness trends for years now that are tied in no small part to dramatic reductions in defense spending and the overall size of the Bundeswehr in the aftermath of the Cold War. A separate report from the Bundeswehr in 2018 showed that just 12 Tigers and 13 NH90s were mission capable, making it clear that the plight of both fleets certainly isn’t new. Low availability hasn’t been limited to helicopters in recent years, with fixed-wing aircraft, ships, submarines, and more, having equally dismal mission capable rates. The German Air Force’s Tornado combat jets, which are aging and in increasingly desperate need of replacement , have been one particular sore spot , with around 35 percent of the aircraft being combat ready as of 2017. Readiness rates for the country’s newer Typhoon fighters haven’t been significantly better, either. Even more notably, by the end of 2017, none of Germany’s six Type 212A subs were operational . This predicament persisted for months into the following year. The German Navy Type 212A submarine U-32 ., Bundeswehr Germany has worked to steadily boost its defense spending since 2014, when Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and subsequent military intervention in that country’s Eastern Donbass region upended the security calculus in Europe. However, competing priorities and visions of what the Bundeswehr ‘s core roles should be, especially outside the country , as well as difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel , have complicated those efforts. The need to rely so heavily on Airbus contractors in the first place highlights the lack of organic capacity within the Bundeswehr to maintain major systems. Defense spending priorities and requirements for new equipment, especially the curious design of the German Navy’s Type 125 frigates , have reflected those debates. The Type 125s have been a saga unto themselves that you can read about more in these past War Zone stories . The German Navy’s Type 125 class frigate Baden-Württemberg ., Bundeswehr In November 2019, when the Tigers and NH90s hit their recent readiness low point, the German government did formally announce a pledge to meet NATO’s goal of all of its members spending two percent of their gross domestic products on defense. Germany has faced particular criticism, especially from U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration , over its failure to meet this target in recent years. When this might happen remains to be seen. German officials have already said they won’t reach this spending benchmark by 2024, which is the Alliance’s most recent target date for having all of its members reach the two percent mark. All told, no matter how much Airbus might be to blame for immediate readiness issues with the Tigers and NH90s, Germany still clearly has much work to do on its end to improve the available rates for those helicopters, as well as other aircraft, ships, and other assets.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019",Kim Jong Un Ends Testing Moratorium And Threatens To Unveil New “Strategic Weapon” (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kim Jong Un has decided to roll the clock back two years in his New Year’s address that caps off the Central Committee’s annual meeting. In it, he declared an end to the testing moratorium he placed on his nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs during the period of detente with Washington D.C. and Seoul. He also warned that the world would see a new strategic weapon system from his country very soon. Whether this means within hours, days, weeks, or months remains unclear, but sooner is more likely than later if you take into account his regime’s recent “Christmas gift” threat. The reasoning behind these changes is too slow of progress with negotiations with the United States and in response to the same hardline sanctions that sit over his regime that were in place two years ago. In his address, Kim noted that the U.S. would “suffer helplessly” if the status quo doesn’t change and accused the Trump Administration of “gangster-like demands.” This is all well-traveled ground when it comes to North Korean rhetoric vis-a-vis the United States, but such a tone had taken a hiatus during the period of diplomacy. That period has clearly been marching toward an end over the last nine months or so as negotiations hit dead ends and no sanction relief materialized. Of course, there are still no signs that North Korea has any intention of giving up its nuclear arsenal. Doing so, at least without unprecedented concessions and aid in exchange, is totally illogical, especially as it has been made clear that actually going to war over the standoff would be unthinkable due to its immense cost in life and treasure according to Trump himself . We will have to see exactly what Kim’s new weapon is, but most signs point to a new or updated intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) design, one that leverages solid fuel for at least one stage of its propulsion stack. A “strategic engine test” occurred earlier in December that was likely a precursor to an actual flight test of such a weapon. Putting his recycled make-shift ballistic missile submarine in the water is another, but less likely possibility, among others. Even though the Kim regime is a master of deceit and double talk, Kim Jong Un has been remarkably clear about his testing intentions and goals, and his weapons capabilities since accelerating both his nuclear and ballistic missile program in early 2016. Since then, the country’s technological know-how has evolved at an incredible rate . Over the last two years, although there haven’t been tests of these weapons, the programs have continued at full steam. As such, 24 months in North Korean weapons development years is a long time. It would be foolish to underestimate just how impressive Kim’s new strategic weapon may be. Above all else, one thing is clear—North Korea’s New Years’ resolution is to end the standoff’s current status quo, one way or another. We will update this post as more information comes available. UPDATE: 4pm PST— Here is part of the KCNA readout from the Central Committee’s meeting that goes into Kim’s statements on the sanctions and the need to develop new weapons and military capabilities: He noted that the huge and complicated work of developing the ultra-modern weapon system possessed only by the countries with advanced defence science and technology presupposed our own innovative solution in terms of the scientific and technical aspect without anyone’s help, and all the research tasks were perfectly carried out by the driving force, i.e. our reliable scientists, designers and workers in the field of the munitions industry. This means a great victory, and our possession of promising strategic weapon system planned by the Party one by one serves as a great event in developing the armed forces of the Republic and defending and guaranteeing our sovereignty and right to existence, he noted. He stressed that such a leap in developing the ultra-modern national defence science would make our great military and technical power irreversible, greatly promote the increase of our great national power, raise the power of putting the political situation around us under control and give the enemies the blow of big uneasiness and horror. In the future, the more the U.S. stalls for time and hesitates in the settlement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, the more helpless it will find itself before the might of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea getting stronger beyond prediction and the deeper it will fall into an impasse, he noted. He referred to a series of successes achieved in the economic construction. Analyzing the trend of the prevailing present situation, he said the U.S. real intention is to seek its own political and diplomatic interests while wasting time away under the signboard of dialogue and negotiations and at the same time keep sanctions upon the latter so as to weaken the latter. He stressed that we further hardened our resolution never to barter the security and dignity of the state and the safety of its future for anything else. He said that the stalemate between the DPRK and the U.S. can not but assume protracted nature as the U.S. is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude. He added that recently the U.S. is talking about continued dialogue while peddling the issue of the resumption of the dialogue here and there but this is just aimed to pass without trouble the year-end time-limit set by us and stall for the time for evading a lethal attack as it now finds itself in a tight corner, not out of the intention to withdraw the hostile policy toward the DPRK and solve issues through improved relations. On the other hand, the U.S. has openly revealed its provocative political, military and economic maneuvers to completely strangle and stifle the DPRK. This is the double-dealing behavior of the brigandish U.S., he added. He said that we will never allow the impudent U.S. to abuse the DPRK-U.S. dialogue for meeting its sordid aim but will shift to a shocking actual action to make it pay for the pains sustained by our people so far and for the development so far restrained. He continued: It is true that we urgently need external environment favorable for the economic construction but we can never sell our dignity which we have so far defended as valuable as our own life, in hope for brilliant transformation. The DPRK-U.S. stand-off which has lasted century after century has now been compressed to clear stand-off between self-reliance and sanctions. If there were not the nuclear issue, the U.S. would find fault with us under other issue, and the U.S. military and political threats would not end. The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future, too, and to strengthen the internal power from all aspects. He said there are not a few problems that need to be set right in state management, economy and other fields from the viewpoint of strengthening our might. He analyzed the present situation including state management and economic performance which are insufficient for pulling and spurring the great cause of self-reliance and self-development and which fail to bring about a bold renovation but stay stagnant. The victory of the revolution is inevitable but it is not achieved without any difficulties and hardships, he said, and continues: If we do not put spur to the struggle for bolstering the power for self-development while waiting for the lift of sanctions, the enemies’ reactionary offensive will get fiercer to check our advance. The more we bolster our own strength and create valuable wealth on the strength of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, the deeper the enemies will be driven into greater agony and the earlier the day of the victory of socialism will come. All the Party organizations and officials have to shoulder upon themselves the important duties entrusted to them by the times and turn out in the offensive for frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies’ sanctions and blockade by dint of self-reliance. … Saying that we should more actively push forward the project for developing strategic weapons, he confirmed that the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, declaring that we can not give up the security of our future just for the visible economic results and happiness and comfort in reality now that hostile acts and nuclear threat against us are increasing and nothing has changed between the days when we maintained the line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and now when we struggle to direct our efforts to the economic construction owing to the U.S. gangster-like acts. He solemnly declared that there is no need to hesitate with any expectation of the U.S. lift of sanctions even now that we had close look into the real intention of the U.S., adding if the U.S. persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built. He said that we will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the U.S. and guaranteeing our long-term security, noting that the scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated depending on the U.S. future attitude to the DPRK. He noted that our development of absolute weapons possessed by big powers is the great success but the big contingent of promising talents of science and technology in this course is more valuable result dear to the WPK.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 16, 2019",Check Out The Crazy Radar That Lies Beneath The MC-130H Combat Talon II’s Gonzo Nose,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s 1st Special Operations Wing has released video footage of various routine maintenance tasks on an MC-130H Combat Talon II special operations transport that includes a look inside the aircraft’s giant nose at its powerful AN/APQ-170 radar. The AN/APQ-170 is the reason for the MC-130H’s unique snout, which makes it quickly distinguishable from other C-130 variants. It’s also offers robust terrain-following and terrain avoidance capabilities that all but two of the newer MC-130J Commando II ‘s lack, a glaring issue the War Zone has reported on in detail in the past, which is why the Combat Talon IIs remains in service at all nearly a decade after the type’s original sunset date. The video, which the 1st Special Operations Wing posted on the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service website on Dec. 30, 2019, shows members of the 901st Special Operations Maintenance Squadron working on the AN/APQ-170 radar, navigation system, and communications equipment on an MC-130H, serial number 89-0282, at Hurlburt Field in Florida. The 901st’s specific job is to train maintenance personnel to work on the Combat Talon IIs, 18 of which remain in service. Those aircraft are assigned to the 15th Special Operations Squadron, an operational unit, and the 19th Special Operations Squadron, which is responsible for training new aircrews for MC-130H and J models, as well as AC-130 gunship variants . The highlight of the clip is definitely seeing MC-130H’s nose radome open, which is done by unhooking various latches and then sliding it forward along an integral rail assembly inside. The entire nose assembly is massive compared to one found on a standard C-130H Hercules airlifter, or any other cargo-carrying C-130 variant for that matter, and is much bigger even than the one on its predecessor, the MC-130E Combat Talon . The Combat Talon was the Air Force’s first dedicated special operations transport variant of the venerable C-130. Even with the extra room, the AN/APQ-170 fits snugly inside. The radar has seen a number of upgrades and modifications to improve its performance and reliability, but the general configuration remains largely the same. The system includes an X-band array mounted on top of two oscillating Ku-band arrays. As a mechanically scanned radar, the pair of dishes moving back and forth below helps the entire system scan faster than it would with just a single array. In the video clip, the personnel from the 901st are seen preparing to replace the X-band component. A complete AN/APQ-170 radar undergoing maintenance. The X-band component on top and the Ku-band components below are clearly visible., USAF The result is a multi-function radar suite than can provide traditional navigation and weather detection capabilities, as well as terrain following and mapping functionality. That latter of these modes, which allows for low-altitude penetration in any weather, are absolutely critical for the MC-130H’s core mission of providing a platform that is able to fly into denied areas in order to insert, extract, or resupply special operations forces. The Air Force has been exploring the possibility of acquiring a more survivable platform, such as a stealth transport aircraft, to perform this mission in the face of increasingly dense and capable hostile air defenses. The service has also explored major modifications to its various MC-130 variants to ensure they remain as relevant as possible in the future. You can read about these developments in this past two-part War Zone feature . However, to remain as hidden from hostile air defenses as possible in the meantime, the Combat Talon IIs fly operational missions at night and at extremely low, nap of the earth altitudes, while following routes that exploit terrain features in order to further mask their approach. This requires a very capable and reliable radar with terrain-following and terrain-avoidance capabilities, such as the AN/APQ-170. The MC-130Hs also have a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras underneath the nose that provides additional situational awareness. An MC-130H Combat Talon II. The aircraft’s sensor turret is visible under its large nose radome, which houses the AN/APQ-170 radar., Carlos Menendez San Juan via Wikimedia As important as the AN/APQ-170 is to the Combat Talon II, it almost didn’t come to be. The Air Force had hoped to avoid the cost of internally developing a specialized terrain-following and terrain avoidance capable radar, as it had done with the MC-130E. It had gone so far as to stop production of the AN/APQ-122(V)8 found on the Combat Talon, which, by the 1980s, cost between $8 and $10 million apiece, or between $19 and nearly $24 million in 2019 dollars, according to The Praetorian STARShip : The untold story of the Combat Talon , an official Air Force historical monograph. An MC-130E Combat Talon with its own distinct nose radome housing the AN/APQ-122(V)8 radar, which is still notably smaller than the one on the MC-130H. , Adrian Pingstone via Wikimedia The Air Force wanted a cheaper radar and hired IBM to build it. IBM, in turn, subcontracted the work to Emerson Electric, who developed what became the AN/APQ-170. The radar program ran into so much trouble it almost scuttled the MC-130H project entirely. With no alternative immediately available, the service decided to push ahead with the Emerson Electric product, delaying the entry into service of the first Combat Talon II until 1991. At that time, each radar cost $20 million, equivalent to nearly $38 million today, according to The Praetorian STARShip . As such, the radar alone accounted for more than a tenth of the each MC-130H’s $160 million unit cost. Difficulties in acquiring AN/APQ-170s and spare parts to go with them, together with continuing reliability issues, plagued the MC-130Hs in their early years. The Air Force initially took delivery of the Combat Talon II seen in the recent maintenance video, serial number 89-0282, in 1994 without a functioning X-band component installed. The radome also presented problems, particularly in not keeping everything warm enough to prevent icing in cold weather. Despite updates and modifications, including a new radome heating and anti-icing system, by the mid-1990s, Praetorian STARShip says that the Air Force had completely given up on its requirement for the AN/APQ-170 to work for an average of 191 hours without a major failure. By the end of the decade, the service had initiated plans for yet another upgrade program, resulting in what was known as the AN/APQ-170(V)1-425 configuration, which had a so-called “mean time between failure” rate of 75 hours. By around 2000, all MC-130Hs had received this new version of the radar. An MC-130H seen in 1999., Mike Freer via Wikimedia Given this experience, it seems somewhat curious that the Air Force has ended going down a similar route , with similar results, when deciding on the radar for the new MC-130J Commando II. This new special operations transport version of the C-130 uses the same AN/APN-241 multi-function radar as the standard C-130J airlifter, which provides some nominal amount of terrain-following and terrain avoidance capability. You can read more in detail about the MC-130J’s own radar saga in this past War Zone piece , but suffice to say, testing showed that the AN/APN-241 was unsafe to use for the kind of extreme low-level flying the Air Force Special Operations Command conducts with its MC-130Hs. There is now a program in the works to add a dedicated terrain-following and terrain avoidance capable radar, the AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight, to the Commando IIs. As of May 2019, there were only two MC-130Js in testing with the new radar fit. An MC-130J Commando II with the AN/APQ-187 seen with its black radome mounted on top of the aircraft’s nose., Lockheed Martin capture The Air Force had planned to retire the Combat Talon IIs entirely by 2012, but has significantly slowed this process in light of the limited capabilities of the Commando IIs. The plan now is to retain at least some MC-130Hs until the Silent Knight-equipped MC-130J proves it can match its capabilities and there are sufficient numbers of those aircraft to meet the demands of the U.S. special operations community. As such, the MC-130Hs and their complex and expensive AN/APQ-170 radar, which have now been in service for nearly 30 years and are some of the oldest special operations aircraft in U.S. military service at present, look set to continue flying demanding, super-low-level, night-time special operations missions for at least a few more years.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Xi’an Aircraft Company, which makes China’s most prominent large aircraft, among other responsibilities, has its primary plant located at the sprawling Yanliang Air Base that also houses China’s Flight Test Establishment, as well as academic institutions that deal with aircraft design. Beyond being a strategic production line for China’s aerospace industry, the installation supports testing for the vast majority of aircraft within the People’s Liberation Army’s stable and executes avionics and other systems integration work for those aircraft. As of late, Xi’an has been building China a fleet of airlifters that can help make its geopolitical aspirations abroad a reality, as well as providing updated long-range bombers to support its emerging anti-access military strategy. In a high-resolution satellite image we exclusively obtained from Planet Labs that was taken just 48 hours ago, the breakneck pace of Y-20 strategic transport production is abundantly clear. The photo of the base includes no less than 20 Y-20s, the most we have ever seen at the installation based on a number of high-resolution images available for review that span a number of years. PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Although it is far less exciting than its indigenous fighter jet counterparts , the Xi’an Y-20 is just as, if not more important, when it comes to China realizing its extra-territorial ambitions. Being able to haul outsized loads over international distances with an aircraft that does not rely primarily on support from foreign entities gives Beijing the high-speed logistical reach it needs to support its growing number of bases and military engagements far beyond the Chinese mainland. In other words, the Y-20 is essential to China’s core foreign policy and defense strategy. PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Like many Chinese military aircraft designs , the main limitation for the Y-20, which is loosely analogous to the C-17 , remains its engines, which are currently Russian low-bypass Soloviev D-30KP-2 turbofans. The goal is to equip the type with the indigenous WS-20 high-bypass turbofan that will allow the aircraft design to reach its maximum potential and rid the type of any significant foreign dependence. Flight testing is underway to do just that, but the WS-20 isn’t slated for production until 2024 , and that is just an estimated timetable. Regardless, the fact that China is punching these airlifters out at a seemingly dizzying rate underlines its foreign policy objectives and the growing might of the Chinese military overall. Also, it is worth noting that the U.S. no longer has a strategic airlifter in production after shuttering the C-17 plant in Long Beach after the last C-17 rolled off its line in 2015. PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Also seen scattered about the base are 17 Xi’an H-6 bombers. Now in its drastically upgraded H-6K form , along with its derivatives, these bombers, which draw their design lineage from the 1950s Soviet Badger, are the backbone of the People’s Liberation Army’s long-range aviation enterprise and perform a large variety of roles beyond traditional bomber and cruise missile delivery missions. These include acting as the mothership for outsized high-speed drones and massive air-launched ballistic missiles . Until China’s stealthy bombers come online in the future, the H-6 will represent the tip of the airborne strategic spear for the PLA and clearly Beijing is investing in the platform accordingly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 27, 2021",Bizarre Airstrip Is Being Built Right Between Apartment Towers Near Libyan Capital,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new airstrip is emerging in the middle of a residential development, with part of its runway sandwiched right between towering apartment blocks, just outside Libya’s official capital Tripoli. This comes amid reports that Turkey has begun deploying fighters from Syria as part of its increasingly active support for the internationally recognized Government of National Accord, or GNA. The GNA is currently locked in grueling civil conflict, which you can read about more in this recent in-depth War Zone piece , with the Libyan National Army, or LNA, and its leader Khalifa Haftar. Haftar enjoys the support of the United Arab Emirates , Egypt, and Russia , among others. On Dec. 30, 2019, pro-LNA social media accounts shared video purporting to show Turkish personnel working on the airstrip on the site of the former Mashrou Al-Moz development, also known as the Banana Project, in the town of Ain Zara, which is situated approximately five miles southeast of the center of Tripoli.  Even with reports of Turkish involvement, we don’t know who is actually building the strip or for what purpose, but the area remains under GNA control and satellite imagery shows that it is unmistakably under construction. A map showing the location of the new airstrip in Ain Zara, as well as Tripoli’s Mitga International Airport to the north., Google Maps Satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows that an area approximately 3,500 feet in length has been cleared for a single runway. As of Dec. 25,  approximately half of it was paved. Additional images show that work to clear the site first began sometime between Nov. 25 and Dec. 4, while the paving began between Dec. 16 and Dec. 22. A high resolution of the apartment project before the airstrip construction., Google Earth Some of the first hints of construction on Dec. 3, 2019., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The airstrip as of Dec. 16, 2019, before paving began., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The airstrip as of Dec. 25, 2019. Notice it the strip between two apartment complexes that are roughly 115 feet apart., PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Though we don’t know who specifically is building the airstrip or why, the short 3,500-foot runway, which is also around 105 feet wide, limits the likely possibilities. The paved section also notably runs right between one pair of the Banana Project’s apartment blocks, which sit just 115 feet apart, and straddles others, which makes it even more constrained. This suggests that this airstrip, once completed with or without direct assistance from Turkey, could help support the Government of National Accord’s (GNA) drone operations. The buildings could serve as antenna mounts to increase the range of line-of-sight control links, as well. The GNA reportedly took delivery of three Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s , which can carry small air-to-surface munitions, in May 2019 and had received a total of 12 by the end of the following month. There are reports that the LNA may have destroyed as many as nine of these TB2s as of August 2019, through airstrikes against the airports where they have been operating from, as well as shooting them down with surface-to-air missile systems. Haftar’s forces, which have also been making increasing use of drones that the United Arab Emirates has supplied , shot down an American unmanned aircraft flying near Tripoli in November, as well, but claimed they did so by accident . LNA manned combat jets have subjected the airports in Tripoli, as well as Misrata, another GNA hub situated further East, to repeated airstrikes. At the same time, both sides in the Libyan conflict have found it increasingly difficult to operate and maintain manned aircraft, while combat losses have further shrunk the number of available airframes, as well as pilots , over the years. The LNA’s strikes have also impacted deliveries of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment by air from Turkey. Those chartered cargo flights have notably increased in recent weeks following Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Libyan counterpart Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj signing a deal that included provisions for continued Turkish military assistance to the GNA and opened to the door for a possible direct deployment of Turkish forces into Libya. It’s also worth noting that Erdogan and Sarraj agreed to this deal on Nov. 27, right around when the construction of the airstrip first began. The GNA reportedly asked for direct assistance from the Turkish military on Dec. 19 and Ergodan said on Dec. 26 that he would present a formal plan for doing so to his country’s parliament no later than the first few weeks of January. As it turned out, legislators received that proposal today , though there are no specifics yet about what the Turkish deployment could entail. So, the new airstrip in the Banana Project could signal the impending arrival of additional TB2s as part of a more significant Turkish deployment, or it could simply offer the GNA another alternate launch location to try to make its drone operations less vulnerable to the LNA’s strikes. The apartment blocks could make it difficult, if not impossible for hostile combat jets or artillery to target at least parts of the airstrip directly from certain directions. This could be especially important with regards to Ain Zara, which is not exactly insolated from LNA threats and is actually closer in some directions than Mitga airport in Tripoli to Libya’s fluid front lines. It is well within range of Haftar’s artillery, which has been shelling the Banana Project site, among others, in recent weeks as part of his latest offensive to try and seize Tripoli. The Turkish unmanned aircraft are also small enough to be relatively rapidly redeployed by truck and Libyan operators reportedly fly them from readily relocatable truck-mounted, road-mobile ground-control stations. This could offer the GNA the possibility of shifting between this new airstrip and other locations, as necessary. A Ukranian TB2 with truck-mounted ground-control stations seen behind it. Libya’s Government of National Accord has recieved TB2s along with these same road-mobile ground-control stations., Ukroboronprom The runway could also support lighter manned aircraft and helicopters moving forces in and out of the Banana Project area. Various GNA-aligned forces have used the site as a staging area in the past. The paving of the runway also started shortly after still-unconfirmed reports emerged in Turkish media outlets suggesting that Turkey would build a physical base somewhere in Libya to support its increasing involvement in the conflict. Other reports have also said that Turkish warships could patrol off the coast of GNA-controlled areas, while Turkish aircraft and helicopters would deploy to Misrata, to the east of Tripoli, to actively support GNA operations, none of which appears to have occurred as of yet. There are additional unconfirmed reports that Turkey has begun airlifting ethnic Turkmen and other fighters from areas of northwestern Syria to Libya to bolster GNA positions. Turkish Air Force A400M transport aircraft are reportedly flying these individuals to locations in Turkey, where they then board chartered airline flights as part of emerging air bridge. On Dec. 27, Bloomberg first reported that the Turkish government had met with various groups it supports in Syria about entering the Libyan conflict with the promise of monetary incentives. Mercenaries and other foreign fighters, as well as troops from various national militaries, ostensibly acting as advisors, have been important components of both GNA and LNA-aligned forces for some time now. Using fighters from Syria would offer Turkey a way to infuse additional armed personnel with at least some combat experience onto the GNA front lines without necessarily having to take the far more politically fraught step of sending its own troops. The speaker of Libya’s parliament now spoken out against an actual Turkish deployment and said that Sarraj had no authority to put the deal with Turkey into force at all without approval from legislators. Russia has sent members of the shadowy Wagner private military company , which is heavily linked to Russian intelligence services , to support Haftar in recent months for similar reasons. A curious charter flight from Syria last week might indicate that Russia redeployed even more Wagner personnel to Libya as the LNA’s latest push toward Tripoli stalled . With regards to the new airstrip outside Tripoli, whatever its purpose is and whoever is building it, there is strong evidence that it is related to Turkey’s increasingly active involvement in the Libyan conflict, which appears to be prompting similar escalation from other outside actors. After announcing plans to possibly send troops to Libya, Ergodan had subsequently traveled to Tunisia to also meet with his counterpart there, Kais Saied, about more actively supporting the government in Tripoli. Haftar is now in Egypt to appeal to that country for additional support in light of Turkish moves. Authorities in Cario are in the midst of their own emerging spat with the counterparts in Ankara over maritime boundaries, another component of the recent deal between Erogdan and Sarraj, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . All told, the situation in Libya seems to be evolving very rapidly now and the basic character of the conflict appears to be entering an entirely new and uncertain phase.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",U.S. Strikes Back At Iranian Proxy Forces In Iraq And Syria After Deadly Rocket Attack (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American warplanes struck five separate facilities in Iraq and Syria on December 29th, 2019 in retaliation to a rocket attack on Iraq’s K-1 base near Kirkuk where several U.S. personnel were wounded and an American contractor was killed. The strikes, which occurred roughly 48 hours after the rocket attack, targeted Kata’ib Hezbollah , a militant group that has a long history of fighting U.S. forces in the region and one that is directly supported by Iran and its Quds Force. Tensions are already extremely high between the U.S. and Iran. After these somewhat unprecedented airstrikes, it can be argued that the possibility of a larger outbreak in violence between the two bitter foes has increased markedly. A statement from Pentagon about the strikes reads as follows: In response to repeated Kata’ib Hizbollah (KH) attacks on Iraqi bases that host Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) coalition forces, U.S. forces have conducted precision defensive strikes against five KH facilities in Iraq and Syria that will degrade KH’s ability to conduct future attacks against OIR coalition forces. The five targets include three KH locations in Iraq and two in Syria. These locations included weapon storage facilities and command and control locations that KH uses to plan and execute attacks on OIR coalition forces. Recent KH strikes included a 30-plus rocket attack on an Iraqi base near Kirkuk that resulted in the death of a U.S. citizen and injured four U.S. service members and two members of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). KH has a strong linkage with Iran’s Quds Force and has repeatedly received lethal aid and other support from Iran that it has used to attack OIR coalition forces. The OIR coalition is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS and provide advice and assistance to the ISF. The U.S. and its coalition partners fully respect Iraqi sovereignty, and support a strong and independent Iraq. The U.S., however, will not be deterred from exercising its right of self-defense. It is important to note that KH attacks have also injured multiple members of the ISF. Secretary Esper and Prime Minister Mahdi have shared with each other their commitment to see these KH attacks on ISF and OIR forces cease once and for all. Iran and their KH proxy forces must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces, and respect Iraq’s sovereignty, to prevent additional defensive actions by U.S. forces. Concern over Iran’s increasingly powerful proxies in Iraq has hung over U.S. relations with the country for years, but in recent months, those concerns have elevated to the point of kinetic action. Israel has been running a limited and clandestine air campaign over Iraq that began earlier this year and has focused on striking potentially stockpiles of advanced weapons in the hands of Iranian proxies. Meanwhile, the U.S. has repeatedly warned of intelligence indicating these groups may step up attacks on U.S. interests in Iraq and throughout the region. This supposed change in the intelligence stream prompted major increases in U.S. military might in the Middle East late last Spring. This hardened posture was enhanced further after an unprecedented drone and cruise missile strike at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil production capabilities last September. Now, with the U.S. turning its stance from one of force protection to kinetic actions against these threats, we will have to wait to see how Iran—which has deeply rooted power in the Iraqi government—will respond. In addition, it is unclear if the Iraqi government approved these strikes. If they did not, the act could create another deep wedge between Baghdad and Washington D.C., one that Iran could further capitalize on. We are also tracking some peculiar aircraft movement which may or may not be related to this flare-up of hostilities in the region. Moving more capabilities into Central Command’s area of responsibility would make sense following these unprecedented strikes. UPDATE: 3:33pm PST— The situation is changing rapidly in Iraq in the hours following the U.S. strikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria. There are reports of another rocket attack on a base housing U.S. personnel Iraq: Casualty reports from the strikes are wide-ranging, but all include multiple killed and wounded. Key individuals tied to the group and Iran’s Quds forces are vowing revenge: The Iraqi government appears to have not given its approval for the strikes, which could result in a huge division between the Washington and Baghdad in the hours and days ahead: DoD Multiple reports on social media of a large blast heard in Baghdad’s Green Zone and an increased U.S. military presence there, but these cannot be confirmed at this time. President Trump is meeting with top foreign policy and defense officials at Mar-a-Lago following the strikes: UPDATE: 4:35pm PST— As predicted above, a real rift is emerging here. Iran will do anything it can to capitalize on it and further its influence, both military and political, in Iraq: Once again, the situation remains fluid and some of these details are bound to be revised in the hours to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Navy Wants Special Fabrics That Can Monitor A Pilot’s Health,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking into buying specialized fabric to make biosensing suits for its pilots and aircrew, which would be able to collect physiological data, such as heart rates and deepness of breath. This comes as the service , as well as the U.S. Air Force and NASA , continue to conduct research into and search for solutions to the causes of hypoxia-like symptoms that have plagued pilots across various aircraft types in recent years. The new clothing could also collect more general data on the health and wellness of aviators to improve their performance, avoid injuries, and more. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) released the request for information regarding “physiological monitoring fabrics” for “biosensing garments suitable for Naval aviation” on Dec. 23, 2019. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense editor and good friend of The War Zone , was among the first notice the contracting announcement, highlighting it in a Tweet on Dec. 26. NAVAIR says it wants fabrics that have good elasticity, being able to stretch significantly without breaking and return to their original shape quickly, while also having “excellent next-to-skin comfort.” They also need to pass ASTM International industrial standards for resistance to heat, helping to ensure that they do not “melt or drip” during a fire. This is a particularly important safety requirement as the U.S. military has found in the past that some synthetic fabrics could melt and stick to skin , causing or exacerbating already serious burns that personnel might suffer during combat or accidents. Biosensing clothing isn’t new , having been in use in the professional athletic world for years now. Typically these garments use fabrics with interwoven silver fibers or other materials that can sense physiological changes, such as increases and decreases in heat or pressure. They then convey that information to a small, wearable computer that can interpret this information as a faster or slower heart rate or deeper or shallower breathing. Wireless links then often display the desired information on an individual’s smartphone or other devices via an app. Altogether, this kind of “smart clothing” operates similarly in many respects to other kinds of wearable health and fitness devices, such the Fitbit . NAVAIR’s contracting notice does not say what its specific requirement is for the biosensing garments, but one immediate use for smart clothing could certainly be to help the Navy gather information to gain more insight into persistent and often unexplained reports of hypoxia-like symptoms among its aviators. The service actually went looking for suits with built-in physiological sensors to help combat hypoxia back in 2009 , but it’s not immediately clear how far those efforts progressed. Air Force pilots have suffered similar issues over the years , as well. The incidents have occurred with individuals flying a number of aircraft types and potential issues with onboard oxygen generation systems , or OBOGS, have typically been cited as a likely root cause. You can read more about these so-called “physiological events” and what the services have been doing to mitigate them in these past War Zone stories . One of the Navy’s decisions was to, starting in July 2017, begin issuing $450 Garmin Fenix 3 wristwatches to all pilots flying F/A-18C/D Hornets , F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , and EA-18G Growlers . The service has seen some of the most consistent reports of hypoxia-like symptoms from aviators flying these types. Though the Navy primarily purchased the Fenix 3s because they can detect changes in ambient air pressure, as well as provide altitude and course heading information, the watches are also billed as fitness devices and can come equipped with a heart rate monitor and other features. Smart clothing for naval aviators would be able to gather data to provide a much more comprehensive picture of an aviator’s health before, during, and after any physiological event. Combined with health and flight data from other sensors built into the aircraft, this could help the services get a better sense of what pilots are experiencing and why. Networked biosensing flight suits could also send data to ground stations in near-real-time, allowing for offboard monitoring , which means commanders might be able to warn their pilots about potential issues. Hypoxia-like symptoms can include disorientation and confusion, which can make it difficult for an individual to necessarily notice what is going on by themselves. Beyond the hypoxia issue specifically, issuing smart clothing to aviators could simply help build databases of valuable baseline physiological information. Flying fighter jets especially is taxing on the body in many ways that aren’t necessarily well understood. In August 2018, NASA began a program that was primarily aimed at helping to resolve the reported hypoxia issues across the Navy and Air Force. However, the main immediate goal was simply to collect physiological data to help researchers better understand what was normal and abnormal for pilots flying high-performance combat jets. NASA pilot Jim Less tries on a Cobham VigiLOX system connected to his normal oxygen mask. This system collects physiological data, as well as information about the ambient pressure and other environmental factors in the cockpit., NASA “We found that there has been very little investigation surrounding the human in the cockpit,” Clinton Cragg, a principal engineer at the NASA Engineering and Safety Center, explained to members of Congress in 2018 . “We don’t have the amount of oxygen in his mask, the amount of CO2 [carbon dioxcide] in his mask, the pressure you’d want to know about in the cockpit, nor the pilot’s breathing rates. Those types of things are what could help us do a full physiological assessment of what’s happening to the pilot.” Databases of physiological information could also simply help maximize the performance of naval aviators inside and out of their aircraft. The data could allow Navy officials to gain insight into how certain demographic groups, as well as specific individuals, perform athletically in various situations under different circumstances. This, in turn, could help in determine optimal fitness requirements and setting other health-related benchmarks. The collected information could also expose significant trends, such as the occurrence of injuries or other illnesses , and then link them to certain activities or environmental factors. With the help of artificial intelligence-driven algorithms, it might be possible in the future to more quickly spot worrying increases in certain conditions among specific groups, more conclusive determine the root causes, and remedy them. The rest of the U.S. military has also been taking note of the potential benefits biosensing smart clothing in recent years for the same reasons. Just earlier this year, the U.S. Marine Corps issued their own request for information regarding physiological monitoring garments that would allow them to “tailor conditioning and operational training in order to minimize injuries and optimize strength building and overall operational performance.” The U.S. Air Force and Army have also been exploring this kind of technology. All told, no matter how much biosensing flight suits do or don’t ultimately help with determining the causes of reported hypoxia-like symptoms among Navy aviators, these garments could still become standard issue in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 9, 2020",A Big And Bizarre Drone Mystery Is Unfolding In Rural Colorado,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The sparse expanses of Northeast Colorado have become ground zero for a bizarre mystery surrounding sightings of nighttime coordinated flights of groups of drones. From roughly 7 pm to 10 pm every night last week, an estimated 17 drones with six-foot spans have flown “grid patterns” over Phillips County and near its border with neighboring Yuma County, according to Phillips County Sheriff Thomas Elliott. The drones operate at a few hundred feet in the air and were brightly lit with strobing colored and white lights, leaving local residents and those driving through the area baffled. The Denver Post was first to report on the string of strange sightings. Local law enforcement, the FAA, DEA, U.S. Army, and the Air Force have said they have no idea what these aircraft are or who they belong to. The Denver Post writes: The sheriff’s office can’t explain where the drones are coming from or who is flying them. The estimated size and number of drones makes it unlikely that they’re being flown by hobbyists, Undersheriff William Myers said. … On Friday, Myers said he watched eight of the large drones flying along the Yuma County border near the intersection of U.S. 385 and County Road 54. At the same time, a single drone hovered about 25 miles away over the town of Paoli — it didn’t move all night, just hovered over the town — and eight more drones flew over Haxtun, about 10 miles down the road from Paoli, Myers said. “Overhead they were probably doing 30, 40 mph,” he said. “They weren’t racing or flying around with speed.” One resident who spotted a drone last week gave chase, Elliott said, driving behind it at about 50 mph, but lost the drone when he ran out of gas in Washington County. The machines fly too high to be heard from the ground but can be seen by their strobing white lights along with red, blue and green lights, Myers said. … “The way Colorado law is written, none of the statutes fit for harassment or trespassing,” Myers said. “Colorado hasn’t gotten on board with identifying the airspace around your property as the actual premises, so we don’t have anything we could charge.” The FAA does have rules for drones that weigh less than 55 pounds and requires such aircraft to be flown during daylight hours, within sight of the pilot, no higher than 400 feet above the ground, and not over people, among other rules. However, pilots can apply for and receive waivers from the FAA that exempts the pilots from many of those rules. It’s also not clear whether the drones over Phillips and Yuma counties would be governed by those regulations. A drone the size of the ones spotted over the counties likely would weigh more than 55 pounds, Moss said. That means the drone operator would be flying commercially and would likely need to be a “manned aviator” — an actual pilot, Moss said. … Elliott said Monday that the sheriff’s office has received nine calls about the drones since last week. He said residents no longer need to call to report a simple sighting of the drones. “We just want to know if one lands, if we can get our hands on it, or if they see someone operating them, that’s what we’re looking for now,” he said. “We know they exist.” I think people will wonder why there is no video that we know of these sightings. Most amateur video shot of lights in the sky at night has very little value, but regardless, you have to remember that this is happening in very sparsely populated areas after dark. If it was occurring near an urban area, I think the lack of video would be a bit troubling, but in this case, I don’t find it to be, especially considering the level of law enforcement knowledge of these events. People seeing lights in the sky that they don’t understand the origin of happens often, but this case seems far more consistent over a short timespan than something that could be easily blown off. Once again, the fact that law enforcement is well aware of it and discussing it as fact is also telling. This all begs the question, what is going on in this remote section of Colorado? Based strictly on the descriptions conveyed , it sounds like someone or some group is testing a broad-area surveillance capability with lower-end autonomous drones. This could include something as simple as having a group fly a series of planned routes and return with the information gathered via autopilot. By doing so, a group of small, relatively inexpensive drones can cover a large area quickly instead of single, far more expensive assets that could take more time and offer less redundancy. Such a capability could be used for search and rescue, mapping, and general intelligence gathering. This also doesn’t require man-in-the-loop control that would necessitate line-of-sight connectivity. Still, it is really flat terrain with endless farmland in the area where the sightings occurred, which means line-of-sight connectivity could be maximized, especially with the help of a large aerial or small tower, but the grid pattern nature of these flights that the Sheriff describes point to a coordinated and automated flight plan for the drones. The airspace where this is occurring is peculiarly desolate, as well, making it ideally suited for such a task, but the flights are not legally occurring, which makes the whole affair quite suspicious. The fact that the activity is happening after sundown is even more intriguing and adds to the notion that whoever is doing this knows it is outside the bounds of FAA regulations. In addition, it would be very challenging to trace these aircraft back to their place of origin or point of flight termination. The drones could fly the majority of their missions with lights on and turn them off during launch and recovery. With very little ambient light, they would be all but undetectable to the naked eye. Also, remember that drones this size can takeoff from very small areas, so it’s not like a runway is needed or anything like that. As such, they can originate from nearly anywhere. This is basically the area where the sightings are occurring. It’s largely uncontrolled airspace with a very sparse population., VFRmap.com Here you can see the relationship of the area of activity in relation to Denver and nearby Nebraska., VFRmap.com The reality is that an individual or small group with some resources can do this. It doesn’t need to be a federal agency, the military, or some defense or aviation contractor. Although it all sounds relatively innocuous, it is possibly yet another sign of the potential threats small, commercially available unmanned aircraft pose. If the grid pattern reports are accurate and autonomous waypoint navigation is being used by these drones, it can be posited that similar basic concepts of operation were used in the game-changing attack on Saudi oil facilities in September. Furthermore, drones of this size can carry a relevant payload of deadly explosives instead of surveillance or electronic warfare gear . 17 drones flying at once that can surveil a broad area could be re-roled by a nefarious actor to strike 17 pinpoint fixed targets near-simultaneously , or swarm against a single high value one from multiple directions. This is the same drum I have been beating for years, and eventually, this threat will materialize in the continental United States as it has overseas . With that in mind, this type of event—which we will only see more of in the future—shouldn’t be treated as just some interesting curiosity. There is no need to panic, but the mystery behind these aircraft should be solved and whoever is doing it should receive some sort of penalty for executing these types of operations outside of FAA regulations, even if there isn’t a dark agenda behind the activity. Some will say this is an overreaction, but those are probably the same people that laughed when some of us started warning of the potential threat of small drones being used unlawfully and for very negative purposes years ago. Regardless, a skyborne mystery is afoot in Colorado. It will be interesting to see if the flights continue and if the description of these sightings holds up. We will keep you updated as we find out more about these strange events. Update: 4:45pm PST— It is worth noting that not far where these drones were sighted, F.E. Warren Air Force Base’s intercontinental ballistic missile fields begin. Roughly 30 miles northwest of Haxtun. It is something to at least keep in mind as the story unfolds.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020","Congress Pushes Back On Stunning Navy Plan To Cut Destroyers, Cruisers, Subs, And More","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S.  Navy could scale back purchases of new destroyers , attack submarines , frigates , cargo ships , as well as retire early a number of cruisers and littoral combat ships , under a new budget plan taking shape in the Pentagon. The ostensible goal of the proposal is to free up funds for other shipbuilding efforts, including new fleets of unmanned surface and undersea vehicles, but the service is already finding itself in a battle with Congress over funding priorities before it has even finalized its pitch. Defense News ‘ David Larter explored the specifics of the plan , which was outlined in a memo from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) earlier this year, in a recent set of articles . Breaking Defense had first reported that a total of 24 ships, both new production vessels and existing hulls, could get cut from the Navy’s long-term shipbuilding and force structure plans over the next five to 10 years under this proposal. This same OMB document had also called on the Navy to craft a proposal for including unmanned platforms its so-called “battle force” inventory, which has historically only included larger, manned surface warships, submarines, and auxiliaries. The service has a standing goal to obtain a Battle Force with at least 355 ships, a benchmark Congress has enshrined in law. Earlier in December, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly had issued his own memo saying that one of his five immediate objectives was finding a path to a 355-ship fleet within the next decade. Proposed shipbuilding totals through Fiscal Year 2025 per the OMB memo., OMB via Defense News The projected Battle Force inventory included in the Navy’s most recent long-term shipbuilding plan, which it released in March 2019., USN It’s not entirely clear how the present plan will service this goal, given that it could shrink the total size of the Battle Force from around 290 ships today to around 287 by 2025, according to Breaking Defense . The proposal includes cutting five of the 12 advanced Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers that the Navy expects to receive over the next five years, along with one Virginia class attack submarine and one FFG(X) frigate. The Navy has not yet chosen the design it will buy under the FFG(X) program , but wants to buy 20 examples of whatever ship it picks, in total, through 2030. It’s worth noting that the Navy has been exploring the idea of acquiring a new Large Surface Combatant (LSC) in lieu of new destroyers since at least 2018, with senior officials saying in the past that hullform has reached its structural limits and cannot adequately support future requirements. At the same time, the LSC remains largely undefined and there have been indications that a new derivative of the Arleigh Burke may be the only logical path forward, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone piece . A breakdown of the new features on the Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers compared to its predecessors., GAO The OMB’s memo also called for a halt to the Common Hull Auxiliary Multi-Mission Platform (CHAMP) program and the development of a new alternative concept in its place. As its name implies, CHAMP has been focused on acquiring a fleet of auxiliaries with common hulls to take on a host of roles, including sealift , aviation logistics support , hospital , repair tender , and command and control . The ships currently performing these tasks are aging and increasingly difficult to operate and maintain. There have been growing fears that this could limit the availability of vital sealift capabilities, in particular, in a future large scale conflict, something you can read about in much greater detail in these past War Zone stories . Right now, the Navy expects to get its first CHAMP ship, a sealift variant, in 2025. An infographic about a proposal from Huntington Ingalls Industries to use the hullform from its San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious ships as a common starting place for new auxiliaries., Huntington Ingalls Industries Beyond the cuts to new shipbuilding, the proposal also calls for increasing the speed at which the Navy retires its Ticonderoga class cruisers . The plan in OMB’s memo would see 13 of those warships leave service by 2025, up from the nine presently scheduled to head into mothballs in that same timeframe. In addition, the Navy would retire the first two examples of both the Freedom and Independence class Littoral Combat Ships . These ships have already been relegated to training and test roles, but the service had planned to put them together with other manned and unmanned surface combatants in its new Surface Development Squadron One. This unit stood up earlier this year and is already set to be responsible for all three of the Zumwalt class stealth destroyers , two of which are already in service, as well as the Sea Hunter experimental unmanned surface vessels. The first-in-class USS Zumwalt , in the foreground, sails with the first-in-class USS Independence ., USN It’s important to point out that the plan in the OMB memo is not necessarily the final proposal that the Navy will include in its budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, a public version of which should come out sometime between February and March 2020. The exact justifications for the spending shifts and how the service expects to fill the resulting force structure gaps remain to be seen. However, many of the decisions already on the table have begun to incite the ire of legislators who will have a final say over the budget. This opposition is likely to grow in the near term. For instance, Congress has pushed back against retiring Ticonderoga class cruisers repeatedly in recent years. The Arleigh Burkes are set to continue to be the Navy’s primary surface combatant for years to come, which could make cuts there another hard sell, especially with the Large Surface Combatant still so undefined. The Virginia class is equally central to the service’s future submarine force plans. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Shiloh , one of the ships that has been eyed for earlier retirement in the past., USN It may be easier to get support for cutting the original four Littoral Combat Ships, which, as noted, have already been sidelined and assigned only non-combat roles, but many legislators remain proponents of the LCS program despite the continually underwhelming performance of the ships. Congress has also been skeptical of the FFG(X) program, especially how heavily it has been considering non-U.S. warship designs. Lawmakers have already pushed through legislation that could upend those plans by requiring the use of a certain amount of American-made parts and materials, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . In addition, there have also been general concerns in recent years about ensuring the stability of the shipbuilding industrial base, which could be threatened by major changes in production totals and timeframes. Building warships and submarines is an inherently long lead time affair that involves establishing complex supply chains and recruiting and retaining highly training workforces. Legislators representing districts where the ships in question are built simply have interests in preserving the jobs and other economic benefits that come along with keeping shipyards working without significant interruptions, too. All of this applies to major overhauls and other regular maintenance work , as well. All told, the proposal OMB has outlined seems almost guaranteed to generate the kind of criticism from Congress that the Navy most recently received with its curious plan to retire the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman years ahead of schedule. The service eventually abandoned that idea in the face of a massive backlash from lawmakers. The OMB memo reportedly shows that the White House actually rejected a second attempt from the Navy to try and cut Truman from the budget. As was the case with the attempt to retire Truman early, all of this raises questions about whether the real goal of this latest proposal is to try to convince Congress to increase funding for shipbuilding efforts across the board. At the end of the debacle, legislators agreed to a block buy of two Ford class carriers and to pay for the Truman ‘s overhaul to keep it in service. The Navy continues to argue that it needs to purchase a large number of new ships and submarines and that it has to make hard choices to work within existing budget constraints. In particular, the acquisition of new and extremely expensive Columbia class ballistic missile submarines, critical to ensuring the United States’ nuclear deterrent capabilities, is repeatedly cited as a core issue in long-term budget planning. Congress has already allowed the Pentagon and the Navy to use novel funding mechanisms to try to mitigate the impact of buying these submarines has on other shipbuilding priorities, but concerns remain about whether yet more funding may be necessary to keep production of the Columbias on schedule . The costs the Navy has already incurred as it struggles to get the first-in-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford ready for actual operations , which are likely to continue to grow at least in the near term, has been another drain on shipbuilding resources. The service has taken steps to try to mitigate cost growth in the acquisition of future Ford class carriers, notably the aforementioned block buy, and President Donald Trump recently enacted new cost caps on those ships with the signing of the latest National Defense Authorization Act policy bill. Whatever the Navy’s exact plans might be, criticism of the still unfinalized budget proposal has already begun to come from members of Congress in Mississippi , which is home to a number of shipyards that could see major impacts if the plan goes ahead. Many legislators have expressed concern about the speed with which the service is moving ahead with what they feel are unproven unmanned platforms, as well as other technologies, despite the enormous capability and cost benefits they promise in support of increasingly distributed operations, especially in the Pacific Region. The War Zone has explored these issues in depth on multiple occasions in the past. “I’d remind the Pentagon that through the authorization and appropriations processes, Congress will ultimately decide the sizes of our manned and unmanned fleets,” Representative Steven Palazzo, a Republican, said in a statement . “Now more than ever we need these multi-mission ships to fight against the real threats from countries like Russia and China. I find it doubtful that Congress would buy into this plan to limit construction of destroyers while we are actively working to rebuild our military.” “The Navy’s goal of 355 ships is the law of the land, and I am committed to working with President Trump to ensure our shipbuilders on the Mississippi Gulf Coast have the resources they need to remain the premier supplier of Navy ships,” Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, who was responsible for enshrining the 355-ship requirement in law, said in a separate statement . “Destroyers have been the backbone of our Navy’s fleet for decades, and I do not see that changing any time soon.” All told, the Navy is clearly in the process of ironing out a new vision for how it will build a 355-ship fleet and what types of ships it will include in that force in the years to come. At the same time, the service is already butting heads with Congress over exactly what mix of ships and capabilities represents the best path forward to meet that long-standing goal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 16, 2019",USAF Is Spending Millions To Upgrade Turkey Bases Amid Turkish Threats To Kick Them Out,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has announced that it will pay eight different Turkish firms tens of millions of dollars to update the infrastructure and complete other construction projects at facilities it operates in that country over the next five years. This comes amid threats from Turkey’s government, including from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to suspend or outright terminate American access to various bases in the country, including Incirlik Air Base , where the United States presently stores approximately 50 B61 nuclear bombs . The Pentagon announced the Air Force deals, worth $95 million in total, in its daily contracting announcement on Dec. 23, 2019. The notice does not say how much each of the Turkish companies received. The Air Force only considered offers from local companies in accordance with the U.S.-Turkey Defense Economic Cooperation Agreement (DECA), which the two countries signed in 1980 and includes guarantees for Turkish participation in military construction projects. The contracting announcement does not say what bases in Turkey will see construction projects under the deals, but does say they will be limited to Air Force facilities. The contracts cover “design-build, partial design, and full design infrastructure requirements” and the “work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories for the military base facilities of Air Force and support units within Turkey,” according to the notice. Though Incirlik is the best known of American facilities in Turkey, the U.S. military had eight major operating locations in the country as of September 2017, according to the most recent publicly available Department of Defense Base Structure Report. The Air Force is the lead service at seven of those sites, with the U.S. Army being responsible for operations at the Kurecik Radar Station, near the city of Malatya, also known as Site K, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . The relevant portions from the most recent publicly available Department of Defense Base Structure Report., DOD The approximate locations of Air Force-managed facilities in Turkey as of September 2017. From left to right: Cigli Air Base, Izmir Air Station, the Ankara Administration Office, the Yumurtalik Petroleum Products Storage Annex, Batman Air Base, and Mus Air Base., Google Maps Air Force facilities in Turkey have been important staging bases for U.S. forces, including special operations forces , operating in the region, especially against ISIS in neighboring Syria. Turkey also continues to exist in a strategically important position along the Black Sea and Russia’s southern flank . The Turkish companies now under contract to the Air Force could perform work as mundane as repaving roads and runways, renovating underground piping for water and sewage, and other general infrastructure-related work, based on planned U.S. military projects in Turkey outlined in Pentagon budget documents in recent years. It could also include more intensive projects, such as renovating larger existing facilities, such as housing or office buildings, or erecting entirely new facilities. It’s possible that the Turkish companies could find themselves involved in the design and construction of new or revised security features, even at the part of Incirlik where the B61 bombs are stored. In 2015, Turkey’s Kuanta Construction, working as a subcontractor to the Aselsan Cooperation, built a new security perimeter for the so-called “NATO area” of that base where the nuclear weapons are secured. An annotated satellite image from 2015 showing locations related to the storage of US B61 nuclear bombs at Incirlik Air Base and improvements being made to security there at the time., Google Earth/FAS Whatever the Air Force expects the Turkish contractors to do, with the work expected to run through at least 2024, at least a portion of the contracts could very well become moot. U.S. relations with Turkey have been steadily eroding since a coup attempt against Erdogan in 2016 and have experienced an even more pronounced chill following the Turkish military’s decision to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems the following year. The S-400 deal had already led the Pentagon to boot Turkey form the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program over operational security concerns, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . There is still the looming threat of U.S. sanctions over the purchase of the Russian air defense systems. In addition, there have been growing calls in Congress for even harsher punitive actions against Turkey in light of its military intervention into Northern Syria, which began in October 2019 and has been aimed primarily at U.S.-backed forces, which are predominately Kurdish. “If this is necessary, together with our delegations, we will close down Incirlik if necessary,” President Erdogan said in an interview on Turkey’s A Haber television network on Dec. 15, 2019, following U.S. lawmakers’ passage of a resolution recognizing the genocide of ethnic Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. “If it is necessary for us to take such a step, of course we have the authority.” “If they are threatening us with these sanctions, of course we will be retaliating,” he continued. Air Force personnel conduct construction activities at Diyarbakir Air Base in Turkey in 2015. Diyarbakir, also known as Site D, is another base in the country that US forces have used on a contingency basis in the past., USAF Erdogan also threatened to shut down Site K in the same interview. It’s unclear whether these threats extend to other American facilities in the country. The U.S. is already considering finally pulling the B61s out of Incirlik and there are unconfirmed reports that it may have already begun doing so. The Turkish President has adopted increasingly authoritarian policies in recent years and stoked unsubstantiated conspiracy theories of direct U.S. involvement in the 2016 coup attempt, and has moved his country closer to Russia’s sphere of influence, as well. Turkey is also deepening its commitments to the internationally-recognized government of Libya and has prompted a major maritime dispute as a result of a recent deal with Libyan authorities, issues you can read about in great detail in this War Zone piece , which are examples of increasingly assertive foreign policy. Other Turkish officials have made similar remarks in recent weeks, as well. “We will evaluate the worst-case scenario and in the event of a decision to sanction Turkey, the Incirlik and Kurecik airbases can be brought to the agenda,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Dec. 12, 2019, in his own televised interview . Cavusoglu had also made similar threats earlier in the year and Turkish officials have done so on multiple occasions in the past without following through, but U.S.-Turkish relations seem especially strained at present. Turkey has suspended certain types of U.S. access to Incirlik, in particular, on multiple occasions in the past. U.S. sanctions themselves could upend the military contracts with the various Turkish firms, depending on how severely they restrict the U.S. government’s ability to do business in the country. A proposed sanctions package presently making its way through Congress would enact close to a total arms embargo against Turkey, but would not outright prohibit the U.S. government from contracting with companies there to provide services to American forces. Addition restrictions imposed under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA , could also create hurdles. It is important to note that there are provisions in both CAASTA and the proposed legislation for waivers in light of national security concerns. When any sanctions might take effect and what form they might take remains to be seen. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have argued against sanctions and other actions that are critical of Turkey as they seek to try to negotiate with Turkey to resolve the S-400 issue and other impasses. US President Donald Trump, at left, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during the latter’s visit to Washington, D.C. in November., Kyodo via AP Images So, in the meantime, Turkish contractors will be getting to work on various construction projects at U.S. facilities, even if it’s not clear what the future will hold for American forces in the country.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 12, 2020",Su-57 Felon Advanced Fighter Crashes In Russia (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian Su-57 has crashed roughly 68 miles from the Komsomolsk-on-Amur aircraft plant in Russia’s Far East. The jet belonged to Sukhoi and was executing a flight test at the time of the incident. The pilot ejected and was recovered alive by an Mi-8 search and rescue helicopter not long after the crash. It is the first total loss of a Su-57, although one of the type’s T-50 prototypes was badly damaged due to an engine fire in 2014. Just over a dozen T-50/Su-57s have been delivered since the type first flew nearly a decade ago. For a time, it looked as if production was in doubt, especially as an export partner for the jet remains elusive , but the Russian Ministry of Defense announced it would order 76 of the advanced fighters last May. Specialized weapons continue to be developed for the jet and the advanced fighter is being used to test interoperability with the country’s “Hunter” unmanned combat air vehicles. You can read more about the Su-57’s unique strengths and weaknesses in this past feature of ours. Update: 2:38 AM PST— TASS reports that a flight control system failure caused the crash, with one source stating it had to do with the aircraft’s tail control surfaces. Interfax reports the aircraft was the first production Su-57 ever and it was supposed to be delivered to the Russian Air Force by year’s end. If this is the case, it would be a significant blow to the program on a number of levels. We will update this article with more information as it comes available. Update: 6:40 AM PST— TV Zvezda , an official outlet of the Russian Ministry of Defense, says that Su-57 exploded when it hit the ground and was totally destroyed. Multiple outlets are also now reporting that aircraft was indeed the first serial production example. State-run media outlet RIA Novosti has reported that the mishap occurred during an engine test , but it remains unclear if engine trouble was the actual cause of the accident.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are all about for sale listings that allow civilians to turn tactical into practical. From air defense bunkers to satellite communications installations , there are some bizarrely awesome opportunities for creative property investors looking to turn someone or some organization’s product of extremely expensive mission requirements into something else entirely for pennies on the dollar. But usually, when defense-related installations and facilities go up for sale, we know the owner. That’s doesn’t appear to be the case for this mysterious, but awesome piece of property for sale that is located just 10 miles east of Savannah, Tennessee—one that appears equally suited for becoming a private lair or for training a mercenary strike force. Our good friend and contributor Matt Hartman of Shorealone Films spotted the $8,650,000 listing and sent it our way. Wilks Ranch Brokers of Texas is representing the seller of the 6,200-acre property that includes a somewhat peculiar airfield at its apex, one that is complete with an air traffic control tower and two relatively large hangars. The airstrip is also remarkably wide for its length. The listing reads in part: Highly improved recreational ranch with private airfield, excellent interior roads, live streams, timber, and a large abundance of wildlife. Paved road access and some paved private interior roads. Estimated over $1,000,000 spent in private ranch road network. Improvements: 2,300 x 100+/- airstrip with a control tower and two hangars. Two very nice metal insulated hangars each one is 3,500 +/- square feet. Four nicer modular buildings on property. Large double- winged equipment shed with central insulated shop and office quarters. Fiber optic line had been laid to the interior of the ranch. 4 large, high- elevation observation tower stations scattered throughout the ranch provide magnificent views of both landscape and wildlife. Interior Roads: Over 10.5 miles of engineered high- grade all- weather private roads, some of which are paved. Many more miles of natural base interior roads traverse off the main roads, completing a network to which very few other ranches would compare. With no public roads/access through the heart of the ranch, this provides a very unique, large private setting. The infrastructure improvements including the roads and runway were constructed in 2010. All other improvements on the property were constructed from 2011 to 2012. Ranch Amenities: Water is in abundance with several ponds and streams, including some live streams. The topographic changes throughout the ranch provide many conducive lake site potentials. Water wells provide water to the newer structures. Elevation changes from the peaks of many large hills overlooking vast areas down to numerous creek bottoms. Although there are large draws and big hills, the topsoil is considerably good throughout the elevation changes, which provides excellent growth across the ranch. Land: 3,000 +/- acres of pine timber varying from 8 to 11 years old. 2,500 +/- acres of hardwood timber varying from young to older mature trees. 350 +/- acres of rolling pasture grass fields. Wildlife: Hunting has not been allowed on this ranch for many years. Such a large contiguous block of desirable natural habitat for wildlife without historical hunting pressure is very hard to find. Wildlife is easily viewed from vehicles while driving around the ranch. Morning and evening daylight hours produce consistent viewing of deer and turkey out in the roads. As an example, all the pictures and video of deer where taken one evening over approximately an hour, from a vehicle, while on the ranch. Although wooded now, there are many acres of historical fields on the ranch that could be put back to use for wildlife or commercial farming. The infrastructure, habitat, and wildlife are in place to be utilized as a top end hunting retreat. Check out the video tour and images below: Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Wilks Ranch Brokers Yeah, I know what you are thinking, we are thinking the same—”what the heck is this place?” It does seem like some sort of government-related installation. There are some odd features seen in satellite images that are not discussed in the listing, one of which looks like a small military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) training site and test area. There is no lodge or luxury accommodations, either. This wasn’t some entertainment getaway for a rich person. This appears to be some sort of MOUT site. , Google Earth There is also this installation, which we really can’t tell what it is intended for. The pads are also interesting. , Google Earth Yet the airfield is most curious of all. It has a control tower and a very wide runway, two things not commonly found at small private airstrips. Making things even weirder, it doesn’t show up on the VFR map and the runway has no markings whatsoever. That is a lot of trouble to go through building something like this not to have it registered with the FAA. Google Earth So, was this some sort of training and test base for certain three-letter agencies and other security forces? Or at least, was it meant to be? We don’t know for sure at this time, but we reached out to the listing agent to see if we could get more information and we will update this post if indeed we do. What we do know is that this is one hell of a dream property for someone. It looks absolutely gorgeous in the images posted and the fact that it just a short drive from a decent sized town is really an amazing plus. So, if you are comfortable with blowing a cool eight and a half million bucks and always wanted your own commando mountain hideaway and/or training camp, and also have a place to store your light air force, this may be just the opportunity you have been looking for! UPDATE: 12/23/2019 10:20pm PST — We have some great new information about the history of this place. According to multiple sources including one that says he worked there, the installation was owned and developed by the ISR Group, which had its primary business location in nearby Savannah. It primarily focused on Group 2 and Group 3 drone testing and training. The MOUT facility was used for these purposes as well—to leverage the drones’ capabilities over urban-like terrain. A previous listing for the property gives details about its unmanned aircraft testing capabilities: On section has a chert base with a limestone layer and a tar coating on top totaling 2.8 miles. Another section has the chert base with limestone layer on top totaling 1.9 miles. The rest of the roads have the chert base totaling 5.74 miles. All sections of the road have an average of about 30-40 feet of clear right of way on each side. The center of the property was the focal point of the operation and is improved with a 2,300 x 100 runway with an 8 x 20 control tower surrounded by barbed-wire fencing, two 3,600 square foot hangers with 20 ceilings and two 24 x 68 manufactured-home classrooms. This area was used for Group 3 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The hangars were for storage of these aircrafts. The runway has 10 inches of gravel surface. To the south of the runway is an area that includes the facilities maintenance improvements, which include a two 24 x 68 manufactured home office buildings and a 7,200 square foot equipment shelter with 1,200 square feet of enclosed space. Further to the south is a portion of the subject known as the south site testing area and is improved with a mock compound that was used for staged drone operations. This site was used for Group 2 UAVs. It has concrete block walls with razor wire on the top. Inside are 6 connex boxes that were used for the storage of equipment and control stations. Outside it has three 30 x 30 concrete pads that was used for the equipment needed to launch and recover the aircraft. Equipment was run on generators. Toward southeastern most portion of the property is another area improved with another mock compound used for staged drone operations. This facility was used strictly for training purposes. It gave the operators a visual on what they may encounter on an overseas mission. The structure is shipping containers stacked together in the form of a small town. There are approximately 20 of these containers. Also, next to the site is an OP tower. This is an observation post where an employee would monitor the aircraft movement. There are 4 of these structures on the property. They are 30 tall and are wooden. The area to the north known as the north site was used to launch and land UAVs. There are no existing improvements in this area. One of our commenters stated the following in our discussion area below that matches this information: I worked here one summer. The company was called ISR and was for Field Service Drone Pilot training on mainly the Scan Eagle platform. This was the field training simulator… The runway was for a Tiger Shark UAV that they trained with at one time. Nice and quiet out there. There is also this article , which dates back to 2013, before the runway facilities were constructed. It is not clear exactly if the proposed relationships remained intact, but it directly supports the supposed impetus behind the facility as discussed above.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week, just two days after the release of the second trailer for Top Gun: Maverick , we were treated a behind the scenes featurette about the work that went into capturing the movie’s flying sequences. At the time, we were concerned that the air-to-air engagements would be largely rendered in CGI, but a recent Facebook post from Kevin LaRosa II, the Aerial Coordinator and Lead Camera Pilot for the film, has allayed much of that fear and offered details on the four different platforms, including drones, that he and his team used to capture the aerial magic we will see on screen. You can read LaRosa’s post in full below: “I used four different types of camera platforms on Top Gun Maverick. As the Aerial Coordinator and Lead Camera Pilot, each platform was chosen with the help of both Aerial DP’s ( Michael FitzMaurice & David Nowell) for a specific purpose for each individual aerial sequence. The L-39 CineJet was chosen for most of the dog fighting and low level high energy type flying. The Phenom Camera Jet with my Co-Captain @jonathan_spano was chosen for any extended over water operation, extended range missions, or complex sequence that needed the flexibility of carrying two Shotover F1’s at the same time with different lens capabilities. The Helinet camera helicopter was used to capture all of the high energy passes and low level action with the Shotover K1 attached by an Airfilm Camera Systems AF200. The fourth platform was Helinet Aviation cinema drones which were able to operate in places we couldn’t get full size camera aircraft. All of these amazing platforms carried state of the art SHOTOVER camera gimbals. The gimbals and accessories were supplied by both @helinetaviation and Team5 Aerial Systems . There is so much fantastic footage that I can’t wait for the world to see. Really looking forward to this summer when the movie is released! @k2_larosa #AerialCoordinator #StuntPilot #AerialDepartment @helinetaviation @team5aerials @shotovercamera #TeamWork @paramountpics @tomcruise @glenpowell @monicabarbaro @gregtarzandavis @jaredslater @scherbas” So, there you have it. At least some of the dogfighting in the movie will be footage of actual air-to-air engagements. We had already seen one of CineJet’s L-39s in the featurette filming an F/A-18E/F Super Hornet as it goes into full afterburner. That’s exactly the kind of “high energy type flying” footage that LaRosa said his team used the L-39 to grab. It’s very interesting to see the kind of additional platforms that the aerial team used to capture all of the in-air footage. The use of smaller drones is hardly surprising given how unmanned platforms are increasingly valuable for various commercial enterprises , especially when it comes to any task that involves getting into hard to access areas, just as LaRosa says. All told, LaRosa’s brief, but detailed post highlights the very hard work that goes into making this kind of specialized movie magic without defaulting to computer-generated imagery. We already know that the filming of the original Top Gun more than three decades ago was particularly challenging and potentially risky given how close the camera aircraft had to fly to the fighter jets they were filming. Back in 2016, Dave “Bio” Baranek, a F-14 Radar Intercept Officer who was a real Topgun instructor and took part in the filming of Top Gun , told The War Zone the following in an interview : “In basically every scene, we had to fly closer to each other for the cameras than we would in real life. When we were filming the head-on passes, it took quite a few passes to get it right [detailed in awesome fashion in Topgun Days ]. In our dogfight training, when we had a head-on pass we were required to stay 500 feet away from the other jet for safety. That was a distance we were all comfortable with, even if we were closing at Mach 1! But when we tried it for the movie the other jets looked too small, so the director wanted us to get closer than 500 feet. We talked about it and reasoned that under the controlled filming conditions we could close the distance. It still took several passes to refine the formations and other things, and we eventually passed close enough to hear the other jets—a rarity. The flight leads and all the aircrew kept it professional, in the briefings and during the flights. The main flight lead for the F-14s was Lloyd “Bozo” Abel, while Bob “Rat” Willard and Ray “Secks” Seckinger took turns leading the Topgun jets. From the Navy’s safety-conscious culture, we knew that unusual flights such as air shows present high risk because it’s not the way we normally fly. So the movie crew would tell us what they wanted and the flight leads would work out how we could safely accomplish it. Then the briefings were very thorough. No one wanted to mess up while filming a Hollywood movie.” Be sure to read the rest of that interview, if you haven’t already, here . Knowing what we know now about the aerial filming for Top Gun: Maverick , we are even more excited to see the exhilarating new footage and feel that need for speed all over again.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 15, 2020",Air Force Tests Laser Guided Rockets In The Air-To-Air Role To Shoot Down Cruise Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper recently shot down a target drone using a laser-guided 70mm rocket typically used for air-to-ground strikes during a test. The service ostensibly conducted the experiment to determine the weapon’s suitability for shooting down incoming cruise missiles , but it could also be useful for destroying small unmanned aircraft, including suicide drones . The F-16C, assigned to the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, part of the 53rd Wing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, conducted the test over a range off the coast of the state on Dec. 19, 2019. A BQM-167 target drone served as the simulated cruise missile threat . “The test was unprecedented and will shape the future of how the Air Force executes CMD [cruise missile defense],” U.S. Air Force Colonel Ryan Messer, commander of the 53rd Wing, said in a statement . “This is a prime example of how the 53rd Wing is using resources readily available to establish innovative ways that enhance combat capabilities for our combat units.” The Marine Corps first fielded the laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) 70mm rocket, also known as the AGR-20A, in 2008 and the weapon’s use has since expanded dramatically across the use military on both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The core of the system is a laser seeker system that slots in between the standard 70mm rocket motor and the warhead, allowing for the rapid conversion of existing Hydra 70 unguided rockets into low-cost precision-guided munitions. You can read more about the APKWS II and its use as an air-to-ground weapon in these past War Zone stories . https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPXh0SpQU6w The Air Force did not say what warhead and fuze combination it used during the test. An inert training warhead might have been enough to turn the rocket into a hit-to-kill air-to-air weapon that would have destroyed the target by physically smashing into it. A high explosive type combined with a proximity fuze would have been another option. Images that the Air Force released show that the aircraft taking part in the test were carrying rockets with yellow bands at the front, which would point to a live warhead. The service did say that the F-16C had targeted the drone using an onboard targeting pod. Pictures show that the plane was carrying an AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) during the test. The Sniper ATP’s long-range, gyro-stabilized optics and laser designator can be slaved to an aircraft’s radar, but it’s unclear if this was the case during this particular experiment. The Air Force has been upgrading a number of F-16C/D Vipers, including those in the Air National Guard, with Northrop Grumman’s AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), which is an active electronically scanned array type, and just awarded that company a new contract to install these on hundreds of additional F-16 aircraft in the USAF’s stable. These will allow these aircraft to spot and track targets at greater ranges and with increased precision, especially low flying targets with small radar cross-sections. The Sniper ATP linked to an AESA radar would significantly enhance the ability of the Viper to engage targets with its laser-guided rockets. Fighter jets conducting homeland defense missions already fly with Sniper ATPs for long-range identification of aircraft. Contractors install an AN/APG-83 SABR radar onto a US Air Force F-16., USAF The Air Force says that using the AGR-20A in the air-to-air role was the result of an effort to develop a low-cost weapon for aircraft to use in the cruise missile defense role. This was the number two proposal, out of 76 in total, to come out of an internal Weapons and Tactics Conference (WEPTAC) in January 2019. At present, the service trains to use AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and AIM-9X Sidewinders to engage cruise missile threats. The unit price for the latest AIM-120D variant is just over $1.3 million, according to the Pentagon’s budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year. Older AIM-120Cs still cost around $1.16 million per shot. Each guidance and control section for the AGR-20A, which, as noted, can be used to convert existing Hydra 70 rocket stocks into laser-guided versions, is just around $25,000. In addition, the Air Force says that the laser-guided rockets are faster to load than AIM-120s. Above all else, these weapons also give the launching aircraft far greater magazine depth since they get loaded into 7- and 19-shot pods on a single station that would hold a single AIM-120. The threat cruise missiles pose to U.S. forces deployed overseas, as well as to the United States itself , has been a growing concern for years now within the U.S. military, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . Cruise missile technology is increasingly proliferating, including to non-state militant groups, such as Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels , as seen in the video below. The latest U.S. Missile Defense Review, which came out in January 2019, also focused heavily on cruise missile defense. Earlier this year, the U.S. Army also announced it was buying a number of Israeli-made Iron Dome systems ostensibly for this role. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cVADHyxA8Ks The unprecedented cruise missile and mass suicide drone strikes on oil-related infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in September 2019, which the United States blames on Iran and which the Saudis say were at least Iranian-sponsored , have only underscored how real the threat is and prompted renewed demands for appropriate defenses. Air Force Colonel Messer, the head of the 53rd Wing, made an indirect reference to these strikes, as well as the new U.S. military mission in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East to defend against any future Iranian attacks, when talking about the importance of this recent air-to-air AGR-20A test. “This proof of concept can have implications for homeland defense missions , Combined Defense of the Arabian Gulf, and beyond,” Messer said in his statement. “I am exceptionally proud of the efforts of the 85th TES [Test and Evaluation Squadron] and the units across the 53rd Wing that made this possible.” A picture the Air Force released showing where the target drone came down after the F-16C hit it with an AGR-20A rocket., USAF Though the Air Force did not specifically mention it, the test also demonstrates how the laser-guided rockets could be employed against small unmanned aircraft, including suicide, drones, as well. American opponents and potential adversaries , again including non-state actors , are increasing employing small drones for intelligence gathering and direct strikes . This has already prompted the development of a number of surface-based counter-drone systems , including various directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves . The limitations and costs involved in using AIM-120s and AIM-9Xs, are just as apparent in the counter-drone mission as they are in the counter-cruise missile role. The added magazine depth that the AGR-20A offers could be particularly valuable against mass drone attacks and drone swarms . It’s not clear how close the Air Force may be to fielding the laser-guided rockets as air-to-air weapons operationally or if the service views this as just as a proof of concept or some level of interim solution to its requirements. It’s possible that this could just be a stepping stone to a more dedicated 70mm air-to-air design or to using another weapon in a similar fashion. The AGR-20A could have difficulty engaging increasingly advanced cruise missiles that fly at high supersonic or even hypersonic speeds, which might require a faster-flying interceptor , but these aren’t the main threat set the rockets would be facing. Whatever happens, the Air Force has demonstrated that its laser-guided rockets, combat-proven against ground targets, may be just as valuable for knocking down small aerial threats.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Here Is How Much Those Decoy Flares Cost That Military Aircraft Fire Off All The Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Flares can make any aircraft, no matter how big and lumbering, look dynamic and even beautiful. In reality, they are an essential countermeasure used to confuse enemy heat-seeking missiles. So, how much do these fiery things being pumped out the back of military aircraft actually cost? Countermeasure flares burn at thousands of degrees and there is a wide variety of types, the vast majority of which ignite when their volatile compound mix is exposed to the air itself. These are can be referred to as pyrophoric flares. Beyond their use in actual combat, even in training, helicopters and ground attack aircraft will practice firing flares off when entering into high-risk areas of their flight envelope and mission where shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles could be present. Fighters will also pop flares during training dogfights when the adversary is within the firing envelope of their short-range missiles. Sometimes fighters will even thank a tanker boom operator by popping flares. These pyrotechnics also often evoke oohs and ahhs from air show crowds as they ripple off military aircraft performing flying displays. Youtube GIF/High Flight With all this in mind, how much is being spent each time a flare pops off? Here are the numbers: Each M206 flare, a basic type which is launched from A-10, F-16, C-17, C-130, and other aircraft that use the AN/ALE-47 countermeasure dispenser system, costs $35 according to the 2018 Pentagon budget. USAF In other words, if an aircraft releases a ‘bucket’ full of 30 flares, the cost of doing so is $1,050. But this is among the most basic of expendable infrared countermeasures. The cost climbs for more advanced types and those that are used on fewer types of aircraft or for specific tactical scenarios. Youtube GIF For instance, the F-35’s MJU-68/B that is used to decoy advanced infrared threats costs a whopping $3,000 per unit, according to Pentagon budget documents. Another flare the F-35 is capable of dispensing, the less capable MJU-61/B, cost $75 apiece. This same flare could replace the venerable M206 in the future. F-35.com The MJU-7/B, which is used by a wide variety of fighter aircraft, including A-10, F-15, F-16, and F-22, costs $57 each, while the imminent replacement for this flare, the MJU-53/B, cost $75 each. So a single bucket of MJU-53/Bs would run $2,250. The most recent budget puts the cost of the MJU-66/B flare at the price of $135 each and describes this expendable as such: MJU-66 decoy Countermeasure Flare is an improved version of the MJU-64 providing increased decoy effectiveness and protection for the A-10, C-130 and F-35 aircraft and HH-53 and HH-60 helicopters and is being evaluated for other aircraft. It is a one-piece aluminum case containing a payload of advanced special material elements, loaded into a multiple jettison unit magazine installed on a countermeasure dispenser. When deployed into the air stream, the special material reacts to emit an infrared signal to decoy infrared seeking missiles. The MJU-10/B, which is used on the F-15 family of fighters, costs $184 each. USAF Often times a cocktail of different flare types are used together to cover a broader number of threats across the infrared spectrum and to achieve a better overall countermeasure effect. For instance, the C-5 and C-17 also use the MJU-53/B, which those aircraft can release massive amounts of within a matter of seconds, but they will also fly with MJU-62/B spectral flares that aren’t as visible to the naked eye mixed in. You can see this mix in action in spectacular fashion in the video below: The DoD’s budget documents describe the MJU-62/B as such: MJU-62 Flare is a multi-spectral countermeasure designed to be used as part of a flare cocktail pattern to confuse advanced infrared threat missiles. Used primarily on the C-17 and C-5 aircraft which require a 1 inch by 2 inch by 8 inch flare size to accommodate desired cocktail flare mixes. MJU-62 is being evaluated for use on other types of aircraft such as F-16, A-10, and HH-60. The MJU-62/Bs cost $290 each. Beyond the F-35, other aircraft seem to have expensive proprietary flares, too. The B-52, for instance, uses an older design that has no commonality with the rest of the force. This flare, the ALA-17C, is being phased out as the B-52 gets upgraded with more modern and common ALE-47 countermeasure systems. In the meantime, each of these expendables has a $1,000 unit cost ALA-17C used by the B-52., USAF/Mil-Spec-Industries.com The B-1B also has a unique flare for its upward-firing dispenser arrangement that exists due to its high-speed, low altitude flight profile. Designated the MJU-23/B, we couldn’t find any budget data on this flare within the last couple of years, but in 2013 they cost $623. The BONE’s flare game is strong!  Thank you for the awesome video @raw_sterling #bone #b1 #bomber pic.twitter.com/bL7Gu1losh — Combat Learjet (@Combat_learjet) December 8, 2019 It is possible that some of the unit costs listed, at least the very expensive ones, include all-up packages of multiple flares, but we could not confirm this. Regardless, this gives you a general idea of what these things cost. It’s also worth mentioning that sometimes flares that are close to reaching their expiration date are fired off in training or otherwise, which is likely less expensive than disposing of them formally on the ground. So, next time you see fighter, bomber, transport, or helicopter spewing flares you can count each one in terms of the dollars and cents literally being lit on fire. But hey, a little perspective here, everything costs huge amounts of money when it comes to aviation, and this is especially so for military aviation. Spewing hundreds of dollars in flares to say thanks for the gas may seem like a waste, but that same tactical fighter costs roughly no less than $20,000 per hour to operate and it goes up from there, way up. The F-22 is basically three times that cost per hour, for instance. When it comes to Pentagon expenditures, everything is relative. Author’s note: Updated piece to reflect that flares may be fired off that are close to exceeding their shelf life.

The U.S. Navy appears to be backing away from an extremely ambitious plan that emerged earlier this year to reach the goal of a fleet with 355 ships within the next 15 years. The service’s senior leadership has said that, unless their budget increases dramatically, they are looking at a fleet of between 305 and 310 ships in the near-to-mid-term. They say they will have also have to find a way to drive down the costs of buying and operating vessels, including focusing more on unmanned vessels , to realize real growth beyond the current 290-ship fleet after years of spending increasingly more on fewer ships. Various Navy officials offered these remarks at the Military Reporters and Editors Conference on Oct. 25, 2019. The service had previously published its most recent Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels in March 2019, which charted an aggressive and very costly course to reaching the long-standing and Congressionally-mandated objective of having a 355-ship fleet by 2034. The Navy has already said that this plan is likely to change when it publishes its next Force Structure Assessment, which it hopes to have ready by the end of the year. Its last Force Structure Assessment, published in 2016, had laid out a requirement for 355 ships, which Congress subsequently enshrined into law. “Will we get to 355-ships?” U.S. Navy Admiral Robert Burke, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the service’s number two uniformed officer, said at the Military Reporters and Editors Conference. “I think with today’s fiscal situation, where the Navy’s top line is right now, we can keep around 305 to 310 ships whole, properly manned, properly maintained, properly equipped, and properly ready.” This is a slightly lower projection than the one that the Navy included in its budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which came out in February 2019 and set out a path reaching 314 ships in 2024. This is in line with the 2019 shipbuilding plan, which the service published a month later, envisioned hitting the 314 ship mark in the 2025 Fiscal Year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2024. The shipbuilding schedule from the 2019 Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels showing the Navy reaching a “Battle Force” fleet with a total of 355 ships in 2034., USN This is actually a slower pace than what the service had called for in its 2019 Fiscal Year budget proposal, which saw the service reaching 326 ships in 2023. “If our [budget] top line does not go up, if it remains where it is now and is projected to remain in the future defense plans, that’s about where we can get to and do it right, in terms of man those ships and maintain them and have all the ordnance for them and generate readiness,” Burke said of his 305- to 310-ship fleet estimate. “We would need an increased top line” to get above that, he added. Cost has clearly been a major driver in reassessing these shipbuilding timelines, as well as the increased questioning of the 355-ship goal, as a whole. “A 355-ship Navy is an important aspirational goal. … But more important is ensuring that we have the maximum capability to address every challenge we’re going to be facing,” Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer had said at a separate gathering at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C. last week. These funding concerns were already readily apparent in the Navy’s 2019 shipbuilding plan, which said that it would cost the service $660 billion over the next 30 years to acquire the hulls necessary to reach the 355 ship mark and to sustain them going forward. That report projected that it would cost $40 billion annually to operate and maintain this many ships, a 30 percent increase over what it spends now. Earlier in October 2019, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued its own assessment of the Navy’s plan, questioning whether the service had adequately estimated the total price tag for this shipbuilding endeavor over the next three decades. CBO’s analysts said that the Navy’s plan could cost as much as $865 billion in total, primarily due to differences in shipbuilding cost estimates. Where the Navy said it would need to spend almost $22 billion just acquiring ships each year on average to arrive at a 355-ship fleet and sustain it through 2049, CBO’s metrics said this figure was likely to be closer to $29 billion. CBO No matter how the costs are calculated, the Navy is certainly in agreement that the fleet it has today has only become increasingly more expensive in terms of ship unit prices and operational and maintenance costs. “Going back to the ‘80s, when we had the 600-ship Navy, the average cost of our ship in that fleet was a billion dollars, that was the average cost of all those ships,” Thomas Modly, the Undersecretary of the Navy, said at the Military Reporters and Editors Conference. “Today, our current fleet of 290, the average cost is $2 billion. And that’s in real dollars, inflation-adjusted real dollars,” he continued. “So what that suggests is we’re piling a lot more capability and a lot more expense on a smaller number of platforms.” This reality extends to operational and maintenance costs, as well, and is apparently reflected most in the ballooning price of what it takes to operate a complete carrier strike group. Carrier strike groups, previously known as carrier battle groups, accounted for around 14 percent of the Navy’s operations and maintenance budget 30 years ago, according to USNI News . Today, it’s just over 30 percent. USN Costs associated with the troubled first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , as well as the next ships in that class, have steadily grown in recent years. The fourth ship in the class, a still-unnamed ship known by the hull number CVN-81, could cost as much as $15 billion to build by itself. This would be a full two percent of the Navy’s estimated ship-related costs over the next 30 years under the 2019 shipbuilding plan. “Now, I’m not sure when we’re looking at a scenario where we’re dealing with a great power like China or Russia , where we’re going to have distributed responsibilities, whether that’s the right strategy for us,” Undersecretary Modly continued. “So we’re looking at that and examining that.” By every indication the Navy, with the full support of the U.S. Marine Corps, is increasingly looking at potential lower-cost and more flexible shipbuilding options that result in ships better suited to the kind of distributed operations that will only become increasingly more likely to occur in future conflicts as time goes on. These are things The War Zone has covered in depth in the past, which you can read about more here and here . These efforts already include, among other things, plans to acquire a new class of frigates, or FFG(X), which will be derived from an existing in-production design and will leverage as much existing technology as possible to try to keep costs down. The Navy is aiming for an average unit cost of around $800 million for these ships, which would be less than half the average unit cost of the ships the Navy has now, despite an impressive array of planned capabilities, which you can read about more in this past War Zone story . The Navy also has ongoing efforts to try to improve the capabilities of the chronically underperforming Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) and plans to begin exploring new concepts of operations for those vessels, as well as others, such the Zumwalt class stealth destroyers , which will better reflect what they can and cannot actually do. These efforts have included the establishment of a new, dedicated surface warfare development unit, known as Surface Development Squadron 1 , or SURDEVRON 1. The first-in-class USS Zumwalt , in front, sails with the USS Independence , the first in that subclass of Littoral Combat Ships., USN All three Zumwalts will eventually join SURDEVRON 1, together with the first two Littoral Combat Ships from both the Freedom and Independence subclasses, which have already been largely related to non-deployable test and training roles. The squadron, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece, will also eventually contain a number of experimental unmanned surface vessels. The Navy is very actively embracing the potential benefits of unmanned surface and undersea vessels as a path to increasing the overall size of the service’s fleets, as well as their capabilities, while also keeping costs low. The Navy’s 2020 Fiscal Year budget proposal calls for acquiring up to 10 Large Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessels (LDUSV) over the next five years at a total cost of just around $2.7 billion. Each one of these would be a multi-purpose ship with a displacement of 2,000 tons, around the same size as modern manned corvettes. On Oct. 1, 2019, the Navy announced the beginning of the second phase of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program , which will help inform the LDUSV program. The service has been conducting this effort in cooperation with the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO). The SCO is leading a number of potentially revolutionary development efforts across the entire U.S. military . The first phase of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program involved hiring two teams to each convert one commercial fast supply vessels, also referred to as offshore support vessels (OSV), into an unmanned surface vessel. Phase II, which is set to finish up in 2021, “will be conducted using the same ships from Phase I and will focus on the integration of government-furnished command-and-control systems and payloads and involve more complex and challenging naval experimentation,” according to the Navy. After this phase is complete, SCO will also turn over the ships to full Navy control for further experimentation. The two Ghost Fleet Overlord test ships., USN This is similar to the development of the Sea Hunter , a smaller unmanned surface vessel. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initially led this project, before handing it over completely to the Navy last year. The service is now buying a second one of these crewless ships and will use them to support the development of a Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV). The first two Sea Hunters will join SURDEVRON 1 to help support the development of concepts of operations for these ships, including manned-unmanned teaming, as well. You can read more about the LDUSV and MDUSV programs in these two past War Zone stories . The Navy is also working in small unmanned surface vessels, as well as expanding its unmanned undersea vehicles, to include large displacement drone submarines, developments that The War Zone has also been following closely . An artist’s conception of Boeing Orca large displacement unmanned undersea vehicle, which it is building for the Navy., Boeing The upcoming Force Structure Assessment will almost certainly reflect this increasingly unmanned reality. It may even call for counting existing and future unmanned vessels within the service’s projections for its so-called “Battle Force,” which presently only includes manned surface vessels and submarines. “If you look at what it would take to do that – and we laid this into our 30-year shipbuilding plan – it’s going to be very, very difficult for us to do that, A) based on that force structure, and B) based on the budget and top line,” Modly explained. “So we’re all sort of coming to this realization now that there’s a math problem that we need to try to solve, and we have to be creative about how we’re going to solve it.” “First of all, is the number 355 the right number? I don’t know. I suspect it’s probably more, it probably needs to be more than that – but the way we define a battle force ship, we probably have to think about that differently, as well,” he continued. “As technology advances and we have the ability to have fairly large unmanned platforms out there that have significant lethality, do we include them in our ship force count? So we have to take a really hard look at what 355 means, if it’s the right number, does it even matter what the number is, and what are we investing in for the future.” The Navy’s upcoming Force Structure Assessment, which will hopefully be public before the end of the year, will give the first real sense of how the Navy might envision its future fleet after years of spending increasingly more, but buying fewer ships. However, it seems increasingly likely that it won’t call for 355 ships and that the future battle force it describes will feature a much larger number of unmanned vessels.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 17, 2020",Boeing’s Starliner Spacecraft Got Confused And Won’t Reach The International Space Station,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, which could carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station in the future, failed to reach the correct orbit to link up with that station during its first orbital flight test today. Automated systems on the uncrewed CST-100 thought the craft was in a different position than it actually was, leaving it in a stable orbit, but out of position and low on fuel. Mission controllers are still in control of it remotely and are planning to bring it down at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico before the weekend is over. NASA says the launch took place as planned at 6:36 AM this morning, with a United Launch Alliance Atlas V space launch vehicle with the Starliner on top blasting off successfully from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The CST-100 separated from the upper stage of the Atlas V as intended 15 minutes after launch, at which point it was not yet in orbit. This is intended to allow time to safely abort a mission, if necessary. The spacecraft then used its own four thrusters to boost itself into orbit. “The Boeing Starliner space vehicle experienced an off-nominal insertion. The spacecraft currently is in a safe and stable configuration. Flight controllers have completed a successful initial burn and are assessing next steps,” Kelly Kaplan, a Boeing spokesperson subsequently, told reporters . “Boeing and NASA are working together to review options for the test and mission opportunities available while the Starliner remains in orbit.” You can watch the full NASA live stream of the launch and the Starliner’s failure to reach the right orbit below: NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine later further explained on Twitter that what had happened was a “Mission Elapsed Time (MET) anomaly,” meaning that “Starliner believed it was in an orbital insertion burn (or that the burn was complete), the dead bands were reduced and the spacecraft burned more fuel than anticipated to maintain precise control.” Having expanded too much fuel in the initial ascent into orbit, the CST-100 did not have what it needed to get into the appropriate orbit to meet up with the International Space Station (ISS). NASA and Boeing are now working to bring the Starliner down safely at White Sands, which is where it was originally expected to land on Dec. 28 after completing its planned mission. The craft is carrying Christmas gifts that had been intended for the six astronauts on the ISS, half of which are presently Americans. It also had tree seeds similar to the ones that the Apollo 14 mission brought to the Moon and an ID card that belonged to Boeing founder William E. Boeing. An artist’s conception of the CST-100 Starliner., Boeing Though there was no one on board the Starliner for this inaugural orbital mission, it is carrying a mannequin dressed as “Rosie the Riveter,” the iconic representation of women who worked in factories, especially those supporting the war effort, during World War II. This surrogate was also packed full of sensors to gather data on the stresses human occupants might experience during future missions. The entire launch and rendezvous with the ISS was supposed to provide an end-to-end test of the CST-100 ahead of a first crewed mission that is presently scheduled to take place sometime in the first half of 2020. Female Boeing employees make the iconic Rosie the Riveter pose in front of the “Rosie” test dummy that is now flying in space on the CST-100., Boeing NASA and Boeing say it’s too soon to tell whether or not another uncrewed mission will be necessary now to validate the craft’s general functions. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a subsequent press conference that had astronauts been on board during this flight, they might have been able to detect and correct the anomaly before it became an issue. Starliner also completed a successful sub-orbital abort test in November. Boeing is competing against SpaceX, and its Crew Dragon spacecraft, for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program contract, which seeks to develop an all-American alternative to the present practice of using Russian-made space launch vehicles and spacecraft to deliver personnel, as well as cargo, to the ISS. Relying on Russia for these services has become increasingly complex in recent years due to worsening relations between Moscow and Washington. Both companies have suffered delays since securing their initial contracts to develop prototype systems in 2014. The SpaceX Crew Dragon did successfully conduct its first uncrewed mission to the ISS in March, two months later than originally expected. The company had expected to perform its own in-flight abort test in April, but the spacecraft it planned to use in that test was destroyed when one of its SuperDraco thrusters exploded during a static engine test that same month. It’s far too soon to tell exactly how serious the technical problems that scuttled the CST-100’s first uncrewed mission are in the end. At the same time, it does come more than a year after NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel publicly criticized both Boeing and SpaceX over what it said were unrealistically short timelines for achieving an actual, operational capability. “We have not seen the [Commercial Crew] program make decisions detrimental to safety,” Patricia Sanders, head of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said in October 2018. “But current projected schedules for uncrewed and crewed test flights for both providers have considerable risk and do not appear achievable.” Crew Dragon and CST-100 are each still scheduled to bring astronauts to the ISS in 2020. Failure to do so on time could put the space station in an extremely precarious situation, which you can read about in much greater detail in this past War Zone story . Of course, this is not to say that the Russians haven’t had their own issues in providing launch services to the ISS. In October 2018, a  Soyuz-FG rocket suffered a technical problem, leading to its second stage breaking apart and forcing the two occupants of the Soyuz-MS crew capsule on top, Russian cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and American astronaut Nick Hague, to conduct an emergency “ballistic descent,” which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story. Thankfully the capsule touched down safely and Ovchinin and Hague survived. The remains of the Soyuz-MS that had been carrying Ovchinin and Hague in October 2018., Russian Ministry of Defense via AP “We’re talking about human spaceflight,” NASA Administrator Bridenstine noted during the press briefing about the CST-100 mishap. “It’s not for the faint of heart. It never has been, and it’s never going to be.” There are also questions about whether the United States remains committed to the ISS and whether it might look to rent its space on the station to private entities starting after 2025 . The U.S. government relaxed rules on its ability to commercializing the ISS, which could include taking on privately-funded projects, accepting corporate sponsorships, and even selling tickets for private citizens to go to the station, in June . Without life-extending upgrades , the ISS may not even be a viable platform for work in space after 2028, by which time the United States may have moved on to plans for its own new space station. The U.S. government is also looking to restart manned missions to the Moon and has also expressed its eagerness to eventually send astronauts to Mars . In the meantime, Boeing and SpaceX will continue working toward launching the first crewed missions of their respective spacecraft up to the ISS, which will usher in a new era of American space travel… Eventually.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 20, 2019",Crisis Averted As New Crew Successfully Blasts Off To The International Space Station,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s space agency Roscosmos says it has successfully launched a replacement crew for the International Space Station, or ISS, into near-Earth orbit. Barring any complications with the manned spacecraft, the orbital facility will avoid having to spend any time in a risky uncrewed configuration . There had been a concern that that could happen after a failed launch in October 2018. The Soyuz-FG booster rocket successfully lofted the Soyuz-MS spacecraft out of the Earth’s atmosphere after launching from the Russian-operated Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Nov. 3, 2018 .  Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut Anne McClain, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut David Saint-Jacques were on board. They are set to arrive at the ISS later today to begin a 194 day stint in space. “The spacecraft separated from the third stage of the Soyuz-FG carrier rocket in a normal mode and at the designated time,” Roscosmos said of the launch . This usually routine announcement carried significantly more weight in this case given the accident that occurred on Oct. 11, 2018 . On that day, another Soyuz-FG had lifted off at Baikonur carrying another Soyuz-MS with Russian cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and American astronaut Nick Hague inside. Shortly after the initial launch, a malfunction with a booster rocket triggered an emergency safety mechanism, blasting the crew module off and sending it parachuting back down to the ground in a “ballistic descent” at a particularly high speed. Though the two occupants in the spacecraft had not made it into orbit, they were still at such a high altitude that the parachute descent took around 30 minutes in total. From left to right, NASA astronaut Anne McClain, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut David Saint-Jacques. , Grigory Sysoev / Sputnik  via AP This was the first-ever failure for a Soyuz-FG and Russia immediately initiated an investigation to find the source of the problem in one of its primary space launch vehicles. On Nov. 1, 2018, Roscomos detailed its finding in a press conference. Personnel at Baikonur had deformed a sensor during the assembly of one of the four strap-on boosters that attach to the Soyuz-FG’s central booster. When the strap-on boosters separate from the main rocket, this sensor is supposed to trigger a valve to open, releasing liquid oxygen and propelling the smaller boosters safety away from the remaining core. With the broken sensor, the valve never opened, leaving the strap-on booster to slide down the side of the main rocket, causing significant damage and a loss of control. You can see the entire sequence of events in the video below. Roscosmos said that personnel would inspect any assembled strap-on boosters for similar damage and would take steps to help prevent similar problems from occurring in the future. On Nov. 16, 2018, Russia launched another Soyuz-FG , this time with an unmanned Progress cargo spacecraft with supplies for the ISS, from Baikonur without issue. Isolating the issue with the Soyuz-FG and launching the Soyuz-MS with Kononenko, McClain, and Saint-Jacques did not come a moment too soon. After the October 2018 mishap, there had been concerns that the next launch wouldn’t occur before the existing crew on the ISS would have to return to Earth. The biggest issue was how long the Soyuz-MS that had brought the last crew to the space station would remain safe to use for the return trip. The spacecraft is not supposed to remain in orbit indefinitely and would be dangerous to use after a certain point. Without a crew and with personnel monitoring the situation from the ground only, the ISS would have few, if any options to immediately respond to any potentially serious technical problems. It would also bring work on the station to a halt and possibly lead to the loss of perishable scientific experiments. In addition, scheduled repairs, upgrades, and the flight tests of new spacecraft would be delayed. A Soyuz-MS docked with the ISS in 2016., NASA Thankfully, by all indications, this crisis has been averted. In 2011, another just-in-time Russian rocket launch averted a similar situation from occurring after another accident delayed the arrival of a new crew to the ISS. In this case, the cosmonauts and astronauts that are already on the station will have to stay there an extra week as part of the transition. Still, the October 2018 Soyuz-FG failure and the scramble to get a replacement crew into orbit have highlighted a variety of important issues. At present, the U.S. government and other international partners on the ISS rely entirely on Roscosmos to get their astronauts to the station. It remains an important example of international cooperation with Russia as the Kremlin has drawn increasing criticism for its repressive domestic political climate and aggressive foreign policy stance. Most recently, the United States and its allies, including astronaut Saint-Jacques’s home country of Canada, condemned an incident in the Kerch Strait separating the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov. On Nov. 25, 2018, Russian forces brought a number of Ukrainian naval vessels that were legally sailing in the area forcefully to a halt . Russia subsequently seized the boats and arrested their crews, inflaming regional tensions . The ISS., NASA The two countries have been in a de facto conflict since Russia illegally took control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and began supporting separatists in breakaway Ukranian regions along the Russian border. The Kremlin had previously refused to help with extending the lifespan of the ISS in retaliation for American sanctions over Crimea. NASA’s latest contract with Roscosmos to send its astronauts to the ISS comes up in April 2019 and the geo-political situation could make it difficult to renew. However, the United States has no alternatives ready to go. Boeing and SpaceX are working on their CST-100 Starliner and Crew Dragon spacecraft respectively as part of the Commercial Crew Program . Unfortunately, the inaugural flights of these craft won’t occur until the beginning of 2019 . NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel has publicly criticized both companies for what it says are unrealistic timelines for reaching an actual, operational capability, as well. SpaceX says it plans to launch its Crew Dragon spacecraft for the first time in January 2019., SpaceX The United States only has firm plans to continue its work aboard the ISS until 2025 , at which point it might look to rent space to private firms interested in space-based research and development efforts and space tourism . Russia has also said it has investigated physically splitting off its portions in the future to serve as the basis for a new space station, but in 2017 said it had no plans to actually do so . Without further life-extension upgrades, the station itself will only remain viable through 2028 . Russia and the United States have no plans at present to collaborate bilaterally or as a part of a multi-national group on a new space station. At the moment, the ISS looks to be on course to continue normal operations at least through July 2019. It remains to be seen how the United States and other contributing countries will get new crews to the station after that and for how long.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has been circulating on social media purporting to capture an assassination attempt on Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman , but by every indication appears to show a VIP protection exercise or demonstration in Kuwait. It’s still a sight to behold, especially at the end when a member of the close protection team can’t get the passenger door of an SUV open and dives through the window instead before the vehicle speeds away. The video starts with what appears to be a traditionally dressed Arab dignitary arriving at what looks to be an arms exhibition in a black SUV. He then walks toward the convention center with another individual and his entourage in tow, before someone in the crowd charges at them and gets body-slammed by security personnel. A second person appears to get ordered to lie on the ground, as well. There is little question that this attempted assassination is staged, with none of the onlookers are running for cover and many individuals are steadily filming what’s going on with their cell phones. Other nearby uniformed personnel take no action what so ever as the events unfold around them. After the initial incident, members of the VIP protection detail quickly form a phalanx around the principal and rush him back into the black SUV while others shoot at the attackers. Someone drops a blue smoke grenade to further cover the escape. At the very end, the remaining personnel scramble to get into a red SUV. One of them struggles to get the door open and ultimately decides to just jump into the passenger’s seat through the window, after which they speed away after their compatriots. It’s an intense half minute or so in total of action. Still, all told, this demonstration is somewhat muted compared to more extravagant propaganda displays we’ve seen from Saudi Arabia , Iraq , and Turkmenistan . It certainly doesn’t compare to this terribly awesome music video promoting Azerbaijan’s Border Guard. It’s also very contained compared to the U.S.-led special operations forces demonstrations that accompany the annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Florida. To reiterate, we don’t know when or where this occurred exactly, but the license plates on the SUVs appear to be Kuwaiti and are definitely not Saudi. There are no reports of any repute corroborating any attempt on Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s life in recent days. Beyond that, copies of this video have been circulating online since at least Dec. 13, 2019. One post also falsely claims that it shows a recent murder of a Saudi national in Eygpt.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2018",Air Force To Conduct Its First Space Launch From Guam Next Year Using A 747 Jumbo Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force will conduct its first satellite launch from Guam next year using private space launch company Virgin Orbit’s Cosmic Girl, a modified Boeing 747 mothership , carrying a LauncherOne air-launched booster rocket. This underscores the inherent flexibility of this type of two-stage-to-orbit launch concept, something that the U.S. military as a whole is increasingly interested in as it seeks options for rapid access to space in the face of growing threats to American interests in orbit. U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Ryan Rose, who runs the Small Launch and Targets Division within the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center’s Launch Enterprise Systems Directorate, revealed that the service had settled on Guam and Virgin Orbit’s aerial space launch system in an interview with SpaceNews on Dec. 18, 2019. The Air Force had announced that it had hired VOX Space , a subsidiary of Virgin Orbit focused on competing for U.S. government contracts, for the launch, known formally as STP-27VP, in April, but did not say where it would take place. The only publicly announced payload for the STP-27VP launch appears to be the MiniCarb cubesat , which communications company Iridium built under contract to the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Its primary mission as it travels in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) will be monitoring greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and it will be able to transmit data it collects back to researchers on the ground via Iridium’s “Big LEO” constellation. During the actual launch, Virgin Orbit’s specially-configured 747 will fly to an appropriate altitude and launch position with a LaunchOne rocket, with MiniCarb inside, under its left wing. The crew will then launch the rocket, which will carry the satellite into orbit. You can read more about Cosmic Girl, and how the plane leverages that aircraft’s unique built-in externally heavily lift capability, in this past War Zone piece . https://youtube.com/watch?v=wWaW3IzVGBw Back in April, the Air Force had suggested that VOX Space might conduct the launch from Mojave Air and Space Port, where Cosmic Girl is based. It’s still not clear if the 747 will stage from Andersen Air Force Base or Guam International Airport. However, even before getting this military contract, representatives of Virgin Orbit and its subsidiary have been publicly talking about its desire to use Guam, in general, as a major hub for its operations. “We’re excited about Guam because it makes for a great hub,” William Pomerantz, Vice President of Special Projects at VOX Space, told The Guam Daily Post in January. “You can get to a lot of places on missions from there.” “We’re not necessarily looking at having an aircraft based on Guam,” Mandy Vaughn, VOX Space’s President, also told The Guam Daily Post for the same story. “For the first few launches, or campaigns, we’d likely ship the rocket itself and the support equipment by boat over to Guam and probably fly the payloads in on another cargo aircraft.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=WviwMNQ-EaU One of the inherent benefits of a two-stage-to-orbit space launch system utilizing a flying mothership is the ability to rapidly redeploy that aircraft to different staging locations depending on the exact mission requirements or to potentially avoid delays due to bad weather or other factors at the primary launch site. That is something that is impossible to do with fixed launch sites for traditional space launch rockets. The use of a mothership aircraft also allows the actual air launch of the payload-carrying rocket to occur at a tertiary location some distance away from the main staging location, which offers additional flexibility. Other countries, including Russia and China , are also in the process of developing similar two-stage-to-orbit capabilities for many of the same reasons. “For decades, people have wanted to make rockets operate with airline-like efficacy – lots of flights, quick turnaround time,” VOX Space’s Pomerantz added in his interview earlier this year with The Guam Daily Post , referring to the kind of space launch capacity the company is looking to offer. As VOX Space’s President Vaughn noted, there is still the need to preposition assets ahead of launches. The LauncherOne also has a maximum payload weight of around 500 pounds for missions headed to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which is small by modern satellite standards. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9, a traditional space launch vehicle, can loft 50,265 pounds to LEO. A SpaceX Falcon 9 space launch vehicle., SpaceX Of course, Virgin Orbit isn’t targeting the same marketspace as companies such as SpaceX, aiming its services more at the growing industry around the development of small, lower-cost satellites, such as MiniCarb. The U.S. military has become particularly interested in the possibility of using smaller satellites, or leveraging existing commercial ones, to quickly and relatively cheaply establish constellations that can handle communications, satellite navigation, and other tasks. The U.S. military’s Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI), a joint effort between the Space Test Program and the Defense Innovation Unit, is funding the STP-27VP launch as part of these broader efforts exploring rapid and response space access concepts. The hope is that these space-based networks would also be less vulnerable to attack given their overall density, which would require an opponent to engage hundreds of individual satellites to seriously disrupt the operations of space-based communications or other capabilities. It would also be easier to rapidly replace any disabled or destroyed cubesats using alternative launch concepts, such as VOX Space’s two-stage-to-orbit system. “If I can build spacecraft for a million dollars or less, if I can pull them off the production lines and use them, I can now afford to lose things,” then-Space Development Agency Fred Kennedy told SpaceNews in April. “I’m not scared anymore. I can put up several hundred satellites and know that maybe 75 percent of them will work and that would be just fine.” An infographic the Pentagon released earlier this year depicting how it might employ multiple constellations of hundreds small satellites for early warning, including against hypersonic weapons, communications, and other functions., DOD There have been critics of this concept, including outgoing Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who said later that month that tabletop wargames had raised serious questions about its validity. “Launching hundreds of cheap satellites into theater as a substitute for the complex architectures where we provide key capabilities to the warfighter will result in failure on America’s worst day if relied upon alone. The analysis shows that,” she said . The launch from Guam is just one of a number of small satellite launches the Air Force plans to conduct in 2020 in support of the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI), showing that the service and the U.S. military as a whole still remains invested in the concept to at least some degree. The outcome of STP-27VP and how the United States’ future plans regarding military activities in space continue to evolve, including the impending establishment of a new Space Force service branch, will no doubt inform the future of RALI and any related efforts. Virgin Orbit certainly seems hopeful that, U.S. contracts or not, it will be steadily increasing its small satellite launches from the Western Pacific, and demonstrating the value of its two-stage-to-orbit system in the process, in the coming years.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Can The U.S. Military Make An Airplane Invisible To The Naked Eye?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. From Wonder Woman’s Invisible Jet to the cloaking devices used by the Romulans and Klingons of the Star Trek universe, science fiction and popular culture are full of examples of completely invisible flying craft. Despite having its roots in fiction, the act of making an aircraft less visible to the naked eye has been an ongoing, but shadowy area of research and development for both private and military laboratories since the early days of military aviation. Paramount Pictures Evading radar systems, infrared sensors, and other sensors is the main strategy behind today’s modern stealthy aircraft, yet the ability to also avoid or delay visual detection remains near the top of the list of strategic aerospace technologies even in an age of increasingly advanced integrated air defense networks. Being able to detect an aircraft on radar is one thing, and even being able to hear it is another, but the ability to actually see an aircraft remains a huge vulnerability. Tight rules of engagement and the premium placed on using stealth and electronic warfare to penetrate into enemy airspace and even persist there for long periods of time mean that visual detection is still a major Achilles heel of many modern combat aircraft. Thus, the need for the ability to make an aircraft invisible as possible remains as pressing as ever. While the world has yet to be shown evidence of an “invisible” aircraft or a high-end adaptive aircraft camouflage system that comes close to achieving such a goal, there is more than enough documentation originating from both the Department of Defense and associated private contractors to suggest that these technologies may be very much real. Aircraft like the B-2 already possess systems to reduce their visual signatures by minimizing the contrails they produce, and there is a documented pattern of research and development of other visual stealth technologies dating back the better part of a century that point to the real possibility that such capabilities do actually exist today, at least to a certain extent. The Yehudi Lights ​​​​ Since the earliest days of mechanized warfare, militaries around the world have tested different methods of applying camouflage paint to structures, ground vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels in order to reduce the distance at which they could be detected and positively identified with the naked eye. In recent years, computer-generated and more complex camouflage patterns have improved these techniques, although the effectiveness of these specialized paint jobs still depends on lighting and weather conditions and the angle at which an observer views the aircraft or ship, along with many other factors. A US Air Force F-16C aggressor in “BDU” splinter camouflage ., USAF To get around these issues, aviation researchers in the midst of World War II tested methods of using light to camouflage aircraft, whether through controlling the light reflected off of aircraft using non-reflective paints or through a technique known as counter-illumination, which involves projecting light from the aircraft itself to help it blend in with its surroundings. It was in these early studies that the search for an invisible aircraft began in earnest. The counter-illumination concept is fairly simple. When a bright light is projected against the aircraft’s skin, it is much harder to detect against the daytime sky as it no longer appears as a dark silhouette and literally blends in with the bright sky. Starting in 1943, the United States and Canada began testing a somewhat crude technology in which light bulbs were attached to the noses and leading edges of aircraft to reduce the distinctiveness of their silhouettes. The concept required setting the lights’ luminosity and color as close as possible to the appearance of the daytime sky. This tactic made it more difficult for opponents to visually detect and identify the aircraft from the critical head-on viewing angle. These Yehudi Lights , as they were known, could reduce the distance at which aircraft could be visually detected significantly. The U.S. Navy began a program to test the efficacy of these lights first on Grumman TBF Avengers , intending to enable them to better reach German U-boats before they could dive after spotting the aircraft, as well as improve the survivability of the aircraft, in general. According to a 1943 report commissioned by the National Defense Research Committee’s (NDRC) Office of Scientific Research and Development titled “Visibility Studies and Some Applications in the field of Camouflage”, the Yehudi Lights were fairly effective in many circumstances. “Under conditions such that an uncamouflaged plane was visible at about 12 miles,” the report said, “the plane equipped with Yehudi camouflage could approach to within 3,000 yards without detection, even when its approximate location was indicated by an accompanying uncamouflaged plane.” A scale model of a B-24 fitted with Yehudi Lights., DTIC That report also devoted a whole chapter to the “Perceptual Capacity of the Human Observer,” which detailed the extensive testing the NDRC conducted to determine the effectiveness of the Yehudi Lights and other luminous camouflage systems. The chapter outlined numerous research programs conducted by the Army-Navy Office of Scientific Research and Development (ANOSRD) Vision Committee, including lengthy studies into how well human observers could perceive and detect minute changes in luminosity and color or detect a luminous object against a similarly-lit background. Extensive testing was also conducted in the field that required researchers to develop custom spectrographs for measuring the luminosity and color of natural environments and erect 100-foot-high towers from which to suspend model aircraft fitted with various experimental luminous camouflage systems. Eventually, researchers developed a full-size model of a B-24 Liberator bomber to test the Yehudi Lights system. While these studies found that luminous camouflage systems could indeed reduce the distance at which an aircraft could be detected, these light bulb-based systems were highly dependent on the environments in which aircraft were flown and were only fully effective from certain viewing angles and distances. Slight changes in atmospheric conditions or weather could significantly impact the effectiveness of luminous camouflage, and the weight, aerodynamic penalties, and power requirements of the light bulbs made them impractical for many applications. DTIC It’s still not known how widespread the use of Yehudi Lights was and the 1943 NDRC report notes that, despite the fact that the Naval Air Station at Patuxent River in Maryland was asked to make the necessary changes to its aircraft to allow for installation of the lights, the project was still not completed at the time of the document’s publication. More Recent Versions Of Luminous Camouflage Obviously, the Yehudi Lights and other luminous camouflage techniques are most effective during daytime conditions, but there are ways of camouflaging aircraft at night, as well. That same 1943 NDRC report discussed several different variations of black paint that were either non-reflective or otherwise designed to help an aircraft blend in with the night sky, and similar paint schemes are still in use today. Modern stealth aircraft, such as the F-117 Nighthawk attack jet and B-2 Spirit bomber, are painted in matte black or dark grey and are flown at night to limit their visual signature. It’s unclear exactly what research pertaining to luminous camouflage the U.S. military conducted in the years following the Second World War, but during the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force tested light bulb-based systems similar to the Yehudi Lights, which could reduce the distance at which an aircraft could be visually detected. F-4 Phantom II aircraft were fitted with lights on their bellies and sides and painted sky blue and white in order to make them more difficult to be visually identified by enemy forces in what was known as the Compass Ghost project. The Phantom was anything but discreet visually speaking. , USN The F-4 was large and its two General Electric J79 turbojet engines left a large, dark exhaust trail in its wake, making it easy for observers to spot and making the desire for visual camouflage a particularly pressing one in its case. While the Compass Ghost system was found to reduce the range at which the F-4 could be seen by up to a third , advances in enemy radar technology and the system’s limitations meant the Compass Ghost configuration never made into widespread use. Decades later, in the early 1990s, Boeing’s Phantom Works began testing the radical Bird of Prey aircraft in secret, which was designed to produce as little signature as possible across all forms – radar, infrared, acoustic, and visual. The aircraft remained in the black world throughout the ’90s and was only revealed to the public in 2002. Bird Of Prey., Public Domain Perhaps owing to its Star Trek- inspired name, there were plenty of rumors of active camouflage featuring counter-illumination techniques surrounding the Bird of Prey program, though none was ever confirmed. However, we do know that the Bird of Prey’s airframe was designed specifically to test visual signature reduction techniques. The fact that the jet looked unlike any traditional aircraft, with many of the normal features seen on planes missing or drastically reduced in proportion, helped with decreasing its visual signature. The design also reduced or eliminated some shadows on the aircraft itself, making it revolutionary in terms of visual stealth to at least some degree. Recent Advances In Illumination Technologies While these early luminous camouflage systems had limited success and use (at least based off of what information is publicly available), the advances that have occurred in illumination, image production, and optical sensors over the last 75 years mean that if any similar systems exist today, they will have moved far beyond hanging light bulbs off of wings or scattering incandescent lights around an airframe. Given how far something as civilian as a cellphone screen has advanced in 15 years, it’s safe to imagine just how far optical camouflage techniques have advanced in the 75 years since U.S. military first began researching methods of making aircraft less visible to the eye. One look at what is commercially available in terms of LED systems, electroluminescent paints and panels, and other illumination technologies is enough to assume the military is certainly attempting to leverage the same systems at higher degrees of scale and sophistication. In recent years, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), electroluminescent paints and panels, thin form factor LCD screens, and other visual technologies have advanced significantly in terms of power requirements, brightness, image clarity, size, and automated control, pushing the possibility of visual stealth systems even closer to the realm of the probable, if they have not already arrived there already. Anecdotal and academic evidence that has trickled into the public realm over the last few decades suggests just that. One such system without a doubt has its roots in the Yehudi Lights yet has updated its methods of light projection. The 1997 Popular Science article “ Hiding in Plain Sight ” describes tests of thin fluorescent panels on experimental aircraft that could camouflage these aircraft even against the daytime sky. The systems described worked much like the Yehudi Lights, but featured small articulated slits that could be used to aim the light emitted from the aircraft. According to one technician working on these systems at the Tonopah Test Range , “trying to pick out the aircraft against a clear blue sky was next to impossible. The only time we could easily spot the aircraft was when it produced an unexpected contrail.” The article goes on to describe even more advanced systems tested at some of the United States’ most secretive facilities: Defense contractors have told POPULAR SCIENCE that an even more exotic skin is being tested on two stealth aircraft at the high-security Groom Lake air base [Area 51] in Nevada. The skin is derived from an electromagnetically conductive polyaniline-based radar-absorbent composite material. It is optically transparent except when electrically charged, much like the LCDs used in laptop computers. What makes this new material attractive is that it can change brightness and color instantaneously. Photo-sensitive receptors, mounted on all sides of the plane, read the ambient light and color of the sky and ground. An onboard computer adjusts the brightness, hue, and texture of the skin to match the sky above the plane or the terrain below it. In the 20 years since that article’s publication, further examples of similar systems have been appearing appeared at test ranges. In 2008 and 2009, Flight Global reported on the use of electroluminescent panels on small unmanned air vehicles and a newer LED-based system operating on the same principles of light-sensing and projection as in other examples, writing that “recent developments for sensors and lighting technology hold the promise of revolutionizing this old idea. Sensors embedded in an aircraft skin can now precisely measure the brightness of the air as an aircraft moves through the sky.” Similar systems are being tested in academic laboratories around the world. As recently as 2015, several startups have been testing methods of using commercial e-ink displays to actively camouflage small drones by displaying similar colors and brightness as the surrounding sky. Tests have already been conducted to determine if a drone’s entire fuselage or wing structure could be lined in these e-ink panels, rendering it nearly translucent in certain conditions. Some commercial airliners are already fitted with electroluminescent panels, flat materials that glow when an electrical current passes through them., Airbus A Lockheed Martin press release from 2015 describes advances in visual cloaking in relation to the F-35 Lightning II. The press release never states that the F-35 sports such a system, but it does note a pair of advances from the University of Rochester and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that were both able to produce scalable cloaking devices capable of rendering 3D objects invisible using metamaterials, or specially-engineered materials which have properties not found in naturally occurring materials. While metamaterial research has been a common subject of invisibility technology for some time, the extent to which they have been tested as a means of rendering aircraft invisible is unknown. Still, the inclusion of this optical metamaterial research in an official Lockheed Martin press release is curious. We would be remiss if we didn’t mention the similarly curious statements made by President Donald Trump in which he has repeatedly called the F-35 an “ invisible fighter ” and has never differentiated between radar and the visual realm. Maybe he has been briefed on such a capability, even if it is aspirational in nature or being eyed as a future development for the controversial aircraft. Metamaterials: Beyond Counter Illumination While methods to reduce the visual signature of an aircraft have existed for years, it could be that metamaterials hold the key to rendering aircraft truly invisible. The design and applications of metamaterials have become a vital area of research for a wide range of uses not limited to the optical camouflage of aircraft. According to the Fiscal Year 2009 President’s Budget Request for DoD Science & Technology, the Department of Defense invested $35 million into metamaterials research in 2008. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, the Air Force requested $124,264,000 for materials applied research alone. USAF budget documents show that this materials research involved “nanoscale materials, metamaterials”, and “quantum materials for aerospace applications”. The DIA’s Defense Intelligence Research Document (DIRD) “Invisibility Cloaking: Theory and Experiments” explores various methods of cloaking three-dimensional objects., DOD A 2010 Defense Intelligence Research Document (DIRD) titled “ Invisibility Cloaking: Theory and Experiments ,” which was prepared by the DIA’s Defense Warning Office’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications (AAWSA) program, was written by Ulf Leonhardt, a pioneer in invisibility sciences, optical metamaterials, and various forms of cloaking. Leonhardt’s “Invisibility Cloaking” DIRD outlines a multitude of visual cloaking approaches ranging from the theoretical to the practical. Various metamaterials are discussed that can manipulate or absorb visible light, but the report concludes that while it is possible in the laboratory to create metamaterials that filter specific wavelengths of light, these materials remain fundamentally ineffective at cloaking objects out of the entire visible spectrum: The demonstrated microwave-cloaking device only works correctly for microwave radiation of a specific frequency (wavelength), and the proposed optical cloaking device would also work for just one frequency; that is, for only one color. Light of different colors would be severely distorted. So, to see things disappear in a cloaking device, one should wear tinted glasses of the required color, which of course completely defeats the purpose. This design flaw is inevitable, no matter how much progress is made in the technology of metamaterials, for the following reason: the device is designed such that light waves traveling around the object enclosed by the cloaking device are completely indistinguishable from light waves propagating through empty space. Recent advances in metamaterial manufacturing have allowed for materials which refract or ‘bend’ light differently than glass or other materials., DOD However, the report adds in conclusion that “the greatest challenge for turning invisibility from an idea into a workable device is not technology but imagination”: Perfect cloaking devices are impossible because they require materials where the speed of light approaches infinity. Imperfect cloaking devices could be made. Such devices implement suitable curved-space geometries. For electromagnetic microwaves, cloaking devices are definitely within reach of the present technology. Whether invisibility in the visible range of the spectrum will become a reality is not entirely clear yet. Most probably, this will depend more on the new theoretical research than on advances in new materials, and on the application of mathematical intelligence, intuition, and imagination. The 2010 DIRD document released by Las Vegas journalist George Knapp., DIA Similarly, other studies funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory between 2011 and 2016 and unearthed via FOIA detail the collaboration between Air Force researchers and scientists both as they experimented with various methods of metamaterials and “ transformation optics ” and even “ invisibility cloak ” construction. The Air Force Research Laboratory funded a report in 2013 that concluded that “recent advances in metamaterial research have shifted cloaking possibilities to this new field through transformation optics, creating a shell which effectively cloaks the space inside the shell by diverting EM radiation around it.” The report mostly focuses on the microscopic structures that could provide some form of cloaking and methods of measuring their effectiveness, and concludes by stating that “there is still a big gap between the wishes – desired permeability and permittivity distribution – and reality – the real electromagnetic parameters of different metamaterial structures.” Still, scientists have already published successful results with materials that mimic the skin of cuttlefish and other cephalopods, enabling the construction of “thin sheets that can be conformally wrapped onto solid objects to modulate their visual appearance” similar to the way that cuttlefish can change the color of their skin to match their surroundings. Judging by the number of studies the Air Force has funded and the recent claimed advances in materials and optics that have come out of private laboratories like the British Columbia-based Hyperstealth Biotechnology Corporation , it is possible that some level of “invisible” aircraft using such methods could be plausible. But once again, it’s not necessarily about making an aircraft perfectly or nearly perfectly invisible, but rather reducing its visual signature overall and reducing the distance at which it can be detected visually enough to make it worth the price and performance penalties incurred by integrating such a capability onto an aircraft. While extreme invisibility may still be an academic and theoretical exercise at this time, major and worthwhile reductions in visual signature may very well be a reality. The Need For Invisible Aircraft There are clear benefits to equipping many aircraft types that perform many types of missions with adaptive camouflage, but for stealthy surveillance aircraft that are intended to persist for long periods over enemy airspace, visual stealth would be especially beneficial. Vehicles like the RQ-170 Sentinel have reduced infrared signature and can evade radar through low observable design features, strict emissions control, electronic warfare, and dynamic mission planning and control, but evading visual identification would offer another highly important layer of survivability. The threats these types of aircraft face are not transient in nature, unlike fighters or transports moving to or from a target, in most cases. The penetrating and persistent reconnaissance mission that focuses on capturing extremely high-quality intelligence directly over or very near where the enemy is operating over time also makes aircraft tasked with this role more vulnerable to all forms of detection, especially the visual kind. The fact that these aircraft are subsonic and rely on their ability to remain undetected by sensors for survivability makes them even more vulnerable when it comes to visual detection, as well. In other words, they don’t have the ability to run like a fighter jet or evade the enemy’s attacks via hard maneuvering once detected. An RQ-170 at Andersen AFB on the island of Guam. , USAF via FOIA Because of these unique challenges, these deep penetrating aircraft, which include the still officially undisclosed RQ-180 and the upcoming B-21 Raider , which is really a multirole platform , not just a bomber , as well as the RQ-170 , and possibly USAF’s mysterious missing unmanned combat air vehicles , would be top candidates to receive visual stealth technologies in an operational manner. Beyond this narrow, but hugely important capability set, because of the increasing potency integrated defense networks, it’s also more important than ever to have other stealthy combat aircraft or infiltration/exfiltration vehicles avoid visual detection and survive, even if briefly, in enemy territory or heavily contested environments. Organizations such as Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) continue to explore low-observability technologies for their next-generation special operations aircraft, particularly transports and short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft. As part of The War Zone’s reporting on AFSOC’s R&D into these concepts, we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) the AFSOC document “Cost Benefit Analysis of Potential AFSOC MC-130H/J “New Magic” Modifications (Project 10).” The document discusses the bizarrely well-established need for a stealthy STOL aircraft for special operations and the potential for implementing recent advances in active optical camouflage. The briefing mentioned carbon nanotube-based coatings, light-absorbing skin created through laser surface structuring, and metamaterials. All of which could theoretically reduce or alter an aircraft’s appearance in the visual light spectrum and make it more difficult for the enemy to identify an aircraft at a distance and even in daylight. Studies have found that surfaces lined with vertical carbon nanotubes can literally absorb every wavelength of light through essentially ‘trapping’ light within these microscopic non-reflective tubes. Femtosecond laser surface structuring can achieve similar results through creating microscopic textures that can change the way a material scatters or absorbs various wavelengths of light. A document The War Zone obtained through FOIA., USAF It isn’t clear if the AFSOC proceded with investigating or developing these technologies or what level of information the people who put the document together had on what classified capabilities exist at the time of writing. Not Seeing Is Believing By the very nature of high-end military aerospace research and development and operational concerns, it’s safe to say that there are plenty of classified technologies currently in the air of which very few members of the public are aware. There is also an established pattern of research and development into visual stealth, invisibility, and cloaking systems that dates back to World War II. As such, there always remains the real possibility, if not probability, that there have been advances in invisibility tech that remain far too sensitive to disclose, some of which may, in fact, be already in use. Beyond the hard documentation that does exist, the hunt for visual signature reduction on combat aircraft has been heavily rumored to be a major endeavor at places such as Area 51, as it should be, especially now that deep penetrating and persistent aerial reconnaissance is a real mission set. In addition, these concepts are applicable beyond aircraft and it’s likely that the other branches of the U.S. military are working with each other and private laboratories toward common ends. The Army, especially, has a long history of active camouflage programs . Given the advances in illumination and image production even in just the last decade or so, it’s no stretch of the imagination to say that there are likely breakthrough methods of visually camouflaging aircraft that at least show real promise. Who knows, they may even first become evident once the B-21 is finally revealed in the not so distant future or an aircraft, such as the RQ-180, which exists in the shadows comes into the light. Then again, maybe such technology will emerge on far more lowly, but still remarkably frightening platforms, like small swarming drones . We just don’t know. In the meantime, we’ll continue to do our best to keep an eye out for any visible developments in invisible aircraft technology. Brett Tingley Air Air Forces Stealth U.S. Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 12, 2020",Air Force Names Its Newest Helicopters “Grey Wolves” Because They Will Fly in “Packs”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has officially named its new MH-139A light utility helicopter the Grey Wolf. The name is meant to evoke how many of the MH-139As will operate in “packs” to defend America’s ballistic missile silos, as well as possessing the endurance necessary to complete that mission set. U.S. Air Force General Tim Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), announced the name at a ceremony that also marked the delivery of the first MH-139A at Duke Field in Florida on Dec. 19, 2019. There had been some confusion earlier in the week about whether the helicopter’s official nickname might be Striker, which is actually just how AFGSC refers to personnel assigned to the command. You can read more about that and the Air Force’s naming conventions for helicopters and other aircraft in this recent War Zone story . This is the first time AFGSC had taken delivery of a new type of aircraft or helicopter and is also the first time the Air Force has had to choose a name for a helicopter that it is the sole U.S. military operator of, at least at present. In a press release, Boeing, which is building the MH-139As in cooperation with Italian defense contractor Leonardo, described the symbolism of the name as such: The Boeing MH-139A pays homage to the grey wolf, an extremely adaptable species known for its power and endurance, which contributes to its ability to roam large distances. The name falls in line with the geographical areas of the United States represented by Air Force Global Strike Command and Air Force District of Washington. As a pack animal, the Grey Wolf represents the Air Force’s mission sets, which bring multiple aircraft to the fight. The Air Force is set to take delivery of a total of 84 MH-139As, which are variants of the Leonardo AW139 design, in the coming years to replace its fleet of aging UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters. Boeing and Leonardo first won the contract, which is worth up to $2.8 billion, in September 2018. This was an unexpected choice, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . Beyond supporting Air Force Security Forces guarding ballistic missile silos, MH-139As will also take over a host of other support functions that the UH-1Ns have been performing, including VIP transport, local base rescue, disaster relief, and training tasks. The Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Materiel Command, and Pacific Air Forces, will all eventually become operators of the new Grey Wolves.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 1, 2019",New Owner Of Stratolaunch And World’s Largest Plane To Refocus On Hypersonic Testing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New ownership has spared Stratolaunch , the company behind the massive Roc aircraft , the largest plane ever flown, from a sad end following the death of its founder, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, last year. The firm now looks set to take a new direction, providing high-speed flight testing services rather than focus on space launch services, amid a boom in hypersonic weapon and aircraft development within the U.S. military , which will likely become a major focus of the Roc’s future activities. GeekWire was first to report that Cerberus Capital Management had bought Stratolaunch from the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan, Inc. holding company and that Stratolaunch President and CEO Jean Floyd had announced a new mission statement earlier in December 2019. Reports first emerged that Vulcan had sold Stratolaunch to an unnamed buyer in October. Vulcan, which had already been steadily scaling back the space launch firm’s activities after Allen died, had first put it up for sale in June with a price tag of $400 million , including the Roc, a plane that cost at least $200 million to develop and build alone. Neither Vulcan nor Cerberus has said what the final agreed-upon price was. “Stratolaunch grew from 13 to 87 employees over the past 2 months,” Stratolaunch’s CEO Floyd said in a Tweet on Dec. 10, 2019. “2020 will be a great year!” Floyd also indicated a shift away from Stratolaunch’s original focus of providing space launch services using the Roc, which first flew in April , as a mothership to air-launch various vehicles to using that aircraft to support more terrestrial high-speed flight testing. “VISION: Breaking Barriers. MISSION: To be the world’s leading provider of high-speed flight test services,” he added in his Tweet. Recent job listings at the company’s Mojave flight facility provide additional evidence of this change in direction. “Stratolaunch is developing an air-launch platform to contribute to high-speed research and development,” a canned statement at the beginning of each current job offering says. “The goal of Stratolaunch is to use the air-launch platform for enabling technologies that may not exist otherwise.” The company’s new ownership is almost certainly driving this decision. Unlike Paul Allen, who regularly talked about the wonders of space and the future of space travel , Cerberus, and its billionaire owner Steve Feinberg, has long cultivated a more controversial and mercenary image, both figuratively and literally . Cerberus is a private equity firm that has focused on buying up “distressed” entities, those experiencing serious financial strain or outright in bankruptcy, with the idea of reorganizing them and profiting from their recovery. In the last 20 years, Feinberg’s company has acquired, directly or through subsidiaries , defense contractor DynCorp and gunmakers Remington and Bushmaster , among other enterprises. Feinberg himself has strong ties to President Donald Trump and his administration. He has been chair of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board since May 2018. Steve Feinberg’s profile picture from the Cerberus website., Cerberus Capital Management It’s not clear who Stratolaunch might see as the target customers for its new high-speed flight test services, but Feinberg’s connections, together with the boom in hypersonic weapons and aircraft developments within the U.S. military in recent years, strongly point to the U.S. government being at the top of that list, if it isn’t the only realistic customer. There are at least a half a dozen U.S. hypersonic weapon programs ongoing right now across the services that we know about publicly and it is clear that there are additional efforts taking place in the classified realm . This is to say nothing of the additional work being done on hypersonic aircraft. This, in turn, has substantially increased the demand for flight test capabilities. Flight tests of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) and Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) are scheduled to occur in 2020. These programs both suffered unspecified delays in preparing for these tests, which were supposed to take place this year. Nearly 40 more hypersonic weapon flight tests are set to occur over the next four years. The speeds, ranges, and flight regimes involved in hypersonic testing also means that, while the U.S. military as a whole has already made significant investments in new infrastructure and the development of new procedures and best practices, it will still need more capacity to keep everything on schedule. It can be a challenge just to track and observe the flights of these vehicles, let alone collect important test data and simply provide adequate physical space to explore the full capabilities that they offer. A briefing slide from 2018 showing various efforts the Air Force was conducting at the time to improve hypersonic flight test capabilities., USAF Most recently, the U.S. Army laid out plans for a new three-part Hypersonic Test Engineering, Mission Planning and Systems concept, or HyTEMPS . This includes plans for a Portable Range Operations and Test Network (PROTN), a Broad Ocean Area Terminal Sensing System (BOATSS), and a Sky Range. PROTN envisages a single networked architecture to rapidly share telemetry and other test data, as well as handle communications between participants in particular tests, who might be hundreds or even thousands of miles apart. Since the open expanses of the Pacific Ocean have historically provided the best available space to conduct these kinds of flight tests, BOATSS will provide a distributed array of sensors on crewed ships, barges, and remotely operated vehicles in the air and at sea to gather information across a wide area. A briefing slide showing the typical array of air, sea, and ground bases sensors used to collect data during the two tests of the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) in 2010 and 2011, respectively., USAF Sky Range focuses specifically on the development telemetry gathering and other testing related systems and the integration of those onto specially configured RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-9 Reaper drones , which will be known respectively as Range Hawks and Range Reapers. NASA Global Hawks have already supported previous U.S. military hypersonic weapon testing. Stratolaunch and the Roc could easily have a role in all this. Many of the benefits of using flying mothership as a two-stage-to-orbit space launch platform are just as applicable for high-speed flight tests. The plane has the ability to launch its payload thousands of miles from where it took off, opening up the possibility of opening up addition flight test corridors. This also means that it can rapidly redeploy to other locations in the event the testing location changes on short notice. The Roc also has the ability to carry very large and unusually shaped payloads, a capability that may not otherwise be readily available to the U.S. military. The Air Force’s B-52 bombers are presently the go-to option for tests of these kinds of air-launched vehicles, but on a small number of them are dedicated for research and development activities. The Air Force has already begun buying expendable air-launched hypersonic test vehicles, designated X-60As , to provide a less complicated and lower cost option for various basic hypersonic testing, including gathering data on how certain materials and systems hold up to the strain of flying at speeds in excess of Mach 7. Stratolaunch could potentially leverage existing development work it did on its own family of space launch vehicles with various payload capacities, including a reusable space plane known as Black Ice, to provide additional testing capacity. The firm had announced it had canceled all of those projects in January 2019 and would instead focus solely on getting the Roc ready to launch the relatively small, but proven Northrop Grumman Pegasus XL onto the aircraft. The massive plane was also designed to be able to carry at least three Pegasus XLs at a time, highlighting the potential for it perform multiple test launches at once with smaller vehicles, as well. An artist’s conception of Stratolaunch’s Roc and family of space launch vehicles, the Black Ice reusable space plane, at right. Three Pegasus XLs are depicted at left, as well., Stratolaunch Of course, there’s nothing to say that Stratolaunch and the Roc could not also continue to be available for space launch purposes. The United States has a long-standing interest in the development of these capabilities, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone stories . The U.S. government’s demands for this kind of capability have only become more pronounced amid increasing demands for flexible and responsive space access to mitigate a variety of emerging threats to American interests in orbit, another topic the War Zone has covered extensively in the past . At the same time, the commercial space launch marketplace has become increasingly crowded in recent years. While Stratolaunch had not been targeting the same market share as traditional space launch firms, such as SpaceX , other companies have been exploring two-stage-to-orbit concepts, such as Virgin Orbit . This might have further prompted Stratolaunch’s new management to move away from space launch services. So, all told, Stratolaunch’s future again looks quite bright. How much its work will reflect the original vision of the late Paul Allen, in the end, remains to be seen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just 48 hours after the second Top Gun: Maverick trailer was released, the film’s production team has posted a behind the scenes look at how they captured the footage that really matters to us aviation lovers—the live-action flight sequences. This was really smart to do because the trailers have left us a little concerned that this is going to be a computer-generated imagery fest sprinkled with some cockpit and external shots. Now the producers are selling us hard that this will be unlike anything we have seen before in terms of real footage shot inside and outside the actual jets. Let’s hope they are right. Getting the Pentagon to buy in full-tilt in producing such a film at an absurdly high-access level couldn’t have been an easy sell. Tom Cruise and the sequel to the movie that changed it all for the Navy, and military aviation as a whole, clearly helped sealed the deal. Those circumstances simply are not replicable. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer notes this by stating that the chances are we will never see something like this again. The fact that the Super Hornet was available and in the fleet was also a big deal, too. It provided the two-seat cockpit needed to pull this off. The F-35 simply could not offer that accommodation nor will the unmanned aircraft of the future. Digital filming technology has also matured to the point that the timing was right as well. The texture of the movie will be different than its predecessor because of it—those cockpit shots in the original were mainly done in a fake cockpit in front of a projection screen in a studio—but considering how unprecedented the footage will be, that’s not a bad thing. The wildcard remains the external air combat sequences. Incredible amounts of coordination had to occur to capture them in-camera when Top Gun was shot nearly 35 years ago—read all about how this was done in this past feature of ours . Now there are highly specialized aerial video services with modified aircraft that bring the latest digital camera tech to the fight. But you still need real fighter jets burning real gas and doing repeated setups to grab such imagery. This is an expensive and high-risk proposition. We see a glimpse of a Cinejet L39 filming a Super Hornet going into burner in the behind the scenes video, but it’s unclear if the actual air-to-air engagements will be rendered in CGI or if we will get the real deal. Let’s hope for more of the latter than the former.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 18, 2018",Air Force General Says His Planes Are Keeping An Eye Out For North Korea’s “Christmas Gift”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States has stepped up aerial intelligence gathering around North Korea , including using a newly modified RC-135V Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft. This comes amid threats from the regime in Pyongyang to send the U.S. government a “ Christmas gift ,” very likely in the form of a long-range ballistic missile test. The U.S. military has also said it is developing options for how it might respond to such a launch, including reviewing plans that it developed during the last period of significantly heightened tensions between the two countries in 2017. American officials have said they could turn again to the strategy they employed two years ago, which included shows of force in the air , at sea , and on the ground . Aircraft spotters using online tracking software have been recording the uptick in aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations near North Korea since at least the beginning of December. On Dec. 3, 2019, Ri Thae Song, North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister of U.S. affairs, had made the “Christmas gift” remark, which the regime in Pyongyang followed up with a “strategic” test of a large rocket motor at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground five days later. The North Koreans have had a self-imposed moratorium on a long-range missile and nuclear weapons tests since 2017, as a period of detente emerged between it and the United States. This goodwill eroded steadily following the collapse of a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February 2019. “There’s a pattern that you see with the North Koreans is their rhetoric precedes activity, which precedes a launch,” U.S. Air Force General Charles Brown, head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the service’s top command in the Pacific region, told reporters on Dec. 17, 2019. “We’re watching.” The U.S. Air Force’s RC-135 variants have been especially prevalent. RC-135V/W Rivet Joints have been observed flying near North Korea, including along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating it from South Korea, on multiple occasions in the past few weeks. Even from South Korean airspace or while flying over international waters in the East Sea, the aircraft can still use their sensors to surveil deep into North Korean territory. The Rivet Joints are among the Air Force’s most capable intelligence collection platforms , being able to scoop up a variety of signals intelligence information, including monitoring an opponent’s communications. The ability to detect, categorize, and geolocate emitters of various kinds, including air defense radars and communications nodes, also gives the planes an impressive ability to contribute to the development of an “ electronic order of battle ” of potential enemy forces in a particular area. The RC-135V/Ws fly with large crews of at least 26 individuals, which includes analysts and linguists, who can begin to process the information gathered immediately. The planes can also send the valuable data they collect on to other assets, including command centers in the region or ground forces, in near-real-time. One particular RC-135V that was flying in the region recently was carrying a new antenna on top, which could be to further improve the aircraft’s communications and data transfer capabilities. The War Zone was first to report on that aircraft, which has the serial number 64-14844, and its recent modifications, which you can read about in more detail here . The recently modified RC-135V, serial number 64-14844, at March Air Reserve Base (ARB) in California earlier in December 2019. The red arrow points to the new antenna., Dan Stijovich One of the Air Force’s three RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft also flew missions in the East Sea on Dec. 5 and Dec. 12, 2019. This is hardly surprising under the circumstances given that, unlike the more general-purpose Rivet Joints, the Cobra Balls are specifically configured to gather telemetry and other electronic intelligence, as well as visual imagery, during missile launches. RC-135s haven’t been the only ones taking part in the increased snooping around North Korea recently. At least one Air Force RQ-4B Global Hawk conducted a mission from within South Korea. These drones fly at extremely high altitudes and can use slanted flight patterns to look deep into a denied area such as North Korea using powerful multi-spectral cameras and radar imaging systems. The Air Force isn’t the only service involved in the intelligence and surveillance activities, either. Aircraft spotter and friend of The War Zone @AircraftSpots picked up on one flight involving an interesting U.S. Navy P-3C Orion on Dec. 12. P-3Cs assigned to Patrol Squadron 40 (VP-40), based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington, completed what had been the last operational deployment of Orions assigned to a patrol squadron in November, but the aircraft remain in service in more specialized roles. The aircraft flying over South Korea carries the Bureau Number 161588. In October, plane spotters caught this same aircraft at Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa not wearing any particular unit markings and equipped with an AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) mounted in a gondola-shaped pod under the fuselage. Despite its name, the LSRS, which has synthetic aperture and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) functionality, is capable of intelligence gathering overland, as well. A P-3C equipped with the LSRS pod., USAF Due to the still limited number of P-8A Poseidon aircraft equipped with the new Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS) pod, a combination intended to eventually replace the P-3Cs with the LSRS, the older aircraft have continued providing this capability in the interim, according to the P-3 Orion Research Group . The recent increase in aerial surveillance of North Korea almost certainly reflects a larger uptick in intelligence activity aimed at the country. The Korean Peninsula has historically been one of the most heavily monitored places on earth by the U.S. military, as well as the U.S. intelligence community. A host of other assets, including submarines , satellites , and agents on the ground, are almost certainly part of the mix of tools the United States is employing to gather information and insights about Pyongyuang’s impending missile test plans. You can read more about how the U.S. government keeps its eyes on North Korea in this past in-depth War Zone story . General Brown, the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) commander, told reporters that the U.S. still isn’t exactly sure what form Pyongyang’s “ Christmas gift ” will take, so the increased intelligence collection is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. There’s also no clear indications about when the increasingly inevitable launch might occur, despite the holiday-themed remarks. “I would expect is some type of long-range ballistic missile would be the gift,” Brown said . “It’s just a matter of, does it come on Christmas Eve? Does it come on Christmas Day? Does it come in after the new year?” “I think there’s also a possibility that the self-imposed moratorium may go away and nothing happens right away. He [Kim Jong Un] announces it, but then doesn’t shoot,” he continued. “Our job is to backstop the diplomatic efforts. If the diplomatic efforts kind of fall apart, we gotta be ready.” What might happen if North Korea does go through with its launch, which seems to be the much more likely outcome given Pyongyang’s renewed hostility to the United States and even Trump personally, remains to be seen. Brown specifically called back to U.S. military activities in 2017, a recent highwater mark for U.S.-North Korean tensions, which saw various shows of force that promoted fiery threats from Kim’s regime. “There’s a lot of stuff we did in 2017 that we can dust off very quickly and be ready to use,” he explained . “We are looking at all the things we’ve done in the past…all the complete options.” In the meantime, the United States will clearly continue to monitor North Korea extremely closely so as to be as prepared as possible to respond in some fashion when Kim’s Christmas gift finally arrives.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 4, 2020",A Dozen Mystery Objects Suddenly Popped Out Of Hangars At Tonopah Test Range Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tonopah Test Range Airport, located along the northern edge of the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range , may not get all the pop culture attention that nearby Area 51 gets, but in many ways, it is just as fascinating. It was born out of a program that saw American fighter pilots secretly flying captured MiGs against their fellow aviators . Not long after that program spun-up, the remote installation was greatly expanded to house the F-117 Nighthawk force during the early and deeply classified part of its career. It has since housed the semi-mothballed F-117 fleet following its official retirement more than a decade ago. It was also the original home of RQ-170 Sentinel . Today, the high-security base continues to support a number of secretive programs, as well as testing at the nearby range . Now, highly unusual activity around a dozen hangars at the shadowy installation has been caught on satellite. The image in question was snapped at around 10:15 AM local time on December 6th, 2019 by one of Planet Labs’ PlanetScope satellites that image the vast majority of the earth daily. The three-meter resolution image shows the front row of the southern-most ‘canyon’ of hangars , which were originally built for the F-117 program, with seemingly identical craft sitting in front or at least protruding out of the hangars. These are also the hangars that appear to house at least one secretive aircraft , which has been spotted peeking out in multiple prior satellite images in the past. But the December 6th image is unique in that we could not find a similar phenomenon after checking hundreds of similar images that span months of time. It appears that some program was uniquely active that day with a small fleet that makes up the contents of those hangars being involved. It remains unclear exactly what we are seeing in the images. Morning shadows are clearly present, but in our experience with using and examining thousands of the PlanetScope images, objects appear smaller than they are due to the lower resolution, not the other way around. Wings and other appendages on smaller airplanes seem to disappear making them look smaller overall than they actually are. The size of the blobs we see in the image are roughly fighter-sized, which you will see for yourself in a moment. The question is what type of aircraft are we seeing if indeed that is the case? If they are the elusive unmanned combat air vehicles the USAF won’t even acknowledge or RQ-170 Sentinel derivative aircraft , which is quite possible , they could be totally outside of their hangars based on their size. If they are larger aircraft, they could have a good portion of their fuselages sitting forward of the hangar doors. PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. One reason for this could be to establish and troubleshoot any satellite data-link issues before the aircraft taxi to the hammerhead and then depart. Advanced unmanned aircraft, in particular, which don’t need to even rely on operators located at the same bases from which they fly, would put a premium on checking out their beyond-line-of-sight data-links before heading out toward the runway. Other potential explanations exist, as well. For instance, maybe this is how they are fueled, although a dozen fuel trucks fueling aircraft at the same time seems highly unlikely, especially based on historical higher resolution satellite imagery of the facility. Fuel trucks are not an exact fit for what we are seeing here either, but even if that were the case, it means a dozen aircraft of an unknown type were going out on a mission together for one reason or another. Even the flyable force of F-117 force that still calls the base home is estimated at around four to six aircraft max in size, not nearly a dozen. In addition, the F-117s don’t occupy the “Red Hangar” cluster seen here, they use the “White Hangar” cluster to the far north of the ramp. The Blue hangar cluster lies between the two. F-117 near the White hangar group decades ago. , Public Domain A few of the hangars at Tonopah Test Range Airport also hold foreign ground-based threat systems that get used for certain exercises, like Russian-built Scud and SAM missile launchers. But many of those systems are stored in single hangars, not a single system in one hangar, as seems to be indicated in the photo, nor has there ever been the impression that entire rows of hangars are full of these systems. Beyond that, placing single examples of identical systems or near-identical systems in front of each hangar makes little sense, but it is something to consider. There is has been a substantial amount of activity at the base in the latter half of 2019. Nearly all of the visible daytime activity picked up on satellite occurs on the northern end of the ramp, between the Blue and White hangar clusters. U.S. Special Operations Command’s CASA CN-235 transports, similar ones likely operated by private contractors, and other special operations aircraft have a common presence on the ramp in this area. The base is an established testing locale for USSOCOM aviation-related initiatives. The F-117s can also be seen fairly regularly using this ramp area exclusively. As many as four have been seen there at one time in daily satellite imagery, which you can see below. An image taken on September 9th, 2019 shows a row of four F-117s sitting across from a pair of special operations transports and what is likely an Army Black Hawk, which also have a presence in this part of the ramp from time to time. , PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The F-117s seen in this image also provides good context to the size of objects seen in the image in question. As such, they appear to be roughly similar in size, but the mystery aircraft could be substantially larger if they are only sitting partially out of their hangars. Beyond that, clearly advanced airborne signature testing is conducted out of the northern ramp area. The Air Force’s shadowy NT-43A, which goes by the callsign “RAT 55” and is used as an airborne signature measurement laboratory, is a common visitor to this part of the base, as are other airliner-sized testbed conversion aircraft. Read all about RAT 55 in this past piece of mine . This isn’t surprising because, as posited years ago, the flying F-117s are involved with signature control experiments and RAT 55’s services are surely used by other more modern, but undisclosed tenants of the base. It’s also worth noting C-17s grace the ramp somewhat regularly in this area, as well. A September 24th, 2019 image showing two airliner derivative aircraft and what appears to be a C-21 and CN-235 on the ramp between the Blue and White hangars. One is very likely RAT 55, the other may be the 757 F-22 testbed aircraft. , PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Below is a high-resolution image from March 13, 2019, of the base showing RAT 55, some CN-235s, and what appears to be a group of people watching some sort of flight on the north end of the White hangar section. Also, note all the cars that line the rear of the northwesternmost trio of Blue hangars. It seems these are used constantly for SOCOM operations and assets. High-resolution image taken on March 12, 2019. It’s worth noting that the reconstruction of some of the base’s operating surfaces has largely been completed now. When this was taken construction was deeply underway. The rumors of some huge expansion of the base are false. Like any airfield, the runway and movement areas need maintenance and rehabilitation. The only new taxiway area is the small cutout on the northernmost taxiway that stops abruptly. It is likely used for engine runs. , PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. But once again, the activity between the White and Blue hangar sets occurs in broad daylight, this is far less the case farther south on the base. With this in mind, whatever we are seeing in the image in question made a somewhat rare daytime appearance. As for any major exercises that may have been related to this occurrence, the Air Force Weapon’s School’s capstone exercise was underway the week after, but it could have begun sooner. Cutting-edge tactics and systems are often part of this highly complex undertaking that makes heavy use of the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) and its many assets, some of which are extremely shy . F-117s appeared to provide support for the exercise in the adversary role the following week, but once again, the hangars of interest are not where the F-117s live nor are there a dozen of them flying regardless. With all this in mind, whatever is calling that row of hangars home remains a mystery—one that keeps surfacing and growing . Historically, Tonopah has proven itself as the natural place where secret aircraft migrate to after being in an experimentation and development state at Area 51. At Tonopah, they move to a semi-operational and even fully operational state while still remaining under a cloak of secrecy. We saw this with the F-117 and the RQ-170. With this in mind, are we seeing a force of unmanned combat air vehicles, stealth helicopters , or even a manned spy aircraft that has existed in the black for many years, or something totally different? We just don’t know, but this image serves as an additional reminder that a pocket fleet, or pocket fleets, of secret aircraft, may very well be living in the shadows at Tonopah. In fact, we would be amazed if that wasn’t the case.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",Turkey’s Deepening Intervention In The Libyan Civil War Point’s To Erdogan’s Grand Ambitions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The possibility that Turkish troops may intervene directly in Libya’s simmer civil war is growing after lawmakers in Ankara approved a military cooperation deal that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed with his Libyan counterpart Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj last month. This reflects Turkey’s apparent growing geopolitical ambitions, which have also recently prompted a crisis over maritime boundaries and resource rights in the Eastern Mediterranean and is inflaming a growing divide with traditional allies, chiefly the United States . On Dec. 16, 2019, Turkey’s parliament approved the agreement that Erdogan and Sarraj had signed on Nov. 27 in Istanbul. This deal reaffirmed the Turkish government’s commitment to providing military assistance and materiel support to the internationally-recognized Government of National According (GNA) based in Tripoli. It also leaves open the possibility for the Turkish military to deploy its own “quick reaction force” in direct support of the GNA. The Turkish and Libyan leaders had met again in Turkey on Dec. 15, but there has been no official announcement of the impending arrival of Turkish troops in the North African country. “We will be protecting the rights of Libya and Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean,” Erdogan had said on Turkey’s A Haber television network on Dec. 15. “We are more than ready to give whatever support necessary to Libya.” The Turkish President had also decried Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar, who as “not a legitimate leader” and “representative of an illegal structure.” Haftar has been leading a challenge to the GNA from his main base of operations in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi for years now. Forces aligned with his Libyan National Army (LNA), with support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia, control much of the country. You can read more about Haftar and the origins of the current Libyan conflict in this past War Zone piece . Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar., Vladimir Astapkovich/Sputnik  via AP On Dec. 12, 2019, Haftar had announced a new offensive aimed at taking control of Tripoli and ousting Sarraj and the GNA. The LNA had tried and failed to do the same in April. “Today we announce the decisive battle and the advancement towards the heart of the capital to set it free … advance now our heroes,” Haftar had declared in a televised speech carried on Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya television network. Haftar claims that the LNA is the country’s legitimate military and that he is simply fighting terrorists and Islamist militants on behalf of the central government. At the same time, however, he has also disputed the GNA’s authority, saying that they are in league with the same terrorists and militants he says he is fighting, and clearly has designs on running the country. Turkey’s growing role in Libya’s civil war Libya has been in a state of near-constant civil conflict since a NATO-led intervention enabled rebels to unseat and kill long-time Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The GNA, which came into being following a United Nations-brokered deal in 2015, continues to enjoy the ostensible support of most of the international community, including the United States and major Western European powers, such as France. Turkey, however, has emerged more recently as one of the GNA’s most active and ardent supporters. On Dec. 13, the day after Haftar announced his new offensive and before Turkish legislators had even approved the new deal with Libya, a Boeing 747-412 cargo aircraft, which belonged to Moldovan charter service Aerotranscargo , flew from Istanbul to Misrata, a city to the East of Tripoli under GNA control. Observers and experts widely believed that this plane was carrying a mix of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment bound for GNA forces. In addition, plane watchers using only tracking software spotted what might have been a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aircraft, which can be configured to carry weapons, heading toward Misrata, as well. The LNA promptly launched an airstrike on the Misrata airport, which appeared to target a pair of hangars where arms, ammunition, and equipment could have been stored. Unconfirmed video purporting to depict the aftermath of those strikes shows a large fire at the airport. Also on Dec. 13, 2019, the LNA claimed to have shot down another TB2 near Tripoli. Libya has technically remained under a U.N. arms embargo, but a recent report from that international organization has found that foreign supporters of both the GNA and the LNA have flaunted it repeatedly. In May 2019, following Haftar’s failed offensive to take Tripoli, the Turkish government began visibly supplying the GNA with various weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment. This also notably included shipments of Bayraktar TB2s, as well as BMC Kirpi mine-protected wheeled armored vehicles. Drones have become an increasingly important feature on both sides of the Libyan conflict. The Chinese-made Wing Loong family of unmanned aircraft, a rough analog the U.S. MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper , which came by way of the United Arab Emirates along with manned IOMAX AT-802i armed crop dusters, have supported the LNA since 2016. The importance of drones has only increased as the availability of manned aircraft to both sides, such as GNA Mirage F1s and LNA MiG-23s , has steadily dropped as they have become increasingly difficult to operate and maintain. Anti-aircraft fire has claimed a number of these jets over the years, too. Possibility of Turkish troops on the ground If Turkey were to deploy actual troops to Libya, it would represent a significant escalation in its participation in the conflict. Both the GNA and the LNA have employed mercenaries over the years , but the overt presence of actual foreign forces fighting on one side or another would be a marked change in the character of the fighting, in general. However, there are indications that things have been trending in this direction in recent months. Last year, reports first began to emerge claiming that the shadowy Russian private military company Wagner , which has strong ties, if not more direct links, to Russia’s intelligence services, had sent personnel to support Haftar. The rogue Libyan general has been actively courting Kremlin support for at least two years now and the U.S. government has accused actual Russian troops, in addition to the Wagner forces, of taking part in the conflict on his behalf this year. “So this is something we’ve been talking about for some time, but it is Russian regulars and the Wagner forces that are being deployed in significant numbers on the ground and support of the LNA,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker told reporters on Nov. 26, 2019. “We think this is incredibly destabilizing.” The United Nations has also accused Sudan’s Rapid Security Forces (RSF) of deploying 1,000 personnel to Libya to support the LNA, possibly in coordination with Russian government forces or Wagner mercenaries. The RSF is best known for overseeing the notoriously brutal Janjaweed militias, accused of numerous atrocities while fighting rebels in Sudan’s Darfur region. It has also been responsible for violently suppressing renewed protests against the country’s new military junta that took power after it ousted long-time dictator Omar Al Bashir in April 2019 following major public demonstrations. Wagner was also linked to efforts to keep Bashir in power. Needless to say, the possibility of Turkish troops finding themselves fighting directly against the LNA, as well as its foreign mercenaries, and any actual troops Hafter’s international backers may have sent covertly, raises the real possibility that the conflict could enter an entirely new phase and have impacts well beyond Libya’s borders. U.S. involvement in Libya That same kind of risk calculous may have been a factor in the U.S. military’s decision to order special operations forces to evacuate from an area to the west of Tripoli via a U.S. Navy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft in the face of LNA advances in April. The United States has continued to operate within Libya amid the country’s unrest since 2011, with the main focuses at present being containing the spread of ISIS’ Libyan franchise and other terrorist groups, as well as hunting down individuals linked to the infamous attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in 2012. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8c0IelvhMzs American personnel operate from a number of forward locations in the country in both GNA- and LNA-controlled territory in support of these missions and have at least appeared to try to deconflict on some level with Haftar’s forces in the past. In November, the LNA admitted that it had shot down an American drone flying over Tripoli, but said it had done so accidentally. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) subsequently said that it believed a Russian-supplied air defense system was responsible for the shoot-down, thought it could not say whether Russian mercenaries were operating it at the time. They “didn’t know it was a U.S. remotely piloted aircraft when they fired on it,” U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, head of AFRICOM, told Reuters earlier in December, adding that the incident has apparently caused some strain between the U.S. military and the LNA. “But they certainly know who it belongs to now and they are refusing to return it. They say they don’t know where it is but I am not buying it.” There have been rumors that U.S. forces or diplomatic staff have withdrawn from Tripoli, via LCAC, from the same location as they were in April. Given the identical details, this may just be a mistaken re-report of the earlier news. In addition, C-17A Globemaster III airlifters were seen on online flight tracking software appearing to fly routes to and from Benghazi for unclear reasons. U.S. Africa Command’s public affairs office said that there have been no evacuations or “relocations,” the term it used to describe the movement of forces near Tripoli in April, in response to recent events. The U.S. State Department’s press office also declined to say whether or not any of its personnel had left Libya recently. However, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli has been shuttered indefinitely since 2014 in light of the country’s unstable security situation. There have also been questions in the past about whether the United States might, despite its public pronouncements of continued support for the GNA, be looking to change tack and back Haftar instead. There were reports in April that President Donald Trump and his administration had given at least tacit approval to the LNA’s offensive toward Tripoli. The U.S. government did change tack , but has continued to engage directly with Haftar and the LNA, ostensibly in an attempt to resolve the conflict. Whether or not the West, in general, remains committed to the GNA also came up when its forces captured U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, along with Chinese-made guided artillery shells , purportedly from LNA units. France later claimed these that weapons belonged to its forces in the country, but that they were inoperable and had been awaiting destruction. The apparent extremely close proximity of French elements to LNA forces raised questions about whether officials in Paris were playing both sides of the conflict. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9CwgKqY5ulE A Mediterranean maritime boundary crisis Regardless, the conflict in Libya has already had larger international impacts when it comes to humanitarian issues and there is already evidence that the new deal between Ankara and Tripoli may have serious and broader second-order effects. Beyond the security cooperation components, the agreement between the two countries formalizes a bilateral agreement on maritime boundaries in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Turkish government sees the arrangement as giving it sole rights to exploit natural gas resources in one particular area. Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus, to varying degrees, see it as infringing both on their sovereign territory and their own exclusive economic zones , in violation of international law. It could also effectively block plans for a massive undersea Eastern Mediterranean gas pipeline that would connect Levantine countries, such as Israel and Lebanon, with Cyrpus and Greece, and, by extension, the rest of Europe. “Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus cannot carry out excavations in the Mediterranean without the permission of Turkey,” Turkish President Erdogan said during an interview with the Turkish TRT television network in November. ”We will protect our maritime borders in accordance with international agreements, thus protecting our rights and the rights of the Turkish part of Cyprus.” A map of the maritime boundaries in the Eastern Mediterranean as Turkish authorities see them, including those that Turkey and Libya’s GNA have now agreed to. , Anadolu Agency It’s not clear if Libyan Prime Minister Sarraj agreed to these provisions to ensure the promise of Turkish military support, but the arrangement has infuriated all of the other countries that have claims in the region. Egypt staged a major maritime drill in response, which included a demonstration of its Soviet-era, Chinese-built, American-upgraded Romeo class diesel-electric submarines and their ability to launch UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Greece has expelled Libya’s ambassador to the country in protest. The European Union , of which Greece and Cyprus are members, has also criticized the deal. The entire situation looks set to be, at best, a protracted legal dispute, akin broadly to challenges in international courts to China’s claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea. Aggressive Turkish foreign policy All told, Turkey’s recent decisions regarding Libya reflect its increasingly assertive and unilateral foreign policy, overall. Erdogan has already demonstrated his willingness to both ignore and outright act against the geopolitical interests of traditional Turkish allies, such as the United States, with little apparent regard for the ramifications. This was clear when Turkey launched its intervention into northern Syria in October 2019 that was aimed primarily at U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish local forces. That military operation was followed soon thereafter with a deal between Ankara and Moscow about patrolling that part of the country. A map that the Russian Ministry of Defense previously released, showing where it is monitoring the northern Syrian border in cooperation with Turkish forces. The dashed line on either side of the gray shaded area, which is entirely under Turkish control, is the six-mile deep buffer zone that Russian forces are patrolling now. The dashed-and-dotted line represents a “safe zone” that U.S.-backed Kurdish forces are not supposed to enter., Russian MoD Ergodan had already incited the ire of the United States and had drawn criticism from other NATO allies by insisting on buying S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia. The U.S. government subsequently booted Turkey out of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program over operational security concerns, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . Turkey has remained defiant, announcing plans to buy more S-400s and other Russian military hardware , which, in turn, looks set to result in serious U.S. sanctions and a potential arms embargo . If the United States does take those actions, Turkey has threatened to respond by suspending American access to various bases inside the country, including Incirlik Air Base , which, at least far as is known, still hosts dozens of B61 nuclear bombs , and Site K , a radar facility that supports U.S. ballistic missile defenses in the region. There has been a flurry of U.S. Air Force traffic to and from Incirlik in recent days, including a visit by a C-17A transport aircraft from 62nd Airlift Wing at Joint Base Lewis–McChord in Washington state. This unit has the so-called Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) mission, making it responsible for air movements of nuclear weapons, which you can read about in detail in this past War Zone story . This followed an unusual sighting of another PNAF C-17A at Volkel Air Base in the Netherlands, another base where the United States keeps B61s. It is unclear whether or not any of these movements indicate the withdrawal of any B61s, something the U.S. government has been reportedly considering doing since October, or other U.S. forces from Incirlik in response to recent U.S.-Turkish tensions. Back in Libya, it’s unclear how the situation might continue to evolve in the coming days and weeks. As of yesterday, the LNA offensive toward Tripoli had appeared to stall as it had in April, which eventually led to Haftar’s forces withdrawing under international pressure. If it looks as if Haftar and the LNA may finally be getting the upper hand, especially with backing from their various international partners, Turkey may feel compelled to intervene, which will only make the future of an already extremely complex conflict more uncertain and unpredictable.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 19, 2019",Global Strike Command Strikes Confusion With New Helicopter Nickname Teaser Tweet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is set to reveal the official nickname for its new MH-139A light utility helicopters at a ceremony later this week. However, it appeared briefly earlier today that an official Tweet from Air Force Global Strike Command, which is set to be the primary user of these helicopters, employing them to guard America’s missile silos , had let the moniker slip out early. Air Force Global Strike Command’s (AFGSC) Twitter account made the post teasing the naming ceremony, which will also mark the delivery of the first MH-139A to the Command on Dec. 16, 2019. This event is scheduled to take place at Duke Field in Florida on Dec. 19. There, AFGSC, Detachment 7 will become responsible for the initial operational test and evaluation of the helicopters. AFGSC’s Tweet included the hashtag “#Striker” in its Tweet. This seemed distinct and more nickname-like than the other tags that focused on the helicopters attributes – “#Faster” and “#Smarter” – and other common U.S. military buzzwords – “#Lethality,” “#Innovation,” and “#Modernization” – which quickly prompted speculation that this might be its new name. As it turns out, “Striker” is how the Command refers to personnel assigned to it and not the MH-139A’s nickname, an AFGSC public affairs officer told The War Zone in an Email. This is similar to how Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) talks about its airmen and women as “Commandos.” AFGSC is set to be the largest single operator of the MH-139A, with the helicopters supporting Security Forces personnel tasked with guarding missile silos and other infrastructure related to the United States’ nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force across Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota. The Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Materiel Command, and Pacific Air Forces, will also receive examples for a variety of VIP support, local base rescue, disaster relief, training, and other support missions. You can read about more in this past War Zone story . Boeing, in partnership with Italian defense contractor Leonardo, won the contract worth up to $2.8 billion to supply a replacement for the Air Force’s fleet of aging UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters in September 2018. The Air Force plans to eventually purchase up to 84 MH-139As, which are variants of Leonardo’s AW139. Striker certainly sounded like a plausible nickname, perhaps even more so given that it has this existing connotation within the Command. It is also, in very broad strokes, similar to Raider, which the Air Force chose for the B-21 stealth bomber in 2016 following an internal poll that saw thousands of submissions . This was the last time the service had to name an aircraft or helicopter that AFGSC would be the primary operator of, indicating that there may be a trend of sorts forming within the command. The Raider name for the B-21 was also a specific reference to the famous Doolittle Raiders , who conducted the first airstrikes on Japan’s Home Islands during World War II. In September, the Air Force also gave the name Red Hawk to its future T-7A jet trainers for Air Education and Training Command, a very different kind of name that also made a direct World War II reference, in this case to the legendary African-American Tuskegee Airmen . Another World War II-related moniker is definitely one possibility. It will be very interesting to see what nickname the Air Force ultimately chooses for the MH-139A, as it also represents one of, if not the first helicopter that has been entirely unique to the Air Force, at least for the time being. This means that the service does not have an existing name or naming convention to immediately refer to. For example, the UH-1N’s official nickname, Iroquois, comes from the Army, which names all of its aircraft and helicopters after Native American tribes and notable figures, with tribal consent . It’s unofficial nickname, Twin Huey, also traces back to the Army’s original designation for the first helicopter in this iconic family, the HU-1A, or Huey. The N variant, also known as the Bell 212, was the first production model in the line to feature a twin-engine configuration. In the past, when the Air Force has not simply used the name another service has previously applied when adopting a new helicopter, it has typically chosen the name of the developmental program that led to its particular variant. Good examples of this are the HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopter, a version of of the UH-60 Black Hawk that the Army was first to adopt, and the now-retired MH-53E/H/J Pave Low series of special operations helicopters, derived from Sikorsky’s CH-53 Sea Stallions that first entered service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy. An MH-53J Pave Low III., USAF It’s possible that Pave Hawk may get recycled in some fashion for the Air Force’s new HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH), which also has yet to receive an official nickname. Pave Hawk II or another variation on the “Hawk” theme would make sense in this case given that the W model is derived from the latest variant of the Black Hawk, the UH-60M. Of course, no matter what the helicopter’s official nickname turns out to be, there’s still no guarantee that will be the name that its pilots and crews actually use, either.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Maybe the most prominent program to emerge from America’s shadowy foreign materiel exploitation (FME) ecosystem was Constant Peg . During the late 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. was flying captured, found, and otherwise reconstituted Russian tactical jets against its own in extreme secrecy. The program also gave birth to the enigmatic Tonopah Test Range Airport as we know it today , which eventually would also house the F-117 Nighthawk force while it remained cloaked in secrecy . The base continues to host the F-117 today in its semi-retired state and a large number of other programs that are shrouded under deep classification. The video below gives us a very rare look not only at a U.S. operated MiG-23 Flogger preparing for a mission, but also into one of the original hangars built on the base for Constant Peg that still stand today. It is one of three hangars that are the largest on the base, with 160-foot wide hangar doors. Note that in the video, the base’s highly unique fenced apron is clearly visible. The contents of the facility were so sensitive in the 1980s that double-rowed security fencing was installed along with floodlights and other security measures more common at a maximum-security prison than an airfield. The arrangement was used to separate the runway from the rest of the base. Sliding gates open to let approved aircraft through. So, even if an uncleared plane were to land of the strip, the occupants couldn’t make it any farther than the runway.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 10, 2020",Here’s Why An E-6B Doomsday Plane Was Flying Tight Circles Off The Jersey Shore Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The E-6B Mercury that executes the “Take Charge And Move Out” (TACAMO) mission for America’s sprawling nuclear apparatus, basically delivering commands from the National Command Authority that can send nuclear-armed ballistic missiles flying during a nuclear apocalypse, is an incredible aircraft. Not only were they among the last Boeing 707 derivatives ever built, but they are also packed full of EMP hardened systems and highly skilled crews that would literally hold the world as we know it in their hands during a major crisis. Although advanced and highly secure satellite communications and line-of-sight data-links are critical parts of their capability set, a far more cumbersome system is used to talk to ballistic missile submarines hiding deep below the waves. The deployment of this fascinating capability was caught today by a plane tracker that was monitoring an E-6B operating off the coast of New Jersey. The Very Low Frequency (VLF) communications system can pierce the ocean’s surface down to about 60 feet to connect with submarines lurking in the planet’s vast undersea environment. A downside to this capability is that data transfer rates are appallingly slow, so only very simple communiques, like Emergency Action Messages , can be transmitted, and huge antenna arrays are required to both send and receive those messages. The E-6B’s primary VLF antenna is just over five miles long. It also has a shorter one that is deployed via a trapdoor arrangement in its tail. The VLF antennas are stabilized with a drogue on its trailing end. The idea is to get the antennas as close to vertical as possible for maximum transmission effectiveness. This is done by putting the aircraft into a very steep and tight banking turn at slow speed and above 20,000 feet, not far above the aircraft’s stall speed. These turns are repeated, oftentimes for hours at a time, as messages are sent. E-6B Mercury. , USAF A submarine trails its own long VLF antenna to receive the transmission. If the submarine is too deep to receive the signal, the VLF antenna can be floated to a shallower depth via a buoy while the submarine remains underway at greater depth. This maneuver is precisely what was spotted today by one eagle-eyed aircraft tracker and open-source intelligence enthusiast, @vcdgf555 . An E-6B was operating off the northeastern coast of the U.S., hundreds of miles out to sea, and executing a VLF communications deployment maneuver. This track gives us a great visual portrayal of what such a maneuver looks like: Submarines can receive many more forms of communication when they are at periscope depth, but for the boomers , the nuclear ballistic missile submarines that must stay hidden in order to assure the strategic second-strike deterrent, exposing themselves in such a manner isn’t really an option in many cases. Even releasing satellite communications buoys that are tethered to the submarine and float to the surface can increase the submarine’s chances of detection to unacceptable levels. VLF messages can be transmitted far over the horizon from ground stations as well. The U.S. Navy maintains a number of these facilities just for that purpose, but in a nuclear exchange, they would be some of the first targets struck. As such, the E-6B’s ability to use the same form of communication during a nuclear exchange is absolutely essential. They could quite literally be the last node on earth capable of distributing such orders. It’s worth noting that the Air Force’s E-4B Nightwatch National Emergency Airborne Command Post aircraft also have VLF antennas that work in a similar fashion if need be, although conveying launch commands to the Navy’s ballistic missile submarine fleet is not their primary mission as it is for the E-6Bs. Yet the E-6Bs are also multi-role platforms and share other capabilities with the E-4B. With so much connectivity at their fingertips and having a highly trained team that can give everything from strategic nuclear attack advice to providing global weather forecasting, they can also act as command posts for many types of contingencies, from taking the National Command Authority aloft and executing a nuclear war to providing assistance after natural disasters. The E-6B burns a lot of gas in its tight turns during VLF operations. Midair refueling is a key part of its operations. , USAF E-6Bs have participated in FEMA exercises in the past and they can provide a lot of important capability without even leaving the ground. This can be absolutely critical to officials responding to a crisis in an entire region cutoff from normal communications infrastructure. The Mercurys and their VLF communications capabilities are just pieces of the bewildering infrastructure puzzle that rose up and evolved after nuclear weapons became a reality. The best overview of this incredible phenomenon is the book Raven Rock . Check out our interview with its author, Garrett Graff, here . It’s amazing to think that at any given time there is a portion of the 16 E-6B strong fleet either already in the air or sitting alert at places like Travis AFB in California and NAS Patuxent River in Maryland, as well as other far less predictable locales around the globe, ready to spring into action at a moments notice. Their primary job is an incredibly dark one. If called upon, they would directly facilitate the end of the world. But the fact that they are so capable of suddenly carrying out that mission ensures that they won’t ever actually have to. With all this in mind, the E-6B is truly one of the most important and fascinating aircraft types on earth and it does its job with a bit of aerobatic flair.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2020",F-35 Cueing Artillery To Take Out Air Defense Site During Test Is A Glimpse Of The Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army ground artillery units recently conducted a test in which they destroyed a mock air defense system based on targeting information from a U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter . The tactic allowed the joint force to destroy a mock threat while allowing the F-35 to remain in its most stealthy mode and not reveal itself by engaging it directly. This is a concept of operations that could be extremely valuable for U.S. forces in a future large-scale conflict against an opponent with dense integrated air defense network and one that could easily expand to include other assets, including unmanned aircraft and new, longer-range artillery and tactical missile systems . This particular scenario was part of a larger Joint Strike Fighter Integration experiment that took place at one of the Doña Ana Ranges in New Mexico, which are part of the Fort Bliss Training Center that is headquartered in neighboring Texas. M109A6 Paladin self-propelled 155mm howitzers from the Army’s 1st Armored Division Artillery and an F-35A from the Air Force’s 59th Test and Evaluation Squadron took part in the test, along with a host of supporting units. As F-35s have entered operational service across the U.S. Marine Corps , Air Force , and Navy , the U.S. military as a whole has been exploring a variety of new concepts of operation for integrating the stealth jets into regular operations. “The F-35 is a very capable aircraft executing against numerous targets. We can use its sensors to identify multiple targets, and we can use the Army to take them out,” U.S. Air Force Captain Charles Humphrey, assigned to Air Combat Command acting as the exercise director for test, said in a subsequent statement . “We can start shaping the battlefield faster, because when we start fighting bigger opponents, we are needing to be able to do that.” In this general respect, F-35 represents the latest evolution of using aircraft as forward spotters for artillery units on the ground, a concept that is almost as old as airplanes themselves . The Joint Strike Fighter’s expansive sensor suite, which you can read about more in these past War Zone stories , makes it particularly well suited to this kind of mission. An M109A6 from a unit assigned to the 1st Armored Division fires a shell during an unrelated training exercise in Europe in 2019., US Army The jets are already sucking up an amazing amount of electronic signals data , which allows them to spot, categorize, and geolocate various emitters, including radars associated with air defense and artillery systems and communications nodes. The aircraft can then send that information to other aircraft, units on the ground, or command centers in rear areas to give other forces a more complete picture of the battlespace around them and potential threats. The F-35 can also fuse together imagery and other data it collects using its AN/APG-81 radar , Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), and AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and share that information, as well. So, it’s not a huge leap to see how ground artillery units, who increasingly employ computerized targeting systems and GPS-assisted and other guided munitions, can take that data, especially the geolocation information, and then rapidly target those threats. The U.S. Marine Corps demonstrated doing just this in a separate exercise in 2018 , with a truck-mounted M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) destroying a shipping container with a guided 226mm artillery rocket after receiving targeting data from one of the service’s F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . A US Marine Corps M142 HIMARS launcher., USMC What the Army and the Air Force have now done in New Mexico is take this one step forward and show how an air-ground team can work together to perform the suppression of enemy air defenses/destruction of enemy air defenses ( SEAD/DEAD ) mission, something that aircraft have primarily done in the past. This could offer the U.S. military an extremely important new capability for dealing with these threats depending on the exact situation. The F-35 itself is often described as a tool for “ kicking down the door ” and destroying hostile integrated air defenses to pave away for follow-on strikes, including by non-stealthy aircraft that would be more vulnerable to those defenses. However, it’s important, as always, to note that “stealth” does not mean “invisible,” either to the naked eye or hostile sensors . The F-35 has a diverse suite of countermeasures itself, including a powerful electronic warfare suite , expendable towed decoys , and internal chaff launchers , to help further protect itself, even if it is detected. The Navy and the Air Force are also in the process of integrating the new AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) missile, a multi-purpose weapon primarily intended to destroy air defense radars, that will give the jets increased standoff range when engaging those targets. The Air Force is working on a more general-purpose derivative of that weapon, the Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW), which will also give its F-35As more options for dealing with pop-up threats. A photo from a test to determine the ability of an F-35C to carry the new AGM-88G AARGM-ER internally., Orbital ATK Navy F-35Cs can already carry the stealthy AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) precision-guided glide bomb, another SEAD/DEAD tool, and the manufacturer Raytheon had said it expects to finish the integration of this weapon on the F-35A soon, if it hasn’t already. The Navy is funding a powered cruise missile derivative , too. The U.S.-Norwegian Joint Strike Missile (JSM), another cruise missile, will be another future option, as will GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) and the more capable GBU-53/B Stormbreaker , previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb II . Unfortunately, to effectively operate in these high threat environments at all, F-35s will also need to be flying in their most stealthy configuration, carrying only a limited number of weapons internally and keeping their own sensors in passive modes except when absolutely necessary. This is where ground artillery could come in as another way to help clear the path of threats for both stealthy and non-stealthy aircraft alike. As the F-35 did in this particular recent experiment in New Mexico, over an actual future battlefield, Joint Strike Fighters, while operating at the safest distance from the threat possible, could use its sensors, especially its passive ones, to geolocate targets and then feed that information to Army units. The Joint Strike Fighters would not have to use their own limited ordnance, either, preserving those weapons for more pressing threats. The aircraft could also stay on station after they’ve expended all of their own bombs and missiles and continue to destroy targets with an effectively unlimited magazine, albeit indirectly. Army artillery units down below also have the benefits of being highly flexible and able to rapidly shift focus from one target area to another, so long as it within their range , and can operate in poor weather that might ground aircraft or otherwise limit their ability to respond. Despite the obvious benefits, the concept the Air Force and the Army demonstrated in New Mexico still isn’t ready for prime time just yet and will need refinements and further experimentation. The entire kill chain, from when the F-35 detected the target to when the M109A6s destroyed it, took 10 minutes and required the use of multiple different networks and data links . During the course of the exercise, the joint force evaluated eight different networks for sharing information between the stealthy jet and ground troops. Members of the 1st Armored Division Artillery inside an M109A6 self-propelled howitzer during the recent Joint Strike Fighter Integration experiment., US Army It’s not clear whether any of these options involved the F-35 using its stealthy Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), which is designed to reduce the likelihood of opponents detecting the transmissions and would be essential for keeping the jet concealed in an actual operational version of this scenario. It seems unlikely given that MADL can only communicate other aircraft equipped with this data link, which is presently only found on the Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force is already pursuing a number of projects aimed at expanding the ability of MADL-equipped aircraft, which will also likely include the B-21 Raider stealth bomber in the future, to communicate stealthily with F-22 Raptors and other assets. There is also already an established tactic in which F-35s relay information among each other until the daisy chain reaches the edge of the high threat area, where the last aircraft can then safely broadcast it via other more readily accessible waveforms. The aircraft could also make use of some form of communications and data-sharing gateway , such as the Air Force’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN). You can read more about these issues in this recent War Zone piece . The Air Force and Army are also very clearly looking at ways to expand this beyond just F-35s and howitzers, as well. New, extended-range 155mm guns will already give artillery units the ability to engage threats that Joint Strike Fighters mark while penetrating deeper into hostile territory. A prototype of the Army’s XM1299 howitzer, a derivative of the new M109A7 fitted with a larger main gun, which you can read about more here ., via @lfx160219 However, ramjet powered artillery shells , longer-range rocket artillery , and new ground-launched missiles – including possible future ground-launched cruise missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles that a now-defunct treaty between the United States and Russia had previously banned – as well as hypersonic weapons , will dramatically increase the range at which troops on the ground can engage those threats. Northrop Grumman has also proposed a containerized ground launcher for the AARGM-ER missile, which would seem to be ideally suited to this concept, as well. A model of a proposed containerized launcher for the AGM-88G AARGM-ER., Joseph Trevithick “Today we are working with the Air Force and we are testing the ability of the U.S. Army’s field artillery to receive messages from an F-35, a 5th generation fighter jet, for possible fire missions,” U.S. Army Major William O’Neil, the fire support officer for the 1st Infantry Division’s forces during the recent test in New Mexico, said afterward . “While we are using canons today, the M109A6 Paladins, the goal is how we integrate a Tomahawk cruise missile and other missile units at the division level into Joint Fires.” A US Army briefing slide from 2018 showing how its various planned new atillery systems might operate on a future battlefield. This notably shows various extended-range artillery systems engaging air defense threats well behind the enemy front line., US Army O’Neil wasn’t just speaking generally. Earlier this year, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , between the United States and Russia collapsed, paving the way for U.S. development of ground-launched cruise missiles and ballistic missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. The now-defunct bilateral agreement had banned both countries from developing and fielding these types of missiles. In August 2019, the U.S. military demonstrated a ground-based Tomahawk using a trailer-mounted derivative of the U.S. Navy’s Mk 41 vertical launch system, a test you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story. Just yesterday, another test occurred involving a prototype intermediate-range ballistic missile . Ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons would offer important advantages in speed, as well as range, over ground-launched subsonic cruise missiles, as well. Being able to strike an opponent rapidly after an F-35 first detects them would be essential for engaging pop-up threats and time-sensitive targets, such as mobile air defense systems , which could potentially shut down and relocate if they detected an incoming threat. F-35s could potentially utilize this tactic when working with U.S. Navy surface ships and submarines, as well, especially the latter service’s Ohio class guided missile submarines, which are configured to be submersible command centers and intelligence fusion cells, in addition to their ability to carry up to 154 Tomahawks and may be able to fire hypersonic weapons in the future. The War Zone recently published an in-depth profile of these boats, which you can find here . Earlier this year, the Air Force and the Navy already agreed to work toward improving the ability to integrate their various networks, an area where the latter service has already made significant strides in this regard with its Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter-Air (NIFC-CA) efforts. Future strikes also wouldn’t need to necessarily rely on traditional artillery shells or missiles, but could involve more novel options, such as loitering munitions and networked drone swarms . Non-kinetic options, such as small unmanned aircraft carrying electronic warfare jammers , could also be among the options available to actually neutralize air defense and other targets that F-35s might find. There’s no reason, necessarily, that an F-35 would have to be the asset acting as the forward sensor node. Future stealthy drones and autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) could be the ones hunting for air defense threats for Army artillery troops to destroy in the future. A manned aircraft, such as an F-35 or a B-21, could also be working with a group of unmanned “ loyal wingmen ,” expanding their ability to locate targets across a broad area. Together with artificial intelligence-driven targeting systems, which could more rapidly identify objects of interest and then categorize them, this distributed network could help reduce the total overall time between first spotting a threat and engaging it. The Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie drone is at the center of a number of efforts exploring how low-cost unmanned aircraft operating with manned aircraft or in autonomous swarms will work  with other forces on future battlefields., USAF The Air Force itself already seems to be moving in this direction in many ways, with plans to replace its E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, battlefield management aircraft with a family of systems, including unmanned aircraft. The War Zone has already explored the implications of that plan in detail in the past. “This is a tactical-level event that helps to further refine our joint integration between the services as we leverage new technologies to get after multi-domain operations,” Air Force Captain Humphrey, who led the New Mexico test, said . “This is one small piece of that as we move forward, which is identifying which capabilities work and how we can actually use those capabilities in peer to peer planning.” All told, an F-35 calling in an artillery strike on an air defense node is an important demonstration of the latest evolution of using aircraft as airborne forward spotters. At the same time, it is also looks set to be a stepping stone to an all-new set of capabilities so that surface-based forces on land, and potentially at sea, can help neutralize enemy air defense networks to clear the way for follow-on strikes.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2019","Egypt’s Soviet-Era, Chinese-Made, American-Upgraded Subs Can Still Fire Harpoon Missiles","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Egyptian Navy recently released a short, but very interesting video offering a close look at a recent training exercise in the Mediterranean, with a particular emphasis on one of the country’s four remaining Cold War vintage Romeo class diesel-electric attack submarines. Egypt is one of just two remaining operators of variants of this type, the other being North Korea, which revealed earlier this year that it was converting one of its examples into a new ballistic missile submarine, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . The remaining Egyptian examples, all of which originally came from China, are unique to the country, having gone through a major refit with U.S. assistance in the late 1980s and early 1990s that, among other things, allow them to fire UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The Egyptian Ministry of Defense released the video on its official YouTube page on Dec. 11, 2019. The Romeo class submarine with the hull number 849 took part in the exercise, as well as one of the country’s much newer German-made Type 209/1400mod diesel-electric boats. The Gamal Abdel Nasser , one of the country’s two French-built Mistral class amphibious assault ships, which you can read about in much more detail here , was also present, with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and CH-47 Chinook transports operating from its flight deck. At least two Gowind class corvettes, which Egypt also acquired from France, participated, as well. Clips of the Romeo , inside and out, took up a significant portion of the video’s runtime. The interior shots offer something of an unusual view, showing a submarine filled with a mixture of archaic gauges, valve handwheels, and other features that underscore the age of the underlying design, coupled with much more modern radar screens, computers, and other improvements, some of which are also now more than 25 years old. It all being a product of Egypt’s somewhat curious history with these submarines. The Soviet Union first began building Romeo s, which displace around 1,830 tons submerged, in the 1950s as successors to the country’s first post-World War II submarines, which were derived from captured Nazi U-boat designs. Prior to the Sino-Soviet split, the Chinese received the requisite technical data package to begin building examples of their own, which they called Type 033s. Between 1966 and 1969, Egypt acquired six Romeos from the Soviet Union. Between 1982 and 1984, the Egyptian Navy received another four Type 033s from China in a unique configuration known as the ES5A . The ES5As replaced a number of Soviet-designed systems with more modern Chinese designs, including new sonars, communications equipment, and periscopes. There were also unspecified improvements that reduced their acoustic signature, something that is absolutely vital to reducing any submarine’s vulnerability to detection and attack. A view inside the Egyptian Navy’s upgraded Romeo class submarine 849 showing decidedly dated valve handwheel controls., Egyptian Ministry of Defense capture China further improved on this refit package to create the Type 033G variant for its own use, which also added computerized torpedo fire control systems and the ability to fire acoustic homing torpedoes from their six bow-mounted and two stern-mounted torpedo tubes. The Chinese subsequently offered Egypt a refit package in the mid-1980s to bring its fleet of Romeos and Type 033s up to a similar standard, known as the ES5B . Reportedly, the submarines in this updated configuration were 20 decibels quieter than the original Soviet design, a nearly 13 percent reduction in the boat’s acoustic signature. Their submerged top speed of 13 knots remained unchanged. At the same time, Egypt’s relations with the United States had been steadily improving. In 1979, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had agreed to a U.S.-brokered peace deal with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, which came into force the following year. Part of that deal was that the Egyptian government would get American economic and military aid, something that continues to this day. Another one Egypts upgraded Romeo class submarines during another training exercise in 2016., Egyptian Ministry of Defense Though militants opposed to the deal, including members of the country’s military, succeeded in assassinating Sadat in 1981, the country’s government continued to uphold the deal and move forward in improving ties with the United States. One of the things Egyptian authorities asked for was U.S. assistance in further modernizing the country’s submarine capabilities. So, in 1988, the State Department approved a plan wherein a company called Tacoma Boatyard in the Washington State city of the same name would further modernize the remaining submarines, according to one edition of the Naval Institute’s Combat Fleets . The refit was extensive, giving the boats the ability to fire torpedo-tube-launched UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles and Mk 37 Mod 1 wire-guided torpedoes, according to one edition of Jane’s Fighting Ships . The recent video shows submarine 849 firing a Harpoon. The inside of the forward torpedo room on the Egyptian Navy’s upgraded Romeo class submarine 849., Egyptian Ministry of Defense capture The boats also received new active and passive sonars from American defense contractor Loral and German firm Atlas Elektronik , respectively. Atlas Elektronik also supplied a new fire control system. Refits to two of the original Soviet-supplied submarines and all four of the ones Egypt had acquired from Chinese were completed in 1993. The Egyptian Navy had decided to simply retire the other two Romeos it had received from the Soviets in the 1960s. Some of the more modern electronics on the Egyptian Navy’s upgraded Romeo class submarine 849., Egyptian Ministry of Defense capture The Egyptians did not necessarily plan to still be operating the upgraded Romeos and Type 033s more than 25 years later. In the late 1980s, Egypt had also entered into a preliminary contract to buy the retired British Navy Porpoise class submarine HMS Walrus , as well as the first-in-class ex-HMS Oberon , both of which had originally entered service in the 1960s. That deal, which would also have included extensive refits, collapsed by the end of the decade. According to Jane’s Fighting Ships , and these two diesel-electric subs were scrapped in 1991. In 1994, the U.S. State Department approved a convoluted plan wherein Egypt would buy German Type 209s, which American shipyard Huntington Ingalls would build under license in the United States using U.S.-made sonars and other internal systems. This would have allowed the Egyptians to purchase the submarines using American military aid via the Foreign Military Sales program, which includes stipulations about the percentage of work that must go to U.S.-based companies. That deal also fell through. In 2011, Egypt finally concluded a deal with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems directly to purchase two Type 209/1400mod class submarines, with an option to buy two more, which the country exercised in 2015. Egypt has now received two of these subs and ThyssenKrupp launched the third example in May of this year. The Egyptian Navy hopes to have received all four examples by the end of 2021. It is likely at that point that they will replace the remaining four Type 033s that are still in service for good. Egypt has already retired the two other upgraded Soviet Romeos . Egypt’s first Type 209/1400mod class submarine 861., Egyptian Ministry of Defense In the meantime, the Romeos , as is apparent from the Egyptian Ministry of Defense’s recent video, will remain an active part of the country’s naval capabilities, despite their increasing age. Especially with their ability to launch Harpoons, which provide the ability to conduct stand-off anti-ship attacks, they present at least some level of threat to more modern ships in service with potential opponents in the region. The importance of Egypt’s Navy, which is largely a regional force primarily focused on protecting the country’s interests in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and surrounding littorals, may be getting some renewed attention amid a growing spat between Turkey and its maritime neighbors, among others , over resources rights . This was the result of a deal between Turkish authorities and Libya’s internationally recognized Government of National Accord earlier this year. Egypt, as well as other countries in the Mediterranean, including Greece, Cyprus, and Israel, have rejected the arrangement, which they feel infringes on their rights. They also say it simply is invalid under international law. Relations between Turkey and Egypt, specifically, are already strained over the fact that the two countries are supporting opposing sides in Libya’s simmering civil war. “Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus cannot carry out excavations in the Mediterranean without the permission of Turkey,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said of the deal, which Turkey and Libya finalized in November, in a recent interview with the Turkish TRT news network. ”We will protect our maritime borders in accordance with international agreements, thus protecting our rights and the rights of the Turkish part of Cyprus.” Egypt’s naval exercises appeared to be signal to Turkish President Erdogan over those statements. Hopefully, the two countries will not actually come to blows, but if they do, the Egyptian Navy’s remaining unique and significantly upgraded Cold War-era Romeo class submarines remain ready to sortie out into the Mediterranean to defend the country’s interests, even as they approach the final years of their decades-long careers. When these submarines finally do leave Egyptian service, North Korea will become the last operator of the type anywhere in the world.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The incredibly tight security measures at work at the Air Force’s clandestine flight test center most commonly referred to as Area 51, a place where the government goes to hide and is literally above the law , are legendary, both in lore and actuality. From its own army of private security contractor “camo dudes” to a pocket fleet of uniquely configured Black Hawk helicopters, maintaining the installation’s perimeter integrity is a big undertaking, especially as the locale has grown in prominence within pop culture . But inside the fence, things aren’t much more hospitable when it comes to accommodating visitors. You have probably heard of the blue busses with blacked-out windows that move workers to and from the secretive facility or the requirement for passengers to leave their shades down when flying into and out of Groom Lake on one of the famous ‘Janet’ airliners that service it and other clandestine locales around America’s southwest. Even sci-fi-like hand scanners were a staple at highly secure sites on the Nevada Test And Training Range , and certainly Area 51 too, back in the 1980s. But have you ever heard of “foggles?” The term refers to goggle-like eyewear that have fogged-out wrap-around lenses and a notch or bifocal-like area at the bottom that allows a wearer to see what is immediately in front of and below them. With the vast majority of the goggle’s viewing area frosted over, nothing can be made out at any meaningful distance. They also come in darkly tinted types and a few other formats, such as laboratory-style goggles that have similar modifications. They are basically blinders for humans, but ones that are far more restrictive than those that horses use. Foggles do have a major aviation crossover, which probably explains their adaptation for security use. Their security role may very well have originated from a momentary burst of off-the-shelf genius by someone working on a clandestine aerospace program. Pilots wear similar if not identical devices for instrument training. Basically, it allows them to see just the instrument cluster so as to get accustomed to not relying on outside visual cues when flying the plane on instruments only. This also provides familiarity with the fact that their own instincts will try to trick them without those external visual cues being present. Other devices exist for this application, from ‘hoods’ to ‘visors,’ that do pretty much the same thing, but foggles are a bit less cumbersome than some of the other options that may be better suited to performing instrument upset attitude recovery drills and instrument approaches in the cockpit than walking across an unfamiliar aircraft parking ramp. These devices are often used when infrequent visitors arrive at the installation. In some cases, foggles are put on while onboard the arriving aircraft or bus and are only taken off once inside a secure windowless building. Then, when moving to a destination on base directly related to the individual’s visit, such as a particular hangar where a project is being housed, the foggles go back on. Even inside certain hangar areas, they may be worn to keep contractors visiting one program from seeing a competing one or other unknown proprietary technology nearby, if even just by chance. The same can be said for VIP type visitors that don’t have the unique clearances required to work at the base. It’s not clear if more regular workers have to wear the glasses under certain circumstances, as well, but it is likely that certain procedures have come and gone depending on changing operational concerns throughout the base’s long and bizarre history . The use of foggles may not even be native to just Area 51, either. Similar measures could be used at other highly sensitive sites under various circumstances, even if they are temporary in nature. So, even if you do get the aerospace industry’s equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket and find yourself in a position to visit Area 51 for business, the chances that you will see anything but exactly what you are supposed to see are slim to none. But maybe they will let you keep the commemorative foggles!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 19, 2019",Pentagon Conducts First Test Of Non-Nuclear Capable Ballistic Missile Post-INF Treaty (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but the U.S. military has confirmed that it launched a ground-launched ballistic missile, believed to be in the intermediate-range class, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California this morning. This is the first U.S. test of this type of weapon since the collapse earlier this year of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , between the United States and Russia, which had prohibited both countries from developing and fielding missiles in this category. CNN ‘s Ryan Brown was among the first to get the official acknowledgment of the test. In March 2019, the Pentagon announced that it planned to conduct a test of an intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, defined as a ballistic missile with a maximum range of between 1,864 and 3,418 miles, in November. It’s unclear why the test was delayed slightly. In August 2019, the U.S. military conducted a test of BGM-109 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile from a trailer-mounted derivative of the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System, another system the INF had previously banned. Under the provisions of the INF, the U.S. Air Force and Army had respectively disposed of dedicated ground-launched BGM-109G Gryphon cruise missiles and Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “The Department of Defense conducted a flight test of a conventionally-configured ground-launched ballistic missile at approximately 8:30am. Pacific Time, today, Dec. 12, 2019, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA,” the Pentagon said in a statement, according to a Tweet from CNN ‘s Brown. “We are currently evaluating the results of the test.” There were indications that the test was imminent already. On Dec. 11, 2019, Twitter user @AircraftSpots, a friend of The War Zone , had posted a Tweet about a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) cordoning off an area off the coast of California near Vandenberg ahead of what appeared to be some kind of test. Vandenberg is also routinely used to conduct regular test launches of the U.S. Air Force’s LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). There are no details yet about the missile’s actual design or capabilities. However, in 2017, the U.S. military reportedly began studying what it would take to develop weapons that the INF then prohibited. This was prompted by Russia’s development and fielding of a treaty-breaking ground-launched cruise missile, something the Kremlin continues to deny it did, which ultimately led to the Cold War-era deal falling apart. The U.S. military could have explored multiple tracks and put any number of them into action after the abandonment of the INF. Developing a missile using only one or two stages from the three-stage Minuteman III design is one option. The U.S. Army has already acquired similar designs in the past for use as surrogates for ballistic missiles during ballistic missile defense system tests. The Hera , for example, uses the second and third stages from older Minuteman II ICBMs. Another possibility would have been a conventionally armed design based on the booster that the U.S. Army developed as part of its Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) program are options that the United States could have leveraged quickly to enable this test. A test launch of the Army’s Advanced Hypersonic Weapon., US Army The Army has already been leveraging the work done under the AHW effort to support the development of a new ground-based hypersonic missile as part of a tri-service effort with the U.S. Air Force and Navy. There is also a possibility that this test was actually of a booster with a new hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top, but the Army has said it doesn’t expect to conduct the first test launch of its future ground-launched hypersonic weapon until 2022. In 2018, the service had also revealed plans for a “ Strategic Fires Missiles ” with a then-INF-breaking range, which appeared to be a new ground-launched ballistic missile. This program may also have informed work on the new IRBM. A US Army briefing slide from 2018 showing plans for the Strategic Fires Missile., US Army The test is almost certain to draw the ire of Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has already demanded a “ symmetric response ” to the August ground-launched Tomahawk test, as well as criticism from China. The U.S. government has said in the past it could use new post-INF missiles to challenge the Chinese geopolitically in the Pacific Region, especially in disputed areas, such as the South China Sea. It may also prompt responses from smaller potential opponents, such as North Korea, which has been threatening to a new “strategic” missile test before the end of the year and has decried international criticism, especially from the United States, of its own ballistic missile programs. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 1:25pm EST— Breaking Defense is reporting that what the U.S. military is now calling a “prototype conventionally-configured ground-launched ballistic missile” flew more than 310 miles, beyond the limits the INF had previously imposed. UPDATE: 1:45pm EST— The U.S. Air Force has now released footage of the test. A close-up view of the missile on the launch platform right before the test strongly suggests that the prototype has a Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (MARV) warhead. This had also been a feature on the Pershing II. A screen capture showing the full missile right before launch., USAF capture UPDATE: 2:45pm EST— Defense News has learned that the Air Force led the test in cooperation with the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO). In addition, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, previously known as Orbit ATK, was the prime contractor. Experts and observers had already noted the similarities between the missile that the U.S. military tested and previous designs based on the Castor 4 rocket booster, which is now presently a Northrop Grumman Innovation System product. Using Castor 4 would have also presented the United States with a relatively low-risk and fast track to developing a new IRBM. UPDATE: 3:05pm EST— Vandenberg Air Force base has now released a statement that says that work on the missile began in February 2019 after the U.S. government formally suspended its obligations under the INF, months before it officially withdrew from the treaty in October. The service said that it typically takes 24 months, not nine, to execute this kind of launch. “The Western Range plays an integral role in testing new capabilities with our mission partners by providing the infrastructure, personnel and range assets needed to carry out efficient missile testing from conception to evaluation,” Air Force Colonel Anthony Mastalir, commander of the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg, said in a statement. “The National Defense Strategy provides very clear direction to restore our competitive edge in the reemergence of great power competition, and we owe it to our nation to rapidly evolve and develop our capacity to defend. Our Airmen should be extremely proud of their contributions to their country today.” “The men and women of Vandenberg work diligently to execute launches efficiently, and we remain committed to providing robust support to our mission partners,” Air Force Colonel Bob Reeves, the 30th’s vice commander and who oversaw the actual launch, added. “Overseeing today’s launch operations in the Western Range Operations Control Center reminded me of just how remarkable our Airmen and partnerships are. To every member of Team V that had a hand in ensuring this launch ran smoothly, from planning to execution, I am honored to have worked alongside every single one of you.” UPDATE: 3:10pm EST— The Pentagon has issued its own brief written statement , which is as follows On Thursday, Dec. 12, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time, the U.S. Air Force, in partnership with the Strategic Capabilities Office, conducted a flight test of a prototype conventionally-configured ground-launched ballistic missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The test missile exited its static launch stand and terminated in the open ocean after more than 500 kilometers of flight. Data collected and lessons learned from this test will inform the Department of Defense’s development of future intermediate-range capabilities. UPDATE: 4:25pm EST— Some have noted that the Castor 4 motor is not currently in production, though Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems still lists it in its catalog as “inactivate production,” suggesting that it could be possible to restart making them, if necessary. Another motor from the company’s existing line could still have been employed,  such as the Orion 50S XLG. Beyond that, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has indicated that it is unclear when the U.S. military might field a new IRBM. “Once we develop intermediate range missiles and if my commanders require them then we will work closely and consult closely with our allies in Europe, Asia and elsewhere with regard to any possible deployments,” he told reporters later on Dec. 12, 2019. The National Defense Authorization Act for the 2020 Fiscal Year that the House just passed, and that looks set to pass in the Senate and then become law, also withholds funding for actually buying and deploying any such missiles until the U.S. military submits various reports answering these basic questions.

The vessel is notorious for breakdowns and accidents, some of which have been deadly.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Sep 18, 2018",Recently Retired USAF General Makes Eyebrow Raising Claims About Advanced Space Technology,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Steven L. Kwast gave a lecture last month that seems to further signal that the next major battlefield will be outer space. While military leadership rattling the space sabers is nothing new, Kwast’s lecture included comments that heavily hint at the possibility that the United States military and its industry partners may have already developed next-generation technologies that have the potential to drastically change the aerospace field, and human civilization, forever. Is this mere posturing or could we actually be on the verge of making science fiction a reality? Who Is Steven Kwast? According to his official USAF biography , Lt. Gen. Kwast graduated from the United States Air Force Academy with a degree in astronautical engineering, and also holds a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Kwast previously served as Commander of the 47th Operations Group at Laughlin Air Force Base and the 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson AFB. Kwast boasts more than 3,300 flight hours in the F-15E, T-6, T-37, and T-38 and over 650 combat hours. Lieutenant General Steven L. Kwast, USAF Lt. Gen. Kwast most recently served as Commander of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), but retired in August. According to some reports, Kwast was prematurely relieved of his duties at JBSA and blacklisted for promotion after speaking out on space-related issues despite a service-wide gag order. Kwast declined to comment on the reports and retired on September 1, 2019. Despite the controversy surrounding his removal from his post at AETC, some defense analysts and Lt. Gen. Kwast’s own supporters within the Armed Forces were suggesting prior to his retirement that he should be appointed as Commander of the Pentagon’s budding Space Force . Kwast has published several op-eds in recent years pushing for the U.S. military to take on a greater role in space in order to ensure American economic dominance and what he sees as the continued proliferation of American values. Gaining The High Ground In Space Kwast delivered a lecture at Hillsdale College in Washington, D.C. on November 20, 2019, titled “The Urgent Need for a U.S. Space Force.” Kwast’s wide-ranging speech described the power of new technologies to revolutionize humankind, referencing the competitive advantage the discovery of fire offered to early humans and the strategic value that nuclear weapons offered 20th-century superpowers. When it comes to current revolutionary technologies, Kwast says the “the power of space will change world power forever” and that it’s up to the United States military to leverage that power: “As a historian, reflecting on the fact that throughout the history of mankind… technology has always changed world power. But the story of rejecting the new and holding and clinging to the paradigms of the past is why no civilization has ever lasted forever, and values are trumped by other values when another civilization figures out a way of finding a competitive advantage. The nature of power, you either have it and your values rule or you do not have it and you must submit. We see that play out again and again in history and it’s playing out now.” As has been common as of late , Lt. Gen Kwast cites rapidly growing Chinese military and technological advances as the reason why the United States must invest heavily in new space-based technologies. “We can say today we are dominant in space but the trend lines are what you have to look at and they will pass us in the next few years if we do not do something. They will win this race and then they will put roadblocks up to space,” Kwast argues, “because once you get the high ground, that strategic high ground, it’s curtains for anybody trying to get to that high ground behind them.” Kwast claims China is already building a “Navy in space” complete with the space-based equivalents of “battleships and destroyers” which are “able to maneuver and kill and communicate with dominance, and we [the United States] are not.” Kwast’s speech centers on the thesis that the United States needs a Space Force in order to counter Chinese advances and win the competition over the economy of the future and, as an extension, who sets the values of the future: “Space is the Navy for the 21st century economy, a networked economy that will dominate any linear terrestrial economy in the four engines of growth and dominance that change world power: transportation, information, energy, and manufacturing. […] Whoever gets to the new market sets the values for that market. And we could either have the market with the values of our Constitution […] or we could have the values we see manifest in China.” As we’ve reported previously, there have been hints of radical new technologies under development by the military and, just as in Kwast’s speech, Chinese advances have been cited as the reason why these technologies are needed. China has been rapidly expanding its presence in space in recent years, placing a lander on the far side of the moon in late 2018 in what some say was a push to scout natural resources with which to develop a permanent lunar manufacturing center. China has also been developing “mothership” aircraft from which to rapidly and unpredictably launch spaceplanes and other payloads into space. The country has also launched several eyebrow-raising satellites in recent years which some analysts claim could be used in anti-satellite warfare . Beyond all this, they have been investing heavily in a traditional space program that includes many facets of manned and unmanned space technologies that rivals, and in some ways, exceeds our own. Setting the Stage for 21st Century Warfare Kwast argues that the scientists, engineers, historians, and strategists of today have been pushing the U.S. Congress to more heavily and more rapidly fund the Space Force and associated technologies, but there is still some pushback and confusion as to why these are presently needed. Kwast ultimately makes the case that the United States must be able to bring kinetic power, non-kinetic power, and informational power to the battlefield cheaper and faster than its adversaries in order to ensure strategic advantage in space. Around the 12:00 mark in the speech, Kwast makes the somewhat bizarre claim that the U.S. currently possesses revolutionary technologies that could render current aerospace capabilities obsolete: “The technology is on the engineering benches today. But most Americans and most members of Congress have not had time to really look deeply at what is going on here. But I’ve had the benefit of 33 years of studying and becoming friends with these scientists. This technology can be built today with technology that is not developmental to deliver any human being from any place on planet Earth to any other place in less than an hour.” Kwast’s comment is only one of several curious comments made by military leadership lately and they do seem to claim that we could be on the precipice of a great leap in transportation technology. We also don’t know exactly where he is coming from on all this as it is not necessarily the direct wheelhouse of someone who was running the Air Force’s training portfolio, although it does have overlaps. Whether or not the revolutionary aerospace technologies Kwast mentions have actually been developed is one thing, but Kwast’s lecture, his recent op-eds, and his supporters make it clear that there are many within the U.S. military and analyst community who have felt that there is a great need to boost investment in American space technologies and the U.S. military’s presence in space. That vision is certainly taking root across the Defense Department. Is all this setting the stage for a new space race that will benefit mankind by furthering scientific and technological development, or is it ushering in the conditions for the first great space war? Only time will tell, but according to Kwast, the technologies needed to win that war may be more science fact than fiction.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021",Lockheed Conducts First Test Of Its New Precision Strike Missile For The Army,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has successfully conducted the first test launch of its entry for U.S. Army’s Precision Strike Missile program , or PrSM. Its competitor Raytheon reportedly suffered a setback that has pushed the date of its own first test launch into early next year. The press release from Lockheed Martin did not say specifically when the company’s test launch had taken place, but said it had occurred at the Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A 6×6 truck-mounted M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) fired the missile, which struck a mock target approximately 149 miles away. “This test flight is the most recent success in a long line of product component and sub-component testing successes conducted as part of our proven development discipline to assure total mission success for our U.S. Army customer,” Gaylia Campbell, Vice President of Precision Fires and Combat Maneuver Systems at Lockheed Martin, said in a statement . “We are confident that our years of demonstrated experience in delivering unmatched Precision Fires capabilities for our U.S. Army customer and our commitment to ensuring affordability will result in the best PrSM option.” Lockheed Martin also released a brief graphical presentation, seen below, about the test with specific details about the test points. The first test launch demonstrated that the company’s PrSM design could work with the HIMARS system, including successfully exchanging data with the launcher’s fire control system. It also flew the desired distance and reached the target while flying at record speed, though the company declined to specify how fast it was going. Raytheon was supposed to have conducted the first test of its PrSM design, also known as DeepStrike, in November 2019, according to Defense News . The company has now reportedly rescheduled this launch to take place some time early on in the new year. A factsheet for Raytheon’s DeepStrike as of 2017., Raytheon The Army itself had hoped these launches would have occurred earlier this year. Unfortunately, Technical issues at a facility belonging to an unspecified sub-vendor supplying components for both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon’s missiles, as well as poor weather, forced the service to push the entire schedule back. “There were a couple of technical issues that caused us to delay about 90 days for the flight test,” U.S. Army Brigadier General John Rafferty, head of the service’s overarching Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) artillery modernization effort, had disclosed in a talk at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in July. “There was a mishap at a facility that caused some of the delay, followed by Mother Nature … extreme weather that made repair at that facility near impossible for a period of time.” The PrSM program dates back to at least 2017, when it was originally known simply as Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), with the primary objective of developing a replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS. HIMARS launchers, which are more often loaded with six 226mm guided artillery rockets , can also be armed with a single ATACMS missile thanks to a universal pod design. The tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) can have two of these weapons in a ready-to-launch configuration, in lieu of a loadout of a dozen 226mm rockets. Variants of the ATACMS missile have been in service since 1991 and various upgrade programs have improved and expanded their capabilities since then. This has included the introduction of GPS-assisted inertial guidance and large, unitary high-explosive warheads. The original versions of the weapon carried cluster munitions payloads consisting of hundreds of small bomblets. There had been talk in the past about developing a new type with the ability to hit moving targets for the anti-ship role, but this has largely given way to plans for the acquisition of ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and the inclusion of a moving target engagement capability in the PrSM. The Army has also said that the development of a dedicated anti-ship variant of this new missile will follow work on the initial version focused on taking out ground targets. Raytheon, at least, has also touted their PrSM entry’s modular design, as seen in the promotional video below, as well. This would allow the company to readily reconfigure the weapon to include different rocket motors or warhead, as well as integrate new capabilities in the future, which could include improved multi-mode guidance packages and networked data links. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gRCTTxjG-WM The Army has stipulated the PrSM contenders both fit inside pods that meet the common dimensions so that they can be rapidly integrated into these existing launchers. In regards to HIMARS, two of the new missiles will be able to fit inside its launcher, compared to just a single ATACMS, which will give units just that much more magazine depth. This commonality will also make PrSM an attractrive option for other HIMARS and MLRS operators, including the U.S. Marine Corps . However, the biggest advantages that the PrSM will have over ATACMS may just be its additional range and speed, allowing it to engage threats at greater distances and do so faster than ATACMS. The Army wants its new missile to be able to hit targets out to at least 310 miles away, just shy of 125 miles more than the maximum range of ATACMS. This will make the PrSM more flexible and make it more capable of conducting time-sensitive strikes on critical targets, further reducing the chance that opponents will be able to relocate their assets or otherwise react. This is well in line with a broader Army push to acquire extended-range artillery systems to ensure that its units outrange potential near-peer opponents, especially Russia, which has invested significantly in new, long-range artillery systems in recent years. You can read more about this larger strategy, which includes the development of ground-based hypersonic missiles and super-long-range guns , in this past War Zone piece . A graphic representation of how the Army sees its future artillery ecosystem, which will include the PrSM, referred to here by an older name for the concept, Long Range Precision Fire (LRPF) Munitions., US Army It seems very likely that PrSM’s range will grow even more following the collapse this year of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , between the United States and Russia. This agreement had prohibited the fielding of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles, even with conventional warheads, with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles, which had a direct impact on the PrSM’s range requirements. Brigadier General Rafferty has said in the past that data from both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon indicates that they could readily modify their designs to fly out to around 340 miles, but he added that the Army wants to first make sure they can demonstrate that their designs can reach the original 310-mile range requirement. “It would fundamentally change the geometry of the battlespace. … You can rapidly deploy and you can put into a position in the very near future [a missile] to be able to have the range of 550 to 600 kilometers [340 to 372 miles],” Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy said at the Reagan National Defense Forum on Dec. 7 . McCarthy was talking broadly about new missiles for the Army, in general, but his comments further indicate that these are ranges the service is now actively looking at. He also specifically cited the PrSM as a starting place for a future weapon with this kind of extended range. The Army has said in the past that it hopes to begin fielding the PrSM in 2023. With Lockheed Martin’s first PrSM test now complete and Raytheon’s first launch coming soon, we may start to learn more about the capabilities of these weapons, including what their actual maximum range will be.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 23, 2020",Behold The First Image Of A Navy CMV-22 Osprey That Will Replace The C-2 Greyhound,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bell’s CMV-22B Osprey Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft program is moving at a blistering pace. It won’t be long before the venerable Grumman C-2A Greyhound starts winding down its long career with the Ospreys taking their place. This was a controversial decision for the Navy, but that time has past and the seagoing force is slated to receive its first CMV-22 soon. We have an exclusive photo of the very first CMV-22B and its dressed in a full-on Navy COD hi-viz paint scheme. The image was shot outside of the Bell plant in Amarillo, Texas by aviation photographer Brady Kendrick on December 10th, 2019. The most notable structural difference between existing V-22 variants and the CMV-22B that can be seen in the photo is the bulbous fuel tank extensions to the forward portion of the sponsons on either side of the aircraft. This modification is critical to providing the CMV-22 the necessary range to work in the COD role during so-called ‘blue water’ operations, when the carrier strike group is far out to sea. Brady Kendrick You can also get a rough idea of this modification in artist renderings of the CMV-22B concept, like the one below. Bell The Navy has been moving ahead at a brisk pace with its CMV-22B plans since it signed the deal to buy 39 of the tilt-rotors in June 2018. This purchase was part of a larger Osprey buy , worth a total of $4.2 billion to the Bell-Boeing joint venture that makes the aircraft, which also includes 19 additional examples, a mixture of MV-22Bs for the U.S. Marine Corps and Japan and CV-22Bs for the U.S. Air Force. In December 2018, the Navy held a ceremony to mark the activation of the first operational CMV-22B unit, Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron 30 (VRM-30), at Naval Air Station North Island in California. The service subsequently sent the initial cadre of future naval Osprey crews to train with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron 204 (VMMT-204). A Marine MV-22B with a Navy crew on the deck of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in April 2019., USN More recently, in October 2019, the Navy stood up Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Win, abbreviated COMVRMWING, at North Island, which will eventually oversee all three the Navy’s planned CMV-22B squadrons. The service is working toward activating VRM-40, another operational squadron, and approved plans to create VRM-50, which will be a dedicated training unit, earlier this year. North Island itself needs a host of improvements and expansions to support the project. This includes new treatments on runways and taxiways to better withstand the heat from the Ospreys’ engine exhaust when the planes are moving around in their vertical and short takeoff and landing modes. An annotated satellite image of Naval Air Station North Island showing the various improvements required for CMV-22B operations as of January 2018., USN This is all in line with the plan the Navy first outlined in 2018 that detailing how it would transition from the C-2A Greyhound to the CMV-22 over the next five years, which The War Zone covered extensively at the time . The very last C-2As are supposed to leave service between 2026 and 2028. However, despite the imminent delivery of the Navy’s first CMV-22B, the service still does not expect to put the first examples into action until 2021 , coinciding with the first operational deployment of the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter on board the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson . “We’re targeting the first quarter of ‘21 for when we’re going to be certified safe to operate where we can start flying our own aircraft and operate as a squadron,” U.S. Navy Commander Trevor Hermann, VRM-30’s commanding officer, told USNI News in an interview in June 2019. The Navy has long insisted that it needs the CMV-22B to adequately support F-35C deployments onboard its carriers. The service’s contention has been that the C-2A cannot carry the Joint Strike Fighter’s F135 turbofan engine, a critical issue for sustained operations. US Marines and sailors load an F-135 engine on a special cradle into a Marine MV-22B during a test in 2015., USMC This has also been one of a number of sources of controversy regarding the Navy’s decision to replace the C-2A with the CMV-22. While the Navy is correct in stating that the Greyhounds cannot carry these engines, the process of doing so with the CMV-22B is complex and requires special equipment and procedures that are subject to very tight tolerances. There have been other concerns about the space necessary for the aircraft to take off and land from a carrier, as well as simply maneuver around the flight deck, and whether this could slow down launching and recovering aircraft and at critical moments. Most critically, in its most compact configuration, the CMV-22B cannot move around under its own power. Beyond that, the Osprey is not pressurized like the Greyhound, which limits its maximum altitude, especially when carrying passengers. This would prevent the tilt-rotors from simply flying over severe storms and other bad weather, forcing them to take more complicated and roundabout routes, which could make it more difficult and risky for them to fly essential missions to and from carriers regardless of the weather. At the same time, the CMV-22 can operate from more than just carriers, which the Greyhound can’t, and can also land in more confined spots ashore. Beyond making the aircraft more flexible broadly, this also opens up the potential to completely eliminate the existing “hub-and-spoke” concept whereby COD aircraft bring cargo and passengers to the carrier and then helicopters ferry them to other ships within a Carrier Strike Group. You can read about all of the pros and cons of the Navy’s transition plan in detail in this past War Zone story . Regardless, the CMV-22s will be fulfilling the Carrier Strike Group’s on-demand logistics needs instead of the C-2 in the not so distant future, and now we are finally seeing exactly what the future of the carrier onboard delivery mission actually looks like.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 5, 2018",Turkish President Erdogan Poaches Training Yacht From The Country’s Navy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has emerged that the Turkish Navy turned over the yacht Yakamoz , which it had been using as a training and auxiliary staff transport ship, to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office more than a year ago. How Erdogan or his staff has been making use of the vessel since then is unclear, but it could be linked to the constrution of a new summer palace on the Mediterrean Sea. Regardless, the transfer fits with other efforts the Turkish government has pursued to expand the often lavish executive transport options, including a VVIP-configured Boeing 747-8i jet acquired from Qatar last year, as well as other amenities, available to the country’s head of state. Vice President Fuat Oktay disclosed that the transfer had occurred on March 16, 2018, in response to a question from Utku Cakirozer, a Turkish parliamentarian and deputy head of the Republican People’s Party, also known by its Turkish acronym CHP. Cakirozer’s party is the main opponent in Turkey to Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, or AKP. CHP has been highly critical of Erdogan and his leadership, as well as his increasingly dictatorial policies and general behavior in recent years. Istanbul Shipyard first began construction of the 495-ton displacement Yakamoz in 2000. The shipyard launched the vessel, which is just under 130 feet long, in 2006. The Turkish Navy formally accepted delivery of the yacht, which carried the hull number Y68 in naval service, in January 2015. There is limited information available about the ship’s activities between 2015 and 2018, with most of the available pictures and video being from its first year in service. It was reportedly refurbished following its transfer to Erdogan’s office, but there do not appear to be any publicly available pictures of its interior. So, we can’t tell how it stacks up against luxury yachts that belong to other world leaders , such as one that reportedly belongs to Russian President Vladimir Putin, or other wealthy individuals, such as the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen’s Octopus . Vice President Oktay had responded to Cakirozer’s questions by saying that the Turkish government had originally ordered Yakamoz for presidential use. The clear implication here is that the transfer is simply about putting the ship to use for its intended purpose. It’s unclear if this is actually the case, however. An article in the May 2015 issue of the Turkish Navy’s official magazine said that the ship, which it added could carry around 100 crew and passengers and had a range of around 3,000 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots, was marked use for “protocol purposes” when construction began in 2000. That same piece does say that in 2009, the decision was made to change its primary missions to that of staff transport and training ship. Navies using yachts as training vessels and transports is hardly unheard of, too. Last year, the Omani Navy actually received an ex-royal yacht to use for these types of missions after the country’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said bought a new one for his own personal use. There’s no indication that, whatever its original intended purpose, the Turkish government had ever intended to place Yakamoz under the control of any organization other than the Turkish Navy. Yakamoz circa 2014-2015., Turkish Navy “Under conditions where an economic crisis is deepening, poverty is increasing and a wide segment of society is trying to get by on the minimum wage, does the Presidency really need a yacht?” Cakirozer had asked when requesting information about the yacht. “For what purpose and what services will this yacht be used?” We don’t know if he’s gotten a response yet, but we do know that the Turkish government has been building a new summer residence for Erdogan in the Mediterranean resort town of Marmaris. Just in August 2019, authorities established a cordon around Okluk Cove , where the palace complex, which is reportedly four times the size of the famous Palace of Versailles in France, has been under construction. Private yachts, tour boats, and other personal and commercial vessels were told to leave the area or face fines. Erdogan already has one massive presidential palace in the country’s capital Ankara. This facility was originally intended to serve as offices and residence for the Turkish Prime Minister, a position that Erdogan held between 2003 and 2014. When he first took office as President in 2014, he then declared that it would become the new presidential offices and residence. The summer palace project dates back at least to 2017 and CHP has alleged that Ergodan demanded that certain portions be demolished and rebuilt after inspecting the initial construction and finding it not to his liking. The opposition party has also said that, as of June 2019, Turkey had spent nearly $58 million on the residence, including approximately $5.2 million in new funding this year. A satellite image showing the full extent of the Turkish presidential palace complex in Marmaris as of June 2019., Google Earth A close up shot of the main residential part of the complex, showing a small harbor with a pier for yachts at the upper edge. Satellite imagery shows that this feature was added some time between 2017 and 2018., Google Earth Ergodan’s desire for the new palace in Marmaris was likely driven, in part, by the fact that he was staying in a private villa there when an abortive coup against him kicked off in 2016. A Turkish government Gulfstream IV business jet whisked him away and was harassed by F-16 Viper fighter jets belonging to the coup forces as it made its way to Istanbul. Still, Erdogan has come under fire on other occasions for the government’s acquisition of extreme luxury items for his personal use. Last year, Turkey also took delivery of a VVIP-configured Boeing 747-8i aircraft, a plane that costs at least $400 million new. This plane joined the rest of the country’s VVIP fleet, which also includes Gulfstream IVs and Airbus A340 widebody airliners. Turkey’s ex-Qatari 747-8i jet., N509FZ via Wikimedia Ergodan’s Administration claimed that in case the case of the 747-8i, the plane had been a gift from Qatar, but, again, it’s unclear if this was actually the case. Turkey has been a major supporter of Qatar, which is embroiled in a simmering political spat with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, among others. The Turkish government spent considerable resources to bolster its Qatari counterparts and the jet may have been one of a number of ways authorities in Doha worked to pay back those debts. Turkey’s economy has seen something of an upswing recently , despite its own growing spat with the United States . That doesn’t mean that the country’s economic position has anywhere near recovered from the downturn in recent years and wouldn’t justify Ergodan’s decision to transfer the Yakamoz to his office back in 2018. There does not seem to be a clear schedule for the completion of the Marmaris palace, but after it is done, we may see more of Yakamoz in Okluk Cove and further out in the Mediterranean.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 21, 2020",F-117 Spotted Playing Stealthy Aggressor Against F-15s And F-22s Over Nellis Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 Nighthawk saga is still far from over even as museums begin receiving demilitarized F-117As for public display . Of the fleet of 51 Nighthawks that remain at the shadowy Tonopah Test Range Airport , the vast majority of which are disassembled and packed inside the same hangars they once occupied operationally, a handful continue to fly for various purposes. Now we know that just as I had initially posited, some of these duties include acting as low-observable (stealthy) aggressors to challenge fighter crews during complex training and tactics development scenarios. Kris Tanjano was out on the snow-covered Nevada Test and Training Range on December 3rd, 2019 when he encountered a very interesting event unfolding overhead. It involved F-16s, F-15s, F-22, F-117s, and possibly B-1Bs in aerial combat. Here is exactly how he explained what he witnessed: “Recently, I witnessed an F-117 along with 4 F-16s go up against F-15s and F-22s. The F-117’s callsign was KNIGHT, the F-16s were GOMER and MIG, and they were communicating on the aggressor frequency. First, the F-16s came in pairs attacking the blue force (F-22s, F-15s, and maybe a B-1) then an F-117 came in at low-level just behind the F-16s towards the blue force. They all fought it out for about five to ten mins then restarted for a second push. Once again the F-16s came high overhead, followed by a low-level F-117. Several times the aggressors called out a target which was a low-level heavy aircraft which I believe was B-1 but I am not certain. After both fights were done the aggressors called RTB [return to base] and the F-16s headed back to Nellis AFB. But before that, they rendezvoused with the single F-117 on its way to Tonopah. Several minutes later, Silverbow (Tonopah) frequency became active with KNIGHT checking in.” Kris was also able to capture some photos of the unique display of airpower he stumbled upon: Kris Tanjano Kris Tanjano Kris Tanjano Kris Tanjano Kris Tanjano The fact that F-117s are being used for aggressor “red air” duties, even if just in a tactics development manner, is not surprising, but it has never been confirmed before. This role was one of the key possibilities I laid out over half a decade ago in a piece that went viral and had a major hand in defining the F-117 mystery going forward. In it I wrote: The F-117 is the only disclosed surplus operational stealth aircraft in America’s inventory. That being said, the world’s armed forces probably have a pretty good idea of its true stealth capabilities after decades of operations around the globe, its participation in many international exercises, and the proliferation of low observability design knowledge in the decades since it entered service. This is not to mention the undoubtedly countless espionage operations conducted by America’s enemies and allies alike in regards to the F-117’s unique technologies. The rest of the world is increasingly catching up to America’s once exclusive monopoly on “stealth” technology. Fighters such as the Russian Sukhoi T-50 and the Chinese Chengdu J-20 are well on their way to becoming potential challengers to American and allied air supremacy. Furthermore, stealthy unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles are even easier to develop than their manned counterparts. So it would make sense for the United States and other allied nations to begin training against low observable adversary aircraft, especially in the realm of detecting, intercepting, and engaging them. With all of this in mind, it would make total sense for the USAF to field the F-117s as stealth aggressors. Having a small aggressor force of F-117s available for putting our and our allies’ latest radars, infrared search and track and electronic emissions detection system to the test, as well as to develop tactics for defeating such threats, seems like a perfect job for the F-117. Seeing as the F-117 is a largely declassified program, the technological risk of standing up such a unit and employing it even in training with our allies would be negligible. F-117 aggressor duties could also be of great value when paired with advanced electronic warfare and jamming. In other words, combining other tactics aside from the aircraft’s inherent stealthy design could still make for a world-class low observable opponent or target even though the aircraft itself is well over 30 years old. As non-American stealth platforms hit the skies operationally around the world, the U.S. is going to have to begin fielding some sort of low observable aggressor aircraft for large air warfare exercises. Red Flag , the largest aerial wargame of its kind, just so happens to take place right where the remaining F-117s are based… These electromagnetically silent and stealthy jets would give our allies’ active fighter, AWACS, and surface to air missile forces a run for their money, while not giving up all of our secrets. Additionally, the USAF’s F-15C, F-15E, and F-16C fleets are in the process (hopefully) of slowly being outfitted with cutting edge Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars that are much more capable of detecting small radar signature targets than their mechanically scanned, and mostly analog, predecessors. Flying the F-117 directly against these newly deployed systems would provide a good training opportunity for aircrews that are learning the capabilities of their newly enhanced systems. Simply put, an investment by the USAF in keeping a small fleet of F-117s flying as “first generation” low observable aggressors would represent an incredibly unique and valuable training tool, especially seeing as these aircraft are all already bought, with a full fleet of spares available, to support years of continued operations. Fast forward to today and Nellis is already currently in the process of standing-up a full-on F-35 aggressor squadron, an initiative you can read much more about in this past piece of ours . Considering what we know now about the state of the F-117 force and who flies these aircraft, what is most probable is that about half a dozen of these jets are kept available for low observable applications and low observable target developmental testing, as well as playing a stealthy bad guy when needed, and likely for tactics development purposes rather than more pedestrian training. In the scenario that Kris lays describes above, the F-117 did exactly what we would expect it to do, to attempt to sneak by in the ground clutter at low-level, giving the opposing force’s advanced sensors a real run for their money. This is not only a flight profile of a potential enemy aircraft, but also one of a cruise missile, which are becoming increasingly stealthy in their own right around the globe. As for the callsign, the unit that is flying these jets calls themselves the Dark Knights. We know this from the fresh tail flash one of the F-117s was recently spotted wearing and by the constant use of the Knight callsign . The fact that the unit also serves at least in part to supply a more traditional red air function also would make their unit name, even if totally unofficial, a bit more significant. Regardless of its ongoing flight activities, the Congressional mandate to eliminate the fleet at a rate of four aircraft per year is behind in schedule, it is still the plan going forward. Of the remaining 51 Nighthawks, 12 have been set aside for museums, two of which have already been delivered, of which one is about to be formally put on display.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 26, 2020",Space Force Looks Go For Launch But Questions Remain About How It Will ‘Dogfight In Space’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The House of Representatives and the Senate have agreed to a version of an annual bill outlining defense policy and budgeting for the 2020 Fiscal Year that would stand up an all-new U.S. military service devoted to operations in space. After years of debate , Space Force now looks all but certain to formally arrive next year, but the language in the law that would create it shows that serious questions remain as to its organization and function. These issues, in turn, could hamper its ability to perform its missions at a time when threats to American interests outside of the Earth’s atmosphere are increasing and as U.S. military officials say they’re still trying to figure out what it will look like to “dogfight in space.” Late on Dec. 9, 2019, the House Committee on Rules released a conference report detailing the outcomes of negotiations between the House and Senate on various provisions in their respective versions of the so-called National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020. This includes a subsection, also referred to as the Space Force Act, which is devoted to the creation of the Space Force under the Department of the Air Force, as well as various other space-focused positions within the Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. “I’ve been glowing for the last day,” Representative Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and one of the original proponents of a separate space branch within the U.S. military, had said at the Reagan National Defense Forum on Dec. 7, 2019. News had emerged the day before that members of the House had cut a deal to pave the way for Space Force in exchange for White House support for a separate provision regarding paid maternity leave for federal employees. President Donald Trump has been an outspoken supporter of Space Force for nearly two years now, as has Vice President Mike Pence. “We have allowed China and Russia to become our peers, not our near peers and that’s unacceptable,” Representative Rogers added. “We have been doing some things short of the Space Force. I feel good but I will feel a lot better in about three or four years.” A panel on space issues at the Reagan National Defense Forum on Dec. 7, 2019. Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett is seated at the center, in red, and Representative Mike Rogers is to her left., Office of Representative Mike Rogers Rogers and other Space Force advocates have long argued that the U.S. military needs a dedicated space-focused branch in order to adequately prioritize the defense of American interests in orbit. The Alabama congressman and others have said that the Air Force, which has historically managed the vast majority of military space research and development programs and acquisition efforts, cannot adequately perform this function given the demands of its terrestrial functions. The current language in the Space Force Act aims to address these concerns and change the U.S. military’s relationship with space, as well as speed up developing and buying critical space-related systems, by transforming Air Force Space Command and its subordinate units, as well as potentially other elements from within the Air Force, into Space Force. The new Chief of Space Operations (CSO) will be a four-star general who sits on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and has the same standing as their colleagues from the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. This arrangement fixed worrisome issues in a previous Space Force proposal that would have placed the head of the service under the direction of an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for the Space Force, which would have put them at a bureaucratic disadvantage as the War Zone previously explained in detail. Under the new plan, the CSO will report directly to the Secretary of the Air Force, similar to how the Commandant of the Marines Corps reports to the Secretary of the Navy. At least for the first year of Space Force’s existence, the CSO will be the same individual in charge of the recently re-activated U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM), not to be confused with Air Force Space Command. SPACECOM is a joint operational command that is responsible for overseeing and coordinating space-related activities across the U.S. military, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The Space Force Act would also lead to the establishment of a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy position within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, as well as new Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration and a Service Acquisition Executive of the Department of the Air Force for Space Systems and Programs roles within that service. These individuals would help further prioritize and advocate for space-related policy and spending. They would also sit together with the Undersecretary of the Air Force, the CSO, commander of SPACECOM, and the director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the U.S. Intelligence Community’s main satellite intelligence arm, on a new Space Force Acquisition Council to be coordinate and develop space-related acquisition requirements and policy. “What we need is capability. We need assets in space, not a vast bureaucracy,” Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett said alongside Representative Rogers at the Reagan National Defense Forum on Dec. 7. “We don’t need duplicate acquisition programs. We need to inspire people. People want to be associated with the Space Force. It’s a renewed excitement. We need to be moving quickly in acquisitions, we need efficient systems to get that done.” Barrett is right about the need to increase emphasis on activities in space and Rogers isn’t wrong about the growing threats to American interests there, issues The War Zone highlights on a regular basis . Space-based capabilities, including satellites handling early warning , intelligence gathering , communications , navigation , and more are absolutely essential to how the modern U.S. military operates every day. At the same time, potential adversaries, such as Russia and China , have been rapidly expanding their space-related activities, as well as developing means to counter the United States’ long-standing edge in satellite capabilities in this regard. This includes various anti-satellite weapons, including “ killer satellites ” and ground-based and air-launched interceptors , as well as non-kinetic systems to jam, spoof , or otherwise disrupt the operation of U.S. space-based systems. Other countries around the world are also beginning to take notice, including India, which demonstrated its own anti-satellite capability this year, and France, which plans to launch laser-armed mini-satellites to defend its assets in orbit. An infographic from the Defense Intelligence Agency showing the various means by which one satellite could attack another in orbit. These are just some of the threats to space-based assets., DIA Still, serious questions about how Space Force will operate, as well as how much it will cost, remain unanswered. The Space Force Act that members of the House and Senate have agreed to includes provisions asking for numerous reports detailing the service’s basic structure, function, and budget that would not be due until February, after Congress has already agreed to establish it. The reports that Congress is asking for after it creates Space Force, including a description of its basic organization and anticipated funding requirements., US Congress This effectively means that lawmakers will be agreeing to buy Space Force sight unseen without any firm estimates about the resources it will need to do a job it has yet to fully define, setting up the very real potential for budget battles in the near future. The current version of the NDAA outlines a budget of just under $75.5 million for the service’s first year of operations, approximately two percent of what then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in 2018 would be necessary . Even then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who aggressively pushed back against Wilson’s figures, said that Space Force could need around $5 billion in total funding in its first five years. “If she [Secretary Barrett] needs more, tell us and that’s our problem,” Representative Rogers stressed at the Reagan National Defense Forum, a position that ignores how fraught debates in Congress over increasing defense spending or reallocating existing funds are regularly. “We want the secretary to create the best Space Force the world has ever seen.” Beyond the budgetary questions, there are major organizational issues that remain unresolved. As it stands now, the Air Force’s space elements will form the core of the new service. There is no plan to transfer the space-related assets under the control of the Army or the Navy to Space Force. Though it’s true that Army and Navy space-related activities are much smaller than those present within the Air Force, the plan still means that Space Force will not have absolute control over the space “domain” and will have to coordinate, within Space Command, with the other services. Space Force also will not take control of space assets from the National Reconnaissance Office or other members of the Intelligence Community, such as the National Security Agency and Central Intelligence Agency. The existing Space Development Agency , Air Force Space Rapid Capabilities Office , and the Air Force Space and Missile Center , all of which charged with development and acquisition of space-related capabilities, are set to get placed be under the direction of the new Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration rather than Space Force. Vice President Mike Pence visits the US Air Force’s 50th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado in 2017. This is a unit that would end up part of the new Space Force under the latest plan in Congress., USAF All of this calls into question the true value of creating an entirely new service, which will live in the Department of the Air Force, and, at least foreseeable future, seems largely limited to roles and functions that that service is already performing. All told, despite years of studies and debate, both in public forums and behind closed doors , the Air Force, and the rest of the U.S. military, do not appear to have come to a clear understanding of how Space Force will actually work, despite its impending activation. “There is a war room that has started to meet to work this out,” Barrett said at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “The whole team is very much devoted to the idea that this is a serious business and we have to get this done … We are going to get this as close to right from the beginning.” “The central point is that we need a cadre of people who grow up and spend their whole careers learning and thinking: ‘how we dogfight in space,’” Air Force Major General Clinton Crosier, the Deputy to the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, said of Space Force at an event the RAND Corporation think tank held on Dec. 6, 2019. “Our adversaries have things on orbit that are looking at ways to do harm to our systems.” Crosier’s comments speak to a larger and perhaps more pressing issue, that the U.S. military is still fundamentally unclear about what war in space might look like and how that fits with traditional notions of terrestrial conflict. In April 2019, former Secretary of the Air Force Wilson warned that the United States might have to demonstrate its resolve to respond to attacks in space, but it seemed apparent from her comments that the thresholds for such a response, and whether it would occur in orbit or down on Earth, remain worryingly unresolved. This is made especially concerning when one considers the importance of space-based systems , including early warning and communications satellites, to the functioning of America’s nuclear deterrent . Attacks on these assets could leave the United States blind to subsequent strikes and hampered in its ability to launch its own counterstrikes, raising real questions about how the U.S. government might feel compelled to respond if it were to lose those assets. You can read more about these issues, which The War Zone has explored in-depth in the past, here . Former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., USAF At the Reagan National Defense Forum, Representative Rogers and Secretary Barrett had both called also called for greater declassification of U.S. space programs and capabilities. This could potentially offer greater insight into what options the U.S. military has right now with regards to conflicts in space and what kind of developments it is pursuing for the future. Declassifying intelligence on what potential adversaries, such as Russia and China, are doing could also give a better sense of existing and emerging threats. “Declassifying some of what is currently held in secure vaults would be a good idea,” Barrett said . “You would have to be careful about what we declassify, but there is much more classified than what needs to be.” “The lack of an understanding really does hurt us in doing things that we need to do in space,” Barrett continued. “There isn’t a constituency for space even though almost everyone uses space before their first cup of coffee in the morning.” Right now, though, it seems hard to understand how Congress can be comfortable in ordering the creation of a Space Force without a clear understanding of its roles and missions, or what that will cost taxpayers, especially when the basic question of what a future conflict in space, or at least one involving hostile activities in that domain, looks like remains unanswered. Space Force “has to be effective inside the national security environment from day one,” Air Force Lieutenant General David Thompson, Vice Commander of Air Force Space Command, who looks set to become the second in command of the new Space Force, said at the RAND event last week. “We have to create enough mass in the organization. We can’t worship efficiency if it means it’s going to create a struggle for this organization to integrate with the rest of the national security organizations.” Right now, Congress looks to be about to create Space Force without a firm understanding of how it might fit into the larger U.S. national security apparatus, or having a sense of how much money it will need to set aside in future budgets to make that happen, let alone what it will take to address the potential struggles in doing so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2020",The First Narco Submarine Ever Seized Off A European Coast Is A Monster,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Spanish authorities have successfully recovered a so-called narco submarine that they seized in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the country’s Galicia region this past weekend. This is the first time any country in Europe has seized one of these smuggling vessels and it’s not entirely clear how it made the thousands-of-miles-long journey from Latin America. Spain’s Guardia Civil, National Police, and Customs Service captured the craft off Galicia on Nov. 24, 2019. The crew had attempted to scuttle it after failing to transfer the approximately three tons of cocaine onboard to another vessel due to poor weather. Those same conditions prevented Spanish security forces from refloating the drug sub until late the next day. They then towed it to port and it has now been pulled out of the water for further inspection. “Conditions at sea meant that the semi-submersible wasn’t able to deliver the drugs to a second vessel,” Spanish officials said in a statement. “Its crew members then headed towards the coast, where they scuttled and abandoned the vessel. The maneuver was detected by a Guardia Civil patrol using night-vision goggles, who then noted the boat’s arrival point and the subsequent fleeing of its crew.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=IjfkNREhrSg The two arrested individuals are Ecuadorian nationals . A third member of the crew was still at large as of Nov. 27. Though commonly referred to as narco submarines, the vast majority of these vessels , which have been steadily improving in size and capability since the 1990s, are not fully submersible. Vessels like the one Spanish authorities captured are more appropriately described as self-propelled semi-submersibles (SPSS) or low-profile vessels (LPV). The narco submarine Spanish authorities seized off Galicia after they refloated it and brought it back to port., Lalo R. VillarAFP via Getty Images They are mostly associated with smuggling in the Eastern Pacific, as well as, to a lesser extent, the Caribbean. In July 2019, the U.S. Coast Guard’s seizure of one of these vessels in the Eastern Pacific made national headlines after that service released a dramatic video showing a member of its boarding team leaping onto the craft and pounding on the hatch. The vessel that arrived off Galicia is very large compared to most known SPSS. Rough estimates suggest it is more than 68 feet long and nearly seven and a half feet wide in the middle. H.I. Sutton, an author and an expert on underwater and semi-submersible craft who has extensively researched narco subs over the years, says that the design is about twice as big as a common narco sub. The example seized off Spain still has a number of typical features, including an overall hullform that sits extremely low in the water. The crew could see out of small, fully-enclosed cockpit toward the rear. The narco sub also has downward curved air intakes and an exhaust with a u-shaped bend in it, which helps prevent water from getting into the engine and elsewhere inside. These are also common features in SPSS design. Sutton also pointed out that the overall hullform and single-screw configuration, as well as other more specific features and its overall size, were very reminiscent of another SPSS that Colombia authorities seized earlier this year in the Eastern Pacific. That craft was just over 65 and a half feet long and around six and a half feet wide. Nearly 1.7 tons of cocaine was found on board that vessel. In addition, Sutton noted that specific SPSS designers and builders have specific signature styles and it is possible that these two narco subs were directly related. Whatever its exact origins, this new SPSS, and the cocaine it was carrying, almost certainly originated somewhere in Latin America. How it made its way to the coast of Spain is unclear. Spanish authorities were reportedly working together with their counterparts in Brazil, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States on the operation that led to the seizure. A tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was reportedly critical to the success of the sting. A substantial amount of the cocaine may have been bound for the United Kingdom, as well, according to authorities in that country , indicating that they had information about possible buyers for the shipment. The involvement of Brazil could point to that country as a launch point for the narco submarine. However, at its absolute shortest, the distance between the Brazilian and Galician coasts is more than 3,600 miles. There have been reports of low-profile narco sub designs derived from high-performance speed boats do have extended range capabilities, but nothing close to this. Google Maps It is possible that a ship left Brazil, or another country in Latin America, with the drug sub onboard or in tow and then launched it when they got closer to Spain. It may have even made a stop somewhere in West Africa, or islands in the Atlantic, such as Cape Verde or the Canaries. Such an intermediate location might have also offered a place to finish assembly of the SPSS or otherwise make final preparations before heading north. An unnamed source told Spain’s El Pais newspaper that the narco sub’s crew had been at sea for 20 days , but did not say where or when their voyage had begun or if they had been riding in the SPSS the entire time. Regardless, the appearance of an SPSS from Latin America off the coast of Spain is an extremely important development. In 2011, Spain convicted six individuals in relation to an attempt to build a narco submarine in the country that started five years earlier, with financial support from drug cartels in Colombia, with the hope that it could be used to help smuggle goods within Europe. The vessel did make it into the water, but performed extremely poorly. This new attempt to use the narco submarine to bring drugs into Europe in the first place is a much more ambitious undertaking and appears to have largely succeeded on a general technical level. Had authorities not had what appears to be extensive intelligence about the smuggling effort before the SPSS’ arrival off Galicia, the crew may well have scuttled it successfully and escaped unnoticed. As the multi-national investigation into the incident continues, we will hopefully get more details about the SPSS design and how it made its way across the Atlantic. It also remains to be seen whether or not this is the beginning of a trend in drug smuggling operations from Latin America to Europe, but it is a clear indication that the use of narco subs in those activities may be an increasingly viable tactic.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Canadian Air Force recently revealed that its dedicated CC-150 Polaris VVIP aircraft, also referred to as Can Force One, suffered a serious accident while undergoing maintenance nearly two months ago and isn’t scheduled to return to duty until August 2020. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau subsequently had to fly to London for the annual NATO summit on one of the service’s four other, but less specialized, CC-150s. The mishap occurred on Oct. 19, 2019 , but the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) did not confirm it until Dec. 2. The incident remains under investigation, but the service has said that contract maintenance personnel were towing Can Force One into a hangar when it apparently went out of control and rolled into the hangar wall, crushing the nose. The right engine cowling also suffered damage. The accident occurred at Canadian Forces Base Trenton in Ontario, Canada., which is home to the 437 Transport Squadron that operates all five CC-150s . “We do not have sufficient detail about potential costs, or the attribution of those costs, to provide any detail at this time,” RCAF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Steve Neta said in a statement . “The incident remains under investigation to determine causes and identify preventive measures.” Can Force One in 2014., Artem Batuzak via Wikimedia Until the VVIP CC-150 returns to service next year, Prime Minister Trudeau, his advisors, family, and others traveling with him will have to make use of the other CC-150s or one of the RCAF’s smaller CC-144s. The latter aircraft are variants of Bombardier’s Challenger 600 series business jets, which the service uses for light passenger transport duties. Though the exact cost to the repair Can Force One is not yet known, the fact that teams from Airbus, which built the CC-150s, and General Electric, which is responsible for their engines, have already assessed that it will take some eight months to complete the work points to a likely very expensive bill. The incident only adds another chapter to what has been something of a saga for aircraft since its introduction into service in the 1990s. A picture showing damage to Can Force One’s right engine cowling following the October 2019 mishap., Canadian Forces The CC-150s started life as Airbus A310-300 airliners, serving first with Wardair and then with Canadian Airlines , not to be confused with Air Canada. The Canadian government subsequently bought the planes in the early 1990s and converted them into combination passenger and cargo transport aircraft with a new cabin floor and a large side-opening cargo door in the forward fuselage. In 2008, Canada also hired Airbus to further modify two of the CC-150s into the Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) configuration with underwing probe-and-drogue refueling pods, with those planes getting redesignated as CC-150Ts. A CC-150T refuels a pair of Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18 Hornet fighter jets., Canadian Forces In 1992, the administration of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, had decided to convert the first of the CC-150s, which has the serial number 15001, to a VVIP configuration at the cost of 56 million Canadian dollars. The exact cost to acquire the aircraft from Canadian Airlines in the first place is unclear, but Jean Chrétien, then head of Canada’s Liberal Party and leader of the opposition in Parliament, decried the VVIP modifications as “extravagant” and described the plane as a “flying Taj Mahal.” These changes reportedly included a private cabin for the prime minister with foldout beds and a shower, as well as a dining room with a table for eight and an entertainment area. Technically, the aircraft remained capable of being reconfigured back into its transport role, if necessary. After Chrétien became Prime Minister himself in November 1993, he refused to fly on the plane for the duration of his more than decade-long tenure, using CC-144s and other CC-150s, instead. Can Force One sat, on standby, at Canadian Forces Base Uplands in Ottawa, home of 412 Transport Squadron , which flies CC-144s specially configured for the VVIP role. This unit ferries senior Canadian government officials around and is also on call to transport foreign dignitaries. This includes supporting visits by the Queen of the United Kingdom, who technically remains Queen of Canada, and shuttling around the Governor-General of Canada, who is the Queen’s direct representative in the country. One of 412 Transportation Squadron’s VIP-configured CC-144 jets., via Wikimedia Chrétien also tried to sell off the VVIP-configured CC-150. American celebrities Madonna and Kenny Rogers, as well as the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, were reportedly among the prospective buyers , but the plane ultimately remained with the RCAF. By the end of the 1990s, the RCAF had reportedly downgraded the interior of the VVIP aircraft, removing the dining room completely and scaling back the entertainment portion to “little more than a TV with a couple of couches in a loud fabric reminiscent of a casino,” according to one article from The Globe and Mail . “The entire VIP section, paneled in tacky wood veneer, takes up about one-third of the aircraft.” A picture showing the spartan interior of the executive bedroom on Can Force One., Public Domain The executive suite for the Prime Minister and their advisors and staff still offers a working area with satellite telephone and computer work stations, but the bulk of the passengers, including members of the press, otherwise ride in airline-style seating in the rear. Various regular upgrades over the years have improved the communications and other systems onboard, as well. Scaling back the opulent interior was not the end of the controversies surrounding Can Force One, however. In 2011, Canadian media uncovered that then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a member of the Conservative Party, had been pushing the RCAF for at least two years to repaint the plane in a special scheme in place of the standard overall gray paint job found on all the CC-150s at the time. Prior to 2013, the RCAF’s VVIP CC-150 carried the same gray scheme as the other four Polaris aicraft, such as this jet, with the serial number 15004., John Davies via Wikimedia The RCAF and the Canadian Ministry of Defense, including Harper’s own Defense Minister Peter MacKay, reportedly pushed back against the plan, saying a high-visibility civilian-style scheme would limit the ability to use the aircraft in the standard military transport role, if required. Harper ultimately prevailed and Can Force One emerged in its new red, white, and blue scheme, which it carries to this day, in 2013. Repainting the plane reportedly cost approximately 50,000 Canadian dollars. Beyond all this, the aircraft is simply aging, with the airframe being just over three decades old and the aircraft having spent most of that time in RCAF service. It is becoming increasingly maintenance intensive, in general. In 2016, a problem with Can Force One’s flaps forced it to return to base just 30 minutes after takeoff with Trudeau onboard. The Prime Minister had been headed to Belgium to sign a trade deal. Two years later, another mechanical issue forced the plane to remain on the ground in Rome, Italy for three hours so maintenance crews could replace an unspecified broken sensor. This was supposed to be a 90-minute refueling stop for Can Force One, which was carrying Trudeau to India for his controversial state visit. The RCAF has considered plans in the past to replace the entire fleet of CC-150s, which are all of the same general age, between 2026 and 2036. However, under Trudeau’s administration, Canada’s Department of National Defense has also said it working to extend the life of the aircraft by limiting their flight hours. The Canadian government’s separate effort to acquire a new fleet of fighter jets, its own saga , which The War Zone has followed extensively , has reportedly contributed to the continued deferring of the decision on a final CC-150 replacement plan. Following this latest incident, Lieutenant Colonel Neta, the RCAF spokesperson, said in his statement that the service is confident that it can still meet the demands for VVIP support with Can Force One now out of commission for the next eight months. Whatever happens to the jet in the coming years, this new mishap has certainly added a new wrinkle to the plane’s unique story. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

In less than a week , the United States has killed a number of terrorists in two separate strikes , each time using a shadowy AIM-114R9X Hellfire missile, which substitutes a center section with six swing-out sword-like blades in place of the missile’s traditional high-explosive warhead. This represents half of all confirmed strikes involving the employment of this missile and roughly a third of all reported instances of the weapon being used at all operationally. Yet, even so, its very existence remains highly secretive despite clear evidence that it excels in reducing collateral damage, putting it in a category of munitions the U.S. military has been very keen to promote publicly in the past. The most recent AGM-114R9X strike came on Dec. 7, 2019 , between the Syrian cities of Afrin and Azaz in the northwestern corner of the country. This came four days after another AGM-114R9X slammed into a minivan in the Syrian city of Atmeh, situated to the southwest of Afrin and Azaz. You can read more about these strikes in detail in these past War Zone stories . The target of the latest strike on the road between Afrin and Azaz was reportedly an individual who went by the nom de guerre Abu Sanad and acted as a facilitator and fixer, smuggling individuals for various groups in and around northern Syria. At the time of the strike, he was carrying an identification card from Ahrar al-Sham , a militant group fighting against Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad that has received support from Turkey, among others, were the targets. However, Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, or HTS, an organization that broke off splintered from the Syrian arm of Al Qaeda in 2017, reportedly claimed that Abu Sanad had left Ahrar al-Sham and was working with ISIS. The strike on Dec. 3 reportedly killed at least one senior member of HTS, raising questions about whether this individual had ISIS ties, as well. The U.S. military captured a significant amount of information on senior members of ISIS during the raid on a compound in northwestern Syria that led to the death of the group’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October. It is possible that these strikes were, in part, driven by that intelligence. There are still unanswered questions about how al-Baghdadi managed to flee from Iraq to northwestern Syria in recent years and individuals like Abu Sanad are likely to have been part of that puzzle. However, the AGM-114R9X, which was developed at some point during President Barack Obama’s two terms in office, according to The Wall Street Journal , continues to exist only behind a wall of secrecy that does not seem to apply to any other Hellfire variant. The U.S. military has openly acknowledged the existence of at least four other known AGM-114R9 subvariants, the R9B, R9E, R9G, and R9H. It’s not entirely clear how exactly they differ from the standard AGM-114R or the original AGM-114R9 subvariant. Production of the original R variant began in 2010 with the missile offering a multi-purpose warhead and the ability to work on both manned and unmanned platforms at various altitudes, thereby replacing a variety of earlier versions optimized for different platforms and target sets. An infographic showing the developmental chronology and other details about various AGM-114 Hellfire variants, including the R model., US Army The AGM-114R’s warhead is capable of breaking through armor and hardened cover, such as the walls of buildings, as well as attacking personnel and other soft targets in the open, thanks to a sleeve over the main charge that would break up into a hail of deadly shrapnel when the missile explodes. The AGM-114R9B and 9E, by all accounts , still have a high-explosive warhead and appear to be in use with both regular and special operations units. A description of the AGM-114R9E’s warhead from the manufacturer, General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems., GD-OTS U.S. Special Operations Command says that Air Force Special Operations Command MQ-9 Reapers began using the AGM-114R9E in 2014. Regular U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagles began using these missiles in 2017. Gray Eagles assigned to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) may have begun using the missiles before then. A briefing slide from 2016 with information about the Hellfire variants that units assigned to US Special Operations Command were using at that time., SOCOM A US Army briefing slide from 2017 discussing, in part, the fielding of the AGM-114R9E on that service’s MQ-1C Gray Eagles deployed to the Middle East that year., US Army There is one report that the AGM-114R9H, a designation first assigned in 2015, according to U.S. government records, is a “very low collateral damage” variant, while the AGM-114R9E is a “low collateral damage” version. The reference to the R9E subvariant may be in error given other available information and could actually be in reference to R9G. The R9E could also still have an explosive warhead, but with a reduced charge to limit the potential for collateral damage. There is no official information of any kind publicly available about the AGM-114R9X. The very first pictures to emerge apparently showing the internal blade mechanism appeared on social media on Dec. 3, which The War Zone was first to report on . What guidance and fuzing systems the weapon uses, necessary to ensure its extreme accuracy and optimal deployment of the blades, remain unknown. A picture showing the remains of the blade mechanism from the AGM-114R9X employed in the Dec. 3, 2019 strike in Syria., via @obretix In previous our analysis of the Dec. 7 strike, we posited that a so-called “man-in-the-loop” guidance system, something Israel pioneered and perfected , with an actual operator correcting its course in the terminal phases of flight is a likely possibility. Another option could be a very fine-tuned imaging infrared guidance package that zeroes in on a specific section of a car automatically. The video below shows a view from the guidance system on an Israeli-made Spike missile , a man-in-the-loop design. Beyond its exact specifications and capabilities, the weapon’s very use has been a closely guarded secret. Before the events of this past week, there was only photographic evidence of one other known instance where the U.S. government had carried out a strike using this missile, in 2017, when it killed Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader Abu Khayr al Masri, again in northwestern Syria. At the time, The War Zone was the first to suggest that his death could have been the work of a new, novel munition. In May 2019, The Wall Street Journal broke the story about the existence of AGM-114R9X and its folding blade arrangement, stating that another AGM-114R9X had killed Jamal al-Badawi in January 2019. Al-Badawi had been a member of Al Qaeda’s franchise in Yemen and had been the alleged mastermind behind the deadly bombing of the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Cole in 2000. The Journal ‘s sources said that the U.S. military had employed AGM-114R9Xs on no more than six occasions in total at the time it published its piece. By all indications, drone units subordinate to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) had been responsible for all of those strikes. It is unclear how many additional strikes the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) may have also carried out using its own unmanned aircraft. As the War Zone has reported extensively in the past, there are unresolved questions about whether there is overlap in administrative and operational control of drone units supporting JSOC and CIA missions. It’s not clear at all why, given the AGM-114R9X’s track record, it has been used so sparingly and has been kept in the black world, squirreled away from disclosed special operations units and regular forces, both of which could potentially make good use of its capabilities. This is the exact opposite of how the U.S. military has treated the development of many other munitions designed to reduce the risks to innocent bystanders. This includes BLU-126/B Low Collateral Damage Bomb, which simply has less explosive than a traditional bomb, and the BLU-129/B Very Low Collateral Damage Weapon, which has a carbon-fiber body that disintegrates when it goes off and limits its blast radius. You can read more about both of these 500-pound class bombs in this past War Zone piece . A BLU-129/B Very Low Collateral Damage Weapon, readily identifiable by its distinctive black color, combined with a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS guidance kit. The resulting complete weapon is known as the GBU-31(V)5/B., USAF Conscious of the negative impacts on the reputation of the United States abroad from the inadvertent killing of civilians during airstrikes, as well as the damage it could do the perception of American forces engaged in those conflicts, the U.S. military has every reason to promote such munitions as further evidence of the steps it takes to prevent civilian casualties. It also publicly highlights the development of novel less-than-lethal systems for the same reasons . At the same time, the concept behind and the results of an AGM-114R9X strike might still be too gruesome to publicize. It’s hard to argue that dying by an explosive blast or pummeled to death by a sword-wielding weapon traveling at hundreds of miles an hour is all that different, but the almost cartoonish design of this weapon could be considered questionable in terms of optics. There may be practical limitations, as well. If the missile does use a man-in-the-loop guidance system, there would need to be an entire architecture , including compatible data links and ground terminals, in place to support that capability. Cost could be a factor, with the average price of an AGM-114R, including R9B and R9E variants, was around $115,000 each between Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015, according to U.S. military budget documents . Still, even if AGM-114R9Xs are expensive compared to other Hellfires and are available in limited quantities – issues that apply equally to the BLU-129/B – it’s hard to see a good reason not to at least make them available in small numbers to a broader swath of deployed units. Increased production of the missiles would also help reduce unit prices. Whatever the reasons for the AGM-114R9X’s limited availability and use in the past, those restrictions appear to be increasingly loosening up now, with three strikes involving the weapon this year and the two in Syria within just the past seven days.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",North Korea Conducts “Strategic” Test Amid Threat To Send A “Christmas Gift” To Trump,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea says that it has conducted a “strategic” test, likely of a large rocket motor, at a site it had previously partially dismantled as a good will gesture as part of negotiations with the United States over its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. This is the latest sign of the deteriorating detente between the two countries that followed a historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in 2018. Tensions have been steadily rising in recent months with the regime in Pyongyang recently threatening to send the U.S. government a provocative “Christmas gift,” almost certainly a reference to the potential of a new test of a long-range ballistic missile or even a nuclear weapon . On Dec. 8, 2019, the North Koreans confirmed that the test had occurred the day before at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground in the northwestern corner of the country. Experts had already seen what they believed to be evidence of imminent testing at the site on in satellite imagery from Dec. 5. “A very important test took place at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground on the afternoon of December 7, 2019,” a spokesperson for North Korea’s Academy of National Defence Science said in a very brief statement. “The results of the recent important test will have an important effect on changing the strategic position of the DPRK once again in the near future.” North Korea has not offered any details about what it tested or released pictures or video from the event, which typically follow tests and demonstrations of ballistic missiles and other major weapon systems. Sohae has been used to test large rocket motors for ballistic missiles and satellite launch vehicles (SLV), as well as for actual SLV launches, in the past. The North Koreans had begun dismantling parts of Sohae following the 2018 Summit between Trump and Kim, but rebuilt some of those facilities earlier this year. The U.S. government has consistently held the view that the SLV developments and launches at Sohae were actually a cover for work supporting North Korea’s long-range ballistic missile programs, including the crafting of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). the North Koreans demonstrated their first ICBM, the Hwasong-14 , on July 4, 2017. They followed this up with the launch of the larger Hwasong-15 just shy of five months later. The use of the word “strategic” in regards to this latest test at Sohae strongly points to it being part of the development of an improved variant of an existing missile, such as the Hwasong-15, or an all-new long-range ballistic missile. This would also fit with other statements North Korea has made recently. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EypIIkg7gx8 “The dialogue touted by the U.S. is, in essence, nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK bound to dialogue and use it in favor of the political situation and election in the U.S.,” Ri Thae Song, North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister of U.S. affairs, said on Dec. 3, 2019 , using an acronym for the country’s official title, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.” At the time, North Korea had also mockingly described the 2017 Hwasong-14 launch as a “gift” to the United States on the occasion of the July 4th holiday. “It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report,” a North Korean state media report declared in November, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe had talked about the threat posed by Pyongyang’s ballistic missiles following a North Korean test of a very large artillery rocket system. “Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose,” that story continued. Some experts have posited that what North Korea tested at Sohae last week as part of work on a new ICBM with a solid-fuel rocket motor. The Hwasong-15, as is the case with all the other known missiles designated in the Hwasong series, have liquid-fuel motors. North Korea has made significant investments , and seen real progress, in the development of large solid-fuel rocket motors for both ground- and submarine-launched ballistic missiles in recent years. Solid-fuel rockets generally make for missiles that are faster and easier to launch than equivalent liquid-fuel designs. Combined with a mobile transporter-erector-launcher, this means that land-based solid-fuel missiles can be employed on shorter notice from various locations, making it harder for an opponent to detect preparations for a launch, and then potentially try to take action before it occurs. Solid-fuel missiles are also historically easier and safer to store in a ready-to-launch configuration for protracted periods of time, making them particularly well suited to submarine-launched applications. The launch of North Korea’s first solid-fuel ICBM would certainly send a major message to North Korea’s opponents, chiefly the United States, and make clear that the country is still improving and expanding its nuclear deterrent capabilities. It would also be another significant demonstration of the country’s ability to keep developing new and increasingly advanced weapon systems in spite of sanctions and international criticism. It is also possible that the North Koreans could test a more intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile. This would still be provocative and threatening to U.S. allies in the Pacific, as well as the strategic American island Guam in the Western Pacific, which Pyongyang has threatened to strike in the past. It could also be an easier test for North Korea to achieve. In October, the North Koreans test-launched a new, larger and more capable submarine-launched solid-fuel ballistic missile, the Pukkuksong-3 . This follows from the submarine-launched Pukkuksong-1 and the land-based Pukkuksong-2 , the latter of which is a ground-launched derivative of the former. A photo of the Pukkuksong-3 test in October 2019., KCNA With this in mind, a ground-based variant or derivative of the Pukkuksong-3 would be a logical next step. It could also serve as an intermediate stepping stone to a solid-fuel ICBM, while still providing Pyongyang with new and important additional capability in the meantime. Other “Christmas gift” options might include the launch of multiple ICBMs simultaneously, demonstrating North Korea’s ability to launch a salvo strike at extreme ranges, a launch of even a single ICBM in a particularly provocative manner, such as over Japan’s Home Islands or toward Guam, or even a new nuclear weapons test. Another submarine-related test, or showing the country’s newly converted ballistic missile submarine in the water or at sea, is another possibility. It’s unclear how the United States might respond to any such provocations. For months, the U.S. government has been downplaying smaller ballistic missile and artillery rocket launches , saying that they do not violate the spirit of North Korea’s self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile and nuclear tests. Pyongyang put that policy into place in 2017 as part of an easing of tensions that led to the first summit between Trump and Kim. Kim Jong Un stands in front of a very large artillery rocket system following a test earlier in 2019., KCNA At the same time, North Korea has been very clearly frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations with the United States, especially over sanctions, an issue that was central to the collapse of the second Trump-Kim meeting in Vietnam earlier this year. Kim and other senior North Korean officials have repeatedly said that they could be forced to take a “ new path ,” seen as a threat to end its missile and nuclear weapons moratorium, if the Trump Administration does not meet its demands. On the day of the test at Sohae, Kim Song, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, said that “denuclearization” was off the table and that Pyongyang was not interested in any future “lengthy talks” with the United States. The  U.S. and North Korean governments explicitly disagree on what “denuclearization” means with regards to the Korean Peninsula, with the Trump Administration insisting for more than a year now that Kim Jong Un agreed to give up his nuclear weapons at the 2018 summit with Trump. However, North Korea has made it painfully clear that it is using a long-standing definition of “denuclearization” which refers to a more complex process of “removing” the nuclear threat to the regime that the United States poses. This would include a final peace deal to formally end the Korean War and the removal of all U.S. troops from South Korea, among other demands. “Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way,” Trump wrote in a pair of Tweets on Dec. 8, implying the potential use of military action against the North Korean regime. “He signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement with me in Singapore.” Trump has long taken a conciliatory tone toward Kim personally and the North Koreans have returned the favor in a clear attempt to try to use that relationship to win concessions. However, following these Tweets, and the U.S. President’s recent re-use of the nickname “ rocket man ” for Kim, North Korea and its state media outlets have launched their own renewed attacks on the American leader. On Dec. 9, Kim Yong Chol, who has served as one of the primary negotiators with the United States and previously ran the country’s top intelligence service, as well as Ri Song Yu, the Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, both issued inflammatory screeds targeting Trump. “Trump might be in great jitters, but he had better accept the status quo that he has sowed, so he should reap, and think twice if he does not want to see bigger catastrophic consequences,” Ri wrote. North Korea’s renewed testing at Sohae, which it partially dismantled in 2018, a goodwill gesture to Trump, is itself something of a signal that what is left of its patience is wearing thin. Now, of course, North Korea does not have the capacity to triumph over the United States in a major conflict, but that’s not to say that a war between the two wouldn’t be devastating for all parties involved, including South Korea and Japan. Still, North Korea is clearly turning up the pressure in hopes that it will finally be able to wrest eased sanctions and other concessions it wants from the Trump Administration. In November, the U.S. military did cancel a major exercise with the South Koreans explicitly with the hope that it could create space for renewed diplomacy with the North. Trump, who is facing impeachment as of the result of a political scandal, which is still very much evolving , could be inclined to try to cut a deal of some sort with North Korea in order to achieve a political victory. At the same time, the President could see taking a harder stance against an increasingly belligerent regime in Pyongyang as providing the same domestic political benefits. The course of action could include more sanctions and other activities , possibly including covert actions such as cyberattacks , which the North Koreans would certainly decry as “hostile” and not in keeping with the spirit of the Kim-Trump summits. This would only further ratchet up tensions and increase the risk of miscalculations on both sides. At the moment, both sides look firmly entrenched in their respective positions, making it unlikely that, even if they return to a period of detente in the future, it won’t come before the end of the month. It seems increasingly inevitable that Kim will send some kind of “Christmas gift” to Trump, though it remains to be seen whether it will be a solid-fuel ICBM test or something else.

A satellite image that was posted on Chinese internet shows an impressive lineup of the Chinese military aerial drones, some of which are in development while others are operational. The lineup occurred at Malan Air Base , a known hub of testing for these types of systems. The image is yet another stark reminder of how China is betting big on unmanned aerial military capabilities, from high-end unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) to swarms of small expendable drones . The lineup includes China’s two high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, the Devine Eagle and Soar Eagle (green arrows). It also includes the Wing Loong series of Predator and Reaper-like and the smaller Rainbow remotely pilot vehicles (blue arrows). China’s two most prominent stealthy flying-wing drones are also present, including the large Sharp Sworn UCAV and the smaller surveillance oriented type known as the Tian Ying that has been displayed publicly in the past (red arrows). We also see the jet-powered Cloud Shadow (black arrow) and no less than three Tengden TB001 twin-boom medium-altitude, long-endurance drones (yellow arrows). Chinese Internet A pair of Insitu-like catapult or rocket-assisted launch drones also appear to be in the lineup (pink arrows), along with two groups of small mass swarming drones (brown arrows), and a couple of assorted individual smaller types that are unidentifiable. A drone helicopter is in the lineup, too (gray arrow). China has a wide variety of these in development, such as the SVU-200 . Finally, the arrowhead-shaped, rocket-powered, very-high-speed WZ-08 is also present in the impressive display (orange arrow).

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",America’s Missile That Uses Sword Blades Instead Of Explosives Has Struck Again In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It appears that the AGM-114R9X , a secret low collateral damage derivative of the AGM-114 Hellfire missile, has been employed against occupants of another vehicle in northwestern Syria. This is the second time this week . Previously, we knew of only one other instance in which the unique missile had been used, back in 2017 when an Al Qaeda kingpin was similarly targeted and killed in western Syria. The War Zone was the first to posit that an exotic new low-collateral damage weapon was being used after images from that strike surfaced. There are no confirmed reports as to who was targeted in this latest strike, which occurred near the town of Afrin in Aleppo Governorate, although there are some unconfirmed claims. Supposedly, three people were killed in the vehicle when the bladed weapon smashed through the roof of the vehicle. The post-strike video below is very gruesome. You have been warned: We followed up our report on a similar strike earlier this week in which an AGM-119R9X was used with a photo of the missile’s blade-wielding metallic core that survived the impact with the vehicle (see below). It provided great insight into how the weapon actually works, which confirmed our suspicions. Read our complete analysis here . Basically what replaces the high explosive warhead of the standard AGM-114 Hellfire on the AGM-114R9X is a metal core hub with six blades that swing out around it, pummelling and shredding anything in its path., Public Domain It’s not clear what has caused what seems like a sudden uptick in the use of this highly unique weapon, but it appears that it is becoming the weapon of choice for targeted assassinations by the U.S. in Northern Syria. Still, one thing remains unclear about this missile system—its guidance system. Most variants of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles use semi-active laser guidance where the seeker on the missile homes in on a laser spot being emitted from an aircraft overhead or by operatives on the ground. It is highly accurate for a weapon that is packed with high explosives. But in the case of the AGM-119R9X, which has no area blast effects at all, it has hit all three targets we have evidence of perfectly in the exact same spot and angle. This begs the question, does this weapon have man-in-the-loop guidance in which a person literally flies the missile into a precise point on the target via command data-link? MQ-9 carrying Hellfires and GBU-12s. , USAF Israel, in particular, has perfected this method of smart weapons delivery and uses it on many disparate weapons in their munitions in their inventory. On the other hand, maybe new high definition optics and lasers and a very sensitive seeker head are being used to place the weapon more accurately using a traditional laser-guided weapon concept of delivery? Or maybe something else going on here. We just don’t know. But considering the missile, which is roughly three and a half feet wide when its blades are extended, has perfectly nailed its target every time we know of and in the same exact spot, some sort of extremely accurate guidance is definitely being used. The video below of the Israeli Spike missile gives a good idea of the accuracy man-in-the-loop control provides. A particular MQ-9 has been repeatedly spotted high over Aleppo in recent days, which is not unusual. But what is unusual is its loadout. It appears to carry two data-link pods , four Hellfire derivatives, and an external fuel tank. This would make sense. One pod would link with the missile in-flight for man-in-the-loop control while the other would link with a controller of that missile. Executing a man-in-the-loop weapons engagement via the Reaper’s satellite data-link may be troublesome. As such, the Reaper would act as a surveillance and launch platform, with the missile guidance being carried out by another party. The other pod would handle this data-exchange. Rami al Sayed/AFP/Getty Images We’ll have to keep an eye out to see if the trend of using these nasty and highly accurate weapons continues and against who. Regardless, as it sits now, it is glaringly clear that America’s ‘blade missile,’ and those that employ it, have had quite a busy week.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2019",Did Israel Just Conduct A Ballistic Missile Test From A Base On Its Mediterranean Coast?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel conducted a mysterious “rocket propulsion system” test earlier today from a base in the central part of the country. The few details that are available have prompted speculation that this launch is related to the development of a new member of the country’s top-secret Jericho family of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. The launch occurred at Palmachim Air Base , which is situated south of the major Israeli city of Tel Aviv, on Dec. 6, 2019. Video and pictures subsequently emerged on social media showing a single long contrail rising from the base. Plane watchers using online tracking software had also seen flights headed for Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv move to different routes and clear a path in the Mediterranean Sea extending beyond the Greek island of Crete ahead of the test. “The defense establishment conducted a launch test a few minutes ago of a rocket propulsion system from a base in the center of the country,” Israel’s Ministry of Defense said in a subsequent statement that did not even name Palmachim directly. “The test was scheduled in advance and was carried out as planned.” #Israel #IDF a effectué un essai du système de propulsion de missiles depuis la base aérienne de Palmachim, au sud de #TelAviv , en ce matin du 6 décembre 2019.

He added that two of the Israeli Air Force’s specially configured Gulfstream G550s , which the service operates in the Eitam airborne early warning and control and Shavit intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance configurations, also appeared to take part in the test, along with a number of C-130 Hercules aircraft.

However, how tight-lipped Israel is being about the launch, combined with Palmachim being the launch sites, does seem to point to a test related to the country’s Jericho ballistic missile family . Very little is known about these weapons, the first of which Israel developed initially with French and later American assistance in the 1960s . This was followed by the Jericho II , which IAI reportedly developed between the 1970s and the 1980s with American assistance. Jericho II is reportedly a two-stage intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), meaning that it has a range of somewhere between 1,864 and 3,418 miles. Experts believe that Jericho II served as the basis for the publicly acknowledged Shavit series of space launch vehicles, which IAI produces and not to be confused with the aforementioned modified Gulfstream G550 intelligence-gathering aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xiTJ7TftJP8 Work on the Shavit family, in turn, reportedly contributed to the development of Jericho III, which may have two or three stages and is described as an intercontinental ballistic missile , meaning it has a range of more than 3,418 miles. There are reports that Jericho III first entered service in 2011, but it is unknown how many may be operational. All of the Jericho missiles are understood to be at least nuclear-capable, part of Israel’s unacknowledged, but widely known strategic nuclear arsenal. As of 2008, the Federation of American Scientists estimated that Israel also had some 50 Jericho IIs, though the 2016 edition of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ‘ The Military Balance , said only approximately 24 were in inventory. There are also reports that Israel may be in the process of developing a new Jericho missile, referred to variously as the IIIA or IV. Is that the type of ""we know it but we can't say it so we quote some random foreign publication"" thingie? — Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) December 6, 2019 Beyond that, Palmachim is widely understood to be the center of Jericho testing, with the base also having publicly served as the site of a number of Shavit launches. It is an otherwise highly sensitive location, which Israel has sought to conceal on publicly available satellite imagery in the past, which also sits adjacent to the Israel Atomic Energy Commission’s (IAEC) Soreq Nuclear Research Center . Similar to many American nuclear research laboratories , Soreq is involved in a variety of non-nuclear research and development, as well. A 2016 satellite image of Palmachim Air Base and the Soreq Nuclear Research Center, which is the facility seen immediately to the east with the ringed perimeter., Google Earth There are reports of at least two Jericho III test launches from the base, one in 2008 and another in 2011 . Another “rocket propulsion system” test took place there in 2017 , which may also have been tied to Israel’s ballistic missile programs. It is also possible that the latest test may be related to the development of Israel’s upper-tier ballistic missile defense systems, such as the Arrow 3 . The Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) tested an Arrow 3 interceptor at Palmachim in January 2019 . However, Israel is much more open about the development and testing of its missile defense systems, which it conducts in cooperation with the U.S. government and American defense contractors. It seems less likely that if the latest launch from Palmachim was related to work on a missile defense system, even a still classified one, that Israeli authorities would not have simply said so. It seems similarly unlikely that this level of secrecy would have applied to a propulsion system test related to the Shavit series or another space launch vehicle. Whatever the case, the launch comes amid a flurry of reports about the increased potential of Iranian threats toward U.S. interests in the Middle East and those of its allies and partners, including Israel. Just this week, it emerged that the U.S. Navy recently captured another new tranche of Iranian guided missiles and related parts, including components that appeared to be for Noor anti-ship missiles , that were likely bound for Houthi rebels in Yemen. There have also been reports that Iran has been quietly moving short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq , where Iranian-backed militias could potentially launch them at American forces. Other media outlets have indicated that Iranian forces and their proxies have been increasingly using drones to surveil U.S. positions in unspecified Middle Eastern countries and otherwise making potentially worrisome moves within the region. What appears to be the guidance section of an Iranian Noor anti-ship missile that was among a larger cache of missiles and related parts that the US Navy recently seized at sea in the Middle East., USN This week, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom also sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, which subsequently became public, raising concerns that Iran has been developing a nuclear-capable variant of the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, which reportedly has a range of up to 1,200 miles, which is “equipped with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle.” These three European countries, sometimes now referred to as the E3, said that this weapon would appear to be in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that prohibit Iran from developing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Iran’s position remains that since it denies it is developing nuclear weapons, none of its ballistic missiles are nuclear-capable. https://youtube.com/watch?v=F9d1BDeA5-I However, Iran has been increasing its nuclear activities, especially with regards to uranium enrichment , in recent months, in contravention of the terms of an international agreement commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. The United States withdrew from this agreement in 2018, leaving the remaining parties, primarily the E3, to try to salvage it. Amid increasingly harsh U.S. sanctions in recent years, Iran has stepped up the pressure in the deal’s European members to make additional concessions. It’s very likely given the work that goes into planning missile tests that the timing of this latest launch from Palmachim was a coincidence. True or not, it has clearly sent a signal to Iran, nonetheless. “Israel today tested a nuke-missile, aimed at Iran,” Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter later on Dec. 6, 2019. “E3 & US never complain about the only nuclear arsenal in West Asia—armed with missiles actually DESIGNED to be capable of carrying nukes—but has fits of apoplexy over our conventional & defensive ones.” Israel today tested a nuke-missile, aimed at Iran. E3 & US never complain about the only nuclear arsenal in West Asia—armed with missiles actually DESIGNED to be capable of carrying nukes—but has fits of apoplexy over our conventional & defensive ones. https://t.co/r4EqXkhcCN — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) December 6, 2019 If nothing else, from the available evidence, there certainly are strong indications that Israel is working on new advances in its secretive ICBM arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 11, 2019",Russia Built A NATO Spec Identification Friend Or Foe System For Turkey’s S-400 Batteries,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia reportedly included a system to distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft that it built to NATO standards with the S-400 surface-to-air missile systems it has sold to Turkey. The same report claims that the actual coded waveforms that this identification friend-or-foe system, or IFF, uses are kept secure within an attached, but separate Turkish-made cryptologic system that the Russians do not have direct access to. The U.S. government and other NATO allies have repeatedly raised concerns that Turkey’s S-400s will not be able to work in concert with other alliance air defenses during a crisis and could give the Kremlin access to sensitive information, including details about the stealthy signature of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The United States kicked Turkey out of the F-35 program earlier this year over its purchase of the Russian air defense systems. Russia’s Gazeta newspaper published the report about Turkey’s S-400s, which is clearly meant to challenge the concerns that the country won’t be able to integrate surface-to-air missile systems with other allied air defenses, on Dec. 5, 2019. The story says that Turkey successfully tested the IFF system during an initial evaluation of one of its S-400s last month. Those tests also involved checking the function of the S-400’s radars. The complete systems that Turkey acquired include the 91N6E Big Bird surveillance and acquisition radar, the 96L6E Cheese Board air search and acquisition radar, and the 92N6E Grave Stone fire control radar. Only the 91N6E and the 96L6E, the latter of which was mounted on a 40V6M elevated mast, were visible in pictures and video from the testing, but Gazeta ‘s sources said that the 92N6E was also present and active. Those same sources said that the aircraft flew around the S-400 site at Murted Air Base, located near the Turkish capital Ankara, for approximately eight hours in total. Two of the Turkish Air Force’s American-made F-16 Viper fighter jets , an older F-4E Phantom II combat jet, and an unspecified helicopter, according to Gazeta . They flew at the radars from various directions and altitudes, including extremely low altitudes and in “dead crater” blind spots, likely a reference to a phenomenon known as the “doppler notch,” which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece. The testing reportedly culminated with a successful simulated engagement of an unspecified target. An infographic showing the various components of the full S-400 system., RIA Novosti The War Zone had surmised that these tests would also include an evaluation of some kind of IFF capability when they were first announced, but that Turkey’s S-400s are using a Russian made system, known as an interrogator, is particularly notable. The interrogator sends and receives coded signals from friendly aircraft flying above that identify them as non-threatening. Gazeta ‘s story says that the interrogator that Russia built for Turkey’s S-400s conforms to NATO’s Mk-XII IFF system requirement as defined by a set of standards known as Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4193. This Russian-made system is capable of sending out signals using the current IFF waveform the Alliance uses, also known as Mode 4. Improved Mk-XIIA systems using an updated and more secure Mode 5 waveform are supposed to begin entering service in the U.S. military and other NATO members in 2020. A chart showing details about the capabilities of the different IFF modes and the time it takes for them to successfully interrogate a target. Mode 1, for instance, is fast, but it only gives the interrogator information about basic aircraft type and whatever its “mission” is according to how the transponder is programmed. The delay between the IFF system issuing a “challenge” pulse and when the transponder pulses its “replies” is fixed, as well, making it more vulnerable to false signals. Mode 4 incorporates a variable delay between the pulses that is based on the encrypted code the interrogator sends out., Public Domain The Turkish government only reportedly acquired this Russian system in the first place due to delays in an entirely domestically produced alternative from defense contractor Aselsan. Turkey plans to refit its S-400s with its own equipment as soon it’s ready. The clear implication from Gazeta ‘s report is that NATO’s interoperability and operational security concerns, at least with regards to IFF codes, are misplaced since the interrogator doesn’t store the codes or have the ability to directly transmit them to a third party. It’s worth noting that STANAG 4193 is not classified, but NATO itself does not allow its release to the general public, though various websites claim to have copies available for purchase. Russia is also reportedly not working directly with the encrypted waveforms. At the same time, that the Russians were able to build an interrogator to what they feel are NATO specifications does raise questions and concerns about just how closely they worked with Turkish personnel or contractors and the full extent of information that changed hands as a result. It’s still not clear, however, if the hybrid Russian-Turkish system actually meets the full array of applicable NATO standards, even if it is technically STANAG 4193 compliant. It’s not clear if other members of the alliance would be willing to trust the safety of their aircraft during combined operations to a Russian-built system, regardless. Beyond that, NATO has many more standardization requirements that deal with specific physical elements, including basic and military-specific safety features, and radio and networking compatibilities well beyond IFF systems that Turkey’s S-400 systems may not meet. Even if the interoperability issues turn out to be relatively minor, it is unlikely that this will address other operational security concerns, especially those that the United States has about the S-400’s radars ability to collect data on the F-35 and whether the Russian might be able to gain access to that information. The U.S. government’s position has been and remains categorically that Turkey can have either the F-35 or the S-400, but not both . The first F-35A Joint Strike Fighter intended for Turkey at rollout ceremony in 2018. This aircraft remains in the United States and Turkey will not take delivery of it due to the S-400 purchase., Anadolu Agency These technical considerations are also moot when it comes to the potential for the United States to hit Turkey with additional sanctions over the S-400 purchase, as well, particularly under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA . Absent the Turkish government receiving a waiver, CAASTA requires the U.S. government to take action, which could include things such as preventing Turkish banks and other business entities from doing business with their American counterparts and blocking the Turkish government from receiving U.S. loans. President Donald Trump and his Administration, as well as members of some members of Congress, had been holding out hope that there might be some sort of negotiated solution, saying that Turkey could potentially avoid sanctions if it did not “ activate ” the S-400 radars. The November 2019 testing crossed that red line and now legislators are increasingly calling for the Trump Administration to act. On Dec. 2, 2019, Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, and Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and staunch Trump ally, sent a joint letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding the implementation of CAASTA sanctions on Turkey. “Both the Administration and the Congress have repeatedly warned [Turkish] President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan that his decision to move forward with the S-400 requires the imposition of American sanctions,” the letter stated. “Despite President Erdogan’s recent visit to the White House, he has given no public indications that he is going to change course.” “The time for patience has long expired. It is time you applied the law,” it said in closing. “Failure to do so is sending a terrible signal to other countries that they can flout U.S. laws without consequence.” Turkey, for its part, has remained defiant and there are reports that it is now looking to buy even more S-400s. The Turkish government has also expressed interest in other advanced Russian military systems, including Su-35 Flanker-E and Su-57 combat jets and the new S-500 air defense system . All told, whether or not Turkey’s S-400s have a NATO-compliant IFF system, seems unlikely to protect the country from more American sanctions and further eroding relations with the United States and its other allies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 13, 2019",Navy Boss Hints At A Very Different Looking Future Fleet Of Naval Combat Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s top officer says that his service is still looking at a mix of still largely undefined manned and unmanned advanced “aviation combatants” to follow on from its existing primary combat jets, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-35C Joint Strike Fighter . He also said that it was not clear what platforms those future aircraft might launch from, raising the possibility that the Navy may be looking beyond traditional aircraft carriers as it refines its naval aviation requirements. On Dec. 5, 2019, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday made his comments about the future of naval aviation at the U.S. Naval Institute’s annual Defense Forum Washington. In April 2019, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Scott Conn, the Navy’s Director of Air Warfare, had told legislators that a study of core requirements for the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, not to be confused with the U.S. Air Force’s program of the same name , would be ready by the summer. NGAD is the Navy’s current effort to develop a “family of systems” to supplant the F/A-18E/F and F-35C. As the Department of the Navy is responsible for overseeing the U.S. Marine Corps, this could have an impact on the future of that service’s combat aviation elements , as well. “I do think we need an aviation combatant, but what the aviation combatant of the future looks like? I don’t know yet,” Gilday explained . “I think there’s going to be a requirement to continue to deliver a seaborne launched vehicle through the air that’ll deliver an effect downrange. … I do think that that will likely be a mix of manned and unmanned.” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday speaks at the Defense Forum Washington on Dec. 5, 2019., USN The Navy has been actively exploring what its future combat aircraft fleets might look like since at least 2008. In 2012, it formally dubbed the program F/A-XX , with the primary goal being the development of a sixth-generation manned stealth fighter. The service has also been separately working on an Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) since at least the 2000s. That effort eventually evolved into the abortive Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program, or UCLASS, a saga in of itself that The War Zone has covered in detail in the past . Though then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus declared in 2015 that the future of naval aviation was unmanned, UCLASS morphed into the MQ-25 Stingray unmanned tanker program the following year and the Navy’s focus returned primarily to manned aircraft with F/A-XX. However, as Admiral Gilday has made clear, this view has shifted again with the evolution of F/A-XX into NGAD and the return to a discussion about a future mix of manned and unmanned platforms. “Anything beyond a Block III Super Hornet is a Next-Generation Air Dominance discussion, in terms of what is going to replace that aircraft,” Rear Admiral Scott Conn explained to lawmakers in April. The NGAD study that the Navy planned to complete this summer would “inform future choices reflected in future budget cycles in terms of what do we need to do to get after the lethality that we need at a cost that we can afford,” he added. This is, in many ways, extremely similar to how discussions about a future air combat platform have transformed over the past two decades within the Air Force. That service also started with a focus on a manned sixth-generation combat jet, referred to as F-X, before shifting focus to a family of systems approach that will include unmanned designs as part of its own, unrelated, NGAD program. The Air Force has described its vision of NGAD as including manned aircraft worked together with “ loyal wingman ” drones, autonomous UCAVs, low-cost unmanned swarms , and much more . The service is also looking at novel concepts within these categories, including “fighter jets” that do not fit traditional definitions, such as a derivative of the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber armed with air-to-air missiles and networked together with a number of loyal wingmen. You can read more about the Air Force’s NGAD effort in this recent in-depth piece on the present state of that program at The War Zone . Kratos’ low-cost experimental XQ-58 drone is at the center a number of advanced US Air Force aerial combat efforts., USAF NGAD is also only one element of how the Air Force is hoping to disrupt typical notions about air combat, as well as the development and acquisition of combat aircraft. This includes a questionably ambitious plan to spur rapid development of new, advanced aircraft designs and work on plug-and-play systems that could add increased autonomy to future drones or pilot-optional designs, as well as generally increasing network connectivity among aircraft and munitions. Golden Horde , the munitions networking effort, and Skyborg , the program to develop an artificial intelligence “brain” for future unmanned platforms are two of the Air Force’s first three new “ Vanguard Programs .” The service says it will designate various efforts as “Vangaurds” in the future, which will highlight them for greater emphasis in future budgets and overall planning. The Navy has no doubt been watching what the Air Force has been doing and there is a distinct possibility that the two NGAD efforts could eventually find themselves working closely together, if not blended together into a single joint program. The two services are already working together on a new joint networking initiative to better link all of their various platforms together, which Admiral Gilday has described as being a new “Manhattan Project,” the name of the effort that developed the first atomic bomb. The Navy has already made significant strides in this regard with its Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter-Air (NIFC-CA) efforts, which you can read about more here and here . It has also been working on a distributed, networked electronic warfare architecture called Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature (NEMESIS), which could be a factor in the service’s future combat aircraft developments and that you can read about in this recent War Zone feature . Of course, the Navy, as well as the Marine Corps, certainly has different requirements than the Air Force and there have been reports in past that the torturous experience with the F-35 program has soured all three on another future joint combat aircraft effort. The increasing emphasis on a diverse family of systems rather than a single ‘exquisite’ aircraft design may mitigate those issues to a degree. In addition, the Navy’s unique need for “seaborne launched” designs may be less of an issue going forward if its future combat aviation fleets include aircraft that do not need to operate from traditional aircraft carriers. “The platform which they launch from?” Admiral Gilday asked rhetorically at the Defense Forum Washington. “I’m not sure what that’s going to look like.” This is a particularly interesting comment given the ongoing troubles the Navy is having with its new Ford class supercarriers , its efforts together with the Marine Corps to investigate the use of amphibious assault ships as light carriers , and the recent dramatic decision within the Marines to emphasize using platforms beyond traditional amphibious warfare ships as part of future distributed operations. It’s possible that the Navy may also consider more novel platforms , including large submarines , as options for launching unmanned aircraft, including swarms of small drones, in the future. The Marines are also in the process of exploring their own multi-faceted advanced drone efforts as part of the Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary program, or MUX . An F/A-18E Super Hornet, at left, and an F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, at right, onboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln during tests in 2018., USN How the Navy’s NGAD program continues to evolve and mature, and how they may blend together with other efforts within the service or elsewhere within the U.S. military, remains to be seen. A number of tertiary factors may impact those plans, as well, especially given Rear Admiral Conn’s remarks earlier this year about the need to fit the requirements into a package “we can afford.” The U.S. government has returned to the use of short-term spending packages, known as continuing resolutions , amid concerns about possible government shutdowns and general budget uncertainty, which will influence long-term planning throughout the U.S. military. The Navy itself is in a period of flux. Admiral Gilday only took up the role of Chief of Naval Operations in August, after the prospective nominee for the position, now retired Admiral Bill Moran, withdrew from the process. Then-Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer had called Moran’s judgment into question over his correspondence with another officer who had previously retired amid a sexual harassment scandal. Spencer himself was forced out in November as a result of a convoluted series of events following President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. A court martial had acquitted Gallagher of murdering a prisoner of war, a war crime, as well as other charges, but had convicted him of “wrongfully pos[ing] for an unofficial picture with a human casualty.” What is clear is that the Navy is still considering a multitude of options as it continues to refine its requirements and potential concepts of operation for its future combat aircraft fleets.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 17, 2019",RC-135 Rivet Joint Surveillance Jet Emerges With Puzzling New Modification,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the USAF’s prized and highly versatile RC-135V/W Rivet Joint electronic intelligence gathering aircraft has appeared at March Air Reserve Base (ARB) in California sporting a very prominent and never seen before modification. In place of a wideband secure satellite communications array that was installed roughly a half-decade ago, a new bizarrely shaped antenna system has been installed. It has a thick vertical base that is elongated with a flat leading edge on top. It’s not apparent what communications system this is, but the one that was removed to accommodate it was far from easily expendible. The reconfigured Rivet Joint was departing after making a fuel stop at March ARB when aviation photographer Dan Stijovich snapped some great photos of it. The RC-135, which is normally based out of Offutt AFB in Nebraska , was operating under the callsign SHINER 50 and was flying from Greenville, Texas where L3Harris ISR Systems is based. They would be the most likely candidate for making such a communications modification on the jet, so that makes perfect sense. Dan Stijovich The RC-135V/W fleet received the satcom antenna that this new one replaced around five years ago. Similar installations have subsequently shown up on other large strategic aircraft, like the E-6B Mercury and VC-25A “Air Force One” fleets, among others, which you can read all about in this past post of ours . Getting the Rivet Joint high-bandwidth secure beyond-line-of-sight connectivity was clearly a highly beneficial initiative. It would allow the jet to potentially send large amounts of its electronic intelligence all around the world instantly for further review and near real-time exploitation. The common RC-135V/W configuration has the rounded satcom installation where the far less streamlined one is now. This configuration was only introduced roughly half a decade ago., Ken H / @chippyho Rivet Joint not only detects, geolocates, and classifies enemy air defense emitters, but it also provides communications and other forms of signals intelligence. The jet has crypto and language experts onboard to process some of this information in real-time, but being able to rapidly distribute more of it to many other eyes and ears, including intelligence analysts and battlefield commanders halfway around the globe, is a huge force multiplier. Onboard an electronics-paced Rivet Joint. , USAF Also, just having better secure beyond-line-of-sight connectivity for a wide variety of other reasons is a huge plus worth the investment itself. This is especially true considering how long RC-135 missions last and how close to they come to hostile territory. With this in mind, we can only assume that this strange new array either replaces the existing one or it offers another function that is so important that other enhanced capabilities were jettisoned to obtain it. Dan Stijovich After speaking to sources familiar with the Rivet Joint airframe, we were told that there probably would also be a fairly substantial aerodynamic penalty for this system. For an aircraft that is already a flying antenna farm of sorts, this isn’t an alien development. But once again, this reality points to the fact that its ungainly configuration must be worth at least some tradeoffs. USAF It’s amazing how these ancient jets continue to be updated with new capabilities and soldier on flying highly sensitive missions day-in and day-out around the globe. The aircraft in question is 55 years old. As it sits now, there is no end in sight for the RC-135 Rivet Joint fleet and for most the other C-135 derivative strategic intelligence-gathering aircraft that continue to provide a steady stream of some of the country’s most critical intelligence products. USAF At least when it comes to technological capabilities, not the reliability of the airframes themselves, this upgrade makes it clear once again that the Rivet Joints just keep getting better with age.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 18, 2023",Photo Emerges Showing Sweden’s Stealthy Visby Class Corvette’s Tiny Radar Signature,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s undeniable that the Swedish Navy’s stealthy Visby class corvettes are among the coolest looking warships in service today. A picture has now emerged online that reportedly shows just how impressive the design is at reducing the vessel’s radar cross-section , in addition to being simply aesthetically pleasing. On Nov. 28, 2019, Reddit user u/Moresail posted a composite image showing one of Sweden’s five Visbys approximately one and a half miles off the bow of a cargo ship that they were on, as well as a shot of the screen of their vessel’s commercial Furuno X-band navigation radar. The corvette’s apparent radar signature is minuscule compared to that of another commercial vessel nearby. “Demonstration of Visby corvette’s stealth 1.5M away on merchant marine x-band radar,” u/Moresail wrote along with posting the images. “Echo [radar return] 0.75M on our starboard bow is another cargo ship anchored next to us.” You can find the pictures and the full discussion between u/Moresail and others about what one can deduce from it here . “It’s similar to the radar cross-section of a small buoy, which is quite fascinating,” the Reddit user added in a separate thread . “The echo would sometimes almost disappear, but surprisingly ARPA (automatic radar plotting aid) was still able to determine a course and speed.” Other Reddit users noted that the speck on the radar screen could also be mistaken for background clutter that the radar did not successfully filter out. It is fair to say that the corvette’s radar return as it appears on military-grade surface search or acquisition and fire control radars on other ships or aircraft flying overhead could very well be larger. It is also very likely that the Visby class corvette in question was not traveling its most stealth configuration and may even have had radar reflectors fitted to help prevent accidents. Even so, the small size radar return seen in the picture on Reddit is impressive, especially for a ship design that Sweden first began building in the 1990s. Sweden’s Kockums shipyard, now a division of Saab, laid down the future HSwMS Visby in 1995. Its design was heavily influenced by earlier work with the stealth test ship HSwMS Smyge , which the Swedish Navy had taken delivery of in 1990. The HSwMS Smyge stealth test ship., Public Domain The 640-ton displacement Visby class ships have a so-called tumblehome hullform, which is found on other modern stealth warship designs, most notably the U.S. Navy’s Zumwalt class destroyers . This general shape, combined with other design elements, including faceted edges and the use of composite materials , offers significant radar reducing advantages. The Visby class corvette Karlstad sails in front of an unknown submarine during the NATO-led exercise Trident Junction 2018 . The design’s tall and narrow tumblehome hullform is clearly visible., Sjøforsvaret The Visbys ‘ hulls are made up primarily of a composite of carbon fiber and vinyl laminate over a PVC plastic core that Kockums says weights half as much as steel of equivalent strength while providing the additional radar-absorbing benefits. It also reportedly helps to acoustically insulate internal systems and reduce the ship’s thermal signature , making it difficult to detect using infrared sensors, as well. The 57mm main gun on the corvettes is also hidden inside a radar-deflecting cupola when not in use. Its eight RBS-15 anti-ship missile launchers and four torpedo tubes are nestled inside the hull for the same reasons, as well. Various antennas and masts do dot the top of the ship, but there have been plans in the past to work on integrating flush-mounted antennas and other improvements to further mitigate the ship’s radar signature. Each one of the ships also has a Rheinmetall Multi Ammunition Softkill System (MASS), which launches decoys to further blind and confuse optical sensors in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet spectrums, as well as radars and laser range-finders. This would only help further conceal the vessel during an actual engagement. Another view of showing various hatches open, including the one that would otherwise conceal the starboard torpedo tubes, second from the rear. All of these would be closed for maximum stealth during combat operations., Sjøforsvaret The design, though certainly impressive, was also reportedly extremely complicated to build, with the entire program seeing significant delays and cost growth . Visby was officially commissioned in 2002, but in an initial configuration with limited capabilities. The next year, the Swedish Navy formally accepted delivery Visby , along with the second ship in the class, Helsingborg . The third example, Härnösand , arrived later that year, but the last two ships, Nyköping and Karlstad , were only commissioned in 2015. The purchase of a sixth member of the class, to be named Uddevalla , was canceled. By 2004, the average unit price for the ships was already reportedly approximately $184 million, or around $250.6 million in 2019 dollars. For comparison, in the 2019 Fiscal Year, the U.S. Navy budgeted to buy three Littoral Combat Ships – a program that involves two different classes of ship, both of which have displacements around five times greater than the Visbys – for just under $524 million each, or around twice the price of a single one of Sweden’s stealth corvettes. Still, the high costs of the Swedish ships have come with real benefits in terms of reduced radar signatures. “We are able to reduce the radar cross-section by 99 percent,” John Nilsson, one of the ship’s principal designers, told the BBC in 2004. “That doesn’t mean it’s 99 percent invisible, it means that we have reduced its detection range.” The Visby class ships are also intended to fight in littoral areas where they would have the benefit of complex terrain to hide within. “Naval officers fall in love with [this] ship. It’s not classically beautiful,” Nilsson added in his 2015 interview with the BBC . “In fact, it looks like a lunchbox. But it has better maneuverability and can achieve that level of stealth.” We respectfully disagree with that description of the Visby design, but, either way, it seems hard to argue about the ship’s impressively stealthy qualities. Gotta love the Visbys! https://t.co/IQTKGfrl37 — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) November 1, 2018 Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Corvettes Naval Radars Naval Sensor Systems Sea"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 28, 2019",Boeing Confirms Joining Forces With Disney To Build Flying X-Wings For Galaxy’s Edge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up story to our recent story about Disney’s secretive endeavor to create flying X-Wings to soar over their Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge theme park, we have now confirmed with Boeing that they were indeed part of the endeavor. The X-Wings appeared in front of a huge crowd at the park for the opening of the highly-anticipated Rise Of The Resistance ride’s grand opening last evening in Orlando, Florida. We were first to point out that judging by spy shots of the X-Wings, which are roughly the size of a family van, the craft appeared to be based on Boeing’s Cargo Air Vehicle (CAV) drone . In an email response to our inquiry, Alison Sheridan, a communications official for Boeing’s future-technology NeXt initiative , stated the following: “We can confirm that those were Boeing aircraft that flew last night at the Rise Of The Resistance dedication, and we were excited to be part of their event, but that’s all we’re sharing right now.” It is a very novel application of one of Boeing’s still experimental future-facing aerospace technologies. In fact, flying a pair of CAVs in a highly modified form at a very high-profile event like this that is associated with one of the world’s largest brands and entertainment franchises speaks to the stability and maturity of the CAV design. You can read all about these vehicles, Disney’s recent track record of pulling off grand illusions in the air on a not so a grand budget, and how such illusions have major tactical takeaways in our recent feature on the topic linked here . The collaboration between Disney’s Imagineering team and Boeing is an interesting one, to say the least. It will be great to hear the backstory about how this idea came to be, how the platform was selected, and how its X-Wing structure was added and flight tested. Hopefully, we will have those details in the not so distant future. In the meantime, check out what all the fanfare was about with these videos from Rise Of The Resistance . An incredible amount of technology went into making this “Deathstar” of dark rides happen. New effects include blaster bolts that fly across hangar bays and damaging the surrounding structure to lightsabers burning through ceilings. The Disney Imagineering team is pretty much the Skunk Works of the theme park universe, they can pull off most any illusion they are challenged to do. This ride, the most complex on our own planet, proves that. SPOILER ALERT! If you don’t want to see the ride before actually going on it, read about stealth cruise missiles instead!
