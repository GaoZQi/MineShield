By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Mark Welsh , who ended his 40-year military career this summer as the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, has joined the board of one of America’s largest defense contractors, Northrop Grumman. Of course, this is the same company that was selected to build America’s next stealth bomber —a contract that could be worth upwards of $100 billion, and one that was awarded under Welsh’s purview. The contract was seen as absolutely critical to the survival of Northrop Grumman as a prime combat aircraft manufacturer. Originally, it seemed as if Welsh was going to take the high road, accepting the position of dean at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service months before his official retirement from the USAF. Now, less than six months into that job, it appears that the general has decided to expand his professional career, and his income. It is not clear if Welsh will continue with his position as dean while he sits on Northrop Grumman’s board. Northrop Grumman’s CEO Wes Bush stated the following regarding Welsh’s new gig: “We are delighted that Mark Welsh has joined our board of directors. His extensive leadership experience and deep understanding of global security are a great fit to our board, and we are excited about the contributions he will make as Northrop Grumman employees around the globe work to create value for our customers and shareholders.” Northrop Grumman is not alone when it comes to slotting recently retired top commanders on their boards. All the other big defense contractors do it, too. And that is just a small sample of what happens on a program and department level far below a corporation’s board-level hierarchy. Taking a job that likely pays very well and has lucrative stock options right after you were in a position to greatly benefit the same company hiring you doesn’t mean your are crooked—but the fact that this type of thing is allowed only invites mass corruption and sows skepticism as to the Pentagon’s ability to make the right procurement decisions for America’s armed forces. Don’t hate the player, hate the game, as they say. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q-yJHUqeBew The thing is, this made news because Welsh was the top officer in the Air Force just months ago. Yet this happens virtually every day throughout the middle and upper command structure of America’s defense apparatus. Reform is desperately needed to create a clear and continuous separation between defense industry and those in uniform, as well as civilian leadership tasked with making key military procurement and strategic decisions. An abysmal example of the revolving door within the defense-industrial complex was the general who had a lot to do with keeping the miserable JLENS aerostat-mounted radar program alive even though pretty much everyone wanted to kill it. Eventually, it killed itself , but that’s another story for another time. The LA Times wrote : “Army leaders tried to kill JLENS in 2010, The Times learned. What happened next illustrates the difficulty of extinguishing even a deeply troubled defense program. Raytheon mobilized its congressional lobbyists. Within the Pentagon, Marine Corps Gen. James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, then vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, came to JLENS’ defense , arguing that it held promise for enhancing the nation’s air defenses. At Cartwright’s urging, money was found in 2011 for a trial run of the technology—officially, an “operational exercise”—in the skies above Washington, D.C. Cartwright retired the same year—and joined Raytheon’s board of directors five months later. As of the end of 2014, Raytheon had paid him more than $828,000 in cash and stock for serving as a director, Securities and Exchange Commission records show.” Demand massive systemic reform within the Pentagon now. The system is broken and it is not just wasteful of American treasure, it is producing chronically ineffective weapons for our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airman.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 9, 2016","Donald Trump Spanks F-35 Program, Talks Ban On Industry Hiring DoD Decision Makers","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Elect Donald Trump is just weeks away from taking over as Commander in Chief. Yet most of what we know of his plans has come from a series of fragmented tweets, sound bites from “victory rallies,” and comments from his transition team. That began to change Sunday when Trump sat down for his first interview since the election. Chris Wallace grilled Trump on a number of hot-button issues, but interestingly Trump lashed out not just at the Air Force One replacement program , but also the F-35 program and the Pentagon’s total lack of oversight when it comes to military officials taking high paying jobs with big defense contractors after they retire. When asked what we can expect once he actually takes office, Trump stated: “I want to make good deals for this country. I don’t need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in, O.K.? I don’t need that, especially when it’s totally out of control. You know, they’ve lost control of it. I let them know that I don’t want this. “I just see things that’s—if you look at the F-35 program, with the money, the hundreds of billions of dollars, and it’s out of control. And the people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies. “You know, they make a deal like that and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal. I’m going to a very—you know, lobbyists I’m doing. This is bigger than the lobbyists. When people order from these massive companies, these massive deals, I don’t want the people making these horrible—and they’re horrible deals—the overruns, the cost overruns, I don’t want them going to work for the companies after the deals are made. They should have a lifetime restriction.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=9ND8IMjwxes This statement comes just days after Trump controversially slammed the USAF’s Air Force One replacement initiative, a move The War Zone dissected in great detail . Building a new Air Force One is certainly a source of pride for Boeing, and the program will bring development dollars as well as help stretch the longevity of the 747-8i production line, which is already struggling to prove fiscally worthwhile. Yet Trump’s policies abroad could result in a much bigger loss for Boeing than the cancellation of a couple highly modified 747s could. If Trump were to start a major trade dispute with China, Boeing stands to lose massive amounts of revenue in the form of lost airliner orders. Currently, China is the largest emerging market for commercial airliners in the world. An astounding 6,810 planes worth $1.025 trillion are predicted to be sold to airlines in the country within the next 20 years and Boeing is becoming deeply invested into seeing their products end up in Chinese airliner fleets. A major part of this strategy includes building a 737 assembly plant near Shanghai . How all this will sit with a Trump administration—which is vehemently opposed to outsourcing manufacturing jobs—is yet to be seen. And although Trump and Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg talked last week , Trump’s remarks yesterday makes it seem as though nothing has changed. Additionally, Trump’s national security cabinet is very hawkish when it comes to Iran. Although tearing up the P5+1 nuclear deal with Iran completely would be foolish, dumping parts of it could happen. This could set US-Iranian relations back years, and it could also spell doom for Tehran’s large $17 billion order with Boeing for 30 777s and Boeing 50 737s. In short, Boeing has a lot to lose when it comes to a protectionist Trump administration. Trump’s comments on the F-35 come as the program continues to suffer from a disconnect between the rosy picture being painted by those in the program and the far more glum outlook put forward by those providing independent oversight of it. Still, Trump’s mention of the Joint Strike Fighter comes as no real surprise. Until mentioning the Air Force One replacement program last week, the F-35 was really the only weapons development program Trump had remarked on during or after the campaign. An F-35B with a unique asymmetric load seen operating from the USS America during trials. , Lockheed Martin Whether Trump will restructure, curtail or even cancel the F-35 is unclear, although the latter option is unlikely, considering how deeply invested the Pentagon already is on the program. Then again, with this administration anything is possible. Pouring more fuel on the fire, Trump tweeted a follow-up comment on the F-35 this morning, sending Lockheed into damage control and their stock diving: The president elect’s strong messaging concerning what has become known as the Pentagon’s “revolving door” also raised eyebrows. This unique “ecosystem” that clearly invites corruption is one in which defense officials with prominent influence over procurement programs retire only to take high-paying jobs at big defense companies. Often times, before leaving their government or military jobs, these same officials had some sort of control or influence over the same defense programs that the companies that hire them won or ran at the time. It isn’t even that uncommon for a military official working as lead decision maker for a big acquisition program (representing the customer, AKA the DoD and the taxpayer) to retire just to go run the same program from the civilian side for the same company that they had a hand in awarding said program or contract to. The crazy thing it’s all perfectly legal… At least for now. During the interview, Trump quickly noted that he is going to look for a lifetime ban on officials moving from high-up roles in the Pentagon to big jobs in the defense industry. We don’t know if both those in uniform and civilian Pentagon leadership would be equally affected under such a scheme, but we do know that Trump has said in the past that he intends to put a five year mandatory waiting period between the time anyone leaves office and when they can become a lobbyist. This may also include civilian defense officials moving to private sector defense jobs, with military officers having a life-long ban on doing something similar. More details to come. Interestingly, Trump’s pouncing on this topic comes just a couple days after we reported that Air Force ex-Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh took a position on the board of Northrop Grumman . This is the same company that secured the critical and massive B-21 stealth bomber contract while the force was under Welsh’s purview. All this points to major administrative and human resources changes coming to the Pentagon, as well as severe reform in the way the government buys its weapons. We have already discussed some of the broad changes a President Trump will likely make on America’s defense apparatus and foreign policy, but exactly how specific reforms will manifest themselves, and what weapon systems will be winners and losers under the new administration will be greatly determined by incoming Secretary of Defense Mattis. That is if he is given a waiver from Congress that allows him to serve in the role without spending seven years out of uniform first— an odd and somewhat ironic reality considering Trump’s push to break the personnel bonds between the Pentagon and the massive industrial complex that supports it. From left, Brig. Gen. James Mattis, X-35 Program Manager Gary Ervin, Deputy Secretary of Defense Rudy de Leon, Gen. Michael Hough and Lockheed Martin Corp. Chairman and CEO Vance Coffman talk at the end of de Leon's tour of Lockheed Martin in Palmdale, Calif., Tuesday, May 30, 2000. , AP Wallace also grilled Trump on his transition team’s blowing off of the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia meddled in the Presidential election, and to his campaign’s direct benefit. This is something that has been all but a certainty for some time , although having the intelligence agencies make a near total claim that Moscow specifically supported Trump in the process is new, and one full of political pitfalls on both sides of the aisle. Trump’s response during the interview was as such: “I don’t want anyone hacking us. And I’m not only talking about countries. I’m talking about anyone, period… But if you’re going to do that, I think you should not just say Russia, you should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals. It’s not necessarily… It could be. I mean, it could be. Hey, look, we had many people saying one of the great victories of all time. They’re very embarrassed.” President Obama has since ordered a better-late-than-never investigation into the situation, dating back to 2008, but it seems that Trump has little interest in admitting that anyone else could have been to blame for his win in any way—Russia included. Trump’s team slamming America’s intel community before he even takes office sets a bad tone for the coming four years, and has given more ammunition to those who question Trump and his team’s connections to Russia and motivations for being so quick to defend Moscow. It also doesn’t help when one Bush administration alumni and Trump administration Secretary of State candidate goes on national news and floats a “false flag” theory behind the hacking. Then again, Trump himself is a bit of a conspiracy theorist , and so are the folks making up a good portion of his inner circle some would claim. Finally, Trump was confronted about reports that he has only taken a handful of his daily intelligence briefings since being elected President. Here’s Trump’s response: “First of all, these are very good people that are giving me the briefings. If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I’m available on one minute’s notice. “I don’t have to be told—you know, I’m, like, a smart person. I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years—but eight years. I don’t need that. “But I do say if something should change, let us know. Now, in the meantime, my generals are great, are being briefed. Mike Pence is being briefed, who is, by the way, one of my very good decisions. He’s terrific. And they’re being briefed. And I’m being briefed also. “But if they’re going to come in and tell me the exact same thing that they told me, you know, that doesn’t change necessarily. There might be times where it might change. I mean, there will be some very fluid situations. I’ll be there not every day but more than that. But I don’t need to be told, Chris, the same thing every day, every morning, same words. Sir, nothing has changed. Let’s go over it again. I don’t need that.” In all fairness, not every President has been a great study of daily US intelligence reports since the daily brief became a thing at the start of the Nixon administration. In fact, Trump himself chided President Obama for not taking every daily brief once in office. Still, considering how rapidly the world is moving, and Trump’s less than stellar baseline knowledge of foreign policy and defense issues , it would be nice to see him do a lot more cramming before taking to the Oval Office on January 20, 2017.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 20, 2019",Two Major Fighter Deliveries to Middle East Mark Big Changes in Region,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is only fitting that the long-awaited deliveries of both Israel’s and Saudi Arabia’s newest jet fighters are occurring at the same time. For many decades, the US has carefully armed the two foes heavily, always giving Israel the qualitative advantage . This continues to today as the IAF will not only be the first foreign operational user of the F-35, it will also be the only country to get the jet in the Middle East. Turkey, a NATO ally, will be the closest country geographically to also operate the type. Still, Saudi Arabia did not get any sort of consolation prize. Far from it in fact. They are receiving the most advanced iteration of the feared F-15 Eagle the world has ever seen, the F-15SA . After a short delay due to weather at Cameri Air Base in Italy, Israel’s first two F-35I Adirs landed at Nevatim Air Base in Israel yesterday evening. They were greeted by the highest ranks of the Israeli military, industry and government leadership—including Prime Minister Netanyahu. Even outgoing US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and President of Lockheed Martin Marillyn Hewson were on hand to greet the fighters. Although the event, which was a major milestone for the F-35 program, was overshadowed by President elect Trump’s negative remarks about the program just a day earlier, it still was a highly publicized and fairly glitzy affair. At the arrival ceremony Major General Amir Eshel, the commander of the  IAF, proclaimed that “Today, the fifth generation revolution begins. The Adir is about to become a powerful accelerator for the entire IAF… We plan on leveraging our systemic abilities to new heights in attack and defense. Our aerial force will be much deadlier, combined and more relevant than ever.” The general continued, “Today, a fascinating meeting between man and machine begins, between our excellent pilots and maintenance personnel and the forefront of flight technology. The jet will become exceedingly ‘White and Blue’ in its operation and systems. Each Adir will be an awesome attack machine, an information and control center that will operate successfully in the face of dangerous threats in ways completely different than those we are familiar with.” Prime Minister Netanyahu also remarked that “The Adir stealth fighters and pilots will be able to operate in every arena, near and far.  Our goal is to obtain supremacy in every theatre: in the air, in the sea, on the ground and in the cyber arena. We build our force and sharpen our abilities in defense, attack, deterrence and decision. The Adir jets will strengthen these abilities.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=CeyXgirnw4 Israel says the jet will be operational in just one year and that 50% of all pilot training will happen in simulators. This not only saves money and airframe life, it also allows certain tactics to be better simulated than on real missions, especially those using destructive electronic attacks. Israel originally ordered 19 F-35Is, but has since executed two additional options and is now slated to receive 50 of the type. The Adir deal is one facet of a ten year, $30 billion aid deal from the US signed just this year by the Obama Administration. Israel could end up buying another 25 F-35s in the future, some of which could be B models . The F-35 arrives in Israel. , AP The other military giant in the region Saudi Arabia ordered a whopping 84 F-15SAs fresh from Boeing’s St. Louis factory, and another 70 upgrade kits for a large portion of their existing F-15 force. The F-15SA has been flying for a few years now, going through various tests in the US and proving the its new features and capabilities. Now, four of these jets—two new builds and two upgraded—have arrived in Saudi Arabia, having left RAF Lakenheath in England around the same time as the when the Adirs arrived in Israel. All these new aircraft, Saudi and Israeli, will be delivered over the coming half decade or so, resulting in a massive increase in air combat power in the region. This is especially so when other advanced fighter orders to Sunni-Arab gulf states, such as the recent ones to Qatar and Kuwait, are also factored in. In the past, any delivery of advanced weaponry, and especially of high-end fighter jets, to the region would be greeted with a flurry of rhetoric from Israel, or from Arab countries that have historically opposed the Jewish State. That has changed in recent years as an emboldened Iran has caused a massive strategic crevice to form in the Persian Gulf. Sunni Arab gulf states, rich with petro dollars, have found a far more threatening enemy in Shiite-controlled Iran than in Israel, and visa-versa, with Israel increasingly seeing their once bitter foes as strategic partners, and maybe one day even as allies. Meanwhile, Israel and its Arab neighbor to the east, Jordan, have become so close that their air forces are now actively training and traveling together on an international level, and Israel has even donated attack choppers to Jordan to help keep ISIS at bay. This dramatic strategic shift in the Middle East has been further catalyzed by t he Saudi Arabia-led proxy war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen , as well as Iran’s deep involvement in the Syrian conflict. And even though the P5+1 nuclear deal with Iran took away Tehran’s capability to develop a nuclear weapon for at least a decade, the money unfrozen and the loosening of trade restrictions as a result of the deal has allowed Iran to expand their influence abroad militarily and to greatly enhance their conventional weapons arsenal, including their air defenses. F-15SA loaded with weapons. A derivative of this jet is being marketed by Boeing as the Advanced F-15 Eagle., Boeing This new reality of sorts between Israel and many Arab countries was broken down by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself in an unprecedented fashion last Sunday on 60 Minutes : Lesley Stahl: What about the silver lining? That because of this deal, you now have all this—these better relationships with your neighbors. Benjamin Netanyahu: Oh, well, that’s true. I would say—I will say this. The only good thing I can say about the deal with Iran is that it brought the Arab states and Israel closer together. Benjamin Netanyahu: All I can tell you is that Israel’s position in the Arab world has changed because they no longer see Israel as their enemy, but as their ally, in their indispensable battle against the forces of militant Islam, either those led by Iran, the Shiites, or—and those led by Daesh—by ISIS, the militant Sunnis. Lesley Stahl: We hear that you have dramatically improved your relationship with Egypt. Is that correct? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Jordan? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Saudi Arabia? Benjamin Netanyahu: No comment. Lesley Stahl: I have to ask you, because it’s the most fascinating of all: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are you actually developing an anti-Iran alliance in the Middle East? Benjamin Netanyahu: Doesn’t have to be developed. It’s there anyway. So now the question is what will these highly advanced F-15s and F-35s, along with the hundreds of other cutting-edge fighters being delivered to countries in the region, be used for? Obviously they are capable of a multitude of missions, but this is a ton of new firepower to have in a situation where the need to destroy Iran’s nuclear program is a non-issue. Then again, maybe it still is an issue. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's rhetoric has continued to spark concerns about Iran's true intentions. , AP President elect Trump has been very vocal about how much he hates the Iran nuclear deal , and his emerging National Security Council is made up of people who are extremely hawkish when it comes to dealing with Iran.  With this in mind there is a real chance that at least parts of the deal could be dropped. This would lead to vastly increased tensions with Iran, and could even lead to some sort of a military engagement. This possibility is not lost on Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has long been vehemently against the Iranian nuclear deal and is seemingly very excited about Trump’s win: Benjamin Netanyahu: I think Iran didn’t rush to the bomb before there was a deal. Lesley Stahl: Really? Benjamin Netanyahu: No, because they were afraid of retribution. Lesley Stahl: But if… OK, you get rid of the deal. Then what? Benjamin Netanyahu: I think what options we have are much more than you think.  Many more.  And I’ll talk about it… Lesley Stahl: Like what? Benjamin Netanyahu: …with President Trump.  Well, I think quite a few, actually. Lesley Stahl: Because if you, you know, put sanctions back on, the other signatories to the deal won’t. Benjamin Netanyahu: There are ways, various ways of undoing it. Lesley Stahl: You have something in your mind. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, I have about five things in my mind. Lesley Stahl: Well, give me one. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I’d like to talk to the president before I talk to the 60 Minutes. Lesley Stahl: What about the intelligence that the West is getting from on-site inspections?  Apparently, most of the intelligence community thinks it’s worth keeping the deal for that intelligence. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think we have– the deal is not the critical thing of intelligence. Intelligence is a critical thing. Lesley Stahl: Which Israel is really good at. Benjamin Netanyahu: Which is… we’re very good at. And you know, with a little help… Lesley Stahl: So you don’t think we’re… Benjamin Netanyahu: …from our friends. Lesley Stahl: …gaining that much by these on-site inspections? Benjamin Netanyahu: For intelligence? Lesley Stahl: Yeah. Benjamin Netanyahu: No. So we will have to wait and see how all this pans out, but the arrival of the first stealth fighters to any country in the region, along with Saudi Arabia’s souped-up Eagles, certainly adds to the lethality of the two most powerful anti-Iranian states’ arsenals. This is something that won’t go unnoticed by the powers that be in Tehran.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Mad Foxes Take Us to the Middle East in Their P-8 Poseidons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The P-8 Poseidon is not only a big success within the US Navy, but it is also becoming a serious export success. In spite of increasing foreign competition, Boeing has secured orders from India, Australia , the UK and now Norway has ordered the jet . This is pretty remarkable considering these aircraft are definitely on the high-end of maritime patrol aircraft spectrum price-wise, but the customer gets a lot of bang for their buck. Sure the P-8 is a very capable maritime patrol aircraft, used for sea control, surface surveillance, search and rescue, anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare, but it can also provide electronic intelligence and communications intelligence gathering capabilities. Additionally, seeing how the Poseidon can carry large to small weapons on its wing hardpoints and in its weapons bay , it could also be adapted for other kinetic roles, such as a cruise missile carrier or even as an overland surveillance and precision strike asset. Other more shadowy high-end capabilities are also developed or in development for the jet. These includes being able to carry the super-capable, canoe-like Littoral Surveillance Radar System and an exotic communications node pod like the one seen here to name a couple. Because of the P-8’s open-architecture computer system design and user interfaces, new capabilities can easily be added to the type in the decades to come. For countries who either have a lot of water to keep an eye on, or have deep pockets, the Navy’s MQ-4C Triton version of the Q-4 Global Hawk was built to work as a team with P-8. This dynamic duo drastically increasing the reach and fidelity of a military’s maritime surveillance capabilities, and does so in a highly persistent nature. The Mad Foxes out of NAS Jacksonville, Florida, are blazing the way for the P-8 community by executing deployments to new area of operation for the jet, each with their own unique challenges. , VP-5 Even with all this development and export success, the P-8 is still very much a new frontier for squadrons who fly it, and VP-5, the Mad Foxes, have pioneered a lot of that frontier. In 2014 they were the first unit to take the P-8 to the vastness of the increasingly volatile eastern Pacific and Southeast Asia regions. There they did everything from challenge China’s claimed territory in the South China Sea to searching for MH370 . They even found a bunch of castaways on a deserted island . The deployment was a massive success to say the least. Last year the Mad Foxes were tasked with blazing yet another trail for the burgeoning Poseidon community—taking the P-8 to Middle East, including the traffic packed and tense waters of the Persian Gulf. Putting the P-8 to test in some of the most complex littoral waters on the planet was just another growth milestone for aircraft and its crews. And just like VP-5 did for the type’s inaugural tour to Asia, they made an awesome video to commemorate the Poseidon’s first time in “the sand box.” With any luck we will have one of the Mad Foxes join us for an in-depth interview all about what the P-8 can do and how its crews, many of which came from t he venerable P-3C Orion , are taking to their new mount. Last time we talked with an experienced maritime patrol pilot who had flown both types, it was clear that there was some disagreement as to how the aircraft would be used—as a traditional maritime patrol aircraft as it was intended or as a much more versatile “sensor and weapons truck” that can take on additional non-traditional roles. It will be interesting to find out where this debate sits after a couple years of P-8 operations abroad.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 25, 2017",China May Have Began Arming Its Man-Made Islands in the South China Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For months, analysts have been watching the development of hexagon-shaped concrete structures being built on China’s island outposts in the South China Sea. Now one prominent think tank says that new satellite imagery shows these fortress-like turrets are being armed with defenses. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) has obtained satellite imagery dated mid to late November that they says shows China’s man-made islands have been armed with close-in weapon systems and cannons. These defensive weapons have been installed on roughly 30 foot wide platforms set atop clusters of relatively complex hexagonal concrete towers. They are often built near, or as part of, a radar system. AMTI identified both deck-gun like weapons as well as close-in weapon systems (CIWS) in their reports You can check out the images and AMTI’s full report here. Although the images aren’t clear, it appears that some sort of gun system has been installed on some of these structures, although the CIWS claims are less conclusive. Arming these turrets with both systems does make sense, since they’ve long been thought to have been some sort of weapons and sensor platforms, and their elevated position would give these types of weapons an effective line-of-sight for engaging aircraft, low-flying cruise missiles, and nearby vessels. Some of these structures are far more elaborate than others, especially the ones on islands with major airfields like this one on Subi Reef. , Photo DigitalGlobe via Getty Images Exactly what type of guns and CIWS systems have been installed—and what type of fire control system and sensors they use to engage targets—remains unclear. That they exist on multiple islands and in similar configurations adds credence to the report. Deploying such a system en-masse is far more cost effective than using various systems in various configurations on multiple islands. Obviously, logistics is a key challenge for these outposts , so standardizing their defenses makes sense. Still, these are just close-in defenses if they do in fact exist. We have yet to see evidence of surface-to-air missile systems deployed to any of China’s islands in the Spratly Archipelago, although they have popped up far to the north , on Woody Island. However, there are reports that US intelligence is tracking China’s version of the SA-21 (S-400) air defense system that looks like it is being prepared to be shipped from the southern Chinese port of Jieyang. If the system showed up on say Fiery Cross Reef , China’s largest man-made island in the Spratlys, it would be a game changer for the region’s strategic balance. November 10th image showing the massive amount of development on Fiery Cross Reef. , Photo DigitalGlobe via Getty Images In the meantime, Vietnam has armed some of its islands in the South China Sea with heavy weaponry—which is capable of directly threatening China’s own man-made islands. The Israeli-built EXTRA rocket system , somewhat similar to the American HiMARS system , has roughly a 90-mile range and is highly accurate, using GPS and INS to arrive on target. Being capable of carrying a 275 pound warhead or hundreds of submunitions, these rockets could crater China’s runways, especially the large ones on Fiery Cross Reef and Mischief Reef, as well as lay waste to any aircraft sitting on their dispersals. With this threat in mind, China will likely field a counter-mortar, artillery and rocket system (C-RAM) as well as eventually an advanced surface-to-air missile system capable of taking out short-range ballistic missiles. It is also worth noting that Vietnam is expanding its own islands in region, including the runway on Spratly Island. China’s posturing in the South China Sea has only become more aggressive as the US has attempted to confront Beijing at least on some level, via freedom of navigation exercises near the islands and political overtures. Just last week, China flew H-6 heavy bombers into the region as a major play likely aimed at reminding the President elect what they are capable of. An H-6 bomber patrols near the Spratly Islands. , AP With US-Chinese relations entering unknown territory under the new Trump administration, it is likely China will only increase its push to finish its island redoubts in the South China Sea, and arm them not just with air-defense and short-range surface defense weapons, but also long-range anti-ship missiles. The big play for China has always been the creation of a near seamless anti-access/area-denial bubble covering their claims on the near entirety of the South China Sea. If AMTI’s analysis proves accurate, they are one major step closer to achieving that goal—and heavier weapons, such as the SA-21, are very likely to arrive soon.

A fellow defense writer, Mike Yeo, identified the main gun in the picture at the top of the post as likely a 76mm deck gun found on PLAN surface combatants. Looks pretty accurate.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Watch This Crazy Russian Trailer Drop Huge ICBM Missiles Into Their Silos,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s most advanced operational intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the RS-24 Yars, is one massive harbinger of death and destruction. It weighs in just shy of 110,000 pounds, is 68.5 feet long, has four stages and can carry between six and ten (depending who you ask) independently targetable reentry vehicles, each sporting nuclear warheads ranging from 100 to 300 kilotons yields. The RS-24 Yars, like its predecessor that it evolved from, the Topol-M, differs from America’s land-based ICBMs in that they are deployed as both road-mobile and silo-based nuclear deterrents. Soon the Yars will even be deployed on railcars . When the RS-24 is being shaken and battered around the Russian countryside it is mounted atop a Belarusian-built MZKT-79221 16×16 heavy high mobility chassis. And although the operating environment is far less demanding when the Yars is deployed inside a fortified underground silo, it still has to get in that silo, and in doing so it has to go from horizontal to vertical. This feat occurs via a gargantuan trailer equipped with four rows of of knobby tires packed four across. The missile is transported in this trailer to the silo’s brim. Then, once the equally as brutish looking tractor pulls away, massive hydraulic rams push the ICBM into a vertical position. Once hanging in that position directly over the silo, the Yars is lowered down into its concrete cocoon. The process is impressive in just how simple it actually looks even though it clearly is not. Also, Russia’s transporter-erector system looks far more robust than the one used to convey America’s Minuteman III ICBMs , although the Minuteman III is ten feet shorter and 30,000lbs lighter. Watch the contraption in action here: The truth is Russians are great at tipping up big complex and highly explosive things that are meant to be launched into or very near space. Whereas here in America we traditionally roll our rockets out to the launch pad in an upright position, Russia tends to wait till the launch pad to tilt their rockets up into the vertical position. Regardless of if this is an efficient practice or not, it makes for some awesome examples of mechanical engineering. I mean check out what happens before every Soyuz launch: https://youtube.com/watch?v=bn7VL5jqhvY Or even better, check out the hulking transporter-erector that was recycled from the N-1 program and reused for the Energia rocket: https://youtube.com/watch?v=zx1w2dNfs1w Am I the only one who sees a Viagra commercial in all this somewhere?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35A’s first flight occurred on December 15th, 2006—ten years to this very day. The first flight of the X-35 concept demonstrator aircraft took place over six years prior to that, on October 24th, 2000, with the Joint Strike Fighter/Joint Advanced Strike Technology initiative kicking off seven years before that in 1993—over 23 years ago. We all know how the Joint Strike Fighter program shattered its budget and elongated its development schedule by many years, and more delays and more money than planned will still likely be needed to complete the aircraft in a configuration that is even near what was promised. But putting that aside, let’s reflect on just how long of a development period this was, because the F-35 is not alone . The Pentagon has become all too comfortable procuring weapon systems that take far too long to bring to fruition. Oversight from Congress has also come complacent despite grandstanding but ultimately hollow rhetoric by its members. The system is broken, and if the US wants to keep its supremacy on the battlefields of the future, it needs to change. In comparison, roughly: It took American just under 8 years from putting its first citizen in space to walking on the moon World War I and World War II combined were fought in roughly the same amount of time The Panama canal was built using turn of the century equipment in about ten years It was ten years between the first flight of the cutting-edge piston-powered Lockheed Constellation and the first flight of the also cutting-edge jet powered 707 A Lockheed engineer who had a child in 6th grade when the F-35A first flew would be attending that child’s college graduation this year This was probably what your mobile phone looked like in you had a few bucks back 2006: Peterwhy/wikicommons Even taking into consideration the recent comments from the incoming Trump Administration , the F-35 is almost certainly here to stay. But we can use the program as an example of how not to procure weapon systems in the future. Other alternatives exist, especially for combat aircraft, that can break the mold of how we have done things in the past. 25-30 year development cycles, even after building on major technology investments that came right before it ( see the F-22 ) is not only unacceptable but is especially unsustainable . Above all else, our increasingly adaptable potential enemies will be better off if we keep continuing down this road. F-35’s first flight on December 15th, 2006 at Lockheed’s Fort Work plant: The hard truth is that although there has been progress , the F-35 remains troubled and is slipping further behind schedule and probably won’t be what it was really envisioned to be until the better part of yet another decade passes. And even then, “affordable” is unlikely to be one of its traits.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 20, 2018",The Mysterious C-130 Circling Manhattan on Tuesday Was Not Doing “Standard Training”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New Yorkers saw an interesting visitor in the tightly controlled skies over Manhattan on Tuesday. Contacts of mine who work in the area, many of which are journos, started tweeting about a C-130 making rounds over Midtown at fairly low level. I quickly ID’d the aircraft and where it came—an HC-130 from the 106th Rescue Wing—from by the pictures I was seeing and by its telltale call sign identifier, “King 22.” Military Plane & Blackhawk Helicopters Mysteriously Circle Midtown Manhattan – 3: https://t.co/xRzXmQJ3gK via @YouTube — Ryan Hemphill (@RyanHemphillNYC) December 14, 2016 The King callsign is used pretty much exclusively by the combat search and rescue (CSAR) Hercules community. The moniker has deep roots dating back to Vietnam, and aligns with the name of CSAR Hercules crews’ mounts—the HC-130P/N Combat King or the newer HC-130J Combat King II. HC-130N in flight. , USAF These aircraft are capable of a host of missions—long-range transport into austere fields, making airdrops, acting as refueling points on the ground, aerial tanking, and serving as medevac and disaster relief platforms, just to name a few. Yet their core mission is low-level, nighttime interdictions into enemy territory to support combat search and rescue operations. Often times, this means refueling HH-60G Pave Hawks helicopters filled with PJs along the way. The HC-130, with its special communications and surveillance suite THAT includes a FLIR and satellite links, can also act as an airborne command post and provide communications relay and overwatch functions for search and rescue and special operations missions. The Combat Kings, and the Pave Hawks that often work alongside them as a team, are all about getting pararescuemen—often heavily armed—onto the scene, even under high-threat combat conditions, and plucking downed pilots and other key individuals out of harm’s way before the enemy can snatch them. They can also provide life-saving medical treatment to their “customers” while in the air and on the ground. Think of it as the world’s ultimate emergency evacuation service. And this is where we come back to that strange display over Midtown on Tuesday. First off, the airspace over New York has been tightly controlled following 9/11. Larger aircraft buzzing the skies over the city, even on official business, is something that is normally avoided. (Case in point: the public outcry that followed a photo shoot of Air Force One flying over the city in 2009 .) There is even a ban on helicopters landing on helipads atop buildings, leaving the city with only the heliports at Wall Street, East 30th Street, and West 30th Street. The visual flight corridors that do exist over the Hudson have become more restrictive in recent years, There is even a weekend ban on helicopter operations in and out of the city— one that Mayor Bloomberg got caught breaking. Airplanes can fly over Manhattan, but at higher altitudes (above 7,000 feet)—or in some cases, 1,000 feet above the tallest object beneath the aircraft, but only with air traffic control permission and with flight following. But even this has been restricted recently, with the FAA imposing a 3,000-foot-high, two-mile wide, temporary flight restriction (TFR) over and around Trump Tower. This locks down the low-altitude airspace over the heart of Manhattan above the Hudson River on both sides on the city. So with all this in mind, it’s not as if C-130s and Pave Hawk helicopters just routinely fly low-level patterns over this most sensitive of airspace on a regular basis, and especially not on a random Tuesday afternoon. What’s more, they don’t do this specifically over the airspace that has been closed following Trump being elected President . The track of the HC-130’s flightpath over the city is telling to say the least. in that it stays perfectly within this locked-down portion of airspace—and is almost centered directly on Trump Tower. Seeing multiple reports of a USAF C-130 and several Black Hawk helicopters circling low (3,000 feet) over Manhattan. No, that is not normal pic.twitter.com/DaFByrAX3O — Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) December 13, 2016 And here's the statement from the FAA pic.twitter.com/yYbFYU5cEY — Mary Ann Georgantopoulos (@marygeorgant) December 13, 2016 So what were these aircraft doing? Well we can’t be certain, but we can take an educated guess. They belong to the 106th Rescue Wing based out of the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base, which is co-located at Westhampton Municipal Airport, just 65 miles east of Manhattan. This means they would be one of the first assets on the scene during an emergency or disaster in New York. And considering their mission, there are few better outfits around to have swoop in and extract key people from America’s most dense concrete jungle should the need arise. For better or worse, Trump Tower will remain not just a target but a seat of power for the First Family for years to come. Securing the building, at least as much as it can be secured, is costing the city massive amounts of money each day . In the event President Trump and his family need to be evacuated from Manhattan, the PJs and the 106th Rescue Wing have almost certainly been tapped to be the go-to ones to assist the Secret Service in making that happen. As such, they need to become intimately familiar with challenges presented by the pinpointed landing zones and airspace directly over the center of city. They also need to train at working together as a team in this environment, with the HC-130 working as overwatch and command and control, and the HH-60Gs swooping in to grab their targets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gLWfz6fepOQ So what New Yorkers likely saw on Tuesday was just that: unique training to prepare the 106th’s aviators for a very demanding and high-priority task. And this type of mission is nothing new for the military. Around Washington D.C., a massive fleet of military helicopters from multiple units all train to extract key power players, and in some cases their families, from the Capitol in the event of an emergency. (You can read all about these units, their gear, and their mission in this past feature of mine. ) Even Washington D.C., with its extremely tight airspace restrictions, opens up its skies to this training occasionally. When Donald Trump became the 45th president-elect of the United States, he and his family became a monumental security risk. The fact that they live and work in the heart of midtown Manhattan, with their residence and workplace being a prominent building (with their name emblazoned on it, no less) vastly complicates the situation. There is no doubt that the highly-trained Secret Service, the U.S. military, and the NYPD, along with other agencies, have began working together to mitigate this risk. These aircraft were just another piece of that intricate and expanding puzzle.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We saw the fall of Aleppo coming for months and it was just as brutally executed as we thought it would be. The question of the fallout Russia will experience for involving itself in such a brutal operation—and the Syrian conflict in general—has also become more ominous in recent weeks as violence has ratcheted up. We’ve already heard the international condemnations . Now it appears the repercussions have turned deadly, as Russia’s ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, was shot dead on camera by a man yelling “we die in Aleppo, you die here!” Ambassador Andrey Karlov shortly before his death with his killer seen behind him., AP The horrific moment occurred while the ambassador was speaking at an art gallery in the Turkish capital of Ankara. A ranting man in a suit pulled a pistol and shot the Ambassador from behind. Security forces quickly counter-attacked and killed the assailant, but he made his message clear before being taken down in a barrage of gunfire. Warning—this is graphic content: https://youtube.com/watch?v=-KZMPsZjZLE What comes to many people’s minds when a high-ranking official is killed in such a volatile region is if they’ve just witnessed a “Franz Ferdinand” moment —one that could set tensions aflame and plunge a region—even a hemisphere into war. The answer in this case is likely no. Russia and Turkey have been down a similar road recently. Last year, among increasing rhetoric between Turkey and Russia, Turkish F-16s shot down a Russian Su-24 f or crossing over the Syrian-Turkish border for mere seconds. One pilot died in the shoot down, with his corpse being displayed on social media, the other lived to tell the story . This event plunged Turkish-Russian relations into the abyss, with tense posturing by both sides as they felt each other out. In the end it didn’t lead far. Diplomatic relations were badly strained, some trade and travel was halted and accusations flew back and forth, but that was about it. The scene shortly after the gunman killed the ambassador. , Stringer/Getty Images In the seven or so months that followed, Russian-Turkish relations slowly improved, but they were still nowhere near as tidy as they were prior to Russia’s direct involvement in the Syrian civil war. That all changed once again after the events of the night of July 15th, 2016 when factions within the Turkish military attempted to overthrow the Erdogan government by military coup. The coup failed in a fairly miserable fashion, but the aftermath is still sending geopolitical shockwaves. Massive crackdowns throughout the Turkish government on perceived political opposition followed and Erdogan’s grip on power dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the ever-more totalitarian Erdogan began distancing himself from his NATO allies, and primarily the US, while cozying up closer to Russia. Erdogan’s accusation that the coup attempt largely stemmed from an exiled Turkish cleric living in the US, and America’s unwillingness to extradite him to Turkey, only increased US-Turkish volatility. Following the coup, Turkey dived dramatically into the Syrian conflict with a land offensive and stepped up attacks on Kurdish groups in Northern Syria—many of which the US back directly with expertise and material in the fight against ISIS. Today, US-Turkish ties remain strained , and there have been direct calls to have the US remove its tactical nuclear arsenal from the country. With this recent history in mind, what is more likely to happen following this horrific assassination is that both Erdogan and Putin will use this death to consolidate support for their actions in Syria—though Putin may have a tougher time of it than Erdogan. The story continues to unfold quickly, and the ID of the assassin is likely to be a big fulcrum that will help dictate the official responses from both Turkey and Russia. The gunman standing over his victim. , AP We will keep this page updated throughout the day as more info becomes available. Update: 12:50pm PST- Al Aribya has posted the identity of the attacker, stating : “The gunman was a policeman who was off duty entered the hall using a policeman ID, while journalists who were present thought he was one of the ambassador’s personal bodyguard. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in in video message that the attacker was Mevlut Mert Aydintas, who worked for Ankara riot police for over two years.” He also quoted Osama Bin Laden before being shot dead stating “you will not have security, even in your dreams until we live it in reality in our countries.” Three other people were injured in the attack and counterattack. Update: 2:32pm PST- President Putin has remarked on the shooting, stating : “A crime has been committed and it was without doubt a provocation aimed at spoiling the normalization of Russo-Turkish relations and spoiling the Syrian peace process which is being actively pushed by Russia, Turkey, Iran and others… There can only be one response— stepping up the fight against terrorism. The bandits will feel this happening.” Putin, who was a personal friend of the slain ambassador, also called for  an increase in security at diplomatic facilities abroad and told his intelligence forces that “We must know who directed the killer’s hand.” Also it looks like Turkey will blame exiled  Fethullah Gulen for the shooting although representatives for Gulen have strongly condemned it. Update: 4:21pm PST- President Erdogan said the following about the attack: “Both Turkey and Russia have the will not to be deceived by this provocation… I believe this is an attack on Turkey, the Turkish state and the Turkish people, and also a clear provocation to Turkish-Russian relations. I am sure our Russian friends also see this fact.” Erdogan continued, “Our relations with Russia are significant… I am calling on those who aim to destroy our relations: You are waiting in vain. You will never reach your goals.” Both Russia and Turkey have labeled the incident as an act of terrorism.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",China Gives Drone Back—But Why Did They Grab It In The First Place?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last Thursday the USNS Bowditch (T-AGS-62) , a non-combatant US naval research vessel, was recovering two low-buoyancy underwater gliders while the Chinese Dalang III class rescue and salvage ship Nan-Jiu was shadowing them. Crew from the Nan-Jiu launched a small boat, sped up to one of the little drones and plucked one out of the water. The Bowditch’s crew watched the abduction go down in plain sight. The incident occurred about 50 miles west of the Philippines in the tense waters of the South China Sea. The official statement from the Pentagon made last Friday following the incident reads: “Using appropriate government-to-government channels, the Department of Defense has called upon China to immediately return an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) that China unlawfully seized on Dec. 15 in the South China Sea while it was being recovered by a U.S. Navy oceanographic survey ship. The USNS Bowditch (T-AGS 62) and the UUV — an unclassified “ocean glider” system used around the world to gather military oceanographic data such as salinity, water temperature, and sound speed – were conducting routine operations in accordance with international law about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay, Philippines, when a Chinese Navy PRC DALANG III -Class ship (ASR-510) launched a small boat and retrieved the UUV. Bowditch made contact with the PRC Navy ship via bridge-to-bridge radio to request the return of the UUV. The radio contact was acknowledged by the PRC Navy ship, but the request was ignored.  The UUV is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States. We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law.” The ocean research vessel USNS Bowditch. , USN These little (about six feet in length) reconfigurable drones are not classified technology, far from it in fact. They serve with government agencies and universities around the globe and are not super high-tech as far as unmanned underwater vehicles go by any means. Gliders like Teledyne Marine’s Slocom —which is what the Navy’s Littoral Battlespace Sensing-Glider (LBS-G) is based on—move through the water without traditional propulsion. Instead, they utilize shifting internal ballast, along with their wings to provide lift, porpoising up and down through the depths. They are semi-autonomous and can carry various payloads both internally and externally. Persistence is one of their great advantages as they can stay active in an area for months at a time while being monitored and controlled by small teams using desktop computer interfaces and commercial communications satellites or line-of-sight data-links Defense Industry Daily describes how the Slocom works: “Teledyne’s glider uses changes in buoyancy to propel itself through the ocean. Instead of using mechanical means to change that buoyancy, however, it mostly relies on the ocean’s own temperature and pressure changes. To sink, a valve allows oil from a flexible bladder on the outside to flow in, lowering volume but keeping mass constant. The glider sinks. Liquid wax inside internal tubes shrinks and solidifies as it descends into colder waters, letting oil in. The glider will continue descending to about 5,000 feet, then another internal storage tank filled with oil and nitrogen at 3,000 psi pressure is used to force oil back into the external bladder. As the now-buoyant glider heads toward the surface, its wings provide lift and forward motion, while sensors in the nose gather oceanographic data. The glider will eventually surface about 5 km/ 2.75 miles away, where surface water temperatures of about 80F/ 27C liquefy the wax again. Liquids can’t really be compressed, so the liquid wax forces the oil and nitrogen back into the storage tank, resetting the gas “spring” for use in the next cycle. At the surface, the glider reports its position, transmits data via satellite, and receives any sent commands. That propulsion system means the glider can be at sea for weeks at a time, allowing subsurface sampling on a regional scale. In 2009, a Slocum Glider managed to cross the Atlantic in 223 days” Technicians work on a Slocum glider used by the US Navy., USN Underwater gliders are used primarily for oceanic research, such as mapping water temperatures, listening for marine life, measuring depths, currents, salinity and the like. That’s not to say that the scientific products they create aren’t used to aid in submarine, anti-submarine, amphibious or irregular warfare operations. Just knowing what these variables are at any given time can greatly enhance the effectiveness of a nearby ship or submarine’s sonar. It also doesn’t take much imagination to realize that similar systems could be used to do things like listen for submarines and record the audio signatures of different vessels within a specific geographical area. A slide detailing the Littoral Battlefield Surveillance Glider program, DoD The truth is, China has a history with being very curious—even outright suspicious—of these types of strange underwater vehicles that have popped up from time to time. In 2015 I broke the story in the US about a puzzling cylindrical mechanized contraption hauled up by a Chinese fisherman in a very sensitive maritime area. It made major news in China and seemed to spook the Chinese military significantly. With this in mind, being able to pluck anything similar out of the water from a known source probably is a pretty high-priority act for the PLAN. Especially if said thing was being deployed in highly disputed waters where you are massively invested militarily. Now doing so right in front of the crew that launched it is tacky and may have violated international maritime law, but then again it’s the South China Sea, a place where China has totally blown off the will of international governing bodies. On Saturday, China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said the following about the incident : “An unidentified device was discovered by a lifeboat of the Chinese Navy in waters of the South China Sea. In order to prevent this device from posing danger to the safe navigation of passing ships and personnel, the Chinese side checked and verified the device in a professional and responsible attitude. After identifying the device as a UUV from the US, the Chinese side decided to hand it over to the US side in an appropriate manner. It is learnt that the two sides are in smooth communication through the military-to-military channel, which will definitely lead to a proper settlement of this issue.” China also noted how the American media was playing up the incident, saying that “The U.S. side’s unilateral move to dramatize the issue in the process is inappropriate, and not conductive to its settlement.” It is true, the story dominated headlines on Friday and throughout the weekend, with loads of inaccurate information and hyperbole being delved out by major outlets. President-elect Trump even commented on it, not once but twice: Trump’s first tweet was inaccurate, as China had not taken the drone back to the mainland. Trump’s second tweet on Saturday held a very different tone: Although this all may have been somewhat unprecedented, it’s not like this is the first time American military hardware operating in international territory has fallen into Chinese hands . The snatching of maritime drones will become a common occurrence in the decades to come as the world’s seas become increasingly populated by unmanned systems. It should serve as a case study for emerging unmanned surface vehicle initiatives, especially far more complex and sensitive ones like DAPRA’s ACTUV . Now, a few days after being taken and just as China promised, the drone has been returned to the US Navy. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Mustin rendezvoused with the same Chinese salvage and rescue vessel that grabbed the drone on Friday and it was peacefully handed over. The DoD says that they will continue to investigate the incident and will take further diplomatic actions if necessary, although that won’t likely happen. It remains unclear if the ocean glider was manipulated in any way while aboard the Chinese vessel, but it should be safe to assume that it was. Regardless, you can be pretty certain the US Navy will be extra careful when it comes to choosing which computer they will plug into the glider’s brains now that it’s back in their custody. So why did China snatch the drone in the first place? Some say they wanted to send a message to President-elect Trump, following his comments on Taiwan . Although this could have been a factor, I doubt it was the primary reasoning behind the operation. It’s more likely that China is very suspicious of these vehicles and wanted to check out a functioning specimen in the configuration being used by the US Navy in that highly contested area of the world. When the right opportunity presented itself, they did just that. Finding out exactly what the payloads on these devices are capable of would be highly valuable intelligence for the PLAN. And let’s face it, nobody is going to go to war over losing one of these drones for a few days. The US didn’t even act kinetically when a highly classified unmanned stealth flying wing, the RQ-170 Sentinel, dropped into Iranian hands in late 2011. Nor did they bomb the intact tail of the even more classified stealth Black Hawk helicopter that landed on the wrong side of Osama Bin Laden’s compound wall in Pakistan out of fear of killing civilians. The Chinese know this all too well, and factor in historical reactions carefully when making a play like this. The fact that the USNS Bowditch is an unarmed deployment vessel for the gliders made them an especially ripe target for the picking. The Teledyne Slocum G2 seen underwater., Teledyne As for the US Navy using these simple unmanned underwater vehicles in a direct military role, well, they’ve been launching them from submerged nuclear submarines for over a decade and are now deploying them from destroyers as well. If these quiet, ultra-long endurance gliders can acoustically detect schools of fish and whales in a high-fidelity acoustic manner, they are also likely able to detect naval assets—including submarines prowling far below the surface. The best part about using commercially available hardware like this is that high-tech classified gear doesn’t have to be put at risk of capture. As such, they represent an inherently low-risk and high reward proposition. In fact, when it comes to military hardware, these drones aren’t even that expensive—costing less than a couple hundred thousands dollars each. And yes, mapping the movements of Chinese submarines 50 miles off Subic Bay in the South China Sea would represent very valuable data, even if it was “inadvertently gained” by an underwater glider while on a “scientific mission.” On a larger scale, deploying small groups of these gliders to strategic maritime choke points, including those in the South China Sea , could provide the Navy with very cost effective, persistent and low risk intelligence on the comings and goings of local sea traffic—even on the type that operates deep below the surface and under thermocline layers . Think of it as a more adaptable, focused, less expensive, and highly deployable mini-SOSUS network . Whether or not this is actually being done, and by what underwater vehicles and on what scale remains unclear, but wouldn’t the Navy be stupid not to employ such a strategy? Still, even just having these gliders execute their disclosed mission they are improving US Navy capabilities—especially their sonar sensing abilities—in the region. So yeah, if you were Chinese, you would be very suspicious of these things too, although that still doesn’t justify the act.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At 5:23pm local time, an Aerosucre Boeing 727-200F cargo jet with six crew aboard did not get off the ground as planned during its takeoff from Puerto Carreño Airport in Colombia. The 727, departing for Bogota, overran the runway at high-speed and plowed through a fence, then across a field at a nose-high attitude before struggling into the air under ground effect. Moments later, the 41-year-old airliner tumbled wing-down into a field roughly ten miles from the airport. Reports are sketchy but it seems that one of the crew miraculously survived the crash. Weather conditions at Puerto Carreño Airport around the time of the crash included scattered clouds, winds out of the east at eight knots, and 87 degrees. The jet may have been taking off with a tailwind and elevated ambient temperatures affect an aircraft’s takeoff performance. Dramatic videos showing different angles of the mishap surfaced just hours after the crash: https://youtube.com/watch?v=eb6YIZQw7EA It’s is not clear why so many cameras were pointing at the jet during its departure. Flightaware only shows Embraer 170 regional jets as frequenting the airport’s relatively short 5,900 foot asphalt strip, but there are videos of other aircraft stopping there, including larger 737s and 727s. In fact, one video taken back in October shows what is likely the exact same jet (Aerosucre is thought to have only one operational 727) nearly suffering the same fate as yesterday’s doomed flight. It seems the jet was operating at the extreme edge of its envelope—or beyond it, in the case of yesterday’s crash. With no margin for contingencies, even small non-technical issues such as changing atmospheric conditions or minor miscalculations in weight and balance and air density could prove deadly during a short-field departure. The aircraft involved was delivered to Air Jamaica in 1975 and served with the airline for 22 years before being converted into a freighter. It went on to serve with various US cargo carriers before joining Aerosucre’s fleet in 2008. Another Aerosucre 727 freighter crashed in Bogota in 2006 after hitting a TV tower while on approach to land in bad weather, killing six onboard. An Aerosucre 727 seen in 2011., Alec Wilson/wikicommons The Boeing 727 is an incredibly versatile aircraft. It was designed to be able to operate from shorter runways, though weight restrictions increase as the available runway length decreases. The CIA used the “three holer” for cargo drops , and a dozen earlier models were built for Mexicana Airlines with JATO capability . Today the aging jet  can find itself operating under some pretty abominable conditions around the globe—ones that push these old airliners beyond their design limits. Some third world operators are turning these aircraft essentially into bush jets and flying them from semi-improved or downright rough airstrips under very austere conditions. While some jet airliners can fly from short gravel or even hard-packed dirt strips safely under some circumstances, special training, equipment, maintenance, operating procedures and very close attention to detail are needed to make sure it happens safely. Some carriers have excelled in this kind of work , other operators that specialize in it would likely never be allowed to fly in developed countries. It’s risky work, where cheap used-up old airliners seem somewhat expendable, and that doesn’t bode well for the people flying them. We will have to wait and see exactly what caused this crash. Maybe there was a systemic pattern of pushing the envelope when it comes to safety at Aerosucre, or maybe a technical issue struck the plane at the worst possible time. It could have been a mixture of the two, or something different altogether. At least with so much quality video evidence, investigators might have an easier time getting to the bottom of this tragedy.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 27, 2017",Trump Tells Boeing To Price A Comparable F/A-18 To The F-35—There Isn’t One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Commander-in-Chief to be Trump is back at it again. He has taken plunge into the Pentagon procurement wars and the heads of Boeing and Lockheed—along with generals and admirals in tow—have visited his Florida estate to kiss the ring and pitch their wares . Now he’s tweeted that he is having Boeing price out a “comparable” F/A-18 Super Hornet to the F-35 because of the latter’s cost and developmental overruns. The only problem is that there is no Super Hornet comparable to the F-35, and there never will be. First off, there is a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F-35, something the Super Hornet family cannot offer. Additionally, Boeing has quietly played with the idea of a very stealthy Hornet adaptation, most likely an unmanned one, but it didn’t seem to go anywhere. Even if the F-35 program were cancelled—which has become nearly unthinkable—major force structure investments in other platforms would be necessary to have the proper capabilities mix. Otherwise there will be a massive capabilities gap left behind by the already 20+ year old Joint Strike Fighter program For instance, if the F-35 were no more, the USAF would have to put the F-22 back into production , purchase more F-16s and possibly F-15s. Heavier investments in advanced Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs) and long-range strike, namely the B-21 Raider , would also need to go along with it. This is precisely the force structure I have pushed for many years. Likewise for the Navy (which is the service that Trump might be talking about exclusively here) more Super Hornets and Growlers would be a relevant choice, but they would need to be paired with substantial investment into fast-tracking navalized UCAVs into the inventory and larger purchases of standoff munitions—something I have proposed for many years. The Marine Corps is a different animal altogether. Their rapidly aging legacy Hornet fleet could be, and should have been, replaced with Super Hornets. Instead they opted to hold out for an all F-35 force made up mainly of B models and a smaller number of C models. Cancel the F-35 and the aged AV-8B Harrier would continue to serve indefinitely as the only short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) tactical jet alternative to the F-35B. Super Hornet Advanced. , Boeing The Marines AV-8Bs can continue to fly for a couple more decades with the help of the UK’s GR7/9 Harrier fleet, bought for parts by the USMC for pennies on the dollar . Still, axing the F-35B and keeping the A and C model would be foolish. The A and C models pay for the F-35B’s STOVL capabilities in a compromised design ( you can read all about this odd situation here ). By eliminating the type and keeping the others, the US armed forces will never benefit from this design sacrifice. In fact, the F-35B is the most relevant of all F-35 variants, at least to the US. It is tough to tell from a tweet what exactly Trump is talking about here, and maybe it’s just a bargaining ploy. But if the President-elect has been informed that the Super Hornet alone, even in its most advanced conceptual configuration , is capable of replacing the F-35, he is sorely and alarmingly wrong. The situation is far more complex than that, but with the right overall high-low capability mix strategy, a more flexible, affordable and capable air combat capability can be had without the F-35, or at least with far fewer of them than the 2500 or so that the US currently plans on buying.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 11, 2016","Trump’s Nuclear Arms Race Is a Terrible Idea, but Modernization is Overdue","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yes, the President elect says many confounding things , especially on social media, and his priorities can
 seem far out of whack ; but that doesn’t mean everything he says is wrong. Case in point: Yesterday’s tweet about nuclear weapons. Trump has dived into the technological portfolio of the Pentagon in recent days. And yes, if you just follow the President-elect on Twitter he seems like a kid in Willy Wonka’s factory—more in awe of things he never knew existed than someone already in the know on these topics. He was briefed in detail on Lockheed’s F-35 program, which he has strongly criticized (I would love to have been a fly on the wall for that sales job.) Then he proclaimed that he is shopping Boeing for an F-35 alternative , sending Lockheed stock tumbling. Boeing, too, is under Trump’s thumb on the Air Force One replacement program. Now the President Elect seems to be getting an earful about the state of America’s nuclear arsenal and the security issues surrounding it. From this, the man who famously knew nothing about the nuclear triad has concluded that we need to strengthen and expand our capabilities in this, the most deadly realm of weaponry. He is right on one aspect of the statement and wrong on another. America’s nuclear arsenal has become outdated and hard to maintain after decades of fiscal neglect. While it should be obvious that we don’t need more nuclear weapons, we certainly need to make the best of the ones we have through modernization of both the weapons themselves and their delivery systems. This is essential in maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent at a time when having that capability is becoming ever more critical to national security. Both the US and Russia have roughly 1,800 operational nuclear weapons that are ready for use, and thousands more that are retired and are awaiting disassembly. It should be the new administration’s goal to refurbish and upgrade our operational nuclear weapons and to work with Russia to destroy permanently the roughly 14,300 retired weapons as quickly as possible. Pushing for reduction in operational weapons could and should happen once the retired stockpiles have been eliminated. Minuteman Missile in its silo. , Spencer/wikicommons It would also make sense for the President-elect to look into the actual benefits of a nuclear triad, and to be open to the possibility of moving to a two-prong nuclear weapons strategy. America’s silo-based Minuteman ICBMs are in great need of a major upgrade or direct replacement. That’s one area where savings could be realized, and the money saved could be channeled to the other two legs of the nuclear triad—which include aircraft and submarine delivery platforms. If the US were to eliminate its ground-based ICBMs it could invest more heavily in the Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarine , which are being developed to replace the aging Ohio class “boomers.” Money channeled from the Minuteman program could be used to augment Columbia class numbers, decreasing its cost while providing increased patrols. It could also be used to consistently modernize the Trident II SLBM that will be carried over from the Ohio class to the Columbia class. Savings from retiring the Minuteman fleet could also allow the USAF to procure more B-21 stealth bombers and to develop a modern, survivable nuclear-tipped cruise missile. Meanwhile executing key strategic moves, such as actually basing American tactical aircraft at the airfields where tactical nukes are stored abroad , like we had in the Cold War , would be a good starting point. Having forward-deployed strike units actually train for the nuclear mission would be beneficial as well. A B-2 drops a B-61 nuclear bomb., NNSA The thing is that a lot of this is already planned for under President Obama’s $348 billion initiative to recapitalize America’s nuclear arsenal over the next decade, and that includes keeping the ground-based leg of the triad intact. In the end what we need is rationalization of our nuclear posture, not simply more of it. We have enough nuclear weapons to end human life on this planet as it is, procuring more is a fool’s errand. And if we were to help incite that nonsensical behavior by expanding our nuclear arsenal needlessly, it will just result in a massive buildup of more nuclear weapons among our enemies. With more nuclear weapons there are more chances for mistakes to be made—mistakes more costly than any of us can imagine. Also, just because Russia is doing something in the nuclear realm does not mean we need to counter tit-for-tat. With no real defense against a large nuclear weapons barrage from a peer-state actor, what’s most important is to have the arsenal that is most likely to be effective and to be survivable if it is ordered into use, not who has the largest stockpile alone. Secretary of Defense holds a nuclear missile launch controller during a tour of a boomer. , AP So Trump is half right and half wrong: We do need to strengthen our nuclear arsenal, and doing so isn’t cheap. But by carefully analysing the necessity of a nuclear triad, we may be able to save money and increase America’s nuclear deterrent effectiveness and flexibility. At the same time, Trump is very wrong. Expanding our nuclear arsenal is a massive waste of money and only invites more instability in an increasingly unstable world. Sadly, it seems that Trump really does believe in a nuclear weapons buildup, at least that’s what his recent comments to MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski indicate. If this is truly the case, we are all in for a wild, expensive and dangerous ride.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone reported on the existence of a second rendition of China’s Shenyang FC-31 Gyrfalcon stealth fighter when pictures of the design under construction surfaced during the Zhuhai Air Show in early November . Now that aircraft—which features substantial upgrades in its low observable shaping and manufacturing quality —has flown for the first time, as evidenced by the photos and video below. Not only could an operational FC-31 help fill the ranks of PLAAF medium and light fighter squadrons, but it could also be adapted for China’s emerging CATOBAR aircraft carrier program. This would give China a stealthy fighter that can project power far from the Chinese mainland. If this redesign proves fruitful, it’s all but guaranteed China will move to export the FC-31 to anyone with the cash to buy it. Many countries either can’t afford, or are not allowed to buy, the Lockheed Martin F-35 from the US. These nations could turn to China and the FC-31 to provide them with a “poor man’s” Joint Strike Fighter. Pakistan, in particular, is a very ripe candidate to join the FC-31 program early on–especially as new aircraft join the Indian Air Force’s fleet, including the PAK-FA based on Russia’s stealthy T-50 fighter. The FC-31 appeared for the first time over four years ago , and the fact that already moved from “YF” configuration to a near production configuration is telling. It shows how committed China is to developing multiple stealth fighters as part of a high-low capability mix, and to take a larger share of the fighter export market abroad. The FC-31/J-31 prototype appeared at Zhuhai in 2014 but disappeared for some time thereafter, with some analysts saying the program was dead. Now it is reemerging in a vastly upgraded form., AP The FC-31 is one of three light to medium-weight stealthy fighters being developed indigenously in the region— Japan and Korea are the other two countries taking on such endeavours, and both are also F-35 customers. They will likely end up with designs that will be similar to what the F-35 would have been like without the F-35B’s damning STOVL requirements that mired the jet’s design and specifically its aerodynamics. How stealthy an airframe and how advanced China’s FC-31’s sensor fusion and avionics suite will be is unknown. But even an 70% solution alternative to the F-35 that costs 40% of Lockheed Martin’s price is an enticing proposition, as quantity has a quality all its own.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 15, 2016",The Fight For Mosul Grinds to a Bloody Crawl,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The battle to retake Mosul is just as horrific as some of us feared it would be . A suicidal enemy that has had years to fortify themselves within an incredibly complex urban combat environment still teeming with civilians has left Iraqi forces with a much longer and more intensive fight than their commanders initially predicted. In recent weeks the fight has become an increasingly bogged-down affair that is hinging on a questionable strategy and countless unknowns. Meanwhile, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding at a rapid rate, and the question of what comes after the city is finally liberated looms as fears of a civil war grow. On top of all this, an even more unpredictable threat lays just a few dozen miles north of the embattled city—one that could cause destruction more sudden than a nuclear weapon. From a running start to hitting a wall Amid much media fanfare the military offensive to liberate Mosul—ISIS’s last major stronghold in Iraq—began on October 16th. Following a blitz into the eastern neighborhoods of the city, Iraq’s most capable fighting forces soon came under almost constant suicide bomber, sniper, mortar, machine gun, and homemade drone attacks. Maybe one of the best accounts from an embedded reporter on what combat looked like during the early days of the offensive came from CNN’s Arwa Damon and Brice Laine. Titled “28 Hours In Hell,” it gives a glimpse of the horrific circumstances forces entering the city to take on ISIS were up against. Now, 45 days after that report was filed, the Iraqi military’s push into the city has stalled. With troops in constant combat for weeks at a time, and suffering undisclosed but severe casualties, Mosul is turning out to be the epic battle of attrition may of us feared it would be. An Iraqi soldier fires at one of ISIS's improvised explosive drones. , AP After nearly two and a half months of fighting, some of the 38 districts in eastern Mosul that have been declared liberated remain in flux and Iraqi military advances have become far fewer. Areas that are said to be under Iraqi military control quickly become battlegrounds once again, with gunfights and suicide bombers erupting seemingly out of nowhere. ISIS also tends to mortar liberated areas near the front lines, meaning that although the Islamic State may no longer hold the ground definitely, they still rain terror down on those who do. Too heavy a burden The brunt of the frontline fighting in Mosul has fallen on the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Forces’ (CTFs) shoulders, and particularly those of Iraq’s 1st Special Operations Brigade, also known famously as the “Golden Division.” Currently the Iraqi military’s strategy to win back the city seems to place these elite units, which are made up of less than 10,000 soldiers in total, almost solely along the leading edge of the fight. Ideally, the CTFs are extending the Iraqi government’s zone of control in Mosul, while turning over recaptured territory to other less capable Iraqi Army and police forces to hold. But this means the relatively small group of elite and highly trained units, which were never envisioned for such a job, will be relied on to take the majority of the city, roughly 75% of which remains firmly under ISIS control. This is a drastically unrealistic demand to put on such a finite and specialized fighting force. Making things worse is that these forces cannot be regenerated quickly as losses mount as it takes far longer and much more resources to train and equip an Iraqi special forces soldier than a regular one. Some good news has come in recent days regarding the issue of liberated territory falling back into the hands of ISIS—reinforcements have arrived to help occupy the areas that are ostensibly under Iraqi government control. This should help stabilize the situation and free up front-line combat forces, namely the CTFs, to push harder into enemy-held territory. On the other hand, to have such a crisis this early in the battle is not really a good sign. What also has to be considered is that as CTF units push slowly towards the west, south and the north, the fighting is only likely to get more intense and more complex. As ISIS foot soldiers become increasingly cornered and the urban terrain gets only more perilous, these units will be under heavier fire and in harsher combat conditions than ever before. A Golden Division soldier. , AP This all prompts a series of questions, first of which is if Iraqi CTF units will be able to keep doing the brunt of the fighting for the foreseeable future. This may not be just a question of physical and mental capabilities, but one of numbers alone. Without reliable metrics on casualties, it is hard to predict how long these units can continue in their current role—especially if the fighting becomes more intense, not less. If more regular Iraqi Army units are assigned to the leading-edge of the fight than the handful that are today, they will likely suffer a much higher attrition rate than the CTF units. This puts not only the morale and the stability of the fledgling Iraqi Army in danger, but the entire operation as well. And, while CTF units have been proven to take the fight the enemy under virtually any circumstances, can Iraqi regulars be trusted to do the same? The answer to this question may partially lie in a bloody retreat by an Iraqi regular army unit, the 9th Division, that had pushed into southern Mosul to take a hospital complex in early December. Waves of suicide bombers, along with running gun battles, RPG barrages and snipers, took a heavy toll on the Iraqi Army’s assault force. At one point a CTF unit had to be retasked to rapidly aid in the the rescue of troops besieged in the complex. The operation took a high toll on the 9th Division, with dozens of injured, at least 12 dead (some sources put the number far higher), and many vehicles destroyed. Areas of the hospital were eventually bombed by coalition aircraft once ISIS had retaken it. Other plans to send more regular Iraqi Army units to attack other objectives in Southern Mosul were put on hold following the incident. Iraqi special operations team goes door-to-door in Mosul., AP With all this in mind, the Iraqi CTFs will be hard-pressed to keep up their current tempo of operations for months to come, and the idea that regular Iraqi Army units can take large parts of the city on their own without experiencing extreme losses remains a major unknown. Considering how slow progress has become, taking back Mosul from the clutches of ISIS will take many more months to accomplish. The longer it takes, the higher the risk for the Iraqi government forces, as there is a chance that the operation could implode due to the ferocity of the fight, high casualties and the resulting lack of highly motivated and highly trained front-line Iraqi fighters. Regaining momentum On December 24th, the Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani said the following about why the operation has come to a crawl: “The operations seem to be going rather slowly. There are two reasons for this. There is a concerted effort to avoid collateral damage, to avoid harming civilians during the course of the operations. The second reason is that Daesh is putting up stiff resistance.” Basically, this tells us what we already know, and none of this should be a surprise. Yet it seems that the US military and Washington have also taken serious note of the Iraqi military’s slowing progress in Mosul. Air power over the city has surged in recent days, with one US commander calling it “virtually limitless.” These include a constellation of information, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as electronic warfare aircraft aimed at jamming ISIS communications. Finally, fighters, bombers and attack helicopters are stacked high over the city at any given time awaiting targeting information. Iraqi forces surrounding a building that was just hit by an coalition air strike. , AP Yet even the potential of seemingly endless attack and surveillance power in the air is limited by its ability to be exploited or applied quickly and precisely, especially under very tight rules of engagement. Without coalition forward air controllers embedded with Iraqi units operating deep in the city, putting real-time surveillance and high capacity striking power to use is troublesome. This well known—but often unacknowledged by politicians—limitation of air power has long been the Achilles Heel of the Obama anti-ISIS policy in Iraq, but now it may be changing out of raw necessity above anything else. On Saturday, Colonel Brett G. Sylvia stated the following regarding what appears to be a loosening of restrictions on how close US troops can operate alongside their Iraqi counterparts fighting to break ISIS’s hold on the city: “We are deepening our integration with them. We are now pushing that into more of the Iraqi formations pushing forward, some formations that we haven’t partnered with in the past where we are now partnering with them.” An Iraqi security forces Humvee moving among the rubble of bombed-out buildings in Mosul., AP Although the Colonel would not specifically define how exactly these troops would be embedded, he did say that “we have never been embedded to this degree…We are embedded inside their formations.” There is a good chance this means Joint Terminal Air Controllers (ground-based forward air controllers in US military parlance) are being moved up into Mosul to help call in precision strikes. They still may not be on the “front lines” so to speak, but even a few blocks back gives them a better idea of what is going on then being outside the city altogether. This higher situational awareness will allow JTACs to make the very most of the massive aerial arsenal orbiting the city, and that could prove to be a major factor in gaining battlefield momentum once again. A growing humanitarian crisis Currently the city, which is thought to have a million civilians still living in it, has been effectively cut in two. On December 27th the last of the five bridges that spanned the Tigris River was dropped. Now small boats are the only way to cross between the western and eastern half of the metropolis. Cleaving Mosul in two will help keep ISIS fighters in the west side of the city from reinforcing positions on the east side. It will also make falling back across the river more problematic for fighters battling Iraqi security forces on the east side of the city. The downside for Iraqi forces is that it will make fighting to the eastern bank of the Tigris even more treacherous as ISIS foot soldiers will have nowhere to run. Many families have been displaced and broken apart during the Mosul offensive. , AP This also plays into the horrific humanitarian toll the battle is taking on civilians still trapped inside the city. ISIS has ruled Mosul in just about as sadistic way as possible over the past two and a half years, and this has not let up because during the fighting. Mass executions have been stepped up since the battle began and militants have been pushing civilians across the river into western Mosul. Many fled instead of following their orders for fear of being used as human shields, and countless have died doing so. ISIS is killing those civilians who do not follow their orders— shooting families trying to escape in the back or mortaring groups as they attempt to flee. Those who have made it to Iraqi forces alive have told horrific stories of the final days of living under the Islamic State, and the wounded are having a very hard time finding medical care . Scarce aid being handed out in a recently liberated neighborhood in eastern Mosul., AP The Iraqi government also seems woefully unprepared for the size of the humanitarian crisis that will continue to unfold as the battle rages on. In a wishful attempt to forestall mass displacement, the Iraqi government had told civilians to stay in their homes during the battle, but since it has slowed after months of fighting, many have no choice but to run for their lives or leave their homes due to lack of food and water. Even those in supposedly liberated areas are still being wounded and killed by sporadic fighting . This has led to throngs of Iraqi civilians, many already wary from years of ISIS occupation, with nowhere to go and the refugee camps that do exist are poorly equipped to handle the size of the migration. As a result, when the little aid that has been moved into the region is dispersed total chaos has erupted. Unequal opportunity battle As Iraqi forces continue to slog through Mosul, it may eventually be necessary to include non-Iraqi government forces more closely in the central fight to retake the city. Especially if the timeline to liberate the city continues to unravel—and it almost certainly will. Originally Iraqi officials made laughable statements about how fast they would take the city back. But now the realization of just how hard a fight they have on their hands is setting in. Three more months is the timeline that was put forward just yesterday by Iraq’s prime minister , but this too is likely very wishful thinking. Iraqi special operations are leading the fight in Mosul, but that could change if the battle continues to languish. , AP Originally, the Iraqi Government barred the officially unrecognized but battle hardened Iranian-backed Shiite militias from being included directly in the fight to retake the city. There were great fears that their presence in the city could anger Mosul’s predominantly Sunni populace and invite sectarian violence. Turkey, in particular, was adamant about not letting Shiite militias into the Mosul fight for fear of a wider sectarian war in the region. This all changed on November 26th when the Shiite dominated Iraqi parliament voted to outright legalize the militias . Since then they have been active south of Mosul, blocking key escape routes and holding territory seized from the Islamic State’s grasp. They have even benefited from US air strikes in the process. But as the Iraqi government’s security forces degrade over months of urban warfare, resorting to bringing the Iranian-backed Shiite militias into the Mosul fight may become necessary for the Iraqi government. The same can be said for Kurdish fighters, most notably the Peshmerga , although now even Syrian Kurdish female fighting units are migrating to Iraq to take on ISIS . Although the Peshmerga remain heavily engaged on smaller objectives surrounding Mosul, they are not active in the battle for the city itself. Like the Shiite militias, there are major concerns among some factions about the reliance on Peshmerga to fight ISIS and their increased territorial control in the region. Shiite militias known as Popular Mobilzation Forces have been officially legalized in Iraq and these groups, which have been backed by Iran in the past, have moved closer to Mosul in recent weeks. , AP The truth is that Iraqi Kurds’ battle against ISIS began under great crisis over two and a half years ago. The US-backed Peshmerga were rushed into service to diffuse the Islamic State’s blitzkrieg across Iraq. Without the Peshmerga’s intervention, ISIS could have pushed into Baghdad and beyond, steamrolling Iraq’s then-failing security apparatus single handedly. Now, after years of bloody conflict against the Islamic State, the Kurds are unwilling to cede control of the territory they fought and died to retake. All this points to a much larger issue—if or when Mosul finally falls, and without a common enemy to unite tacitly against, how will the now battle hardened and heavily armed Peshmerga, Shiite militias and Iraqi Army—all controlled by different factions with different allegiances, both internal and external—keep from turning against each other. Such a civil war could be far more bloody and have much larger international repercussions than the battle against ISIS does today. Peshmerga fighters are famous for being fearless combatants and have close ties to the United States. They were key in stopping ISIS's blitz across Iraq in the summer of 2014. , AP The threat from beyond the wall As everyone is focusing their attention on the battle for Mosul, an even deadlier threat quietly emanates from the North, from behind a huge wall. Just 37 miles from Mosul, the massive 371 foot-high, 2.1 mile-long Mosul Dam, which was once held by ISIS, is being frantically worked on by an Italian engineering firm to keep it from failing. The operation is occurring under the armed guard of 500 Italian troops, security contractors and Peshmerga fighters. If just 26% of the dam were to fail, the destruction would be epic in scope according to a report by a European science commission: “This simulation results in a very high wave of water, up to 25 metres high arriving at Mosul after 100 minutes. The capital Baghdad is reached after 3.5 days with a maximum water height of 8 metres and a mean of around 2 metres.” The US Embassy in Baghdad said in a communique that between 500,000 to 1.47 million Iraqis living along the Tigris river “probably would not survive.” A security contractor flies over the failing Mosul Dam. , AP Even if the Italian engineering firm is successful, the fix is just momentary in nature, as there’s consensus that the failure of the dam is just a matter of time. While the international community has taken action to try to abate such a disaster, even under combat conditions, the Iraqi government seems disinterested in the problem. Iraqi minister of water resources, Mohsin Al-Shammari, said the following : “The danger is not imminent, it’s far off… The danger is 1 in 1,000. The danger for Mosul Dam is no greater than that of other dams.” It’s eerie to think that it’s possible the battle for Mosul may be lost by everyone involved to a much more insidious enemy than ISIS—that being a coalition of procrastination, the passage of time and poor engineering.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 10, 2017",Israel Retires The F-16A/B “Netz” And Puts 40 Up For Sale,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The IAF just said goodbye to a very dear friend. The General Dynamics F-16A/B “Netz” (Hawk) has been retired after 36 years of history making service. Following the type’s retirement, Israel put 40 of the jets up for sale.Maybe even more than the McDonnell Douglas F-15A/B Baz that came before it, the F-16A/B Netz revolutionized the way the Israeli Air Force fights. Their existence affected the course of history by shifting the strategic equation in the Middle East. 75 “Electric Fighters” were ordered by Israel in 1978 under the Peace Marble I program. The first Block 5 and Block 10 (later upgraded to a common Block 10 configuration) jets outfitted with Israeli modifications and desert camouflage arrived Ramat David AFB in Israel in July of 1980. These aircraft were originally intended for the Shah of Iran, Israel originally procured the type more as a response to the high cost of the F-15 Eagle than anything else. With those costs in mind and a bargain on the new aircraft to be had, the IAF decided that a high-low capability mix was needed to firmly establish Israel’s air superiority in the region. Just a matter of weeks after the first Israeli Air Force F-16s arrived, the type was declared operational. Not long after the jets were pressed into combat, a first for the F-16. On April 28th, 1981, an IAF Netz fighter shot down a Syrian helicopter with its cannon, marking the first air-to-air victory for the F-16. Other Syrian aircraft quickly followed, and the F-16’s reputation for being vicious air-to-air fighter was quickly cemented. An F-16B Netz flying high over Israel. , IAF Though the F-16 remains an incredibly deadly air-to-air combatant, the Netz also gave the IDF a new level of precision in the strike role. The jet’s high-tech, constantly computed impact point bombing system allowed for the delivery of hard-hitting 2,000lb bombs with relatively reliable accuracy against large targets. This capability was put to use in dramatic fashion on June 7th, 1981 when a formation of IAF F-16s executed a daring long-range daytime bombing raid on Saddam Hussein’s Osiris nuclear reactor near Baghdad. Dubbed “Operation Opera,” the mission saw eight F-16As, each loaded with two 2,000lb Mk84 bombs with delay fuses, and six F-15As swoop across the desert to pulverize the heart of Iraq’s burgeoning nuclear program. Against great odds the mission was a massive and history-changing success—and the F-16 made it possible. At the time, Saddam Hussein was an enemy of the new Iranian regime and thus an ally of the US. If the reactor had not been destroyed, there’s a good chance Iraq would have become the first nuclear-armed Arab nation in the Middle East. The Netz would go on to serve for 36 years with the IAF, seeing countless combat sorties and shooting down dozens of enemy aircraft. A total of 125 F-16A/Bs were delivered to the IAF between 1981 and 1994, in two distinct lots. The initial 75 aircraft were delivered by the end of 1981. A second lot, dubbed Peace Marble IV, saw the introduction of the F-16C/D “Barak” (Lightning) into IAF service in the late ‘80s. Another batch of F-16A/Bs was delivered to Israel in 1994 as thanks for staying out of Operation Desert Storm, even while Iraqi Scud missiles rained down on Israeli territory. A total of 50 US surplus Block 5 and Block 10 F-16s made up the Peace Marble IV program. Israel’s love affair with the F-16 continued far beyond the Netz or the initial orders of the Barak. More F-16C/Ds and eventually the advanced F-16I Soufa (Storm) would round out the IAF’s F-16 inventory. In recent years the oldest A-models have been retired, including the most combat decorated F-16 of all time .  Other remaining A/B models were transferred to the aggressor role with the famed Red Dragon Squadron , or were used as advanced trainers for IAF pilots and weapon systems officers (WSOs). Israeli F-16As on the ramp., IAF Now, as the IAF’s first F-35As arrive and the M346 Lavi fills Israel’s advanced jet trainer role, the Netz have finally been pulled from service. The type had flown 335,000 flight hours and participated in 474,000 sorties during its IAF career, and changed the entire strategic paradigm in the Middle East in the process. With a massive aid package from the US going into effect, F-35’s beginning to arrive, upgrades on newer fighters underway, and with the F-15 fleet of all generations still going strong , Haarets reports that Israel is putting some of its flyable F-16A/Bs up for sale, along with other surplus hardware: “Israel’s Defense Ministry has announced that it will try to sell the aircraft to foreign forces. Specifically, the ministry’s Defense Aid Branch has advertised that 40 such planes are up for sale, noting that in the IAF they served in a variety of missions and are “especially recommended for attack forces. Israel is also selling another seven Hercules C-130 planes, seven Hawk fighter-interceptor systems, 40 Skyhawk Eagles and eight Cobra helicopters.” The F-16A/B, with its simplicity, light weight, and early flight control system remains a very nimble adversary aircraft for fleet pilots to face off against. , IAF It remains unclear exactly who may be a customer for these older F-16s, but Jordan, an ever-closer military ally of Israel , is one possibility. They have bought second-hand European F-16s for years , and Israel would likely cut them a very good deal, even providing upgrades to the jets to make them more relevant to today’s battlefield. In the past Israel has gifted Jordan surplus AH-1 attack helicopters , so there is a chance the jets could be given to Jordan for the price of upgrades alone. It is also possible that a private adversary support contractor could make a play at these surplus F-16s, as the market is set to explode in size in the coming years. Having a true 4th generation threat profile to offer, one that is radar equipped and highly manueverable, is clearly where the field is headed , and Israel’s aerospace industry could easily upgrade these jets with modern radars, such as the Elta 2032 . In the past Isarel has sold some of its surplus A-4 Skyhawks to adversrary and testing support contractors. During the jet’s retirement ceremony on December 26th, Colonel Itamar, the commander of Ouvda AFB said these fitting words to commemorate the Netz’ service: “Today, we say goodbye to an incredible aircraft that seems to have been created by an artist, an aircraft that fits its missions like a glove” An adversary Netz returns from a training mission., AP Lt. Colonel Udi, who commands the much vaunted Red Dragons aggressor squadron, summed up the unique nature of an aircraft that had such a huge impact on Israeli history: “Today, we sign the last chapter of the ‘Netz’ aircraft in the IAF… Only those who have touched the aircraft, only those who have been touched by the aircraft, know that the ‘Netz’ is not just an object – it has a soul.” Even though the Netz is officially gone from IAF service, you can celebrate the type by watching the ‘80’s cult classic fighter flick Iron Eagle . The film was shot in Israel just a few years after the Netz arrived, and the aircraft is one of the stars of the movie. The film was shot outside the US was because the Pentagon had a policy at the time that the military wouldn’t support any Hollywood movie that featured stolen aircraft. Till this day, some of the best air-to-air footage of F-16s can be seen in this film.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 16, 2018",Russia Tests Another Anti-Satellite Weapon as Battleground Space Looms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fifth test of Russia’s anti-satellite missile , the PL-19 Nudol, occurred near Plesetsk, Russia on Friday. The launch was monitored by American intelligence gathering capabilities and the missile is reported to not have impacted anything in orbit. Whether this denotes a failed test or the weapon was never meant to achieve a kinetic kill is unknown. Russia has long claimed that the Nudol is a mid-course anti-ballistic missile system used for defensive purposes only. The consensus is that, although it may have this capability, its other primary mission is to knock enemy satellites out of orbit. Anti-ballistic missile systems are a natural fit for plinking satellites. The US Navy used its SM-3 interceptor and Aegis combat system to do just that back in 2008 under Operation Burnt Frost, swatting a malfunctioning surveillance satellite out of the sky successfully. Other Russian weapons in development are thought to also have anti-satellite capabilities. These include the S-500 anti-ballistic missile and air defense system and more shadowy weapons like the maneuvering orbital “satlet”—likely capable of near observation, disruption and possibly even manipulation of other satellites— launched under the guise of Kosmos 2499. Russia is also experimenting with airborne lasers designed to blind or even kill enemy satellites. The Pentagon is facing threats in emerging mediums of combat. Cyber warfare may be grabbing all the headlines lately, but space—the place where so much of America’s unique combat capability is enabled from—is the US military’s glaring achilles heel. China and Russia are rapidly developing new capabilities to destroy, disable, blind or even hijack American satellites in orbit in an attempt to level the playing field should a peer-state conflict breakout. The US is slowly trying to adapt to this new reality by spinning up new ways to navigate and target in GPS-denied combat environments —as well as coming up with new communications techniques that work around reliance on satellite relays. For years, anything but kinetic anti-satellite weaponry remained on the dark fringes of the defense world. Now these concepts and capabilities are emerging into the mainstream. These range from the mysterious X-37B miniature space shuttle , to DARPA led initiatives aimed at servicing other satellites in space or using space junk to create cheap communications satellites. Any of these could be used to monitor, jam, or even destroy enemy satellites without creating terrible debris fields that will limit future access to space. Other highly classified space technologies also likely exist. I wrote the following in 2012: “What may be in retrospect the “Wright Flyer” of this emerging new realm of space drones is the highly publicized but little understood Boeing X-37B. This reusable mini-spaceplane has a reconfiguration payload bay about the size of pickup truck bed and could theoretically be used for any of a plethora of new technologies. At the same time, other white-world drone-like orbital space programs are popping up fast, many of which are seem quite benign at first glance but offer serious military potential with simple modifications. For instance, DARPA’s “Phoenix Program,” which will see space junk turned into large communications relays via the deployment of small and maneuverable micro satellite parasites, called “satlets,” could theoretically de-orbit space junk or commandeer it for other purposes. These same “satlets” could also take old satellites to a tender for refueling or even repair. This capability combined with NASA’s DEXTER android-like remote manipulator system could literally put astronaut repairman’s hands virtually on a satellite in need.” “Although not found in DARPA’s “Phoenix Project” press materials, it is clear that if you can do the things mentioned above with friendly or abandoned satellites than you could disable, de-orbit or even capture an enemy’s satellites as well. In other words, DARPA may be creating an incredible low-earth orbit space custodian and tow truck of sorts with their “satlet” drones, but at the same time they also may be creating the ultimate anti-satellite weapon, one which does not create thousands of pieces of deadly space junk like their crude “kinetic” fore-bearers. Orbital space debris caused by a traditional “hit to kill” anti-satellite weapons can harm even the very user’s orbiting capabilities as well as the enemy’s. Although DARPA’s Phoenix program and the X-37B are promising, with every new capability there will eventually be a countermeasure, which begs the question: could we one day see near space filled with “satlets,” both of the offensive type mentioned above and of a defensive type, deployed to guard our critical military satellites from marauding enemy “satles?” I think it’s not only possible but probable.” This very important topic is picking up steam in the mainstream press. 60 Minutes did a story on it last year, but maybe the best and most current primer on space weaponry and America’s vulnerabilities in this most inhospitable of realms comes from CNN. Their documentary War In Space goes through a lot of the emerging capabilities we have discussed in the past, and does so in a pretty attainable manner.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 1, 2016",Take a Virtual Ride in the Cockpit on the F-4 Phantom’s Retirement Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been talking about it all year —the F-4 Phantom’s long awaited retirement from the Pentagon’s active inventory. The QF-4s of the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron made a triumphant round of visits to air shows across the US this year, giving the American people one last chance to glimpse the “Bent Wing Wonder” in action. It was one last hurrah for what would be an emotional end to a stunning career. Yesterday, on December 21st, 2016, the Phantom’s service finally came to an end with a ceremony at Holloman Air Force base marking the bittersweet milestone. Although the type was officially retired from front-line service 20 years ago, over 300 surplus Phantoms were converted by BAE Systems into QF-4 full-scale aerial targets (FSAT) . These optionally manned jets played the invaluable role of acting as fodder for the testing of America’s newest missile and missile countermeasure technologies. The QF-16 has now fully assumed the role as America’s FSAT from the Phantom, and it brings higher maneuverability and better economy to the mission. Yet the Viper will never have the same level of cultural cache or swagger as the iconic F-4 Phantom had. A small ceremony was held at Holloman AFB for the Phantom’s final flight, with QF-4s sitting on static display flanked by two QF-16s. A flight of four Phantoms went up to create some J79 turbojet thunder over the airfield before landing, drogue chutes billowing, one last time. This awesome 360 video was shot with Lt. Col. (Ret) Jim “WAM” Harkins at the controls of a QF-4 for the type’s final flight over Holloman: The F-4 continues to soldier on in active service with the Turkish Air Force, Hellenic Air Force, Japanese Self Defense Forces, Republic of Korea Air Force, and of course the Iranian Air Force—where it flies combat missions against ISIS. A single F-4 is also privately owned and sporadically flown by the Collins Foundation, here in the US. As for the handful of QF-4s that never met their fate at the mean end of a missile, those jets will be used as ground targets on bombing ranges, while a select few may end up in museums. Farewell to the glorious Phantom, after 56 years of continuous service with the United States armed forces.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",The Navy’s F-35C Has A Major Nose Gear Problem,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a decade after the Lockheed Martin F-35 began flight testing , the Navy’s catapult launch and barrier recovery (CATOBAR) variant, the F-35C, remains mired with teething issues. Now, one problem appears to be more debilitating than previously realized, and it’s rearing its head at a critical phase of flight for any Navy fighter—the catapult launch. The issue occurs when a lightly loaded F-35C’s landing gear nose strut is compressed while the jet throttles up, right before launch. As the catapult fires and the hold back bar is released, the jet is rapidly pulled forward, during which time the strut oscillates violently up and down. The bouncing continues as the aircraft proceeds down the catapult track at increasing speed. The problem was vividly demonstrated among a group of F-35C’s participating in the type’s third set of sea trials aboard the USS George Washington last summer, giving pilots a wild and potentially dangerous ride down the deck. The airplane seems to be able to take the hammering, but the pilot sitting over the strut can be severely affected by the ordeal. The movement sends their already-heavy advanced helmet mounted display and oxygen mask flopping up and down, applying pressure to the pilot’s jaw. The erratic oscillations also keep the pilot from being able to read critical info on their helmet-mounted display, an anomaly that can persist sometime after the jet has departed the deck and entered smooth air. You can see the big bounces as the catapult stroke begins., Youtube The issue itself is not new—it has been identified for nearly three years—but Inside Defense has recently learned that the problem is so persistent and potentially detrimental that a red team has been assigned to address it. So far their recommendation is ominous: If fixes cannot be found, the C model’s nose gear should be redesigned altogether. The C model is the most expensive of the F-35 clan—costing anywhere from roughly $150 million and $337 million each depending on how you look at it—and it’s the smallest planned production run of the three variants. With the Super Hornet still in production, the Navy never hot on the F-35 idea in the first place, the C model will be the last F-35 to enter service, supposedly in 2019. This date, even if it’s not delayed, is arbitrary in nature—just as the F-35B and A’s initial operational capability dates have been. The problem is less severe when the jet is heavily loaded., Lockheed Martin Inside defense quotes a Navy document detailing all the factors that have caused the debilitating situation: “The Red Team believes multiple factors are contributing to the problem, including the pilot’s seat restraint and hand-hold (grab bar) locations, the mass and center-of-gravity of the F-35 helmet and display unit, the physical characteristics of the nose landing gear strut (load vs. stroke, damping), and the length and release load of the repeatable-release hold-back bar (RRHB).” Although catapult launches are already a violent affair, pilots who have been shot off the deck in an F-35C have detailed how disorienting and even painful the whole affair can be. During at sea trials in August, fleet pilots from VFA-101 evaluated their experience on the “cat” with the F-35C using a rating system, here is what they found out: “After each catapult operation pilots were asked to assess their pain level on a scale from one to five. Out of a total of 105 catapult shots 74 of those caused pilots “moderate pain” or a three rating. 18 catapult shots caused pilots “severe pain” or a four rating. One catapult shot was deemed a five rating or “severe pain that persists” with the pilot suffering from neck pain and a headache, and 12 catapult shots scored a two rating or “mild pain.” None of the 105 catapult shots received a one rating of “slight discomfort” or a zero rating of “no discomfort or pain…” The oscillations shake the pilot’s head sufficiently to impair their ability to consistently read flight critical data, which poses a safety of flight risk.” The C model’s nose gear as seen during testing at NAS Lakehurst. , Lockheed Martin A similar scale of zero to four was used for helmet mounted display readability during each catapult launch. 51 of the launches rated a three where it was difficult viewing anything in the display. Nine received a two rating, where only critical data was able to be viewed. Seven shots received a four rating for not being able to view anything at all inside the helmet mounted display and none got a one or zero rating for being able to easily see all the data or most of the data. During testing, pilots have had to lock their harnesses tight for launch—not a safe procedure as it could impair their ability to reach the ejection handle should something go wrong during launch, like a “cold” or underpowered catapult stroke. Obviously all of this is a huge problem in a critical phase of flight, and the Navy’s red team, made up of military and industry personnel, realizes this. Short-term, medium-term and long-term actions, or at least requests for action, are supposedly underway. Short-term recommendations include changing how pilots strap themselves into the jet, and how they hold their straps during catapult launches. Not too enticing of a fix, if you are hurtling yourself off the deck of a carrier at 150 miles an hour in a 25 ton machine, at night, over frigid water. Medium-term actions include small modifications to the nose gear and HMD symbology, such as simplifying what is displayed in the helmet during catapult launches. These alterations are not set to begin for about another year, after which they will take at least six months to accomplish, and the HMD software may take much longer to change due to the restrictions of the F-35’s already questionable development timeline. Long-term actions are not slated to begin until 2019—the same year the jet will supposedly be declared operational—and would take between one and three years to complete. These include changes to the hold-back bar design, and could include alterations to the carrier’s catapult systems themselves to change the amount of compression the nose strut experiences prior to launch. Finally, if these measures don’t fix the problem, a full redesign of the nose gear assembly would be needed. Currently a redesign isn’t being pursued due to development time restraints, and would likely take years to achieve once the process begins. Dramatically retrofitting existing F-35Cs—there will be squadrons in service by that time—would also be a costly affair to say the least. Another angle of the F-35C’s bouncy departure. , youtube Since this problem has been an acknowledged issue since 2014, it’s absurd to think that the jet could—and at this point almost definitely would—be declared operational despite such a fundamental flaw. With the F-35 program trying to stick to its timeline and meet goals without asking for another major budget expansion, it seems that major problems are being put off until development has been completed. This completely contradicts the whole purpose of a test and development program, but what else is new in concurrency hell? Chalk it up as just one of many unsolved mysteries that continue to plague the Joint Strike Fighter family of jets.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 12, 2017",China’s Carrier Ties Up At Specially-Built Giant Dock In S. China Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s lone carrier, the totally refurbished Kuznetsov class Liaoning , and its battle group has been on a highly-publicized cruise that began at its homeport of Qingdao on the Yellow Sea and continued up into the Bohai Sea for drills, and down through the East China Sea, past Okinawa and the First Island Chain and into the Pacific (a first). It then traveled south before passing Taiwan’s southern tip and into the highly disputed South China Sea . There the carrier put into port in China’s sprawling Hainan Island naval facility, where a massive dock— the largest of its kind in the world —was built recently to accept her and her escorts. While the ships were far north, in the Bohai Sea, complex exercises were executed—the first of their kind for the carrier —including live fire drills against airborne and surface targets. The ship’s J-15 fighters and helicopters were very active during this training evolution and have remained embarked on the carrier and flying missions ever since. During the carrier’s southerly trip it skirted Japanese and Taiwanese territory, both countries that have long-standing territorial disputes with Beijing and are experiencing especially heightened tensions with China at the moment . The route was clearly planned as much as a highly-visible exercise of China’s new power projection capabilities as it was for training purposes. #PLAN Liaoning #AircraftCarrier CSG Crossed the First Island Chain & Entered South #China Sea https://t.co/ciI8ZaNkWy pic.twitter.com/QTFnEZwcQ4 — Navy Recognition (@NavyRecognition) December 26, 2016 Her flotilla includes multiple ships drawn from disparate PLAN fleets, including two Type 052C and one Type 052D destroyers, two Type 054C frigates, one Type 056A corvette and a Type 903A support ship. These were the ships the Japanese Ministry of Defense identified as part of the armada that sailed past Japanese territory. More ships could join the battle group if it pushes south, deep into the troubled waters of the South China Sea . Also it is worth mentioning that at least one submarine is also likely part of the battle group, and more would likely join once the armada leaves Hainan Island which is one of China’s master submarine bases and includes a submarine facility carved inside a mountain . The Liaoning and her escorts as recorded by Japan., Japanese Government It is likely that the Liaoning and her escorts will venture next into the southern portion of the South China Sea, a place where US carrier groups often prowl as a counterweight to China’s island-building campaign and claims on nearly the entirety of the body of water. By sailing its own carrier group around its manmade island outposts (that are now armed) in the South China Sea it sends a strong message to other countries in the region, many of which also claim large areas of the waterway as their own. That message being the US is not the only one with overwhelming naval power projection capabilities that can cruise the area at will. Geolocation of photos posted today on Chinese social media confirms PLAN CV Liaoning alongside at purpose-built pier in Hainan, near Sanya pic.twitter.com/D1Eu38itW1 — Mike Yeo 杨启铭 (@TheBaseLeg) December 28, 2016 Even if the Liaoning does not sail south from her present location, it seems quite clear that this cruise, one that expanded the ship’s tactical capabilities and its physical reach, will serve as a final test before declaring the ship and its air wing operational even if in a limited capacity. The Liaoning may be no match for her nuclear powered US counterparts, but going from no carrier operations experience to even a limited operational state in just four years is one amazing accomplishment. With Liaoning’s all indigenously built sister-ship now far along in her construction , it is one that will pay off strategically in a much larger way in the not so distant future. China’s second carrier, an updated clone of its imported sister-ship, is well on its way to being finished. Looking farther ahead, China will move away from a ski-jump carrier design and to a catapult and barrier arrestment (CATOBAR) configuration with future carriers. Such a move will drastically increase the combat punch Chinese carriers to come and will be a major step forward in terms of approaching parity with the US or even with India for that matter which also has CATOBAR carriers in its near future. Still, a lot of learning has to happen between now and then, but as we have seen over the last half decade of Chinese carrier operations, learning fast seems to be one of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s strong suits. #China #PLANAF #Huangdicun both catapults ready as on10/16/16.Tyre marks suggest trials by steam catapult more than EMALS Pic via Deino/CDF pic.twitter.com/0KKgMspmpt — 卫纳夜格.巴特 Col Vinayak Bhat (Retd) @Raj47 (@rajfortyseven) November 9, 2016 Photo by VCG STR/AFP/Getty Images STR/AFP/Getty Images STR/AFP/Getty Images Photo by VCG STR/AFP/Getty Images STR/AFP/Getty Images Youtube Screencap Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 30, 2016",Engine Falls Off B-52 During A Training Sortie Over North Dakota,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On January 4th, 2017, one of a B-52H’s eight Pratt & Whitney TF33 turbofan engines detached from the jet mid-air , plunging thousands of feet into a sparsely populated area about 25 miles northeast of Minot AFB, North Dakota. The B-52 was not loaded with live ordnance at the time, and its five crew were able to make it back to Minot safely—but the idea that one of the aircraft’s engines literally fell off is bizarre and unnerving to say the least. Stranger still is that the jet’s engines are paired, two go in each nacelle pod, which is attached to one of four pylons under the aircraft’s wing. It’s being reported that a single engine fell away from the aircraft—not two that make up a pod—which makes the incident more puzzling as it would indicate the engine detached from the shared mounting pylon, taking its whole nacelle housing with it. Fortunately for the B-52 crew, having an aircraft’s power spread across eight engines means that that losing one, even far towards the wing tip, does not cause massive thrust imbalances. The B-52’s unique engine configuration makes the loss of just one of them in flight even a stranger occurance., USAF Regardless of whether this incident ends up being a result of human error or a faulty component, it will likely fuel calls for the B-52’s re-engine program to finally be executed. Attempts to mount new powerplants on the BUFF have been frequent over the last four decades, often with different powerplant choices and different funding schemes motivating them. We have discussed all this in great detail in the past —and the stark reality is that upgrading the B-52’s engines is long overdue—especially considering the technological upgrades and game-changing weaponry the B-52 is receiving. Not to mention the potential for what the type could morph into in the future , or that it’s slated to serve till at least 2040. Barring the very low chance of an early B-52 retirement following a massive investment into the new B-21 Raider program, any new engine initiative for the B-52 would likely come under a complex private-public sector cooperative, where the new engines are “paid for” by theoretical fuel savings over time. What the USAF will get in the process is a much more capable bomber—one that features higher reliability, less maintenance per flight hour, dramatically longer range and loitering time, higher altitude operations, and more lifting ability while utilizing shorter runways.That improved short-field performance could come in very handy for forward deployed operations to the Pacific, and further the use of the B-52H’s new “smart” internal weapons rack. Other benefits of new engines include greater power generation abilities—useful in supporting potential future roles toting directed energy weapons or acting as a standoff jamming and electronic warfare platform. The B-52H is nearly 60 years old and it is not slated for retirement until 2040 at the earliest, but it will probably soldier on as America’s weapons truck of necessity for decades longer., USAF The last time the USAF researched what it would need out of an engine program was 2014, when it concluded that new powerplants would need to save between 10-25% in fuel consumption, and would have to go 15-25 years before the first deep overhauls of the engines are required. The question of which engine would best fit this requirement remains, as well as whether four large engines or eight smaller ones (even six, under some concepts) would be best. One area of concern is if new pylons would be needed to accommodate powerplants mounted in new locations under the BUFF’s wings. Such a requirement could result in a costly re-engineering of the B-52’s wings. With four larger engines, such as GE’s CF6 (called the F138 on the C-5M) or engines similar in size to the Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (the F117, in use aboard the C-17A) wing height and rudder authority for engine-out operations remain a question. As as result, costly flight control and avionics upgrades might be needed to accommodate their use, beyond the need for potential structural upgrades to the B-52’s wings. Various engines have flown on the B-52 in the past, although switching all of them out is a totally different challenge than just testing one on an inboard pylon. , DoD With this in mind, probably the easiest option is eight compact high-bypass turbofans fitted to the aircraft’s existing pylons in re-contoured dual-nacelle pods. The Rolls Royce BR725 powering the Gulfstream 650 is one contender, as is GE’s Passport 20 found on the Global Express 7000 and 8000. If the Air Force decides to push forward with an official RFP for an engine swap on the B-52, other entrants will surely emerge. Although there are only 76 B-52Hs in service , eight engines for each jet equals a whopping 608 in total. With spares, a B-52 re-engine initiative could equal an order for well over 650 engines. During a time when fewer types of military aircraft are being put into production, such an order—even if less lucrative up-front than a flat-out purchase—could represent a large injection of revenue to the winning manufacturer. Meanwhile, Pratt and Whitney, the original manufacturer of the B-52’s engines, has been pushing for the USAF to adopt a package of improvements for existing TF33s flying on the B-52 Stratofortress, E-3 Sentry and E-8C JSTARS fleets. Squeezing more reliability out of the 55 year old TF33/JT3D design may be possible, but large improvements in fuel economy and drastic gains in performance are not. The TF33 has soldiered on for over half a century on B-52H wings. The type also flies on the E-8 JSTARS and E-3 Sentry. , USAF A lot of this will come down to what type of priority the Trump administration will place on the B-52 fleet going forward. He has been known to slam the jet’s age in the past, although that is common among politicians uneducated in the aircraft’s unique abilities. By leveraging a “save to pay” scheme, where both industry and the Pentagon assume some risk, such a program may fit well into the President elect’s new vision for a reformed Pentagon procurement process. Then again, Trump himself seems to have no problem operating aging aircraft that guzzle a lot of gas and cost huge sums of money to keep flying. Fuel costs have been down for years, from their high in the late 2000s, which also hurts the business case for recapitalizing the B-52’s power plants. But as we discussed, it’s not all about fuel savings, but also large increases in capability and drastic enhancements in reliability and maintainability. There is no crystal ball that can predict future fuel pricing with 100% accuracy, and you simply don’t strap new engines on an aircraft like this—it takes time. As such, the Air Force would be better off biting the bullet, beginning the process has to be better than agreeing to rely on an engine design that will be approaching a century of service when the B-52H is finally put out to pasture.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 21, 2016",Russian Special Operations Commando Seen Wearing Hezbollah Patch In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian special operations forces, which have been increasingly modeled on those of the US , were critical in realizing the fall of Aleppo . The longtime rebel holdout has been blitzed by a surge of Russian and Syrian air power, Assad’s troops, Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters and Russian special operations forces since early November. This cocktail of capabilities proved far more than the rebels could handle, with the city falling officially on December 14th. Photos and video of Russia’s special operations forces operating in Syria have trickled out over the last year or so, but leading up to and following the sacking of Aleppo we have seen more of them and heard how their abilities were applied to take Assad’s ultimate objective. These highly-trained units were used to advise Syrian and Hezbollah forces on tactics and strategy, to go after key leadership targets, to quickly fuse actionable intelligence with operations, and to help direct the brutal onslaught of air power that broke the city. Videos showing a teams of commandos has surfaced today showing what appears to be a Russian special operations team outfitted with modern gear, much of it similar to what America’s special operations and special forces teams wear. One one of the soldier’s arms is a bright yellow patch with an unmistakable logo—that of the Iranian-backed, heavily armed, Shiite militant and political organization Hezbollah. Another soldier can be seen with a pirate-like patch on his helmet and what appears to be a patch with a bat logo—most likely in reference to the Spetsnaz which has used the bat symbol prominently for years. Caution, this video is graphic: Having a Russian special operations soldier wearing the patch of Hezbollah has caused a stir because the symbology means very different things to different people, and few of those things are moderate in nature. To some in Lebanon and the immediate region it represents a political affiliation as much as a militant one. Hezbollah has a standing army of fighters and a huge arsenal of rockets alongside other advanced weapons, but it also runs schools and hospitals, and provides other key services and protection to Shiite communities in Lebanon. At the same time, Hezbollah is labeled as a terrorist organization by the US, and is seen as major threat to Israel, who has fought the group directly during many conflicts. On a geopolitical level, Hezbollah is viewed as an Iranian proxy able to dole out Tehran’s deadly bidding far from Iran’s own borders. In Syria, Iran has mobilized Hezbollah fighters to fight along the Assad regime’s forces in an attempt to keep the dictator in power. Russia is doing the same, although for different strategic reasons . This is where Hezbollah and the Russian military have crossed paths, and the evolving strategic relationship between Russia and Iran has only bolstered this unique partnership. Russian soldier seen wearing a Hezbollah patch., Twitter Screencap Russian special operations units have fought and trained alongside Hezbollah now for some time, and the relationship is obviously a brutally effective one on the battlefield. This is something Israel is likely quite concerned with. The Isreali’s fear that Hezbollah already poses a substantial threat to the Jewish State—and a battle hardened Hezbollah, supercharged by Russian special operations tactics, procedures and arms is far more menacing. Worn in combat, that Hezbollah patch makes big statement of solidarity—but it is also a longtime tradition of special forces around the world to wear the unit patches of the indigenous forces they are embedded with to train, advise, and in some cases fight alongside. This practice was controversially evidenced last Summer, when photos of a US special forces soldier wearing the patch of the YPJ surfaced . The YPJ is the all-female, battle tested militia that is an offshoot of the Kurdish Worker’s Party, also known as the PKK. The PKK is a bitter enemy of and deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey. The decades-long fight between the PKK and the Turkish government has indeed been brutal , and the fact that US special forces are directly supporting these units in Syria in an attempt to take out ISIS has infuriated Ankara, who is actively fighting a war against them . A US special forces soldier wearing a YPJ patch in NW Syria., Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images The small international crisis sparked by the picture of the US commando wearing a YPJ patch was quickly extinguished by the Pentagon, with an official stating that the patch was unauthorized and action was taken to make sure it does not happen again. More on the subject was likely communicated by the US to Turkey, helping to temper the NATO’s ally’s disgust over the matter. Even though a very fragile peace deal has been worked out among Turkey, Russia, Iran and the Assad regime that has a chance to bring an end to the Syrian civil war, Sunni dominant Turkey is no fan of Hezbollah either. They see the Shiite militant group as a direct threat, and want them to go back to Lebanon once the ceasefire is firmly in place. But now that the group is entrenched in Syria, getting them to abandon their expanded influence in the region will not be easy, and they seem to have no intention to bow to Turkey’s whims . Left out of the ceasefire deal, of course, is the US. American involvement has been deemed irrelevant by Russia, as tensions between Putin and the Obama administration hit a crescendo . In the end, maybe this is for the better. This ceasefire deal has little chance of engaging all the international players involved, and Assad will see his power erode even further. Additionally, it does not include ISIS nor terror affiliates like Ansar al Islam, so the fight against those factions in Syria will continue regardless. If anything else, the revelation that Russian commandos are wearing the insignia of the “Party of Allah” is just a reminder that on the modern battlefield, where social media is ever present, symbols really do matter.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",Fast And Stealthy “Thunder Child” Is a Wave-Carving Thing of Beauty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Safehaven Marine is world-renowned for building hardy boats that can take on challenging missions in the harshest environments—and they look gorgeous while doing it. With a portfolio ranging from search and rescue vessels to pilot boats, and from wind farm tenders to scientific catamarans, diversity is sort of their thing. Last year they made a splash when they unveiled their stealthy high-speed patrol boat, the Barracuda . Now they’ve introduced its bigger and badder cousin to the world, the aptly named “Thunder Child.” Let’s get this out of the way first�� Thunder Child XSV-17 is one handsome piece of marine engineering—and seeing it in action only solidifies that fact. Watching the ship fly through the water you immediately hear the synth beat from the opening of Miami Vice or the theme from Thunder in Paradise in your head, depending on your generation. There is no doubt that this thing has a lot in common with the high-performance race boats featured in both those shows. But Thunder Child is the real deal, with real military and law enforcement applications. It can also take one hell of a beating. Safehaven sees a role for Thunder Child’s production variant, which will be part of their Barracuda family of boats, in any maritime application where speed is critical. It cruises at over 40 knots, but can be throttled up to 60 when time is of the essence. The boat is ideal for missions like patrol, interdiction, asset protection and pursuit, and it can be armed with a 7.62mm or .50 cal gun or a 40mm grenade launcher in a retractable bow turret just like its smaller Barracuda cousins. Additionally radars, electro-optical and communications suites, and even less than lethal weaponry , can be installed depending on customer needs. Thunder Child undergoing trials near Safehaven Marine’s home in Cork, Ireland., Safehaven Marine Thunder Child , with its stealthy design and extreme speed, could also act as a special operations support vessel for low-intensity warfare and reconnaissance missions. Here is how Safehaven Marine describes the ship’s decreased radar reflectivity: “The design of XSV 17 utilizes various stealth technologies to produce a lower RCS (radar cross section), allowing it to operate with a very high degree of invisibility to an adversary’s radar. Stealth technologies are employed in the superstructure and hull design utilizing flat plane principles to its surfaces in the forward, aft and cabin side projections to deflect radar beams away from source.  These unique features work together with RAM and specialized outfitting, including minimal metallic fittings above decks. All of which combine to produce a vessel with a very significantly lower than normal RCS from all aspects.” Above all that, it retains the search and rescue pedigree that Safehaven has built over the years. When the clock is ticking, the difference between 60 knots and 30 knots can easily mean life and death. Thunder Child is the prototype of what will become the largest of the Barracuda family of vessels. , Safehaven Marine Thunder Child can operate with a crew of up to ten—six in shock attenuating seats in the cabin and four in the bow cabin, which also includes a head and a berthing area. The Barracuda production variant can up the load to 16. The boat is 59 feet long and just over 13 feet wide. Fully loaded she displaces 20 tons but has a draft of just two feet, nine inches. Able to carry 1,320 gallons of fuel, Thunder Child could range out to 750 miles under power from her twin Caterpillar C12.9 1,000hp engines. Its surface drive units are also quite special, as you can see in the video below. Probably the most unique feature of the boat is her hull, which was painstakingly designed to take on pretty much anything the sea can throw at it. Safehaven describes Thunder Child’s design as such: “The vessel is constructed from advanced lightweight FRP cored composites. The radical and innovative hull design hull design combines a constant deadrise deep  V hull form incorporating twin chines capable of 60kts with a wavepiercing bow form. A 24 degree deadrise at the transom transitions to a wave piercing bow, with a super fine wave cutting waterline entry designed to run clear of the water at very high speeds, but which can be bought into dramatic effect with adjustable trim control to very effectively minimizes vertical accelerations at speed in waves, thereby maximizing crew endurance. The hull provides exceptionally high levels of seakeeping abilities on all courses with its twin chine arrangements providing for high levels of both static and dynamic stability. The design is fully self-righting, capable of recovering after capsize by a large breaking sea and is survivable up to sea state 8, capable of operating effectively in up to sea state 6, and maintain operational speed in sea state 4. A unique feature is the bow buoyancy control fins used to increase buoyancy in following seas preventing excessive submersion, the fins are adjustable for wave height and craft speed.” Safehaven may have created the world’s safest speedboat!, Safehaven Marine This thing is not just a militarized race boat. It can also survive in some of the worst weather on the planet. The ability to provide its full operational envelope over a wide range environmental conditions—and even in full-blown storms, sea state 6 means wave heights up to 20 feet—indicates that Thunder Child is not a niche capability. The boat simply offers far more speed compared to boats executing similar missions in these conditions today. It will be interesting to see if Thunder Child —or more accurately, its Barracuda production variant—can find a place in the market. Countries in Asia and oil-rich nations in the Middle East come to mind first when it comes to buyers for a craft like this. They could also be useful off the shores of Latin America, where drug smuggling remains a major problem. There’s also some chance of being adopted as a very rough-water operations craft by some special operations units. But the reality is that any coast guard could benefit from more speed, especially for homeland security and search and rescue operations. Thunder Child is so unique because it offers a lot more of just that without sacrificing sea keeping abilities. Thunder Child will eventually be integrated into Safehaven Marine’s Barracuda portfolio of multi-role fast boats that can also take a serious beating from the sea. The two existing sizes, both smaller and slower than the Thunder Child are shown here. , Safehaven Marine Safehaven looks to make a record setting high-speed circumnavigation of Ireland this summer in Thunder Child as part of the proving process for the new design. Frank Kowalski of Safehaven Marine describes the pending adventure : “The route involves a 1,000km open-ocean crossing into the North Atlantic, one of the roughest and most notorious seas on the planet. But for Thunder Child , I am confident that we will set a new record and have a safe, albeit nail biting, trip. The trip will involve several hours’ navigation in the dark and will inevitably encounter rough conditions which will put incredible stress on both vessel and crew.” We will keep you updated as the program progresses.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 13, 2017",All Eyes On North Korea As Kim Jong Un Says ICBM Test Imminent,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “Research and development of cutting edge arms equipment is actively progressing and ICBM rocket test launch preparation is in its last stage,” Kim Jong Un stated during a New Year’s Day speech.This time there appears to be no shallow cover story stating that the long-range rocket would be used to put a worthless satellite into orbit or is being launched for some other scientific means. Just as Kim said, this would be a test of intercontinental ballistic missile. With this statement it appears that laughably frail disguise that North Korea has historically tried to hide its high-end missile programs under for years has been dropped officially—an ominous sign of just how serious and openly aggressive North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons development initiatives have become. Nearly everything regarding North Korea’s missile programs has changed since early last year. The War Zone predicted that North Korea would go from fielding missiles with “paper capabilities” to a series of rapid tests and development programs, ones that will appear unafraid of the international optics of repeated failures. Over the last nine months Pyongyang has done just that, drastically accelerating its missile test launches as well as its nuclear detonations . So far all these launches have been of medium-range ballistic missiles and smaller (one could have been of the previously untested road-mobile KN-8 ICBM, or an advanced version of it the KN-14, though analysis remains inconclusive ) but according to Kim, that may now change. The product of such a test will likely be a culmination of all that North Korea has learned over the last year of missile testing and development, and it may even feature a whole new missile. In the past, North Korea’s ICBM/rocket has been based around an evolving design known as the Taepodong 2. Various other names of slightly different configurations, including Unha (most recently the Unha 4) and Kwangmyongsong have been used, but they all center around a common and an aged design concept. The Taepodong 2 family of rockets require extensive infrastructure are very predictable and easy to kill, as they have to be fueled and sit on a launch pad for long periods of time before being fired. As such, this kind of weapon is extremely vulnerable to preemptive attack. Its very nature gives America’s missile defense apparatus time to prepare to examine their launch , and if need be to shoot the missile down altogether. The 2012 launch of an Unha 3 rocket was from Sohae Satellite Launch Station in Tongchang-ri. Substantial infrastructure is needed for these launches and they are much more like commerical rocket launches than those of a reliable military rocket toting a nuclear warhead. , AP Another improved Taepodong 2 test may be historically most likely to be what Kim is referring to, but it is possible that a new weapon altogether could be tested. This missile could feature extensive use of solid propellant, or at least be more conceptualized as a rapidly deployable military weapon system than its Taepodong 2 counterpart. It’s even possible that Kim is talking about a submarine-launched ballistic missile. Although it would likely not feature true ICBM performance in terms of range, the fact that the submarine could venture out a distance from the North Korean mainland before launch could put the combo at the high-end of the intermediate range ballistic missile rubric. It would also be far more survivable against land-based missile interceptors , like THAAD, which is about to be forward-deployed to South Korea. The KN-11 “Polaris” submarine-launched ballistic missile has already been tested multiple times , and another test of an improved KN-11 could be coming soon, as there has been activity spotted around North Korea’s only ballistic missile capable submarine as well as the support pier and missile development installation that hosts it. There has also been activity spotted around what could be a new land-based missile silo launch site , one Iran may have had a hand in developing . This installation isn’t equipped to support anything near the size of a Taepodong 2, but it could host something like a Musudan intermediate range ballistic missile , the shadowy KN-8 ICBM, or its bulkier and longer-range cousin the KN-14. If the KN-8/KN-14 was successfully launched via a silo, or definitively launched at all for that matter, it would mark a major departure from the clumsy long-range rockets of North Korea’s past, signaling a far more astute and modern operational ICBM capability on North Korea’s horizon. This image from the watchdog group 38North.com shows the difference between the KN-8 and what is being unofficially referred to as the KN-14. The blunt ablative nose cone is a major development, as are larger stages. , 38North With a launch apparently imminent, what flight path would a long-range, or even a medium-range missile test take? If, for instance, the missile was slated to cross over Japan, there is a chance Japan or the US could shoot it down. A new Trump administration may aim to shoot down North Korea’s missile tests regardless of where they are headed. It would serve as a sign of a much more aggressive policy when it comes to dealing with the North and seeing that North Korea is in violation of UN resolutions when it tests these missiles, a legal argument for shooting them down likely exists. Although President-elect Trump has said in the past tha t he would like to negotiate with Kim Jong Un directly, ordering an ICBM test to be shot down would set in place a whole new series of roadblocks for Pyongyang’s race towards operational nuclear weapons and delivery systems capability. A test of a new advanced ICBM, if it is allowed to take place, could result in a large progression in North Korea’s nuclear weapons delivery capability know-how, especially when it comes to long-range guidance and fielding reentry vehicles carrying miniaturized nuclear weapons that are capable of withstanding the high heat and stress of atmospheric reentry. It is this race towards realizing a credible nuclear deterrent that recent North Korean defector Thae Yong-ho, who was second in command at North Korea’s embassy in London, says is Kim’s number one priority. He stated that “Due to domestic political procedures, North Korea calculates that South Korea and the US will not be able to take physical or military actions to deter North Korea’s nuclear development” and that the country is “racing ahead with nuclear development after setting up a plan to develop it nuclear weapons at all costs by the end of 2017.” He also added that there was no sum of money that would change Kim’s mind or keep the country from realizing its nuclear ambitions—a bleak report to say the least. There is also the real possibility North Korea could retaliate if this potential upcoming test, or any of their missile tests, were shot down—but once again what that response would look like remains unclear. Some sort of scaled response, such as sending artillery shells over the DMZ and into South Korea, or even attacking a South Korean patrol boat are just a handful of more mild potential reactions. Then again, the absolutely paranoid North Korean regime could do nothing, at least not initially—or something far worse. It is just so hard to predict. There is also possibly the option that the Trump administration could utilize other more clandestine and deniable non-kinetic tactics to neuter the utility of Pyongyang’s missile tests. These may include jamming radars and data-links that are crucial in monitoring a missile’s flight telemetry and its sub-systems’ reliability during that flight. Doing so could turn North Korea’s rampant test schedule into a very high-cost-low-return proposition. Thae Yong-ho defected from North Korea after serving as a top diplomat at North Korea’s embassy in London. The information he has put forward has offered a unique insight into North Korea’s opaque regime. , AP Beyond all this, the question remains of what North Korea’s burgeoning nuclear arsenal and missile programs actually buy? In the regime’s paranoid thinking, it is likely seen as a super weapon insurance policy of sorts, one that could keep the more technologically advanced US and its South Korean allies at bay while also allowing North Korea to operate in a less strangled manner, regardless of hard-hitting UN sanctions . In reality, the US and South Korea have no intention of invading the North. There is the long standing theory that the Kim regime is doing all this as a grand bargaining chip, and they do have the Iran nuclear deal to look at as a template for such a strategy now. Yet this theory becomes less plausible with each passing day—especially in light of reports like Thae Yong-ho’s. It is sad to think that all this is being done primarily due to a total lack of understanding, communication, and out of outright fear, but that really does seem to be the North Korean’s primary motivations. Kim’s growing ballistic missile capabilities do put South Korea and Japan in danger, along with US bases in region. Eventually, if this growing capability is left unchecked, North Korea will be able to hit Hawaii and Alaska, and possibly parts of the American west coast—at least theoretically. Still, with between a dozen to 20 nuclear bombs, and enough nuclear material to build an additional three and six weapons each year, North Korea’s missiles could rain catastrophic destruction onto major population centers if they were not swatted out of the sky first. But when it comes to the US, any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would result in the prompt end of that country altogether. America’s nuclear arsenal has the ability to pummel Pyongyang into oblivion in a single barrage. As such, the threat posed to the US, and even those countries under its nuclear umbrella by a nuclear armed North Korea is dubious at best. It sounds scary as hell but when you really break it down, it is a suicidal capability—at least when delivered using conventional means like easily traceable ballistic missiles as a first-strike. Kim Jong Un inspects what appear to be KN-14 ICBMS at a major nuclear weapons development site. , North Korea State Media It all comes down to unpredictability, something that the North Koreans have a knack for. Sure, the use of any of these weapons would result in certain destruction for Kim Jong Un and his cohorts, but many thousands, even millions of people would lose their lives before a counter-attack could be successfully realized. Additionally, pegging the state of North Korea’s rulers’ rationality, or even the stability of the Kim regime as a whole, at any given moment is challenging to say the least. As such dealing with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs continues to be a very important and high-stakes game. Maybe North Korea sees Donald Trump’s propensity to stop supporting major alliances , especially those with large and costly military commitments like the one between the US and Seoul , as a possible way to realize change in their favor regarding the current military equation on the Korean Peninsula . But even if the US were to pull back from its long-standing commitment to Seoul, which is very unlikely to happen despite Trump’s rhetoric, the South would rapidly arm itself with more conventional weaponry and would quickly build a nuclear arsenal of its own. In fact, contingency plans for such an possibility seem to be already underway . After hundreds of executions, Kim Jong Un’s grip on power seems more firm now than ever, but the quality of predictions as to the future of the regime are questionable at best. , AP No matter how firm a hand the US takes in the future when it comes to North Korea’s missile and nuclear ambitions, any meaningful change regarding their mad dash to operational nuclear capabilities will have to include China. As North Korea’s biggest trading partner, and their source for everything from food to energy, they are the only nation with leverage to change the North’s trajectory for the better. In the end, regardless of how robust a missile or nuclear weapons development program is, it cannot proceed without electricity, and without China supplying that energy, the power in North Korea would switch off in just a matter of days. The Trump administration already has a lot to talk about with Beijing. With the possibility of a major trade realignment (some would call it a trade war) looming between the two superpowers, and extremely sensitive topics like cyber theft , Taiwan and the South China Sea also on the docket, there may be possibility that Trump could role in the demand for a new hardline Chinese stance on North Korea in a future deal with Beijing. In fact, the Obama administration has already been laying the groundwork for just that. In the end, American imports and manufacturing are far more important to China’s future than Kim Jong Un, and in this truth there is potential. We will have to wait and see how the nuclear and ballistic missile chess pieces begin to move around the North Korean countryside in the coming days and if Kim Jong Un will stick to his word as far as the looming missile test is concerned. But if last year was any indication, 2017 will be even more packed with missile launches and nuclear detonations courtesy of the Hermit Kingdom and its young tyrant ruler. Inauguration day in American will be especially interesting to watch in relation to North Korea as they are likely remind the new President that they exist and are more of a threat now than ever before. Then again, doing nothing and staying as quiet as possible over the coming months as their missile and nuclear weapons programs progress may be even a more ominous sign—one that underscores how realizing an operational and credible nuclear deterrent has become far more important to the North Koreans than historical saber rattling and attention grabbing gestures.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 4, 2017",Russian Carrier Headed Home After Just Two Months Off Syrian Coast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two months after arriving on station early November, Russian officials have announced that the Admiral Kuznetsov and her battle group, the largest assembled since the end of the Cold War, will be leaving the eastern Mediterranean and heading back to their home port in frigid Severomorsk. Once there the Kuznetsov , which has seen far better days , will supposedly begin a long-awaited and needed overhaul that will take at least half a decade to complete. The ship started its deployment ahead of a major offensive against anti-regime targets, especially in and around the long-time rebel holdout of Aleppo. In mid October, the ship made its way from the Barents Sea through the English Channel and into the Mediterranean under great media scrutiny. Once off the coast of Syria, the flotilla had some fun with NATO submarines . Then, just as combat operations were beginning, the loss of a fuel-starved MiG-29KR — one of the newest jets in Russia’s inventory—turned the deployment sour. Not long after , another jet—this time an Su-33—plunged into the water after an arrestor cable snapped during landing aboard the ship. In both cases the pilots were recovered safely. Soon after the second loss, fixed-wing operations from the carrier seemed to grind to a halt, and most of the ship’s complement of fighters was seen on the ground at Russia’s master air base in Syria. It appeared that the air wing’s operations had moved mainly ashore. @LLIntelligence data tracking the #Russian tug #NikolayChiker (accompanied #Kuznetsov outbound) leaves Syrian domain. pic.twitter.com/ALBjfXt6nP — Daryl Williamson (@LloydsListDaryl) January 6, 2017 Now that Aleppo has fallen and Russia, Turkey, Iran and the Assad regime have brokered a shaky ceasefire, the Kuznetsov and her escorts are heading home. The carrier was rumored to be leaving the area sometime in February or March, but its imminent withdrawal appears to be part of the larger draw-down of Russian forces in Syria currently underway. General Andrei Kartapoloy said on Friday that “Over two months, naval aviation pilots carried out 420 sorties, including 117 at night. Nearly all sorties were accompanied by severe hydrometeorological conditions. A total of 1,252 terrorist targets in Syria were destroyed” How many of these sorties were actually carried out from the ship remains unclear, and Russian “targets destroyed” metrics are always humorous in their grandeur. With the smoke-billowing carrier making its slow return home it will be interesting to see how Russian naval power, long starved for a ship to practice on, will cope with the Kuznetsov being out of commission. By the time the ship returns from its refit, it is likely its entire tactical fighter contingent will be made up of MiG-29KRs. That is, if the ship actually gets its long touted refit at all—or if its air wing remains intact to see the refit through. Then again, Russia has been remodeling old ships at a relatively brisk pace as part of the country’s military resurgence, it’s likely we haven’t seen the last of the Admiral Kuznetsov, or her lone air wing.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 21, 2016",The Chilean Military Has No Idea What This Flying Object Is,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the 11th of November, 2014, a Chilean Navy AS-532 Cougar helicopter equipped with a proven and powerful Wescam MX-15HD FLIR/EO turret captured a strange object flying across the sky. The helicopter was west of Santiago and near the ocean when the camera operator spotted another aircraft—or something—in their airspace, flying about 4,500 above the water. Visibility was excellent laterally, but there was a cloud layer at 10,000 and some broken clouds below. It was 50 degrees out and the helicopter was clipping along at 152mph when the sighting began. The Huffington Post reports that, just before 2pm, the FLIR operator noticed something in the distance with his naked eye. After pointing the Cougar’s FLIR in its direction, the object came into view much more clearly. It seemed to look like a helicopter operating a couple dozen miles away and traveling at about the same speed as the Cougar. The crew immediately began working with local radar controllers to spot the aircraft on their scopes, and to raise the unidentified aircraft flying in controlled airspace over the radio. All attempts at radar detection and communication were futile. Although the object was there visually, it seemed as if it didn’t exist as far as the various radar systems in the area were concerned. Over the next ten minutes the FLIR operator kept the MX-15 trained on the object and used the sensor’s infrared capabilities in dark-hot mode to obtain a well defined image of the target in question. After ten minutes the object started to be obscured by clouds and the Cougar crew had to return to base, ending its surveillance. The video was turned over to various government organizations, including military and the Chilean equivalent of the FAA, who collectively host an investigative subgroup that looks into these types of things—dubbed locally as UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena. Latin American culture is generally far less judgmental and open minded in regards to research of the unexplained—and UFOs. This group is named the CEFAA and is made up of academic researchers, scientists, technicians and military personnel. After many months of deliberation and examination of the evidence, the committee came up with no credible explanations as to what the MX-15 toting Cougar and its crew recorded that day. Not just that, but the aircrew’s highly professional report gave much more detail as to what the camera recorded. The pilot stated that the object was a“flat, elongated structure with two thermal spotlight-like discharges that did not coincide with the axel of motion.” The MX-15 operator stated that the object was “white with a semi-oval shape on the horizontal axis” and that “in two instances it discharged some type of gas or liquid with a high thermal track or signal.” Chilean Air Force photo specialists have gone through the film and have concluded that the footage is not only real, but the aircraft being filmed has true dimensional form and volume, and is under intelligent and independent control. The trails the object leaves behind are puzzling, as they appear to be released from two areas on the object, and are different in nature. Making the whole thing even odder is that the expulsions from the object were only visible when the camera was in IR mode. When it switched back to HD video, whatever was being released blended perfectly with the clouds around it. In other words, it appeared that the object was not only stealthy in nature, but whatever it was dispersing was too. The report at Huffington Post dives into all the various explanations that the committee investigating the sighting debunked and why. Without knowing the culture within the specific group investigating the incident, it may be a little challenging to take all their findings at face value. The truth is that looking through sensitive infrared devices while flying through the atmosphere can lead to some tricky illusions. Heat sources that look close up can be incredibly far away, and the dynamics of the camera moving, as well as clouds traveling at various distances and in various directions can lead to some puzzling imagery to say the least. Take a very similar case of Mexican military FLIR imagery that captured a formation of objects flying through the sky in 2004 . This incident became very widely known and the principal subject of multiple television programs. For almost a decade the event was deemed inexplicable, but has since been sorted out, and fairly easily so . It just goes to show you that everything is not as it seems when it comes to evaluating two dimensional imagery—and especially single spectrum video from a monochrome FLIR camera mounted on an aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2jinGhAPaJs On the other hand, in this instance the video depicting the object seemingly releasing a fluid or smoke-like substance is quite odd. Add the fact that two military pilots—trained and trusted observers—have given a straightforward account pointing toward no clear explanation lends credence to the mystery, at least for now. If there is any group of people that would have ideas about what we’re seeing in this video from the Chilean Cougar crew, it’s our readers and commenters. What do you think it is? Is it explainable without moving into the realm of science fiction? Let us know in the comments section below.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 13, 2019",60 Minutes Does an Infomercial On Drone Swarms For The Pentagon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently America’s premier TV news magazine, 60 Minutes, has pivoted toward more military technology segments than they featured in the past. As always, the Pentagon rolls out the red carpet for the iconic show; but much like the profiles they do on America’s wealthiest CEO’s and the “fascinating” companies they run, these segments can lean toward canned infomercials more than hard journalism. Last night’s segment “The Coming Swarm” was no different. You can watch the segment on the 60 Minutes site . David Martin did his usual oohing and ahhing on the capabilities the Pentagon is openly working on, most of which we talk about here regularly. The focus of the program was Perdix drone swarms , one of the DoD’s small, expendable, networked drone plays that has been in development for some time. We also got to see a silly demonstration of facial recognition and semi-autonomous networked fire (briefly featuring our old friend the M80 Stiletto ), as well as an unmanned sub-hunting boat we are all familiar with—DARPA’s ACTUV, aka the Sea Hunter. Sure, seeing video of a trio of F/A-18 Hornets executing a mass drop of 100 little Perdix drones over NAWS China Lake was fun (check out this other story and video on the test ), and there was some very light talk about autonomy and what it could mean for the future of warfare, but the topic was left feeling woefully underserved and unchallenged. It seemed as if someone made a call to the Pentagon public affairs office and asked “tell us about swarms” and that’s what the DoD cooked up. In other words, an infomercial for the Pentagon. Sure, the DoD is very happy to tout its unclassified miniature networked drone projects. But with all the talk about autonomous swarms, and how they can react faster as a team than humans—even little low-cost brick-sized ones—how was there no talk about larger, higher-end capabilities? In other words, it is all very DARPA-ish stuff, but as a defense reporter for decades, Martin seems to have very little insight into other capabilities that are supposedly out there, or worse, he’s not willing to ask about it. You’re left with the feeling that, once again, networked Unmanned Combat Air Systems (UCAVs) and even lower end UCAV-like systems do not exist, even at a conceptual level. It’s such a glaring omission, especially in a piece about flying drone swarms. The first question a well-briefed reporter would ask on the tarmac at NAWS China Lake while watching Pedix in action should be “Great, these flying shoe boxes are neat, but if they can do all this, what can fighter-sized drone swarms do, and why aren’t they flying around here too?” Maybe even more of an issue is Martin’s lack of follow-through with officials over their concerns of the “ethics” of unmanned autonomous warfare. This topic is having a huge impact on the future of America’s military and the ethical arguments surrounding it need more fleshing out at the highest levels. Although it may be an interesting topic to debate academically, the hard truth is that our enemies will have no problem handing over tactical decision making, including on what to kill and how to kill it, to a machine—if it means gaining a substantial tactical advantage. Take the Russians for instance, who have recently executed an entire air campaign over urban areas using unguided munitions . The thought that they would forestall development and deployment of unmanned autonomous weapon systems due to the ethical concerns is laughable. Another one of our potential peer-states, China, will leverage any weakness the US has in its collective armor. Choosing not to realize the massive increase in overwhelming force that fully autonomous drones could provide will be one of those weak links if we don’t pursue it first. In the end, slowing down the effectiveness of autonomous weaponry considerably by keeping it “semi-autonomous,” or maintaining a “man in the loop,” largely defeats its purpose and future foes will not curtail their own development of these systems for similar reasons. In other words, regardless of what some philosophers and lawyers may say, giving up supposedly the biggest technological combat edge since the creation of nuclear weapons by choice is a fateful decision. This is why follow up questions and clarity on where key people within the DoD and industry stand on this issue is so important. Like asking if its smart for the US to knowingly be giving such an advantage while the enemy certainly would not and is not? And yes, our potential foes, and many others, are developing these things too . With all this in mind, wouldn’t you think Martin would want to find out what these experts on the frontlines of swarm development’s arguments are for or against end-to-end autonomy for robotic combat systems? What about the opinion of experts who don’t make a paycheck from a DoD or an associated program? This is the autonomous swarm story—not a video rendition of what was in last month’s Popular Science magazine. At the end of his piece David asks: ”I’ve heard people say that autonomy is the biggest thing in military technology since nuclear weapons. Really?” Will Roper: “I think I might agree with that, David. I mean, if what we mean is biggest thing is something that’s going to change everything, I think autonomy is going to change everything.” We agree. Tell us why. If you are 60 Minutes , or any serious news organization for that matter, you should not have to “play ball” by not pushing the hard questions in exchange for cool visuals. Hopefully that’s not the case, as other 60 Minutes reporters, such as Lara Logan, don’t seem as constrained in their questioning of military officials. If it isn’t, Martin should use his platform more aggressively to probe into the shadowy areas of the subjects he covers, and there are plenty believe me. If he doesn’t know where those shadows fall, there are many who can guide him. Without these elements, the masses may be wow’d with great imagery, strong-sounding narration and questions that seem like they have impact. but really, you’re seeing a 15-minute prime-time infomercial for the cool stuff the Pentagon wants you to see, and opinions they want you to hear. In the end you can be nearly certain the high-end swarming autonomous combat craft are already here, albeit in small numbers. And, as I’ve stated in great detail before, if this is true then it’s a major problem. If it’s not true, and they don’t exist at all, we are in far worse trouble. The power of good journalism at the highest levels could help effect this somewhat precarious situation and allow us to get to the bottom of what exactly the DoD plans on doing when it comes to unleashing the swarm on its own accord.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 12, 2016",Sailors Make Snow Angels On Deck Of Supercarrier During Storm,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s not everyday you see the world’s largest and most complex weapons of war looking like they were docked at the North Pole. This weekend a harsh winter storm swept across much of the US, and Naval Station Norfolk was not left out. The Nimitz class nuclear-powered supercarrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69), and its pier-mate, the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77), both got a nice coating of powder during the winter weather. The creative public affairs folks aboard the “Ike” took advantage of the situation and snapped some shots of their ship awash in white. They even caught a group of sailors making snow angels on her flight deck—quite the magical moment indeed. It’s not like America’s carriers don’t ever venture into frigid climates, heck some of them are based in Washington State, which also gets hit with snow from time to time. Sailing through snow and sub-freezing temps just goes along with traversing the high seas, but seeing as ships can move around the worst of the weather in front of them—at least in many cases—large accumulations of snow on a supercarrier’s deck isn’t photographed all that regularly. The picture below—passed around quite a bit over the years—is one of the few depicting a modern super carrier executing air operations with snow covering its flight deck. Maybe Russia is onto something with their novel jet engine carrier deck blower system —at least for these types of conditions. In the past, especially before modern weather and navigation aids were available to mariners, carriers ran into and operated in some pretty frosty conditions. This was especially true during the Korean War. Winters off the Korean peninsula’s coastline could be especially frigid and stormy, blanketing carriers and their aircraft with snow. These fun photos come at a time when the US is experiencing a highly publicized “carrier gap” in which no US carriers were deployed anywhere in the world for the first week of the new year. This has not happened since World War II. It sounds a little more sudden and severe an issue than it really is. High operational tempos and the retirement of the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) long before the troubled USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) would be ready for operations was expected to cause availability problems and outright disruptions in the usually constant US supercarrier presence around the globe. The fact that the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77)—the Navy’s newest operational carrier—has blown through its intended six month maintenance window, taking 13 months instead, only aggravated the situation. The Navy has said that the Bush’s prolonged maintenance period was due to the extension of its last deployment causing more wear and tear on the relatively new vessel than originally planned—though there has also been some finger-pointing at the shipyard. If it had kept to its original schedule, the Regan would have been available to relieve the Ike and the carrier gap would have never occurred. The Navy announced last week that the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) would leave San Diego to execute joint training exercises in Asia, ending the short vacancy of America’s supercarriers from the world’s oceans. But still, there will not be a carrier in the middle east for months to come, and that is infuriating some in Washington . The reality is that, although a carrier strike group’s presence in the region may have a psychological impact on potential foes, there are dozens of major airfields available to the US throughout the region to launch strikes from. As such, the loss of carrier is not a big tactical issue, it may just set a poor strategic precedent in some people’s minds. The carrier gap problem is not going to get better soon, considering the Ford’s operational date remains a total question mark. With this in mind, now would be a perfect time for the Navy to step away from its extremely rigid all-supercarrier force structure strategy, but that’s an entirely different story altogether.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 6, 2017",F-35s Head To Japan As Chinese Bombers and Carrier Make Big Moves,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Marking a major milestone in its development, the long awaited operational deployment of the F-35 is underway. A group of Joint Strike Fighters from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121, the “Green Knights,” left their home base at MCAS Yuma in Arizona on Monday, starting their hop across the Pacific to their new home at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan . Once bedded down there, a total of 10 F-35Bs will begin to participate in a number of exercises, many of them multinational, with major allies in the region. The Japanese Ministry of Defense will be watching the deployment closely, as they’re a customer of the F-35 , with 28 F-35As on order for JASDF the and another 24 as options. South Korea is also planning to buy 40 of the jets, and will very likely be one of the first places the Green Knights will show up after arriving in the region. Traditionally, Marine Hornet squadrons forward based at Iwakuni have also found themselves flying alongside their Australian counterparts (another F-35 customer) as well as other Southeast Asian allies. These training detachments paired with the slowly eroding security situation in the region, alongside the unprecedented public affairs push that has accompanied the F-35 program in recent years, will likely result in a well publicized and eventful maiden operational deployment for the type. Towards the middle of 2017 VMFA-121 will get an extra six F-35Bs which are slated to go on a cruise aboard a Landing Helicopter Dock amphibious assault ship for the first time later in the year. Instead of using the USS Bonhomme Richard, which is already forward deployed to Japan, the ship will be swapped out for the USS Wasp. The Bonhomme Richard will be relocated to San Diego and the Wasp will have to make the long voyage from Norfolk, Virginia to its new home in Japan. This fairly elaborate swap is the result of an extensive number of costly improvements that have to be made to existing LHDs for them to handle low volumes of F-35Bs. This operational deployment will be the Wasp’s second in over a decade. Before a recent deployment the ship had largely been relegated to training and testing duties due to chronic issues with its combat management and support systems. Recent upgrades to its sensors, communications, self-defense and local area network should allow it to finally take on standard operational schedule. Another deployment for the F-35B, this one slated for early 2018, will see the USS Essex host a contingent of jets from VMFA-211. This deployment could end up seeing the F-35B take part in its first anti-ISIS sorties—which also could be its first combat missions of any kind—as the ship and its Amphibious Strike Group will likely to end up in the Persian Gulf. Getting the F-35 into the fight, or even operating internationally in any real capacity, is obviously a major goal for the troubled program. In the meantime, a recent response from Undersecretary of Defense Frank Kendall to a request for clarification from Senator John McCain has been made public, detailing further delays in the Joint Strike Fighter development and test program, which you can read here. The F-35Bs imminent arrival in Asia comes at a time when China is flexing its power projection muscles like never before. After taking an unprecedented route into the South China Sea and executing exercises in that tense region , China’s only carrier and its newly fully integrated battle group traversed the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday. The move sent pretty much the whole Taiwanese military into high alert, with fighters, surveillance aircraft, and naval vessels scrambled to monitor the Liaoning’s transit. This is not the first time the ship has taken the route, it did so back in late 2013—but it was not anywhere near as capable as it is today. With the Liaoning and her battlegroup approaching the operational threshold, it won’t be the last—this route will likely become a normal one for Liaoning as she sails from her home port in Qingdao to the turbulent waters of the South China Sea in the future. Vice Foreign Minister of China Liu Zhenmin said the following about Liaoning’s passage through the Taiwan Strait: “The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won’t have any impact on cross-Strait relations.” Taiwan clearly doesn’t feel the same about the matter. China’s ever more powerful Carrier Battle Group’s voyage north inside one of the tensest and heavily armed bodies of water on the planet comes just a day after Chinese airmen circumnavigated Taiwan counterclockwise using long-range aircraft, presumably H-6K bombers and intelligence gathering aircraft. Chinese Su-30 fighter escorts also picked up the aerial formation at both ends of its journey. This is not the first time China has executed this type of fairly provocative perimeter flight of Taiwan. In late November they did the same thing, although in a clockwise manner. That flight included two H-6K bombers, as well as Y-8 and Tu-154 surveillance planes. Just hours before the Taiwan circumnavigation flight, six Chinese H-6K long-range bombers, an electronic surveillance plane and an airborne early warning and control jet flew from the East China Sea, over the  Tsushima Strait and into the Sea of Japan and back. As a result, Japan and South Korea sent dozens of fighters and surveillance aircraft scrambling to monitor the operation. Although Chinese aircraft have passed through the area before, this was by far the largest aerial show of force over the Tsushima Strait put on by the Chinese military. Adding to this frenzy of activity, just this weekend China’s H-6K bombers were back at it again. This time aircraft circled China’s man-made island outposts in the Spratly Island archipelago that sit at the heart of Beijing’s territorial claims over nearly the entire South China Sea. This was the second time since the beginning of the year that Chinese bombers flew that route. China’s Navy and long-range PLAAF assets have been increasingly used to expand China’s regional influence and to project new levels of power in recent years . As the number of flights and naval drills have increased rapidly in their range, capability, internationality and complexity, tensions with competing powers in the region and with the US have also heightened. But the activity China has shown over the last few days is unprecedented. Now with America’s long awaited super fighter nesting for the first time in Asia, expect even more elaborate displays of expanding force from China in the coming months.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 26, 2017",Barack Obama’s Last Flight As President Aboard Air Force One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Among the best perks of being the leader of the free world are having the Presidential Motorcade , Marine One , and Air Force One at your disposal. Going from flying commercial to traveling in a 4,000 square foot flying White House that is as much an icon as it is a mode of transportation—one that is all dedicated to you—is an abrupt change of lifestyle few have experienced. In reality, Air Force One is any USAF aircraft POTUS is flying on, but the vast majority of the time that aircraft is one of two identical, highly modified 747-200s—designated VC-25As by the Air Force. The President also flies on USAF C-32As—modified Boeing 757s—which are often used by the Vice President and thus referred to loosely as Air Force Two. Regardless, with his last trip aboard the jet—a roundtrip from Washington DC to Chicago for his farewell address—the President has spent a whopping 2,799 hours and six minutes flying aboard an aircraft with the vaunted Air Force One callsign. Those flight hours, equal up to just over 116 days, were made up of 445 missions and included destinations in 56 countries and 49 states. Some of those trips were routine, some were historic and some even ended comedic . Behind the scenes, vastly more hours were flown by the pair of VC-25As and cadre of C-32As for training, pre-positioning and repositioning flights, as well as acting as backups and spares while the President flew around the globe. Like many of the Presidents before him, Obama has made numerous comments about his affinity for Air Force One, which started after his very first flight aboard back in early 2009. After which he stated with a big smile “It’s pretty nice!” President Obama seen on his first flight aboard Air Force One as Commander In Chief back in early 2009: Just last October, as Obama’s second term was drawing to a close, the President said the following when discussing new rules to protect airline flyers : “I’m going to be honest with you—one of the best parts of being president is having your own plane. And I’m going to miss it a lot… Because up until I ran for this office, I was mostly flying coach. So I know what a pain the whole process can be – from searching for the best prices to that feeling you get when the baggage carousel stops and yours still hasn’t come out.” The Obama’s have one more opportunity to fly on a VC-25A, although it won’t be flying as Air Force One. Instead it will be using the Special Air Mission “SAM” callsign that the aircraft of the 89th Airlift Wing, based out of Andrews AFB, use when flying around without POTUS or VPOTUS onboard. President Obama celebrating the 20th anniversary of the VC-25A with its crew: Following the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, a VC-25A or C-32A is made available to the outgoing President to fly the ex-First Family home. In this case, seeing as the Obama’s are going to be living in Washington DC for the foreseeable future, they will probably take the jet on a family vacation, and return home on a civilian registered aircraft. If the Obama’s are in the sky as President-elect Trump is sworn in, the jet’s pilots will actually request a callsign change in flight. Unlike the Obamas, the incoming President has a long history of owning airliners that have been converted into lavish VIP transports, as well as personal helicopters. He also has strong feelings about the replacement program for the current pair of aging VC-25As. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how Donald Trump perceives his access to Air Force One. In some ways it’s a step down, luxury-wise, compared to his own personal 757—but no aircraft is as instantly recognizable or a diplomatically impressive as a Blue, White and Gold Air Force One.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 28, 2019",Pakistan Closer To Nuclear Second-Strike Capability After Sub Missile Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fielding a nuclear-tipped cruise missile that can be launched from a submarine will give Pakistan something it has wanted for years—a credible nuclear second strike deterrent. Earlier in the week the Pakistani Navy announced that they successfully test-fired just that for the first. Regardless of if the missile launch was as successful as Pakistan claims it was or not, more tests will follow and it’s likely just a matter of time before the missile becomes operational. Second strike capability means that even if a full-on surprise nuclear barrage were to knock out a country’s nuclear weapons capability, that country still has the ability to make their attacker pay dearly via a retaliatory nuclear attack. It is considered the pinnacle of nuclear deterrent strategies. Pakistan’s Babur-3 submarine-launched cruise missile (SLCM) that was tested just weeks ago in the Indian Ocean is an evolution of the land-based Babur-2. The Babur series of cruise missiles were developed partially via reverse engineering US Navy BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles that crashed in Pakistan in 1998. The first and second land-based versions offered just another layer of attack capability for the Pakistani military, but the submarine-launched Babur-3’s strategic significance is far greater. The ground-launched Babur-2 seen below is very similar to the submarine-launched Babur-3: Pakistani military officials claim that the sea-skimming Babur-3 has a 280 miles range and is highly accurate. The missile will likely end up on Pakistan’s three French-designed Agosta 90B class—locally known as the Khalid class—diesel-electric submarines. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rILN-oEvlec These 2,000 ton displacement submarines are quite advanced and are built for open-ocean missions. They can stay submerged for multiple days at a time via their MESMA air independent propulsion (AIP) system . Normal weaponry for the type includes SM39 Exocet anti-ship missiles and 533mm torpedoes. With the Babur 3’s supposed range of just under 300 miles, and with just three submarines assigned to the task of deploying them (eventually), Pakistan’s fledgling ability to deliver a second strike on an enemy state is quite limited, but it may still be credible. It remains unclear if Pakistan will keep one boat at sea at all times or if they will train to surge-deploy at a moment’s notice. Other operational questions remain as well, including what type of command and control interface will be used to authorize a submarine originated nuclear strike. The Agosta class SSK underway: A second strike deterrent is largely achieved by deploying nuclear submarines loaded with nuclear-warhead laden submarine-launched ballistic missiles, but the use of nuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard small diesel-electric submarines as a “poor man’s” second strike capability is not new. Israel has put the concept to use , leveraging their increasingly capable Dolphin class diesel-electric submarines loaded with nuclear-tipped Popeye Turbo cruise missiles . Other countries may be looking at deploying similar concepts in the future. Although still a far cry from India’s 6,000 ton displacement Arihant class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (one is service and three others planned) and the short-range K-15 or medium-range K-4 ballistic missiles they carry, Pakistan’s nuclear armed Agosta class boats at least get the country in the second strike game, but in a very minimal way. The Indian Navy’s anti-submarine capability is credible, and their submarine fleet includes multiple diesel-electric submarines of different origin, as wells a Russian Akula II class nuclear fast attack boat . So keeping an eye on Pakistan’s tiny Agosta 90B fleet will be possible, although it is not clear what level of confidence the Indian Navy has that they can always keep the boats in their own submarines’ crosshairs. Not just that, but even attempting to do so will tie up valuable assets that could better be assigned to deterring other regional nuclear powers, like China. The Akula II clas INS Chakra: Complicating India’s counter-submarine conundrums will be the eight AIP equipped diesel-electric submarines Pakistan is buying from China, the first of which will become operational in 2022. These boats—dubbed the Hangour class —will be based on an export configuration of the Yuan class , and will likely be outfitted to fire the Babur-3 like their Agosta 90B counterparts. Pakistan’s Babur-3 test also comes as tensions broil over continuing skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces in the Kashmir region and as India launched a very powerful nuclear-capable missile of its own —the Agni V ICBM. This was the fourth test launch of the long-range weapon, and this time it was fired from a road-mobile transporter-erector-launcher . Although the Agni V is as much or even more of a threat to China as it is to Pakistan, it is just another reminder for Islamabad of how New Delhi is running away technologically in recent years. With this in mind, the development of the Babur-3 is just another fairly desperate move to keep some sense of strategic parity in play between the two bitter foes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",EA-18G Growler Crew Saved By Portland-Based PJs After Canopy Explosion,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Friday a pair of EA-18G Growlers belonging to VAQ-132 “Scorpions” flew down to Portland International Airport on a special mission—to say thank you to two 304th Rescue Squadron airmen for rushing to help their squadron mates right when they needed it most. Details continue to emerge surrounding a bizarre and nearly deadly mishap that happened on a frigid morning at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island last December. The incident occurred as three Growlers were preparing for a mission, when upon startup one of the aircraft began to over-pressurize. The pilot and electronic warfare officer, trapped inside the jet’s clear canopy, were subject to some of the worst conditions a human can survive. The pressure built so quickly and violently that the jet’s plexiglass canopy exploded, sending shards flying. VAQ-132’s Commander Crawford gave a simple yet telling description of just how bad the effects of the incident were on the crew, telling a KGW reporter that “The scene was unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed. Some of the stuff…yeah…a little horrific.” As emergency crews reacted to the incident, two pararescuemen—Staff Sergeant John Mellancamp and Staff Sergeant Ryan Penne—both from Portland’s elite 304th Rescue Squadron—were on the base and quickly put their unique set of skills to work to save the Growler crew’s lives. Pararescuemen, known more popularly as “PJs,” are masters at recovering personnel deep inside enemy territory and providing emergency lifesaving care in the most inhospitable of environments, namely in combat. Gunshot wounds, traumatic brain injuries, losses of limbs, concussive trauma, severe burns and many other horrors of the battlefield are what they specialize in treating on the fly. They generally act as well-armed conveyors of life that do anything possible to keep their patients living until they can make it to a surgical center, hopefully within the “golden hour” where their chances of survival are highest. In the last decade and a half of perpetual warfare, PJs have exercised their skill set tirelessly, being some of the most valued assets on the modern battlefield. As you can probably tell by the description above, they were the right people there at the right time to help the stricken Growler crew. Once the aircrew were in the ambulance, the men knew their condition was critical. One had a traumatic injury to the head and the other had major damage to their lungs and was suffocating. “As soon as I got in the ambulance with John, we knew this was extremely serious… When someone is having pressure in their chest you decompress it by putting a needle through the chest to release air so the lung can re-inflate.” said Staff Sergeant Mellencamp. The men went to work quickly along with other first responders, and once on the helicopter inbound to Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center they continued the chestal decompression procedure over and over again, keeping their patient alive, barely. Due to their actions and those of everyone involved that day, the Growler crew lived. One was just released from the hospital while the other will hopefully be released in the coming weeks. In a choking tribute to the two PJs, Crawford stated that “Not only did you do your job in an exemplary manner that day, but you saved their lives. You touched more people’s lives than you know. I know for a fact that having Ryan and John there that day was definitely part of that chain that enabled my buddy to be discharged from the hospital yesterday.” The Scorpions CO handed the two men engraved bottles of scotch as a thank you from his squadron. As for what caused such a heinous incident that resulted in a three-day long temporary stand-down of the entire Growler and Super Hornet communities, that remains under investigation, but at least one possible culprit has been identified . The cold weather combined with the spraying down of the aircraft before the mission has been identified by engineers as possibly having at least a partial hand in the overpressurization and the explosion of the canopy that followed. Mitigation measures have since been put into place so that these combined factors won’t present themselves again, and thus invite another mishap. New procedures have also been initiated for ground crews so that they can quickly identify and correct the issue if it occurs again. It is also reported that the aircrew were troubleshooting environmental control system issues at the time the event occurred, which is unsurprising considering the outcome, and some sources have mentioned a valve system that is meant to relieve pressure under such circumstances had failed, although this is not official at this time. The Hornet fleet, Growler included, has been plagued with issues surrounding its environmental systems. The Super Hornet’s issues are supposedly related to its onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS) that supplies air to the aircraft’s crew. The legacy Hornet’s issues, which have been less severe, are thought to be due to the jet’s cabin pressure system as it does not have an OBOGS and uses liquid oxygen instead. Between May 2010 and October 2015 there had been 297 documented physiological incidents of all types on Hornets, but most have to do with hypoxia (the lack of oxygen to the brain and its debilitating effects) or a total and sudden loss of airflow to the aircrew. None of the incidents involved a death or a crash of any sort, but still the problem is well known within the Hornet community. Although the Navy has been trying to fix the problems for years, and has put all types of measures in place to lessen its effects, its direct cause, or causes, remains a mystery. A report on the issue is due from the Navy on December 1st on this year. At this time there is no known evidence that ties the incident at Whidbey Island last month to past Hornet and Super Hornet’s environmental control system woes. Additionally, no similar occurrences have been noted in over 15 years of operational flying of Super Hornets and Growlers, and over 35 years of legacy Hornet operations. Still, even if there was a direct tie, it is very doubtful the Navy could keep the jets from flying as a solution was figured out they make up the entirety of the service’s tactical fighter capabilities. Even the prolonged grounding of just the Super Hornet and Growler communities would be catosphic as far as the Navy’s combat punch is concerned.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Army Has Finally Picked A New Sidearm,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a battle between a number of prominent small arms manufacturers, including finalists Fabrique Nationale America, Beretta USA, Sig Sauer and Glock, the US Army has announced the winner of the high-stakes XM-17 Modular Handgun System (MHS) contract. Vaunted Swiss small arms manufacturer Sig Sauer and its MHS derivative of the polymer-framed P320 pistol has been crowned the victor. Army acquisition official Steffanie Easter stated the following in a release: “I am tremendously proud of the Modular Handgun System team. By maximizing full and open competition across our industry partners, we have optimized private sector advancements in handguns, ammunition and magazines and the end result will ensure a decidedly superior weapon system for our warfighters.” Sig Sauer P320 based MHS: The Army narrowed the competitors down to the Sig Sauer P320 and the Glock 17 and 19 last month, and given that the Glock 19 has become standard issue for American special operations units, many saw Glock as the likely winner. Yet the Glock did not feature anywhere near the modularity that Sig Sauer’s P320 does. The selection of a new pistol is the first for the Army since 1985 when the service gave up its 45ACP 1911s for the higher capacity but smaller caliber 9mm Beretta M9. It remains unclear what caliber, or calibers, the P320 will be setup to accommodate. The Modular Handgun System seeked to find one platform that could be adapted to a whole slew of missions, with different barrels, grip sizes, safety configurations, trigger groups, slide lengths, and even frame sizes, to be available under a common overall design. For instance, for a general issue sidearm, a standard length barrel, manual safety, combat trigger group and full sized frame could be provided and the user could customize the weapon’s grip to best fit their hand size. For special operations, a threaded barrel for mounting a suppressor, a double action trigger group with lighter trigger pull and no manual safety can be fitted, as well as raised tritium night sights and extended capacity magazine. For concealed carry, a subcompact frame version of the P320 with either trigger group and safety setup could be configured. The bottom line is that not only are main components interchangeable, as are some calibers—such as 9mm, 40S&W and 357Sig—but the manual of arms is universal. Just some of the interchangeable components under the P320 family of firearms: One of the most notable features of the P320, and many of its MHS competitors, is that it’s a polymer framed pistol, which is a massive deviation from the steel and aluminum M9 and the all-steel 1911s that came before them. Polymer pistols have become the norm not the exception in the handgun industry over the last three decades, offering extreme durability, reduced maintenance, lower-cost and especially less weight than their metal-framed cousins. The P320 is also striker fired, and does not feature a traditional hammer. If the P320 based MHS moves through extended testing and development as planned, and sticks to its budget, the Army is slated to buy nearly 300,000 of them. The vast majority will be the full size versions, but thousands of subcompact sized units will also be purchased. Another 200,000 MHS pistols could be bought by the other services as well if the gun proves to be a success. As it sits now the Army contract alone, which includes accessories, spare parts, and even some ammunition, is worth up to a massive $580 million. Considering the huge size of the program and its implications to the winner, there is a good chance Glock, or some of the other entrants, could officially protest the decision. Like the Beretta 92/M9 that came before it, civilian sales could eclipse the size of the Army contract altogether due to the type’s potential affiliation as the Pentagon’s pistol of choice. Think of it as the ultimate endorsement for a handgun. Beretta M9-public domain: Sig Sauer is well known both in military, law enforcement and civilian firearms communities for extremely high quality and long-lasting pistols. The Sig P226 is maybe the most iconic of the company’s products, a weapon that served the US Navy Special Warfare community for decades. Today the P226 is being replaced by the polymer-framed Glock 19 in Navy service, but it is still considered one of the most durable handguns around with a legendarily smooth trigger. The Army’s long meandering road to acquiring a new sidearm has been so bumpy and at times so ridiculous that it has come up time and time again as an example of how broken the Pentagon’s procurement process has become. Just last March , Army General and Chief of Staff Mark Milley, frustrated with how convoluted the Army’s sidearm replacement program had become, stated the following to a Washington think tank: “We’re not figuring out the next lunar landing. This is a pistol. Two years to test? At $17 million? You give me $17 million on a credit card, and I’ll call Cabela’s tonight, and I’ll outfit every soldier, sailor, airman and Marine with a pistol for $17 million. And I’ll get a discount on a bulk buy… It’s not a lack of oversight. We’re not asking for free rein, let’s go party… I’m saying: Let me—and then hold me accountable—figure out what type of pistol we need, and let me go buy it and not go through nine years of scrutiny.” Sure, there is some hyperbole in there, and one very unrealistic claim, but you can see what he is getting at. Many handguns, both domestic and foreign, feature very high reliability, modularity in some aspects, and are available off the shelf for around $400-600. Not only that, but some of them are warrantied for life. The Army’s XM17 MHS requirements are spelled out in a whopping 350 pages of small print, something that seems totally absurd for such a basic yet necessary capability. Some in congress also want the program restructured and simplified, or reset entirely. The highly proven Glock 19 is now widespread in US special operations units, leaving some to think it was most favored to win the MHS contract: There has also been concerns that the Army has reached needlessly far in terms of the modularity portion of their new pistol requirement. There is debate as to how such a highly modular pistol will fair in harsh environmental conditions and over long periods of time compared to more traditional designs. So far it seems by all accounts the P320 is in fact a very robust weapon, but the final series of testing the Army will not put it through will have to validate that once and for all. Above all else, the result of the competition is a huge hit to Beretta who has leveraged their position for decades as thee supplier of the pistol of the American armed services.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Storm Brewing Over Royal Navy Trident Ballistic Missile Test Failure,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last June the Royal Navy nuclear ballistic missile submarine HMS Vengeance was executing certification training off the coast of Florida. Part of that training included the launch of a unarmed Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile—the same type that equips America’s Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. This event was the first Trident test launch by the Royal Navy in four years and was viewed not just as a way to gauge the readiness of Vengeance’s crew, but also the reliability of the UK’s nuclear weapons delivery system. Reports state that the missile was meant to fly over 5,600 miles to a target off the coast of Africa, but instead went awry, flying in the complete opposite direction towards the US. The Times reports that the recently disclosed failure caused massive disruptions at the highest levels of government in London, and Downing Street decided to cover up the results of test through deep classification. While it’s known that the test failed, the reason behind the failure remains undisclosed. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hhIBksIt0GU The impact of this failed test within the UK has been dramatic. Just a month after the botched flight, Parliament voted on the future of the UK’s nuclear arsenal. This specifically included renewing its reliance on the Trident II missile system, and on the building of four new Successor class submarines to host them, a program slated to cost $50 billion. Without knowledge of the missile failure that occurred just weeks before the vote, the measure passed 472 to 117 . Now, the relatively new Prime Minister, Theresa May, who was strongly in favor of the initiative, is in under fire for suspicions that she knowingly let the vote proceed without disclosing this important piece of information to lawmakers. There may be reasons to keep a launch failure like the one that occurred last June secret, especially considering the Trident II and just four Vanguard class SSBNs represent the entirety of the UK’s nuclear arsenal. Such a launch failure degrades the credibility of the deterrent, especially at a time when increased tensions with heavily nuclear armed Russia is a reality. If it were disclosed that the missile’s failure was caused not by some errant malfunction or manufacturing error, but by the vessel’s crew itself, it could be even more damning. Still, not disclosing the failure, especially considering the political debate at the time, is leaving some well versed in London defense politics scratching their heads. Admiral Lord West, former first sea lord and chief of the naval staff stated : “If a firing goes wrong you should say that it’s gone wrong, unless there’s something that means it’s so fundamentally wrong that it means the whole system is no longer viable otherwise we’re rather like the Soviet Union used to be, or like North Korea or China, where they won’t admit to things going wrong… I think it is bizarre and stupid that they didn’t say that there’d been a firing and that there’d been a missile malfunction, but it was a minor fault.” The Royal Navy’s nuclear ballistic missile submarine program has already had more than its fair share of publicity pitfalls in recent years.At a time when the future of the force was being debated furiously in Parliament, knowledge of the such a missile failure could have swayed lawmakers to step away from the program entirely. Regardless, considering the timing of the botched missile test and the vote, classifying the failed test now looks suspect, no matter what the circumstances surrounding it. Yesterday, Prime Minister May was pressed about what she knew about the test and when, her only response was:  “I have absolute faith in our Trident missiles. When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident.” Trident II was originally procured by Prime Minister Margret Thatcher from the Reagan administration in the 1980s. It, alongside a small fleet of cutting-edge ballistic missile submarines (which became the Vanguard class) were seen as a highly credible second-strike deterrent aimed toward keeping Soviet aggression at bay. Some have suggested that the failure of the Trident II D5 missile, long thought to be among the most dependable and mature ICBM/SLBMs on the planet, also puts into question America’s own submarine-based nuclear weapons capabilities. Although a failure is never a good thing, especially considering the weapon involved could eradicate hundreds of thousands or even millions of people, the Trident II D5 remains a very reliable weapon system, with 161 successful test launches under its belt. One of these tests happened just a few months ago , and over the last two years multiple Trident D5s have been launched, one of which resulted in major public attention . The US Navy plans on continuing to upgrade the Trident II, allowing the type to serve for decades to come. Additionally, the Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarines that are slated to replace the Ohio class in the coming decades are being designed around the missile. These new SSBNs are intended to serve well into the second half of the century. Each Trident II D5 missile costs roughly $38 million, weighs 130,000 lbs, and has a maximum range estimated to be around 7,500 miles. That distance can decrease significantly with a full load of warheads and depending on the missile’s flight profile. Trident II can carry up to 14 warheads ranging in yield from the 100 kilotons (W76) to 455 kilotons (W88) in Multiple Independently Targetable reentry Vehicles (MIRVs ). Less warheads are carried in practice, due to START and now New START limitations, and to aid more flexible targeting; which may also allow for more decoys and penetration aids to be deployed during the midcourse phase of the missile’s attack. The exact nature of the Trident II’s countermeasure capabilities remains a closely guarded secret, but the UK in particular used decoys on their Polaris SLBMs under the name “Chevaline” before deploying the Trident. A diagram of how Chevaline worked (wikicommons/Brian.Burnell): Now that the heat is on the Prime Minister we’ll have to see if she moves to get the details surrounding the Trident missile failure declassified once and for all. Major media outlets and their undisclosed sources can report the details of these incidents incorrectly, and what sounds like a catastrophic failure could have been a much simpler issue, or not even a real failure at all. Even the direction of the missile and why it is flying in such a manner can be misinterpreted by reporters with limited knowledge of military operations. But without an official description of the incident to go by there is no way to correct inadvertently mistaken facts or give a more insightful analysis. Certainly whatever is thought to have been the issue has been or is already in the process of being fixed, as both the UK and the US ballistic missile submarine programs depend on it. Still, a failure even of a nuclear tipped missile is bound to happen occasionally as the world has yet to find a perfect rocket system, even for space travel. And it may seem terrifying to some degree, but even in this day and age of highly reliable smart munitions, all expendable weapon systems have a failure rate, even those that can singlehandedly destroy entire population centers of the planet. We will keep you updated as the story progresses. Update- 1/22/17 1:20pm PST: CNN says that their source has confirmed the missile failure and stated that its “trajectory was part of an automatic self-destruct sequence. The official said the missile diverted into the ocean—an automatic procedure when missile electronics detect an anomaly.” Contact the author Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Brazilian Air Force C-130M was about to land at Chile’s snow covered Teniente Rodolfo Marsh airport on the northern tip of Antarctica when everything went wrong. The aircraft suffered a total failure of its right-side undercarriage, sending it careening down the slick runway. During its roll-out the number four prop smacked into a snowbank and eventually the aircraft made a violent ground-loop before coming to a halt facing nearly the opposite direction in which it came. Thankfully nobody was killed or even injured in the incident. It never ceases to amazing me just how tough these aircraft are. Here is video of the incident: https://youtube.com/watch?v=xunOcGYcK_k Another angle: The crash happened on December 27th, 2014 and since then the Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB) has supposedly been repairing the aircraft, with plans to fly it out of the remote airport sometime in the last couple of months—though there is no available information if this is indeed going to happen or already has. A picture of the aircraft shortly after the incident, shows that it’s surprisingly well intact—but carrying out repairs at such a remote location would not be a simple or inexpensive task. The FAB retains a force of roughly 15 C-130s, two of which are aerial tankers, so losing even one aircraft is a significant blow to the inventory. A Chilean C-130 making a JATO assisted departure from the airport in 2002: Some inside-the-cockpit footage of C-130 ops out of the remote airport: C-130s are common visitors at the Antarctic airfield. Other aircraft used for tourism or cargo and scientific charters also use the airport regularly, although there is no consistent airline service to it. The runway is 4,238 feet long and is made out of packed gravel. Here’s a photo of a C-130 at the airport during its opening in 1980: As you can see in the satellite imagery below, the outpost experiences some pretty severe weather differences throughout the year, and overrunning its thresholds at either end would likely result in disaster. Update- 1/22/17 4:45pm PST: One of our readers and commenters “Hupiscratch” found an article that states the Brazilian government is working to dismantle the C-130 and transport it back home via ship, and that process is likely underway now.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After having a less than stellar cruise to the Mediterranean , Russia’s carrier and its armada are making their slow voyage back to their home base in frigid Severomorsk. As it made its way north through the English Channel, the UK Ministry of Defense not only shadowed the flotilla with a Type 23 Frigate, the HMS St. Albans , but it also sent a trio of Eurofighter Typhoons to make low passes near and around it. The results of the mission included some awesome pics, check them out below: All images MoD Crown Copyright. Some may wonder what objective is being met by sending Typhoons out on such a mission. Beyond a show of force and a killer photo op, their presence is likely at least partially a symptom of the fact that the UK has been without a proper maritime patrol aircraft for many years. This deficiency is planned to be righted by an order of P-8 Poseidons which will be able to accomplish myriad of missions beyond basic sea control, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare duties. Defense Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, said the following about monitoring the Kuznetsov as it made its way through the channel: “We are keeping a close eye on the Admiral Kuznetsov as it skulks back to Russia; a ship of shame whose mission has only extended the suffering of the Syrian people. We are man-marking these vessels every step of the way around the UK as part of our steadfast commitment to keep Britain safe.” Not friendly words, to say the least.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 12, 2017",President Trump Takes First Flights On Marine One and Air Force One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly a week in office, Donald Trump crossed the East Lawn for the first time to board a “White Top” VH-3D operated by HMX-1 , better known by its callsign when the President is aboard—Marine One. He made the quick flight to Andrews AFB where he boarded a VC-25A for the first time, even more famously known by its callsign when the President is aboard— Air Force One . Vice President Mike Pence had a similar set of experiences today as well, taking a VH-3D from his home near the US Naval Observatory to Andrews AFB where he boarded a C-32A, dubbed Air Force Two while he’s aboard. Both were headed to nearby Philadelphia for a retreat with fellow Republican lawmakers. Although Trump forgot the signature “turn and wave” before entering Air Force’s One’s forward cabin door, he did seem to settle right in on the aircraft. He quickly took up shop in the President’s office, his large leather chair draped in a new custom-tailored Commander In Chief Air Force One jacket. Aboard the Trump invited pool reporters and photographers into his office for a photo op, where he commented “Beautiful… Great plane… Really beautiful” about his new flying office. When asked how it compared to his personal 757, he said “Well that’s a good one too, but this is a very special plane, for a lot of reasons outside of just being a plane.” Trump seemed more excited about his new jacket than anything else stating “They just gave me that, pretty cool jacket right?” He then turned tables on the reporters asking how flying conditions were on the famous jet and asking “do you like this better than your other plane? I think so, right? You hit the big time right?” Trump has a long history with large lavish jets and helicopters and probably knows more about the subject than any President before him. He has also very publicly questioned the cost of the USAF’s Air Force One replacement program, taking Boeing to task on the price . We’ll still have to see how that all pans out, but for now he seems more than happy with the aircraft he has inherited from Barack Obama and it is yet to be known how much he plans to travel as the 45th President of the United States. If history tells us anything, each President has taken to the air more than their predecessor. It’s pretty unlikely that will change under the Trump administration.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 13, 2017","Secretary of Defense Mattis Orders Reviews Of F-35, Air Force One Replacement Programs","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of memos were signed by Secretary of Defense James Mattis today that demand an immediate review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization programs. Not surprisingly, these are the same two programs Donald Trump chose to make examples of as President Elect. Although the move to formally begin an official Pentagon review of both of them is a major development, don’t expect much to come out of it. Here’s why. First off, the F-35 review memo: As you can see, Mattis is echoing exactly what Trump and his Twitter megaphone announced weeks ago , although there is more clarity in the Mattis memo. SecDef Mattis directs the Deputy Secretary of Defense to lead a review aimed at finding ways to lower costs associated with the Joint Strike fighter, but also adds the need to compare specifically the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the carrier-capable F-35C . Additionally, the review will also look into the possibility that Boeing’s Super Hornet Advanced , which includes a series of capability and rudimentary low-observable upgrades, can provide a “competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” There is no mention of an evaluation of alternatives for the USAF’s F-35A , or the USMC’s F-35B . In essence, this appears to be just a tactic to reduce F-35 program costs to the government. This is all well and good, and it certainly fits in with Donald Trump’s “art of the deal” strategy for negotiations. But seeing as the initiative does not include looking for alternatives to these F-35 variants, which make up the vast majority of planned F-35 orders, program cancellation seems all but a non issue. F-35A on display (Lockheed Martin photo): On the Navy’s side of things the memo paints a different picture, as it asks for direct capability comparisons between the F-35C and existing Super Hornets, as well as those proposed under the Super Hornet Advanced configuration. Although ordering more Super Hornets in either configuration, or even a hybrid of the two, can help with slowing F-35C purchases, no configuration of the jet can replace the F-35C capability-wise. The Super Hornet Advanced, with its stealthy improvements made mainly to its forward hemisphere while in some configurations, as well as its conformal fuel tanks, upgraded cockpit displays, sensors and engines, represents a versatile and capable fighter, but it isn’t an F-35 and it never will be for an exhaustive number of reasons, stealthiness just being one. The Super Hornet Advanced also represents the end of the line developmentally for the Hornet. That’s not to say the F-35C is a necessary purchase for the Navy, but new capabilities will have to invested into to take its place alongside updated Super Hornets. Namely the introduction of advanced unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) could provide America’s supercarriers with a very stealthy aircraft that can put targets at risk deep into contested airspace and, like the F-35,  can work to collect intelligence while in the enemy’s own backyard. Not just that, but UCAVs bring a range of other benefits along with them that no manned fighter can compete with. In the end, if the Navy were to axe the F-35C—an aircraft that is already far along in development and has training squadrons established on both coasts —the Super Hornet can not fill its shoes alone. As such a significant downgrade in planned capability will be realized unless investments are not quickly made in the aforementioned unmanned alternative. The Navy is currently working on fielding the MQ-25 Stingray, an unmanned carrier-borne aircraft whose design prioritizes aerial refuelling and sensor hauling above deep strike and other offensive roles. This initiative can, and should be morphed into a high-end multi-role asset that includes deep strike and reconnaissance in its repertoire in order to get this unmanned capability fielded as early as possible, with or without the F-35C. Originally, the plan was to have this happen, where a full-up carrier-borne UCAV would be fielded by the next decade, but the concept got downgraded to a tanker, likely in part to protect the F-35C program. The X-47B proved UCAV shipboard operations were entirely possible: The thing is, replacing the F-35C with a highly capable stealth drone, one that features longer range than either the F-35 or the Super Hornet will ever realize, and can work as part of a swarm to overwhelm the enemy, doesn’t seem to be on the table at all. If Mattis’s memo asked for comparisons between the F-35C, Super Hornet Advanced, and an advanced navalized UCAV, the F-35C may truly be at risk. But seeing that did not happen, it really isn’t. In the end, all this is most likely a way for Trump to apply extreme pressure on Lockheed to get costs of the F-35 program down, and to get them to give up some of their profits in the process. As to how much it will actually affect America’s current F-35 procurement plan, I would venture to guess not much at all. The Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program memo: Nothing is new here that Trump has not already said himself, aside from the fact that pressure is now coming directly from the DoD in the form of a formal review, not just from the White House, and mainly from President Trump’s Twitter account. There is a certain set of minimal capabilities an aircraft operating as Air Force One needs in order to succeed at being both a flying White House and a survivable top-tier command and control platform. There may be some fat in the existing Air Force One replacement concept based on the 747-8i, but there probably isn’t much. The DoD learned their lesson on this during the VH-71 debacle of the last decade. Once again, Boeing will likely be asked to substantially drop its profits and increase its risk in order to build the pair of iconic jets (a third may be ordered later). Additionally, the Pentagon’s review would be smart to examine what extending the existing VC-25A fleet’s lifepsan would entail, and how other aircraft could be used to offset some of the Presidential airlift mission—specifically the C-32A and even the E-4B. Trump on his first flight aboard Air Force One (AP photo): But once again, the orders to review both these programs were all but a certainty considering what Trump has stated over the last couple of months. What is missing from all this is a much broader, systemic plan for widespread defense procurement and acquisition reform. Nor does it address the maelstrom of other major defense programs that are massively troubled. Basically it seems that these two programs, one massive and one almost laughably small, are being made examples of and are being used in a very public manner to show that the Trump administration is putting an end to business as usual in the Pentagon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fearless US Coast Guard gets some pretty strange calls, and saving people from hideously bad decisions make up a good portion of them. A great example of this came about last week when it was forecast that some monster swells would be pounding the northern California coastline, in particular the shores of picturesque Humboldt County. Here was the USCG’s warning from January 26th: “Overnight, the high swell has been traveling towards NW California coast. At around 11 pm Wednesday, Buoy 46015 saw wave height rise to 19 feet with a wave period of 19 seconds. This indicates a surf height of 27 feet. A High Surf Advisory is in effect for west and northwest facing beaches along NW California coast through 4 pm this afternoon. After that, sneaker wave threat will persist through Friday afternoon.” These monster swells always attract onlookers and photographers, but obviously getting anywhere near them is a horrible and possibly life ending idea. Apparently, a man in a Nissan pickup truck with Arkansas plates thought otherwise. At around 11AM last Thursday, he actually decided to drive out onto Humboldt Bay’s North Jetty directly in the crashing waves’ path. During his short voyage his truck was battered with waves from multiple directions, dropped into a ditch as was disabled. What happened next is depicted below in the video filmed by a much more safely conscious observer, Tyler Whiteside: After onlookers saw the man making the drive out onto the jetty and immediately get stuck, they called 911. The Coast Guard was on site within minutes with a 47 foot lifeboat and a MH-65C Dolphin helicopter from nearby USCAS Humboldt Bay . A land or water rescue was deemed impossible, so the MH-65 was the only viable option. The Dolphin crew seemed to pick the perfect time to winch down the rescue swimmer to pluck the man to safety. The danger involved in such a rescue operation could not be anywhere more clear. The rescue swimmer is tied to a winch-line attached to a helicopter hovering in the wind above, surrounded by unforgiving concrete and a vehicle weighing thousands of pounds that can be thrown around like pool toy under the power of the crashing waves. Amazing work once again by the heroes of the USCG. It is just awesome what these people do on a daily basis.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Deadly SEAL Raid In Yemen Signals Shift In Anti-Terror Strategy Under Trump,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A daring special operations raid into Yemen was approved by the White House and executed this weekend, leaving one US soldier dead and three wounded. Details remain sketchy, but a group made up primarily of America’s most notorious tier one counter-terrorism force, SEAL Team Six, flew into war-torn Yemen to raid an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) headquarters in the al-Bayda region of the country. The raid was supposedly a kill-capture and site exploitation operation aimed at the group’s key leadership, including AQAP kingpin Qasim al Raymi . The SEALs experienced an hour-long firefight after arriving on target under a moonless night sky. The team supposedly killed 14 AQAP operatives in the surprise assault, but also suffered one KIA and three wounded in the process. A V-22 Osprey (it is unclear if this was a Marine MV-22 or USAF CV-22) that was evacuating casualties during the operation experienced a hard landing and was destroyed by choice as the team exfiltrated the target area. Multiple structures were also said to have been obliterated by airstrikes during different phases of the assault. Photos from the site of the destroyed Osprey began surfacing on Twitter last evening: Although nobody was said to have been captured in the raid, large amounts of intelligence that could potentially lead to future raids and targeting of AQAP assets was reported to have been obtained in the operation. A spokesman for AQAP said that only innocents were killed in the raid, including the eight-year-old daughter of American-born, firebrand cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in Yemen 2011 by a US drone strike. It is rumored that the brother of Anwar al Awlaki was also killed during Saturday’s operation, as well as Abdulrauf al Dhahab , a top AQAP lieutenant with strong regional family ties. Al Dhahab’s compound, working in part as an AQAP operations center, seems to have been the main target of the mission. A followup drone strike against a pair of AQAP leaders in a vehicle reportedly occurred just hours after the raid ended. The occupants of the vehicle remain unknown, but it was said to have been destroyed. All these details may change over time, and the Trump administration has made it clear that it intends to be far more tight-lipped about military operations than its predecessor. But one thing is clear: this is the first death of a US serviceperson in combat under the command of President Donald Trump. It also marks the first known major military operation involving troops in combat under the Trump administration. President Obama got his last punch in against islamic extremists just a day before leaving office via a relatively large-scale air strike against ISIS-related elements in Libya using B-2 Spirit Stealth bombers . The White House made the following statement concerning the mission and the loss: “Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism.The sacrifices made by the men and women of our armed forces, and the families they leave behind, are the backbone of the liberty we hold so dear as Americans, united in our pursuit of a safer nation and a freer world.” The US has held a steadily increasing presence at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti , including special operations forces, helicopters, fighters, surveillance aircraft, and drones. Most aerial operations into Yemen and surrounding areas are launched from this base, and from US Navy amphibious assault ships deployed to the area from time to time. A special operations mission that strikes deep into the heart of a war-torn country like Yemen leverages a whole array of assets, including transport, surveillance, and tactical air support aircraft. Since a civil war continues to smolder in the country, and Saudi Arabia and Arab gulf states have reignited operations in and over the country , coordination with these separate elements may have been required in order to deconflict the airspace and to make sure no deadly mistakes were made. The thing is, although US special operations forces have been active in western Africa, they have largely stayed out of Yemen since the country sunk into civil war two years ago . Nearly all known US operations in the country have been targeted assassination and surveillance missions executed by unmanned aircraft. Two occurred just days ago , only a few days after Donald Trump took up shop in the Oval Office. But the use of “boots on the ground,” especially in such a high-risk and offensive manner, appears to be something new, and is likely a sign of President Trump’s more aggressive war on islamic extremism. The last known time US Special Operations forces executed a major operation in Yemen was in 2014, during a rescue operation to save an American hostage that was being held by AQAP operatives. A small team of special operations forces was also sent last year to assist UAE units operating in the country, although this unit was only there to advise and to help with intelligence gathering and exploitation. Over the last eight years, American Special Operations forces have been active in established war zones like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but they have been less so when it comes to executing penetrating raids in non-established areas of operation. The raid against Osama Bin Laden even took months for the Obama administration to approve, and only after careful consideration and micromanagement of the plan by top White House officials. Instead, the Obama Administration had relied very heavily on targeted assassination by unmanned aircraft to fight the global war on terror, especially in countries where American military presence is nil. This practice has been effective when it comes to keeping major terror groups’ leadership in flux and their communications truncated for fear of interception and targeting. At the same time many have argued that this lower-risk, “whack a mole” way of fighting these terror groups makes it impossible to garner intelligence that will allow for the systematic destruction of an entire terror network. In other words, dead men can’t talk and blown-to-bits computer hard drives and severely burned cell phones are useless when it comes to rendering actionable intelligence. With this in mind, Saturday’s raid in Yemen may be a sign of what’s to come. A new reality in which there is less reliance on simply killing the enemy when opportunities to do so represent themselves, and more reliance on putting special operators on the ground to grab key individuals and/or intelligence directly off the battlefield. Obama’s drone program fit his administration’s wish to empty America’s controversial detention center at Guantanamo Bay , as well as his push to end rendition programs and to stick closely to America’s no-torture laws . This policy was viewed as noble by some, and by others as highly hypocritical. Some would argue that shooting a Hellfire missile through a window of a building and killing everyone inside—and possibly some people outside— based on questionably defined intelligence , is far more cruel and unjust than capturing those targeted individuals, interrogating them and sending them to military tribunals. Outside of the torture debate, somehow being executed by drone became more morally acceptable than actually killing or capturing the enemy on the battlefield via real soldiers. The latter certainly presents a lower-risk politically and to US soldiers than the former, but questions of just how much damage the enhanced drone assassination program was doing to America’s image abroad also became a major sticking point with the strategy. A group of SEALs gets ready for a mission in Afghanistan (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images): If Trump and his national security team are indeed going to make a major push to kill or capture high value targets around the globe using commandos as a way of drastically increasing the clarity of America’s intelligence picture, it will not go without major resistance at home and abroad. Americans are sick of hearing about KIAs after a decade and a half of perpetual warfare, and many at home and around the globe dread a return to the “optics” of the counter-terrorism realities of the Bush years. At the same time, a change in tactics could drastically increase the Pentagon and the CIA’s chances of dealing out crescendos of crippling blows to the enemy and eradicating some formal terror networks once and for all. With all this in mind, what we are likely to see is not one or the other—increased drone strikes or increased targeted special operations raids—but more of both. Much more. In essence, the Trump administration is showing signs that they plan on loosening the rules of engagement against terror-related targets, anywhere in the world, on an unprecedented scale. This will likely mean spinning-up operations at Guantanamo Bay , which is down to just a few dozen or so prisoners at this time, as well as unleashing the special operations community and increasing drone operations to target terror networks wherever they reside. The possibility of restarting extraordinary rendition and black site operations to pair with this greater strategy shift also remains on the table. As to what level of regard Trump will place the potential geopolitical ramifications of such acts is uncertain. Considering his core slogan is “America first,” and considering the inflammatory executive orders he has made just ten days into his Presidency, the answer is probably not much. Although this may sound to some like an ambitious plan to take the fight to the, it is not without peril. With increased SOF raids, especially ones deep inside enemy territory with shorter planning and training cycles, comes higher risk. Things will go wrong, and a Black Hawk Down or Eagle Claw like event can deeply mire support for any special operations intervention abroad for years to follow. Also, a new very aggressive “and the kitchen sink” anti-terror strategy can also lead to a massive backlash abroad and especially in the Middle East, which can hamper future intelligence sharing and coalition operations. There is also the argument that a very draconian counter terror strategy helps make more terrorists than it can kill . Not just that but playing into terror groups’ narrative that the US is an imperial anti-Islamic force for which to wage Jihad against could make a larger and more complicated set of problems down the road than it solves in the near term. We’ll have to wait and see how the Trump anti-terror strategy materializes, but if the last ten days tell us anything, it is going to be very different than what we have seen over the last eight years.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It looks as if Houthi rebels on Yemen’s Red Sea coastline are up to their old tricks again: attacking warships operating near the Mandeb Strait. The last attack came in mid October, and it was aimed against the amphibious assault ship USS San Antonio and the USS Mason , an American Arleigh Burke class destroyer acting as a picket ship in the critical waterway. Mason and other US Navy ships had been attacked multiple times over a two week period, and had launched counter attacks against missile and radar sites along the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel-controlled coastline. The US Navy ships’ presence in the region was originally the result of a deadly anti-ship missile strike on the UAE operated high-speed logistics catamaran HSV-2 Swift . The ship shown in the a video supposedly posted by Houthi rebels, depicts what appears to be a French-built, 2,600 ton displacement al Madinah class frigate, which belong the Royal Saudi Navy, being attacked within visual range of the cameraman. After a massive fireball engulfs the stern of the ship, it can be seen smoking from the same area where the detonation took place. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7d8FjamvkX0 If the video was taken near the rebel-controlled port city of Mokha as it is claimed, the ship was obviously operating in a very active and hostile waterway and known anti-ship missile engagement zone. Although these frigates are over 30 years old ( here is the best picture of one I could find), they have defenses against incoming anti-ship missiles, including a Crotale point air defense system and a series of decoys and electronic warfare capabilities. They also have a 100mm and 40mm deck guns and small arms to defend themselves from swarming small boat attacks. It is unclear if any of these weapons and countermeasures were activated during the attack, nor if the attack came from a missile or an explosives-packed small boat. It is also worth noting that Mokha is presently under siege by Yemeni government forces, and that Iranian-built advanced (relatively) weapons have been used by the rebels in a desperate attempt to fend off the attack. A Saudi-led coalition warplane destroyed an Iranian-built drone just last Saturday in the besieged town. The fate of the ship, and its crew of over 170 sailors, is also unknown at this time. If the video proves to be authentic there is a chance lives, or even the vessel as a whole, were lost in the attack. If any of this proves true it could have massive military repercussions and result in deepening of a conflict that is already as brutal as it is dizzyingly complex. We will keep this page updated for 24 hours as new information becomes available. Update- 3:05pm PST: Saudi state news claims the attack came from three small boats, while Iranian state news claims it was an anti-ship missile. Also, preliminary reports state that two sailors were killed and three injured in the attack and that the ship is still afloat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 20, 2017",Report Says US Intel Thinks Attack On Saudi Frigate Was Meant For US Vessel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday’s small boat swarm attack on a Saudi frigate operating off the coast of Yemen is thought to have been intended for a U.S. vessel instead, according to a recent report. Fox News states that U.S. intelligence officials believe the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who executed the attack either believed the ship was an American surface combatant—and were attempting to inflict damage similar to that done by the explosives-laden small boat driven by a suicide bomber during the attack on the USS Cole— or it was a dress rehearsal in preparation for doing so. The report references the fact that the cameraman was chanting “Death to America” during the short video sequence, posted online yesterday, showing the strike. It should be noted that the tracks on videos such as these are often dubbed, but regardless, it’s being viewed as evidence that raises the possibility the suicide bomber and the two other boats that swarmed the al Madinah- class frigate thought they were targeting a U.S. Navy warship. During the attack, the bomber detonated his craft near the frigate’s stern, killing two sailors and injuring three more. The ship is said to still be in semi-operational condition. Although the report seems compelling, its claim that the operation may have been a “dress rehearsal” is highly questionable, considering that it was actually carried out in full. Also, there are large differences between the attack on the USS Cole and yesterday’s suicide bombing of the Saudi frigate—the biggest being that the Cole was at anchor making a refueling stop off Yemen’s southern port of Aden when the attack occurred some 17 years ago. As a result of the blast that killed 17 and injured 39 American sailors, large changes in force protection procedures were put into place across the U.S. Navy, and the threat from small craft, while underway or otherwise, remains one that the US Navy continues to grapple with to this very day. Yesterday’s attack was a classic swarming small boat operation. These have been used before for harassment purposes in the Southern Red Sea near the Mandeb Strait. It is also a common tactic of Iranian forces operating in the Persian Gulf , especially near the Strait of Hormuz. Tensions with Iran have ratcheted up since the election of Donald Trump, who has had strong messages about the Iranians and his distaste for the P5+1 nuclear deal. The Iranians just tested another ballistic missile , defying UN resolutions. It is fairly predictable that the Iranians will continue to test any new President, but if yesterday’s suicide attack had occurred on a U.S. ship, whether Iran had anything to do with ordering it or not, the outcome could be devastating for both the stability of the region and the world’s energy markets. Just as Iran’s involvement in the Yemeni civil war became clear, I postulated the possibility of Tehran’s greater strategy, which may include the gaining the ability to shut down two of the world’s most strategic maritime choke points—the Strait of Hormuz and the Mandeb Strait—on a whim. Read all about this possibility and its potential repercussions in this past feature of mine . In it, I specifically talk about swarming boat attacks and the destabilization of the security situation in the southern Red Sea as being used as military tactics, leverage, and as a deterrent by Tehran. The fact that Iran seems to be quite interested in a more formal naval presence in Yemen simply lends more evidence to this possibility. The Fox News report does not provide enough evidence to conclude the Houthi rebels were targeting an American Navy vessel and instead hit a Saudi one by mistake. The rebels arguably have more reasons to attack a Saudi-flagged surface combatant than an American one, considering the Saudis are leading a large group of Arab gulf states in the bloody war against them. The attack also comes at a time when tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are soaring . Among all this uncertainty, one thing is for sure: the stakes have been raised for ships transiting through the Southern Red Sea. Now, the question is: how will Saudi Arabia respond—and who against?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. USS Antietam (CG-54), a Ticonderoga class guided missile cruiser , was in the process of anchoring in Tokyo Bay on Tuesday under high winds. The crew realized that the ship’s anchor was dragging, and after getting back underway, it ran aground. The impact damaged cruiser’s huge twin screws , making it so they couldn’t change pitch, and 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil was released into the bay as a result of the incident. The ship was not able to maneuver on its own, necessitating tugs to bring it back to port in Yokosuka. The 30-year-old Antietam , which replaced the USS Cowpens in late 2013, is part of America’s forward-deployed naval presence in Japan, and is one of just three US Navy cruisers based there. These ships often deploy as the anti-air warfare operations centerpiece in carrier- and amphibious-strike groups, but they also work on their own for various missions, including ballistic missile defense (if equipped), disaster relief, multi-national training, anti-piracy and other assignments. An investigation is underway regarding the incident, although running aground or colliding with subsurface features does not typically end well for the ship’s captain.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 13, 2016",Number Of Entrants In USAF’s Jet Trainer Competition Dwindles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, the USAF’s $16 billion T-X tender to replace its aging T-38 Talon trainers was looking like a big furball dogfight amongst as many as six competitors. Now, that number has dwindled to just three—one of which still has yet to produce a prototype—a reality that will offer much less choice for the USAF than originally envisioned. In just the last week, both the consortium of Leonardo and Raytheon, and most stunningly, Northrop Grumman, dropped out of the T-X running. Northrop Grumman was seen as a prime competitor, especially considering their T-38’s legendary heritage within the Air Force’s Air Education Training Command. Not just that, but the company specifically ported a large portion of their T-X candidate’s development over to their world renowned “bleeding-edge” aerospace subsidiary, Scaled Composites . Northrop Grumman acquired Scaled Composites back in 2007, and using the outfit to bolster their competitiveness in tenders like the T-X was one of the biggest reasons for the acquisition. For the T-X competition, BAE Systems and L3 also teamed with Northrop Grumman, which together made for an astonishingly powerful team, at least on paper. With Scaled Composites’ well established creativity and cutting-edge material science, Northrop Grumman was expected to present a major challenge to the field. That challenge appeared to come in the form of their shadowy Model 400 prototype . In recent months, the aircraft has flown without fanfare over Scaled Composite’s Mojave plant, but the company has said little about it since it first was spotted last summer. Around the same time the company hinted that their prototype would be officially unveiled, Northrop Grumman’s leadership has decided to throw in the towel. A statement by Northrop Grumman reads: “Northrop Grumman and its principal teammate BAE Systems have carefully examined the U.S. Air Force’s T-X Trainer requirements and acquisition strategy as stated in the final request for proposals issued on Dec. 30, 2016. The companies have decided not to submit a proposal for the T-X Trainer program, as it would not be in the best interest of the companies and their shareholders.” NG definately has other pending priorities—namely, the USAF’s massive Long-Range Strike Bomber contract now known as the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . The B-21 represents potential revenue approaching $100 billion, and while the T-X contract isn’t small beans by any means—especially in the world of dwindling tactical aircraft production opportunities—spreading the company’s limited resources too thin is a serious issue at such a critical time. Not just that, but other initiatives, like the E-8 JSTARS replacement program and MQ-25 Stingray/ CBARS unmanned carrier aircraft system , will also take focus and expertise to win, and the company looks to do just that now that these competitions are getting underway. There is also the real possibility that the company’s Model 400 simply was not seen as competitive enough, either on cost or performance grounds, to win the contract now that the official requirements have been put forward by the USAF. In fact, we may never know for sure what the company’s reasoning for ditching the type may have been. Leonardo and Raytheon dropping their T-100, an aircraft based directly on the successful M346 Master, from the T-X competition was a far more upfront affair. There had been concerns that the twin-engine jet would have trouble competing in terms of raw performance with the other more fighter-like entrants. Yet it seems the major issue with moving forward came down to price and what both prime contractors on the project expected out of it. In the end, an agreement could not be reached, and now the T-100 and Leonardo are without a US partner. The M346/T-100’s road to the T-X competition had been rocky before this latest news. Originally, Leonardo was paired with General Dynamics for the bid, but this relationship shattered in 2015. A year later Raytheon jumped onboard, but there were rumors that the two companies didn’t always see eye-to-eye. Now that Raytheon is officially out, Leonardo could still move forward with another partner, but doing so this late in the game would be troublesome. With Textron pulling a T-X modified version of their Scorpion light attack and surveillance jet from the competition months ago , it leaves Lockheed and KAI with their mature T-50 , Boeing and SAAB with their visually impressive clean-sheet design , and a dark horse candidate in the guise of Sierra Nevada Corporation and Turkish Aircraft Industries clean-sheet design known as the “Freedom Trainer.” Now, the question is what the USAF will end up prioritizing in the contest. Although the RFP is out, and it includes some bonus points for higher-than-minimal performance, in the new age of the Trump administration, will the lowest cost be prioritized over the best capability? Considering all the things the USAF wants to do (and only so many dollars to do them), this very well could be the case. On the other hand, if a massive influx of cash sees the service’s triage of procurement priorities become less severe, a high-end solution—maybe even one that could be adapted into a low-cost light fighter—may become the winning ticket. One design in particular already has that in its pedigree: the Lockheed/KAI T-50, which is active in a light fighter FA-50 variant today within multiple air arms around the globe.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 15, 2019",Is The USAF Finally Serious About Fielding A Light Air Support Aircraft?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After literally flying the wings off its tactical fighter fleet over the last decade and a half of counter-insurgency operations in the Middle East, the USAF maybe finally coming to its senses about the need for a fleet of relatively inexpensive light attack and surveillance aircraft. This has been one of my most passionate issues over my career (read about it on my first site , my second creation and here at thewarzone.com ). Spending years watching the USAF fight men in mud huts brandishing rusty AK-47s and roaming around in Toyota Hilux pickups with high-performance multi-role fighters and heavy bombers was just about as absurd and wasteful as it gets. The “equal opportunity” air wars over Iraq and Afghanistan, along with delays in the F-35 program and the shrinking of the overall tactical fighter force size, largely created the massive logistical crisis and crippling “fighter gaps” of today. And all of this was blatantly foreseeable, but the lack of imagination within the USAF and the powerful special interests that fear any competition for dollars for banner established programs, like the F-35, kept the procurement of a light attack and surveillance platform in relevant numbers a nebulous goal at best. Throughout the 2000s, light air support initiatives, both to arm our allies and ourselves, came and went, with next to nothing to show for them. Not just that but Washington kept setting deadlines for withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan without providing Iraqi and Afghani forces with large numbers of platforms that can provide the same game-changing capability that was crucial to keeping the Taliban at bay and drastically weakening the insurgency in Iraq–that being precision air support and persistent aerial surveillance. Even the Islamic State’s blitzkrieg across Iraq could have been detected sooner, and at least slowed, with such a capability in hand. Instead, Iraq waited and waited for watered-down F-16s, and only had a hodgepodge of attack helicopters and a small handful of Hellfire missile slinging Cessna Caravans at their disposal. In 2015 a pair of surplus Vietnam-era OV-10 Broncos , upgraded with a capable sensor turret, a bevy of radios and data-links, night vision compatible cockpits, defensive suite, and the ability to sling laser-guided rockets went to war against ISIS over Iraq. They proved once again that in many ways a light attack and surveillance aircraft is far better than a fuel thirsty, fast flying F-16 or even a MQ-9 Reaper drone, with its soda-straw view of the battlefield, when it comes to fighting Islamic militants. Not just that but it can do the job with minimal basing right up near the front lines for around a couple thousand dollars and hour, not $22,000 (F-16), or even double that (F-15E). In recent years the Air Force has pushed for studies on a low-end close air support alternative to fast jets. Most recently this has come in the form of the semi-official OA-X initiative, but the Air Force always seem to find a way to inject as much cost and technology into what is clearly a relatively simple requirement. Now, after so many years where the need has been dire, and the solution readily available in multiple forms, the USAF, under General David Goldfein, is actually embracing the idea . Recently a white paper produced by Senator John McCain , in which he pushes for procurement of 300 low-end tactical aircraft to make out the bottom of a high-low tactical aircraft mix strategy, brought the issue back to the forefront. McCain’s paper states: “The Air Force should embrace a ‘high/low mix’ of fighter aircraft. Very expensive fifth-generation technology is not needed in every scenario…These aircraft could conduct counterterrorism operations, perform close air support and other missions in permissive environments, and help to season pilots to mitigate the Air Force’s fighter pilot shortfall.” The USAF Chief now wants to execute a fly-off of different off-the-shelf solutions for a light attack and surveillance aircraft to deem which one gives the best return for the USAF. Although this competition has not been funded as of yet, it seems as if the General wants it to be fast tracked as the cost would be quite low. Not just that, but he may be looking to bring foreign partners onboard. Wealthy middle eastern countries and NATO members in particular could save their precious fast-jet airframe hours for other threats, and use a light air support aircraft for fighting ISIS in a coalition environment. All this sounds good, but here’s the hard truth: The USAF has been kicking this can down the road for well over a decade. The mission of fighting low-intensity conflicts in permissible airspace is not going to evaporate. The A-29 Super Tucano has already been selected, funded, fielded and is flying in small numbers within the USAF. This aircraft should be purchased immediately, 100 seems like a good number to start with, and sent to work in the fight against ISIS. If the USAF wants it can buy two hundred more A-29s, or the fly-off Goldfein wants can be executed and higher-end alternatives can be evaluated—specifically Textron’s Scorpion . Then again, the USAF is going to experiment with the Scorpion anyway so what is the point of a fly-off? Additionally, the jet-powered Scorpion does represent capability creep for what should be the simplest and most cost effective solution, and a single turboprop aircraft, like the already in-inventory A-29 Super Tucano, will supply just that. In the meantime, our tactical fighters, that are on life extensions already, continue to fly mission after mission against an enemy with no Air Force, all the while sipping tanker gas at $30 a gallon. Getting roughly 100 forward-based Super Tucanos into the fight ASAP will help alleviate the pressure on these airframes and their overworked communities. Doing so would also free up some of the Predator and Reaper communities for other missions as a small force of Tucanos can provide even higher quality persistent overwatch and armed reconnaissance than their unmanned cousins, also at lower cost. Aggressively procuring and deploying a low-end light air support aircraft should not be just another backdoor way to justify retiring the A-10 , it should be supplement to it. The two aircraft would be able to work together in synergistic ways and it is possible that the two communities could be blended as one. Additionally, the A-10 can fight in medium threat environments where say a Super Tucano could not. Considering that the USAF is already blowing money on ways to retain close air support knowledge base if or when the A-10 is retired, actually keeping the community intact via the A-29 represents a far smarter move with a better return on investment. Eventually, it would be nice to see missions like the fight against ISIS being handled primarily by the light air support, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), and A-10 communities. This would free up high-performance tactical aircraft, and even heavy bombers to some degree, for higher-end combat scenarios and training. If the Air Force ever really ends up putting something like an A-29A into the field in relevant numbers, the realization and resulting shock will quickly settle in as to how poorly managed and mismatched the air power applied to over a decade and a half of counter-insurgency and close air support operations in the middle east has been. The amount of money wasted on fuel and airframe life alone for just a small portion of missions flown by existing platforms over Iraq and Afghanistan would have paid for a large fleet of light attack and surveillance aircraft many, many times over.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 6, 2017",Watch Russia’s Lone Carrier Air Wing Arrive Home After Troubled Deployment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s rickety aircraft carrier , the Admiral Kuznetsov , is close to being home after spending a couple months off Syria’s coast. During that short period of time, two of its aircraft plunged into the Mediterranean , and it seemed as if the carrier was acting more as a transport ship for its aircraft than as an active airbase at sea . The carrier and her core group of escort ships were ordered back to their home port of Severomorsk in early January and they have spent the last month making their way slowly there. Although fixed-wing carrier naval aviation in the US and Russia differs greatly, the homecoming for their aircrews aren’t too disparate, and coming home in one piece may even be more of a stirring realization for Russian aircrews and their families considering how dangerous operating from their less than reliable carrier with minimal shipboard training really is. With this in mind, check out these videos of the Admiral Kuznetsov’s air wing’s arrival in Severomorsk Friday. It will be years till the air wing deploys aboard an aircraft carrier again. The Admiral Kuznetsov is slated to go through a deep overhaul and refit that will see large portions of the ship and its systems gutted and replaced. If this actually happens as touted by Russian officials for the last half decade or so, it would help stabilize Russian carrier-borne naval aviation and possibly alleviate the stigma the Kuznetsov has garnered over the years as a smoke billowing deathtrap. In the meantime, the ship’s Su-33s may have seen their last deployment, with the much more modern MiG-29KR slated to take over the role as the ship’s primary fighter. At the same time, it will be interesting to see how Russia keeps its single carrier air wing alive while Admiral Kuznetsov is ripped apart. The brain-drain of having such a small force to begin with, and with no ship to fly to for years, represents a big and expensive challenge fraught with risk for the niche community.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The V-22 is quite thunderous while in hover, but when its rotors are tilted forward and it’s in plane mode it is pretty damn quiet, and can give off a “hissing” sound as it flies by. Now take that sound, multiply it by ten, lower the aircraft’s altitude to just 150 feet above the ground, and you have the awesome formation flyby seen in the video below. Four CV-22s from the 20th Special Operations Squadron based at Cannon AFB in New Mexico and six from the 8th Special Operations Squadron based at Hurlburt Field in Florida combined forces to perform an unprecedented ten ship flyover of Hurlburt Field on Friday. The flyover capped a large training exercise between the two squadrons. The CV-22B has increasingly become the go-to asset of choice for special operations around the globe. There are only roughly 45 of these aircraft in the USAF’s inventory, which makes having over 20 percent of the fleet flying together at one time and in one place all that more unique of an undertaking, especially considering the type’s intense tasking overseas. While the Marines have nearly 250 MV-22 Ospreys in service, even seeing ten of those in formation at low altitude and in airplane mode is rare. The CV-22 was originally procured by AFSOC to replace the fabled MH-53 Pave Low fleet of special operations helicopters. Like the last Pave Low variants ( MH-53M Pave Low IV ), the CV-22 version of the Osprey has an advanced navigational suite—including terrain following radar for low-level penetration of enemy airspace in any weather conditions. It also features a highly capable communications package, one of the most extensive self-defense and electronic warfare suites fielded on a tactical aircraft (ALQ-211, AAQ-24 Nemesis, etc), as well as a long list of other upgrades including extended range fuel tanks. CV-22 crews specialize in special operations support missions but they can also be used for Combat Search And Rescue/Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel as the aircraft high-speed and penetration capabilities lends itself to such a time critical and dangerous mission set. This has led to some, including the author of this post, to ask why the USAF is purchasing dozens more HH-60 Pave Hawks to fulfill a critical mission set that is ideally suited for tilt-rotor technology . And considering the USAF has already paid dearly to develop the CV-22, why continue to buy a platform that remains less than ideal for its intended, and extremely challenging mission? The V-22 Osprey has found itself expanding its mission portfolio over the last decade. The aircraft flies White House staff around , fights fires , and is being armed with new weapons , and that’s on top of its work with the USMC as a general purpose medium-lift helicopter , often standing in as special operations platform in the Middle East and Africa. It is even going to try to replace the C-2 Greyhound in the carrier onboard delivery role, for better or worse . And while it is debatable that for many of the more mundane tasks it performs on a daily basis lower-cost and far simpler helicopters could be used, for some missions the aircraft cannot be beaten, and AFSOC, with its maturing fleet of CV-22s, has that pretty well figured out.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 31, 2017",USS Cole Returns To Yemeni Coast Following Attack On Saudi Frigate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The same Arleigh Burke class destroyer that was tragically attacked by a boat-borne suicide bomber while anchored off Aden 17 years ago has been ordered to patrol Yemeni coastline following a recent successful suicide bomber attack on a Saudi frigate . Two other US Navy ships are also in the area, including the USS Makin Island and the USS Comstock , both of which are lumbering amphibious assault ships. But the Cole has been specifically assigned to put its high-end surface and anti-air warfare capabilities to work to respond to any incidents that occur in and around the vital Mandeb Strait. USS Cole being transported by the M/V Blue Marlin following the suicide bomber blast the killed 17 sailors and wounded scores more on October 17th, 2000: The deadly attack on the Saudi frigate, which killed two sailors and injured three others, came after a spate of anti-ship missile attacks on UAE and US Navy ships last October. These attacks culminated in a counter-attack via Tomahawk cruise missiles that targeted Houthi controlled radar stations and launch positions along Yemen’s western coastline. It also occurred in succession with another Iranian ballistic missile test, a move that many claim was in defiance of existing UN resolutions . The new Trump administration, which is loaded with hardliners when it comes to the Iranian issue, has reacted strongly to both events. First off they view the attack on the Saudi frigate as one meant for a US surface combatant, although the evidence to justify such a conclusion remains questionable. Although Iran actively backs Houthi rebels who carried out the attack, aside from some cameraman yelling death to America and death to Israel while filming the attack, no other evidence is known to exist that points to the perpetrators specifically targeting a US ship instead of an Iranian one—or any other ship that would have presented itself for that matter. Secondly both Trump and his National Security Advisor, ousted intel general Michael Flynn, have made it clear that Iran is now “on notice” (whatever that means) and have announced new sanctions against Tehran . Interestingly these sanctions have been designed carefully not to affect the P5+1 nuclear deal Donald Trump heavily maligned during his campaign. Now with tensions dramatically increasing between Tehran and Washington, and with the Cole off the Yemeni coast—both a symbol of American resilience to terrorism and the country’s spotted history in Yemen—as well as representing a major military challenge to Houthi rebels—we will have to wait and see what happens next. If the Cole is attacked, and there is a good chance it will be based on the events of the last few months, it could lead to a wider conflict not just in Red Sea or Gulf of Aden, but also in the simmering waters of the Persian Gulf. Also worth noting, Fox News reports that Houthi rebels have begun mining the Mandeb Strait. If this is true, it would represent a dramatic shift in tactics by the group and a threat to the region and the global economy. I have found no information supporting this claim, but I’ll keep an eye on it. Mining of the strait—or the ability to do so on short notice—fits in with my original analysis of Tehran’s long play is in region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 20, 2017",Video Of Saudi Frigate Attack Released As Ballistic Missile Hits Near Riyadh,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the US Navy destroyer USS Cole patrols the Mandeb Strait , more imagery is emerging of last week’s boat-borne suicide attack on the Saudi frigate al Madinah . It was that attack by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that resulted in the Cole taking up station in what has become the most dangerous major shipping artery on the planet. The Saudi ship was patrolling off the western coast of Yemen, an area largely controlled by Houthi rebels. It is also the same region that last October saw multiple failed anti-ship missile attacks on US Navy surface combatants and one successful missile strike on a UAE flagged high-speed logistics vessel that once belonged to the US Navy. This weekend, the damaged frigate pulled into the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah. Its crew, who were manning the rails as the ship maneuvered to dock, were given boisterous welcome. Tarps covered the ship’s flight deck, and the port side of the stern—where the explosion occurred—could not be seen in video and photos, but overall the ship seemed intact. Regardless of the visible damage, the fact that two sailors died and the three others were injured when the explosive-laden small boat slammed into the warship last week has added new focus on the bloody conflict. For two years now , Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Arab states that backs the Yemeni government have been fighting a ruthless war against one another. Although there have been limited ceasefires, fighting has exploded once again, and there is increasing risk of regional instability and the civil war spreading to a wider conflict. Here is new video of the attack shot from the flight deck of the frigate: Meanwhile, reports state that Houthi rebel forces fired a ballistic missile—a modified Scud—from Houthi-controlled territory in western Yemen to just outside the Saudi capital. Some of the reports state that the missile struck a military base 25 miles southwest of the Riyadh, near Mazahimiyah. A statement from the Houthi rebels claimed “a successful experiment in which the army forces launched a ballistic missile targeting a military target in Riyadh… Riyadh is now within reach of Yemeni missiles… More is yet to come!” If the ballistic missile landed that close to Riyadh, it would be the farthest known strike into Saudi territory yet by Houthi missiliers. It is not the first time that one of their Scud variants made it much farther than many thought possible. On October 10th, as American ships were under attack in the Red Sea by Iranian-supplied, Houthi rebel-fired anti-ship missiles, the group fired a ballistic missile toward Mecca that landed in King Fahad Air Base , some 325 miles from the Yemeni border. Another missile, also said to have been headed toward Mecca, was supposedly shot down weeks later by a Saudi surface-to-air missile battery, likely a PAC-3 Patriot . https://youtube.com/watch?v=EOdDTOwZm5w If last night’s strike near Riyadh did indeed occur, the missile would have flown nearly 500 miles from Houthi-controlled territory along Yemen’s northern border. This profile is at the very edge of—if not slightly beyond—known Scud range (Scud-D), although evolved knock-offs of the Scud system, like the North Korean Hwasong Seven, have seen improvements that take it beyond that range, especially with lighter payloads. The long-range Scud derivative being used by Houthi forces has been named “Borkan” locally. Yemen had hundreds of Scuds of Russian and North Korean origin in their arsenal when civil war broke out, and Houthi rebels seized a large portion of that stockpile. It is nearly a foregone conclusion that some of these Scuds are being modified with the help of Iranian operatives —including those from Hezbollah—and that key missile components also are coming from Iran as the blockade of military material entering Yemen was and still remains porous . There is also the possibility that, on some level, North Korea is helping Houthi missile troops. North Korea has had deep military ties in Yemen for decades, and has worked clandestinely with Iran to co-develop ballistic missile technologies. There has even been reports that North Korea has sold entire missiles to Houthi rebels . Also, it is well known that Pyongyang will sell weapons to literally anyone with hard cash . Although Houthi ballistic missiles do not pose a traditional strategic threat to Saudi Arabia, they do pose major threat to the stability of The Kingdom. If Saudi Arabia’s costly war to the south is “brought home” by putting large population and power centers under the threat of ballistic missile barrage, support for the war, especially among Saudi Arabia’s massive royal hierarchy, may begin to evaporate. Not just that, but sending wealthy Saudis running for cover in their own capital cuts deeply into The Kingdom’s perception of control, both on an internal and external level. These missile strikes can also have massive propaganda benefits for the far less well-armed Shiite rebels who are facing down a coalition of the most powerful Sunni kingdoms in the world. In essence, like the Vengeance weapons of WWII, Houthi ballistic missiles are a psychological weapon above all else.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 20, 2017",More Details Emerge On Kratos’ Optionally Expendable Air Combat Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last Summer we reported in detail about Kratos partially self-funded, semi-disposable unmanned air combat vehicle (UCAV). Now the company has released new details on their design, including its designation—XQ-222. Kratos, who are world renowned for building target drones that simulate enemy aircraft and missiles, has designed the XQ-222 in concert with the Air Force Research Laboratory under the Low-Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration (LCASD) initiative. According to Aviation Week ,  LCASD aims to be able to eventually field a optionally reusable, highly adaptable, low-end unmanned combat air vehicle for $3 million apiece for batches of up to 99 aircraft per year, or $2 million each for yearly orders of 100 or more. In essence, the LCASD concept is “high-volume” both in the strategy behind it and in terms of procuring it affordably. The company, which could realize a whole new portfolio of business if their design makes it into production, has invested millions of its own dollars into the XQ-222—$40 million to be exact compared to just over $7 million in Pentagon funds. But they aren’t the only ones eyeing LCASD as an off ramp to a whole new emerging defense marketplace. Originally it was thought that the XQ-222 would be a light rework of an existing Kratos drone design, but instead the company appears to have gone much further. It is described as a large unmanned aircraft with a relatively massive range. The design features a whopping 1,500 mile combat radius when being operated as a reusable drone, or it can fly a 3,000 mile one way trip when being used as in a disposable manner. This would allow it to strike anywhere in North Korea (and recover back in South Korea or Japan) from Guam, or it could travel nearly 1,000 miles inland from Chinese shores along the Taiwan Strait if launched from Guam. It could also fly from Okinawa to China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea and back. Basically the XQ-222, and the LCASD initative as a whole, is really a melding of multiple existing air combat concepts. These include that of smaller optionally disposable “suicidal” drones that are becoming increasingly popular, mixed with that of a higher-end fighter-like UCAV s, as well as that of an enhanced cruise missile . Their job is not to be a “top end” asset—being the very best at any one role—but to be more flexible and employable than their less adaptable or far more expensive counterparts. The XQ-222 will carry a 500-lb payload, which gives it at least a pair of Small Diameter Bombs at its disposal. Extra surveillance, jamming and other equipment could be fitted instead. Larger payloads could likely be carried with a reduction in fuel storage and, as a result, the XQ-222’s range. The optionally disposable UCAV’s design has stealthy properties, including a trapezoidal fuselage with a chined edge, V-tails, and an S-shaped air intake set high above the aircraft’s fuselage. The wing is also similar to the one found on the stealthy Predator C/Avenger , as is its exhaust, which is optimized to decrease the drone’s “viewable” infrared signature from the rear hemisphere. Like many other stealthy missiles and drones , the XQ-222’s low observable design philosophy and general configuration harkens back to Northrop’s Tacit Blue technology demonstrator of the early 1980s. It also has a strong resemblance to something between EADS’ experimental Barracuda UCAV and KAI’s indigenous UCAV concept. What also makes the XQ-222 exciting as a low-end UCAV is that it launches via rocket assisted takeoff from a stand and lands using a parachute. In other words, no airfield is needed to launch or recover this unmanned aircraft system. This means you can threaten an enemy at long distances from virtually anywhere. This form of distributive lethality is especially relevant in the vastness of the Pacific Theater, where in a peer state conflict, known US master airfield installations would be targeted by multiple types of standoff weaponry. The tiny logistical footprint of the XQ-222 means that it operate from pretty much anywhere a C-130, small logistics vessel , or group of trucks can access. Transit times to cover the XQ-222 substantial range are helped by its high subsonic speed capabilities—up to .9 mach—which means these aircraft could also be used alongside manned combat aircraft one day. “Tethering” or the “Loyal Wingman” concept is already being played with in various domains . One of which is with another Kratos product—a version of the BQM-167A sub-scale aerial target drone that has been adapted for testing such a concept under the $50 million Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 (UTAP-22) initiative. The UTAP-22 can fly as high as 50,000 and can carry 350lbs of stores internally and 200lbs externally for three hours or nearly 1,500 miles. A “wolf pack” of UTAP-22s have already flown alongside a Harrier during a series of tests at NAWS China Lake late last year. During these test sorties UTAP-22 drones were able to support the Harrier’s mission in a semi-autonomous or autonomous fashion . https://youtube.com/watch?v=lcP66syzQls Now U.S. Strategic Capabilities Office and Strategic Command are sponsoring a larger test of the UTAP-22 concept later this year at a yet to be identified major aerial warfare exercise ( likely Northern Edge 2017). This exercise will see a number of UTAP-22s used in a cooperative swarm . In the end Kratos thinks they can field orders for a production version of the UTAP-22 for around $3 million each. That is a small price to pay for a reusable and versatile tactical drone that can do the dirtiest of air combat work. Such a system can also breathe new life and value into older tactical platforms, like the F-16 and Harrier, by giving them a whole new set of capabilities for operating in or near contested airspace. By ordering UTAP-22s to jam, strike, or distract enemy air defenses, a manned and much more expensive fighter aircraft can access new areas of the battlespace with minimal external support. In essence, a whole new series of manned fighter tactics can be developed around tethering. In the end, the UTAP-22 and the XQ-222’s target drone roots and relatively low cost mean that they can also play the role of decoy during the opening stages of a high-end air war. Along with Miniature Air-Launched Decoys , which are much more limited in terms of range,  these new optionally expandable, relatively cheap yet high-performance combat drones can play the role of an incoming attack force. They cannot only stimulate the enemy air defense network, but after doing so they can also deal it a series of blinding blows. If the have the range to do so, those who live can return home to be used another day. These relatively inexpensive semi-autonomous unmanned combat drone concepts are part of the Pentagon’s “third offset strategy” for developing new capabilities suited to take on a high-end foe in the future. Although they are an exciting step in the right direction, the Pentagon still remains totally mum when it comes to even discussing the higher-end on the unmanned combat aircraft spectrum. It is as if advanced unmanned combat air vehicles, that could and should replace fighter aircraft at least partially, don’t even exist as a concept . We have discussed the implications of this strange reality in great detail, but projects like Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 and Low-Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration give us just a glimpse of how deeply revolutionary the UCAV can be if it were extrapolated to its logical end.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 14, 2017",Let’s Talk About Those F-35 Kill Ratio Reports From Red Flag,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The media has run wild with reports that 13 F-35As from Hill AFB have made an impressive showing at the USAF’s largest air warfare exercise, Red Flag. Most notably, a kill ratio of 15:1 has been touted, which traditionally means the F-35 has suffered one loss for every 15 enemy aircraft it has killed. This version of Red Flag , which only includes aircraft from the US, UK and Australia, has supposedly been tailored with more challenging surface-to-air missile and adversary aircraft threat profiles. Layered enemy air defense systems and a higher degree of electronic warfare are said to have been present. Reports state that F-35s have done well taking on these air defenses as part of a massive strike package that included many types of US and coalition aircraft, including F-22s. The problem is that the limited amount of information we have from an air exercise that produces hoards of data really does not give an accurate picture of what the F-35 contributed, or how their performance compared to that of other platforms. The 15:1 kill ratio in particular is nebulous, because it seems this may be skewed in terms of what data it actually includes. Kill ratios attributed to a platform naturally make us think of direct engagements with enemy aircraft, but Red Flag is a highly integrated air battle, one that always uses the latest data-link fusing gateways and other force-multipliers . It remains unclear whether the stated kill ratio is strictly attributable to the F-35, or if it includes the actions of other coalition aircraft, particularly F-22s, while the F-35 is merely present. In other words, did one F-35 die per 15 enemy aircraft killed strictly by the F-35’s own hand, or did those enemy aircraft die while the F-35 was merely involved in the battle? The F-22As from the 27th FS were integrated into this Red Flag, as were APG-63V3 AESA radar toting F-15Cs from the 159th FS. The UK brought their highly capable Typhoon FGR4 to the exercise as well, and these are just the high-end air superiority players; other fighters, including F-16s, were also present. That’s a lot of counter-air capability in the air at one time, all with various advantages and disadvantages, feeding their data into one common fused data-link picture. In addition, they were assisted by an armada of support aircraft, including the most capable jamming and information, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms in the world. Here is a full list of the players for Red Flag 17-1: B-1 37BS EC-130H 41ECS EA-18G VAQ-132 EA-18G VAQ-134 E-8 GA 12/16ACCS F-15C 159FS F-16C 77FS F-16C 176FS F-22A 27FS F-35A 34FS HH-60 55RQS KC-135 92ARW RC-135 343RS C-130J RAAF 37Sq E-7 RAAF 2Sq KC-30 RAAF 33Sq C-130J RAF 47Sq E-3 RAF VIIISq FGR4 RAF 6Sq KC-3 RAF 10Sq R-1 RAF V(AC)Sq RC-135 RAF 51Sq Even if the kill ratio strictly depicts what F-16Cs of the 64th Aggressor Squadron were shot down by F-35As and a visa-versa (at this time we know of no other disclosed red air players), without more information as to the rules of engagement, what weapons were available, what threat profiles the adversary aircraft were flying, what missions were the F-35As partaking in when the kills occurred, and what third party support both sides had at the time of each kill, these kill ratios can only be seen as anecdotal. This is just the nature of a large combined forces exercise: nothing happens in a vacuum. Also, the 64th AGRS flies Block 32 F-16Cs, the least capable in the USAF inventory. Some pack Israeli-built Elta ELL8222 self-escort jamming pods , which can play havoc on the opposition’s ability to target the host aircraft. But these F-16s have radars that are relatively old and they do not sport any sort of infra-red search and track system , which is the biggest air-to-air sensor threat to the F-35A, one that is often found on modern enemy aircraft. Not just that, but unless things have changed for this Red Flag, the aggressors rely entirely on Ground Control Interception (GCI) radar controllers to guide them to their targets. Meanwhile the “blue force” uses much more capable airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) platforms that often use radars that are more capable at detecting low-observable targets than their smaller X-band fighter-borne fire control radar counterparts. How can we really judge F-35A’s supposed kill ratio without knowing those of other platforms used in the exercise, or even historical numbers from other exercises? For instance, what was the F-15C’s kill ratio? Or the F-22’s? What about the Royal Air Force’s Typhoons? How about red air’s corresponding kill ratio? 15:1 sounds great, but it really is about the same as what the US Navy experienced with their Topgun graduates in Vietnam, a time when F-4s were taking on MiG-17s and MiG-21s. In the end we have nothing to compare this number to, and “lesser” platforms could have gotten as high a ratio or even higher, we just don’t know. None of this is really a mark against the F-35A. It could have performed even better than we know at this time. It certainly seemed by most accounts that it did well regardless of what kill ratio has been reported, but keep in mind that any major issues with the type that surfaced during Red Flag is very unlikely to get a public comment by those involved directly with the program. I have been to Red Flag multiple times, sat in the media briefs and aircrew panels, and asked some tough questions. But if you think a F-35 pilot is going to come out and say “well we did ok, but we kept having data-exchange issues between jets and the S-300 SAM guys were using some unorthodox tactics to detect us farther away than we would have liked” than I have an airworthy F-32 to sell you. This is not the first time a small amount of unexplained air combat data was put forward as proof that a fighter aircraft was trouncing the competition, and especially for the F-35 . Red Flag in particular has had its share of controversy surrounding the issue in the past. So sure, 15:1 kill ratios make for catchy headlines, I think this one is my favorite so far , but without more data to back and explain such claims, those headlines are naive at best and disingenuous at worst. Statements like the this one from Lieutenant Colonel George Watkins, the commander of the 34th Fighter Squadron, offer a more credible view of how the F-35A performed in Red Flag as part of the total force: “Before where we would have one advanced threat and we would put everything we had—F-16s, F-15s , F-18s, missiles, we would shoot everything we had at that one threat just to take it out—now we are seeing three or four of those threats at a time. Just between [the F-35] and the [F-22] Raptor we are able to geolocate them, precision-target them, and then we are able to bring the fourth-generation assets in behind us after those threats are neutralized. It’s a whole different world out there for us now…When you pair the F-22 and the F-35 like together with the fourth-generation strikers behind us, we’re really able to dominate the airspace over the Nellis test and training range.” The F-35A also stayed around after their munitions were dropped to soak up electronic intelligence on the enemy, a role the aircraft is especially adept at. The F-35 also had great availability, supposedly 92 percent, and did not miss a mission due to maintenance issues. But this metric can also be skewed as the parts supply chain is flooded and contractors are usually on hand to prop up these numbers during a modern combat aircraft’s operational debuts (see the MV-22).  This is just how the industry works with the DoD to make their systems look great during high-profile deployments among the first operational squadrons. Case in point, the F-22 had a 97 percent mission-effective rate during exercise Northern Edge in 2007 , completing 102 of 105 assigned sorties. What is the F-22 fleet’s readiness rate today? Around 67 percent, give or take a few points. Also, 13 F-35As from the 34th Fighter Squadron were present at Red Flag—that’s a large amount of aircraft from a single unit, with most squadrons historically deploying six to eight jets for the exercise. This larger amount of available aircraft would have bolstered the unit’s mission completion rate. So once again, this readiness figure should be taken anecdotally—as a good sign, but not as conclusive evidence that the jet will perform anywhere near that level during normal fleet operations. Another issue when it comes to these reports on how the F-35 performed during Red Flag is that the exercise was just starting its second week when they were published. Over the course of Red Flag—which usually runs two weeks—things get tougher during not easier. So once again, the notion that these are the final results of the exercise is far from accurate. So what we end up with here is grab bag of hyperbole mixed with some truth, and a whole lot of unknowns sprinkled on top. In the end, the F-35 seems to have done well for its second Red Flag showing, the Marines having made it to the last Red Flag with their F-35Bs. Considering that the aircraft has been in development for twenty years and has been flying for over a decade , this at the very least should be expected. Setting the bar so low as to tout that a 5th generation fighter that has cost monumental piles of cash to develop and still runs $100 million a copy, can trounce 30 year old 4th generation fighters, not even particularly advanced or highly equipped ones at that, is just foolish. Not just that, but the F-22 had proved that 4th generation fighters are no match for 5th generation ones over a decade ago , and has done so time and time again since.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Top General In Afghanistan Makes Urgent Request For ‘More Offensive Capability’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Nicholson, commander of US and allied forces in Afghanistan, testified before congress today that he urgently needs a “few thousand” more troops to break what has become a “stalemate” between the Taliban and other extremist forces, and the Afghan National Army (ANA). These extra forces would supply training and assistance to the ANA and, importantly, provide more close air support and special operations capabilities. The general stated : “Offensive capability is what will break the stalemate in Afghanistan.” Currently there are between 12,000 and 13,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan at any given time, roughly 8,000 to 9,000 of whom are American. In addition, the force is augmented by roughly double that number of contractors. But the vast majority of these troops serve in advisory and training roles, as coalition special operations and air support assets have dwindled significantly in-country as the Obama Administration’s timeline for pull-out crept on. Making matters worse is the fact that the Afghan Air Force had a late start on reforming. The Pentagon fumbled around for a decade trying to get them a light attack aircraft that could provide something near the same precision air support that coalition manned aircraft and drones provided for coalition and Afghan troops for years. Now, with a spattering of aerial assets of their own but just a shadow of available coalition air power compared to the past, the ANA is facing a far more equal fight against a hardened guerrilla army and various extremist factions that can melt at will into the local populous and across borders. The claim that a stalemate is underway in Afghanistan isn’t quite accurate. Afghan forces are losing ground in their own country, and there are worries that if this accelerates it could cause a domino effect that could see over a decade-and-a-half of bloody coalition operations wiped away in a matter of months—even weeks. Furthermore, ANA soldiers lost in combat cannot be replaced fast enough to keep end strength on target, and this is especially true within Afghan special forces units that do some of the most intense and critical fighting. The fact that many Afghan regulars don’t show up, or their leadership dissolves in battle, continues to put the entire force into question. On the enemy side of the equation, funding from poppy farms that feed heroin production continues to enrich the Taliban with hard cash. Safe havens across the border in Pakistan continue to be a major problem even a decade and a half after the Taliban was initially routed in battle. These two factors combined have likely led to a “stalemate” more than any other. During the hearing, General Nicholson noted that 20 of the 98 terrorist organizations designated by the State Department—including ISIS, Haqqani Network, al Qaeda, and others—are active in the country, with many crossing over the border from Pakistan. The General also made it clear that the large youth populations in both countries—200 million people, 70 percent of whom are under 30—make them rife for the gestation of terrorist networks and recruitment of young and willing individuals. In the long term, this alone poses a massive threat to stability in the region and to US national security. To make matters worse, Russia and Iran have increased their involvement in Afghanistan in recent months. The General stated: “The Russian involvement this year has become more difficult … They have begun to publicly legitimize the Taliban. This narrative that they promote is that the Taliban are fighting the Islamic State and the Afghan government is not fighting Islamic State and therefore there can be a spillover of this group into the region. This is a false narrative.” He added that coalition counter-terror forces have taken the fight to ISIS in Afghanistan, reducing the number of ISIS fighters in the country by half and their territory by two thirds. They have also taken out the majority of their top leadership. As for the motive behind Russia’s actions, the general says they are aimed at discrediting and undermining the US and its NATO partners. https://youtube.com/watch?v=XJfSX9v-ta8 The general also said that Shiite Iran is actually assisting Sunni Taliban in the country’s western reaches, and is recruiting Taliban fighters in Afghanistan to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Obviously, this goes against traditional theocratic ties, but Iran now sees Afghanistan as a ripe breeding ground for proxy warriors. When you take this all into account, it appears the general is possibly seeking a change in strategy in Afghanistan—one free from the rail-like political programming that the Obama administration largely stuck to. It’s hard to argue that the US doesn’t have a vested interest in the war-torn country, or a national security one. If Afghanistan were to fall to the Taliban, or just become a completely decentralized maelstrom of extremist interests, it would surely resume as a major breeding ground for international terrorism. Plus, a total breakdown of Afghan stability could spread into deeply troubled Pakistan, a country that possess an extensive nuclear arsenal and maintains a large standing military. At the same time, the US and its coalition partners have been in Afghanistan for nearly 16 years, and without an indigenous security force capable of keeping control within its own borders, the US would have to accept the fact that it could be decades before it could actually leave. What to do with Afghanistan will likely be an early test for the Trump administration. During the campaign, Trump bemoaned the mishandling of Afghanistan, including Obama’s controversial timetable for largely pulling out of the country militarily. At the same time, sending just a few thousand more troops to reinvigorate America’s longest war could also go against Trump’s highly publicized aim of “putting America first” when it comes to international engagements. Not just that, but “winning” in Afghanistan is really a fantasy at this point; although stabilizing the country slowly over many years may be possible, it also wouldn’t be cheap. The real problem is that we don’t have—indeed never had—any sort of policy on Afghanistan from Donald Trump. It was seldom talked about during the campaign, and candidate Trump often said he had plans for America’s military engagements abroad without giving details. As such, there is an equal chance the White House decides to put 10,000 troops back into Afghanistan “to get the job done” as there is a chance that they won’t commit any more troops at all. I have said for years that the best we can really expect in the near- and medium-term from Afghanistan under President Obama’s policy is a narco-feudal state rife with corruption. At worst, it becomes a fragmented and bloody expanse of chaos that represents an open operating space for terror groups. Much of this has to do with the pulling out of the vast majority of close air support and aerial surveillance assets in-country, including embedded forward air controllers on the ground. This potent mix was largely what dismantled the Taliban in the first place, and expecting the fledgling Afghan National Army to prevail without the same key advantages that helped the coalition make and sustain large gains during their tenure in Afghanistan is wishful thinking at best. In fact, I’m surprised the Afghan Army is doing as well as it is. General Nicholson also mentioned that Secretary of Defense Mattis would be speaking to America’s allies about Afghanistan in the coming weeks, and may even visit there. This would likely be prelude to official recommendations from the Pentagon on an Afghanistan policy going forward. Whether that is a policy that the Administration wants to hear is another story. One thing is for certain: expect Afghanistan, the forgotten war, to emerge front and center as a national issue in the coming weeks. And what exactly President Trump decides to do with it will be a good indicator of how the White House will act when it comes to other military engagements in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 21, 2016",First Civilian Version of the C-130J Super Hercules Rolls Off the Assembly Line,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like the legendary “legacy” C-130 Hercules series of ridiculously versatile military cargo haulers that was offered in civilian form under the L-100 designation, the C-130J Super Hercules now has a civilian variant of its own— the LM-100J . And the first of them just rolled out of Lockheed’s plant in Marietta, Georgia. In 2014, after a decade and a half of juggling the decision to put the Super Hercules into production for the civilian market, Lockheed finally pulled the trigger on the idea. Now, with the aircraft being prepared for flight testing, the aerospace and defense giant aims to obtain FAA certification for the new C-130J derivative and start delivering aircraft to buyers. If everything goes as planned, this could occur in early to mid 2018. L-100s have flown for a huge list of operators over the last half century, including with Delta as this photo from 1968 shows. Even some militaries ended up with L-100s in their fleet instead of C-130s (photo credit Bill Larkins/Wikicommons): 114 L-100s based on the militarized C-130E were built from 1964 to 1992. Although sales were never stellar for the sub-type, airworthy examples are a hot commodity today, with about a third of the fleet still in action all around the world . Seeing how the cargo market has changed dramatically in the last 25 years, especially in the outsized cargo segment , there is a logical business case for adding a civilian version to the highly active military C-130J line. In fact, there are already orders on the books for the LM-100J—and once the aircraft obtains full FAA certification, more will likely follow. The C-130J family serves with 16 nations and has amassed 1.5 million flight hours since the type’s first flight in 1996. That gives the LM-100J a big lead on certification, not to mention development costs, compared to a clean sheet design. George Shultz, general manager for Air Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin describes the LM-100J’s attractiveness to potential operators: “Our existing L-100 operators have repeatedly shared with us that the only replacement for a Herc is a Super Herc, and we are proud to meet this demand with the LM-100J,” Schultz said. “There is a significant global requirement for commercial freight operations to support operations in more austere areas. The LM-100J will not only meet these demands, but exceed them by delivering new and unmatched capabilities to the commercial marketplace by transporting cargo on any runway, anywhere, all the time.” A Lockheed press release also touts some of the LM-100J’s virtues: “As it is based on the operational C-130J, the civil variant LM-100J can operate from short, unprepared airfields without ground support equipment. It requires minimal material handling equipment and enables rapid onload and offload at truck-bed height.” Just like its militarized cousin , the LM-100J’s mission possibilities are nearly infinite. Although austere operations and moving oversized cargo are the aircraft’s basic mission set, firefighting, airdrop delivery, humanitarian and disaster relief, search and rescue, mining and oilfield support and exploration, airspray and oil dispersion, medevac, and personnel transport are just some of the jobs this aircraft can do. In effect, these planes could end up doing anything from moving heavy equipment to dirt strips in Africa, to transporting wealthy tourists to Antarctica , to lugging around an oil-rich sheik’s stable of race horses.  Some cash-strapped countries or coalitions could even use charter LM-100Js to augment their own expensive airlift fleets as needed. Doing so would offer a much more elastic supply of airlift capability with a proven and familiar platform, especially for missions to austere and rough fields. The C-130 is a legendary aircraft, but the original civilian model may have been just too ahead of its time. And even though Lockheed has not set its sights too high when it comes to LM-100J production numbers, saying there seems to be a need for at least 75-100 examples, I have a feeling the LM-100J will blow by that number with ease. We’ll keep you updated as the program matures.

However you feel about about the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and its use of “direct action” tactics, you have to hand it to them—they built up a diverse and formidable fleet over the last decade. Sea Shepherd, with its monk-like figurehead Captain Paul Watson , had been going about its business for decades alongside other eco-activist organizations like Green Peace, but once “Whale Wars” aired in 2008, their notoriety and public awareness exponentially increased, as did their coffers. The show took viewers aboard Sea Shepherd vessels for their most dramatic, complex and high-risk yearly operation. These months long campaigns aimed to stop, or at least greatly curtail, the Japanese whaling fleet’s harvesting of hundreds of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary near antarctica. By most accounts, the group has been successful at doing just that. The show brought in viewers from both sides of the issue because it was just downright fascinating to watch. Maybe the most interesting aspect of the show was that it really depicted a less-than-lethal—hopefully—military game of cat-and-mouse between Sea Shepherd’s forces and those of the Japanese whaling fleet. High-speed harpoon boats were turned into clandestine reconnaissance and intervention vessels, helicopters and UAVs were put to work scanning for the elusive whaling fleet, small boats were sent swarming, and ships ventured where they really shouldn’t with massive storms, dangerous icefields, and a relatively green crew being as much a threat to the mission’s success as anything else. The big payoff came some seasons when Watson’s fleet converged on the massive factory ship—a ominous vessel surrounded by harpoon ships where whales would disappear up its bloody stern ramp to be processed for “science” and packaged for future sale. Often times paint would be traded between vessels, and in some cases ships would even be sunk during bizarre maritime jousting. It was amazing television that had flavors of ancient naval warfare and science fiction all rolled into one, and for many fans, the cause was extremely just. Eventually production of the show was curtailed due to a maze of legal issues , but by that time, with dozens of episodes under its belt and main characters fully established, Sea Shepherd became a household name. The international non-profit group was receiving big checks for new ships, high-tech equipment, and its never ending legal defense on multiple fronts. Now, after years of being out of the the cable TV spotlight, the controversial group has only grown their operation with major celebrity supporters on their donor and ambassador roster.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 25, 2017",North Korea’s Latest Missile Test Highlights Ominous New Capabilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we reported on January 3rd, Kim Jong Un promised that a test of a new advanced ballistic missile system would occur in the near future. As President Trump ended his third week in office, and as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a state visit to Washington DC and to Trump’s self proclaimed “Winter White House”— his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida— Kim Jong Un made good on that promise. As the sun came up in northwestern North Korea, under the gaze of the young tyrant Kim Jong Un, a missile canister hinged upward from the back of a never seen before transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) and let loose its payload. The stout rocket levitated into the air before its motor ignited and it started a steep parabolic  trajectory flight. Minutes later the rocket splashed into the Sea of Japan roughly 300 miles from its launch point. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vBqo9eS4tSw Word of the launch came shortly before Trump and Abe, along with their delegations, sat down for a candlelight dinner at the resort. Flash briefings of what had happened supposedly came in the form of printed memos that were distributed to both teams, sending aids running for better light and using the glow of their cellphones (probably not the most secure thing to do) to read what the intelligence report said. Supposedly this moment was caught in the photo below taken during the lavish evening. A statement by both leaders quickly followed, with Trump stating the US would back Japan “100 percent.” This was likely a welcome statement for many Japanese to hear after Trump questioned America’s military commitment to Japan during the election cycle. Examining the footage from the launch, what’s far more impressive than the missile’s flight profile was how it made its way out of its canister. Instead of blasting off under the power of its own engines from a vertical position, the missile was “cold launched” into the air using compressed gas, after which its motor ignited and it successfully began its climb. Cold launching is a hard capability to master, but if perfected it can result in a lighter, longer-ranged missile that can be deployed very quickly, as well as a less weighty TEL. Cold launches also feature a “cleaner” launch sequence with less localized impact, and allows for launches in tighter spaces. On the other hand, if the missile’s fuel and rocket systems are not reliable, a cold launch of a solid-fueled missile can be more dangerous than a liquid-fuel missile that uses the hot launch method. This is because once the missile is ejected during a cold launch, if its motor fails to start as timed it will fall back down on the TEL and explode. Cold launch systems can also have wind limitations as well, although this may not be an issue for such a heavy missile. Also of interest was the missile itself, which looked very much like the two-stage KN-11 “North Star/Polaris” submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that North Korea had tested on multiple occasions last year. Its flight profile was also very similar.  This potentially land-based variant of the KN-11 is being reported by North Korean media as having the designation “Pukguksong-2.” Its name is immaterial, but what does matter is the fact that it seems as if the North Koreans have begun to master the use of solid rocket propellants. Just nine months ago, as it was becoming clear Pyongyang’s missile development strategy was dramatically changing , it was thought that North Korea was in the beginning stages of applying solid-fuel technology to their ballistic missile systems. Now it seems glaringly possible that they have actually achieved initial functionality of solid-fuel designs, both those that can be launched from land-based TELs and from submarines. As The War Zone reported last May: “Ballistic missiles that use a solid-fuel based propulsion concept can be stored for long periods of time with little maintenance requirements and can take much more abuse while remaining mission capable. Most importantly, they can be launched much faster than their clumsy liquid-fueled counterparts. However, the propulsion technology behind solid-fueled missiles is much more challenging to master. It is known that North Korea has been testing solid fuel rocket engines . If one of these adolescent engines was fitted to the submarine-launched missile that was tested recently, it is possible it’s flight was short because the limitations of this early iteration of a solid fuel propellant and motor. If this is the case, it’s likely that the goal of the test was proving launch capability , not downrange flight capability. The weak thrust of a new solid-fuel motor may have limited the amount of fuel that could be loaded onto the missile. By loading less fuel, the thrust-to-weight ratio required for the missile to fly off after being “cold launched” from its underwater missile tube could be achieved. If the KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile fired late last month had a new solid-fuel based propulsion system, we should be concerned. If North Korea has moved to this more promising but complex rocket technology, it will have repercussions across each of their ballistic missile and rocket programs. Once mature, this technology would signify a giant leap in reliability and quick-launch capability for Pyongyang, and it would align with its stated goal of creating a credible nuclear deterrent as quickly as possible. It could also mean that the deployment of nuclear armed ballistic missiles on future North Korean submarines is entirely plausible.” Kim Jong Un appears to celebrate with troops after the launch, the empty TEL looming in the background (STR/AFP/Getty Images): Although North Korea claims this is a long-range ballistic missile, its actual range still seems limited to below that of an intermediate range ballistic missile— say roughly 800 miles on a minimum energy trajectory . This still puts South Korea and much of Japan within its reach. As such, this is really a theatre ballistic missile as much as anything else, but using a more rigid rubric, it likely sits somewhere near the bottom of the medium-range ballistic missile designation spectrum. Regardless of its current range capabilities, if last year was any indication, North Korea will likely make massive strides this year in creating better solid fuel propellants and motors that will take their missile designs on increasingly longer-range flight profiles. Also, the cold launch capability may be limiting how much fuel North Korean missile testers load onto these KN-11 derivatives. But even if the missile’s range does not increase, it can fly far enough to take on North Korea’s most pressing military capability—that of a quickly deployable, robust nuclear delivery system that can hit targets that are on the top of Pyongyang’s priority list. North Korea acting quickly to extrapolate its most mature solid-fuel ballistic missile system from the sea to land makes a lot of sense. Building a capable fleet of submarines that can deploy ballistic missiles in relevant numbers is a longer-term and much more costly goal than building TELs that can move similar missiles around the North Korean countryside. Land-based ballistic missiles traditionally don’t offer a credible “second-strike” deterrent compared to their submarine-based counterparts. But a road-mobile, solid-fuel missile like this one does provide a much more elusive and tactically relevant baseline nuclear weapons delivery capability than North Korea’s more cumbersome liquid-fueled ballistic missiles. The fact is that even if North Korea could potentially deploy the same ballistic missile on a small fleet of diesel-electric submarines, those submarine would likely be continuously hunted and tracked by US, South Korean and Japanese submarines. As such, the chances of one actually getting off a shot before being sunk is questionable at best. As such, putting more resources into deploying a land-based KN-11 in the short term, and working to develop a submarine-based second-strike deterrent over the long term makes great sense. As we discussed earlier, liquid-fueled missiles take time to fuel in their launch position, leaving them especially vulnerable to detection and attack by US and South Korean forces. If this land-based KN-11 derivative indeed runs on solid fuel, that would mean that it can be launched in a matter of minutes from the back of its TEL. This ability to “scoot-n-shoot” makes it a far larger threat than anything that came before it within North Korea’s strategic arsenal. By mirroring the submarine-launched KN-11 program, Pyongyang can bring a land-based solid-fuel missile online quicker than by developing two separate systems independently. Also, by combining efforts, both versions of the missile can develop far faster than otherwise. Paired with a proven nuclear warhead, an operational version of this system could give North Korea its first robust nuclear deterrent capability. Also, by pushing forward with a relatively mature, shorter-ranged missile like this one, North Korea can take more time developing longer-ranged ICBM. Another peculiar thing about this new missile system is that its transporter-erector-launcher is tracked instead of wheeled. There is some precedent for such a strange setup though. The short-lived, Soviet RT-15/ SS-14 “Scamp /Scapegoat,” and RT-20/SS-15 “Scrooge” missile systems from the 1960s had a similar setup, and used a T-10 tank chassis for the TEL’s mobile base. North Korea’s tracked TEL seems to be a unique design, although that could change as more time for research is available. As with most things North Korean, it is likely adapted from something similar. Photo of ’60 vintage SS-14 TEL: While technological evaluations of this new missile continue, countries around the world and in the region scorned the launch, although China was much lighter in their condemnation. Chinese F oreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang publically stated : “ “We will take a constructive and responsible part in the relevant discussion… Under current circumstances, relevant sides should not provoke each other or take actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula… As I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, the root cause to the North Korea nuclear missile issue is the conflicts between North Korea and the United States, as well as between North and South Korea.” Japan, the US and South Korea have called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the test and what actions that can be taken against Pyongyang for its continued violation of UN resolutions. International action or inaction aside, this latest launch will test the Trump administration which has yet to put forward a hard policy regarding North Korea. In the past, candidate Trump showed great concern and also a strange form of admiration for Kim Jong Un . Trump even said he would try to engage the “Young General” in unilateral negotiations , although this is highly unlikely to happen. President Trump could try to make some sort of deal with Beijing—which North Korea relies on for everything from grain to energy imports—whereby the US turns its head on a strategic issue in exchange for Beijing dramatically reining in Pyongyang. This could even be tied to President Trump’s stated hot-button initiative to rebalance trade with China. Still, it is unlikely China would give away their “Kim card” as part of a trade negotiation alone. Even the US agreeing to shelve its THAAD ballistic missile interceptor deployment plans to the Korean Peninsula would likely be too little for China to fully attack the issue head-on. Something much more controversial would likely be the price of such an extreme change in policy—like the US looking the other way when it comes to China’s man-made island building campaign in South China Sea and their territorial claims to the region , packaged with a series of maritime navigation assurances. Whether the administration would actually execute such a deal is unknown, but Trump is all about making deals, and asking China to change North Korea’s attitude on a drastic scale will take a big sacrifice in return.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 5, 2017",Russia Breaks Arms Control Treaty By Deploying Land-Based Cruise Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s shadowy SSC-8 land-based land-attack cruise missile has been in testing for nearly a decade, but now, according to The New York Times , the system has gone operational and has been deployed to two separate locations. Although both the US and Russia have thousands of cruise missiles they are not supposed to have land-based cruise or ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear or conventional warheads over a range of 300 to 3,400 miles according to the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987. The SSC-8 is speculated to have a range of of well over 1,000 miles, and possibly as far as 1,500 miles. Since the treaty’s execution, both the US and Russia have concentrated their cruise missile arsenals to sea-based and air launched varieties, with the US throwing away its Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles and BGM-109G Gryphon cruise missiles based on the Navy’s Tomahawk.  Then in 2008 Russia began testing what US intelligence believed was a land-based cruise missile, possibly based on the Kalibr family of cruise missiles used by Russian naval units today. This was a blatant violation of the treaty, and the Obama administration worked to stop Russia’s testing of the missile in an effort to keep the treaty intact. The administration even floated the possibility of reconstituting America’s own ground-based cruise missile program in Europe as a reaction to Russia’s actions. Obviously these efforts proved futile and the fact that the SSC-8 is now operationally deployed leaves no room for interpretation as to Russia’s intentions. The US Gryphon and Pershing II missile programs both ended following the execution of the IRNFT: The New York Times writes: “Administration officials said the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. One is still located at Russia’s missile test site at Kapustin Yar in southern Russia near Volgograd. The other was shifted in December from that test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country, according to a senior official who did not provide further details and requested anonymity to discuss recent intelligence reports about the missile.” Russia, which has become an adept player at using their easily deployed missile systems— namely their S-400 air defense system , Iskander short-range ballistic missile system , and Bastion coastal defense system —as strategic “anti-access/area denial chess pieces in Syria , Crimea and in Europe. Yet all these systems have a range of less than 300 miles, treaty defined or not, giving them formidable but still limited reach. If the SSC-8 were deployed among these systems, Russia could strike targets across entire continents, not just across a border or two. Considering Russia’s missile-heavy foreign policy playbook, you can see why such a capability would be attractive, especially in an effort to level the playing field against a coalition with advanced airpower and naval systems like NATO. Russia used cruise missiles extensively during their air campaign in Syria, launching them from ships , bombers, and even submarines , which was strange because the airspace was permissive and there was no need for standoff weaponry. Part of this was to test and showcase available weaponry and capabilities to potential buyers on the world stage, and for propaganda purposes. Another part was because Russia still lacks precision attack capability and weapons for most its tactical aircraft units, leaving expensive cruise missiles as the default heavy precision strike option. Even Russia’s Bastion coastal defense system deployed to Syria used its P-800 Oniks supersonic missiles in land-attack mode against targets in Syria during the campaign. Here is both the Kaliber and Bastion in action during Syrian operations: https://youtube.com/watch?v=qsXIALWlb5M If Russia could deploy large numbers of these missiles, possibly both conventionally and nuclear armed, along their western border, as well as in the enclave of Kaliningrad and in Crimea, it would give Moscow a massive precision strike capability that can range across Europe, something that by and large Russia’s tactical air forces continue to lack. Fielding large quantities of road-mobile, conventionally armed land-based cruise missiles is also a relatively cheap proposition, at least in terms of the alternative. After the initial acquisition cost of the missiles and their transporter-erector-launchers (TELs), upkeep and training is just a tiny fraction of the cost of a high-end combat aircraft. And even those are not as survivable and do not possess the range of land attack cruise missile. The fact is that Russia is not the only one that appears to be moving away from some of the landmark arms treaties that have kept both countries’ arsenals in check. The US may also be heading down this road. During a recent phone call with Vladimir Putin, President Trump was supposedly asked if he wanted to renew the New START treaty, he paused, asked his aids and replied that he thought it was a bad deal for the US that favored Russia. New START is a key treaty that demands caps on deployable nuclear weapons stockpiles, including these aggregate limitations: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments; 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (each such heavy bomber is counted as one warhead toward this limit); 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. There are also other important stipulations on verification and inspections included in the agreement. Maybe above all else, New START could work as a jumping off place for increasing limitations on nuclear arms and their delivery systems, and is the best route to potentially get to a place where either country cannot destroy the planet many times over with their own arsenal alone. With all this in mind, what’s most concerning is that both sides, Russia and the US, seem to be moving away from cooperating on arms control overall, which is a dangerous and dark path to stroll down to say the least. As for the SSC-8, if the system gets fielded in large numbers, European countries may decide to invest in their own land-based land-attack cruise missiles to provide long-range precision striking capabilities into Russian territory—if the US does not protest it. This is not a good outcome as one mistake, one errant missile from either side, could elicit a much a wider response and become a springboard to an all-out conflict. Also, when you consider that conventionally armed weapons do not have the same rigid command and control structures that nuclear ones do, and that there is no way of really knowing if one is armed with a nuclear or conventional warhead, this is even more concerning. As for the US, drastically increasing ballistic missile defenses in Europe may be an abstract response, but it won’t help with countering a dramatically enhanced cruise missile threat. These missiles fly nap-of-the-earth using terrain and contour matching. Shooting them down is problematic for ground-based systems, and until recently, shooting them down over land in the air-to-air realm also had its issues as they hide in the ground clutter and shadows on radar. The advent of advanced electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and airborne early warning and control aircraft (AEW&C) with similarly advanced radar systems and large quantities of processing power have made shooting down low-flying cruise missiles overland a more reliable affair. This was one of the main reasons American Air National Guard F-15C/Ds have been re-equipped with powerful APG-63V3 AESA radars and why America’s, and other nations’, airborne early warning and control aircraft have received substantial upgrades . Existing fighters, like the F-16 and soon the Eurofighter Typhoon and others, can be upgraded with AESA radar sets , but it costs millions per aircraft and you still need to train pilots for the mission and have plenty of aircraft and costly air-to-air missiles on hand to actually execute it successfully. Ground-based SAM systems could also be used to shoot down cruise missiles by leveraging a common data-link picture provided by an AEW&C aircraft and any AESA-equipped airborne fighters under a cooperative engagement-like concept. But even this capability is still relatively new at its time, and interoperability among diverse air and ground based defensive systems will be a major ongoing issue in realizing it on a wide scale. Some eastern european air arms that have antiquated Soviet-era fleets are slowly upgrading with second-hand F-16s and other fighters, but equipping these aircraft with AESA radars would be a high cost for already cash-strapped forces: NATO could work together to fund common systems and their supporting architecture to built a credible cruise missile defense, but it will take time and cost considerable amounts of money. Many of the countries that are closest to the threat are not wealthy and some don’t even have their own fighter aircraft at all (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia) . As such doing so would be a huge undertaking that would still take years to develop and field, and even then it would be hard-pressed to be able to counter larger volleys of SSC-8s skimming over the eastern European countryside. The US could deploy AESA equipped fighters on a permanent basis to the region, but that would require a major expansion in force structure to support. The cheapest and safest way to counter new military capabilities is to stop their development before they become operational. President Obama failed miserably in this respect with the SSC-8, in the same way he failed to forestall China’s island-building campaign in the South China Sea or North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. Will Trump replicate this failing record? We’ll have to wait and see, but by most indications, at least when it comes to Russia and strategic arms, he seems in favor of throwing away at least some of the stability-infusing agreements of the past and in his own words “let it be an arms race.” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 6, 2017",Kim Jong Un’s Brother Reportedly Assassinated By Poison Wielding Hit-Girl,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The older half-brother of tyrant Kim Jong Un, and once heir to the North Korean autocracy, Kim Jong Nam, was supposedly attacked yesterday morning by a young female assassin wearing hot pink leggings and an “LOL” branded t-shirt. Some reports state that poisoned needles and/or a poison soaked rag was used in the attack. The whole thing went down inside Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, in a merchant concourse on the terminal side of the security line. The 45-year-old was waiting to board a flight to Macau when he was assaulted. After the attack, Kim made his way to a ticket counter asking for help, and later died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. Before Kim Jong Nam died, he apparently told responders in the ambulance that he had “felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind,” according to Malaysian investigators. Details remain murky and the story will likely change, but one thing is for certain: the half-brother of Pyongyang’s young tyrant is deceased, and all fingers are pointing to the North Korean regime as the responsible party. Why Kim Jong Un would attempt a brazen hit of his exiled and estranged brother—it is unclear if they have ever even met—is not clear. Kim Jong Nam, who attended boarding school in Europe, had made a handful of comments about his wish that North Korea would open up to the world and move towards democracy, and that his half-brother was not fit for the job , but he was hardly an activist and had remained quiet in recent years. As for the possibility of him returning home to rival or replace his half brother, that would have been very unlikely. Although older than Kim Jong Un by an unknown number of years—12 would be a good guess—Kim Jong Nam hasn’t been considered as capable of living life as the ruler of an authoritarian state for over a decade and a half. At one time he was supposedly being groomed for the roll, but after getting nabbed at Tokyo’s Narita International Airport in 2001 while trying to infiltrate the country with a fake Dominican passport—so that he could visit Mickey and Minnie Mouse in Disneyland—the idea of him as a potential successor to Kim Jong Il was apparently dropped. Kim Jong Nam (left) and Kim Jong Un (right): In recent years, Kim is thought to reside mainly in Macau and Beijing, but has been known to travel around Asia with fake travel documents, oftentimes from party to party. It is commonly believed that he has been living under the close protection of China’s security apparatus and may have been on Beijing’s payroll. This may sound odd, but considering the “unique” relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang, such an arrangement would be unsurprising. With this in mind, Kim may have been left without guards once he passed through airport security, leaving him vulnerable to attack by a trained assassin. If Kim Jong Nam’s half-brother did indeed order the hit, maybe it had been in the works for some time, but was only able to be executed now that Kim Jong Un has consolidated his power within Pyongyang’s complicated ruling structure. Kim Jong Un has killed family members before , although doing so “off the reservation” in a foreign country is a bold move, and one that will have ramifications internationally if it proves true. As for South Korea, they already say they know the murder was the result of North Korean agents’ handiwork. Also, the death comes at a time of shifting relations between the US and China, in which North Korea may become a fulcrum . Shortly after Kim Jong Nam died, police put out CCTV stills of a young woman who looks like anything but an assassin. Malaysian police have since caught the suspect, a 28-year-old carrying Vietnamese travel documents. Nothing more is known about her at this time. There have been reports of other suspects, including a connection with individuals from Myanmar, but Malaysian police have not confirmed any of these accounts. We will keep this page updated throughout the day with more information as it comes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 6, 2016","In Kazakhstan, Helicopter Gunship Pilots Ask Truckers For Directions","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have seen all types of videos of low flying aircraft taken by dashcams in countries that were once Soviet-alligned, but this may be a first. The video below was taken in Kazakhstan and shows a convoy of truckers having the road ahead of them blocked by a Mi-8/Mi-17 gunship. At first the scene looks ominous, but then one of the helicopter pilots jumps out of the “Hip” and runs to the lead trucker’s door to ask for directions to the nearest city. And once he gets pointed in the right direction, he runs back to the helo and quickly gets back into the air clearing the road for truckers to continue on their way. RT has provided a translation of what the men are saying in the video: “They were lost,” says a voice on the convoy radio, failing to suppress his laughter. “He came to ask which way to Aktobe.” “How can you get lost in the steppe? How the hell can you get lost in the steppe?” It’s not uncommon for attack helicopter pilots to land nearby the troops they are supporting, and to hop out and quickly come up with a game plan or to get clarification as to what areas need suppressing or strikes from above. But asking for directions by blocking a highway? That’s seems to be something unique at least in these days of satellite navigation. Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Defense was flooded with inquiries after the video began showing up in local news sites and online. They responded saying the pilots were doing a visual flight rules exercise, which included finding their way via “human survey.” They also added that the exercise was a success and that the helicopter returned to airfield in which it was based. It’s great to hear that the Hip crew made it back safely, but I am not sure if having to land on a road and ask directions from a trucker really makes an exercise in pilotage a “success.” I guess any mission you return from intact could also fit the bill, and the snow covered planes of Kazakhstan probably are a bit of challenge when it comes to low-level visual navigation. Inclement weather also doesn’t help but you would think the crew would have some sort of backup navigation, even a commercial-grade GPS to help them out in a pinch. Regardless, the incident may make you look a little differently at those “low flying aircraft” road signs in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 18, 2017",Brazil Pulls The Plug On Its Only Aircraft Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fate of Brazil’s only aircraft carrier, the French-built Foch , which has carried the name NAe São Paulo since first flying the Brazilian flag in 2000, has been in limbo for over a decade. Now it has finally been announced that the Brazilian Navy has decided to decommission the vessel instead of refitting it for extended service as they had promised on and off over the last decade. The 55-year-old ship is in need of massive repairs—especially to its boilers and catapults—to accommodate Brazil’s handful of recently upgraded A-4 (local designation: AF-1) Skyhawks operationally again. You can read all about the ship and these unique jets here . But after years of inspections, cost estimates and maintenance deferrals, São Paulo will not get the deep refit it desperately needs. Instead, it will be decommissioned within the next three years. In the end, it was a matter of priorities. The ship supposedly needs ten years of work, and piles of cash to pay for it. By that time it will be questionable if Brazil will even have aircraft that are capable of flying off its decks. Most importantly, the Brazilian Navy has downgraded fixed-wing aircraft carrier capability to its third most pressing priority, after fielding a nuclear submarine and more corvettes. With Brazil’s economy still in tatters , it is unclear when, or how the Brazilian Navy intends to go about making their carrier replacement wishes a reality once the São Paulo is officially decommissioned. The truth is that under the current circumstances being the Navy’s third priority is likely not a realistic priority at all at this point. São Paulo sailing by Rio’s Sugar Loaf Mountain during better days (AP photo): Building a new carrier from scratch would be a monumental undertaking, both technologically and fiscally, with a questionable strategic return on investment. Buying a secondhand carrier capable of operating their Skyhawks, or even a future naval fighter like a navalized JAS-39E Gripen, is problematic simply because none will be available for the foreseeable future. Plus, all the remaining carriers capable of fielding Brazil’s Skyhawks run on nuclear propulsion. With this decision, the world is left with only two catapult assisted takeoff and barrier assisted recovery (CATOBAR) configured aircraft carrier operators. With the F-35B coming online , the wealthiest nations that are also allies of the US will be able to retain a CATOBAR-like capability without the high cost of a carrier configured for such operations. But aside from the possibility of purchasing second-hand AV-8B Harriers from the US in the coming decade, the fixed-wing carrier club will be increasingly exclusive, at least for the near future. China and India are both working on developing CATOBAR capabilities, but it will be years before these new vessels will be in operation. A Brazilian Navy AF-1 executing cross-deck operations with the USS Ronald Reagan in 2004 (US Navy photo): Brazil still intends to keep its dwindling force of upgraded A-4 Skyhawks flying and may even get their pilots shipboard experience by training abroad, with the US and France being their only possible partners in such an endeavour. Although it’s sad to see a capability that was totally unique to the region—and somewhat of a time capsule of ‘60 era naval aviation—go away, Brazil is making the right choices during hard times when it comes to putting their Navy’s dollars where they can make the most impact. Still, it is a hard hit for Brazil’s Navy who has prided itself on being one of the last vestiges of traditional carrier-based naval aviation .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Trump Cites Russian Intelligence Ship Off East Coast During Intense Presser,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Vishnya class intelligence collection ship Viktor Leonov has been prowling up the east coast, keeping about 30 miles from the shore in international waters. In recent days it has loitered off Groton, Connecticut , one of America’s master submarine bases, drawing ire in the press and interest from public. The ship is used primarily as a signals intelligence collection platform, sucking up electronic emissions such as communications and datalink transmissions. It is also likely equipped with hydrophones to listen for underwater contacts and to record their acoustic signatures. The ship is minimally armed for self defense with AK630 close in weapon systems and SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles, so it poses no kinetic threat to anyone ashore or even to nearby shipping traffic. Regardless, it is being closely shadowed by the US Coast Guard. Russian intelligence ships have a history of cruising the eastern seaboard, but generally they don’t roam as far north as Connecticut. The deepening tension between the US and Russia, as well as major accusations over the Trump Administration being infiltrated by Russian interests, have elevated the ship’s presence in the media to laughable proportions. Russian intelligence ships, like the Viktor Leonov, often spend time in Cuba before or after operations off American shores. In 2014 the ship sortied from Cuba to Naval Station Kings Bay, the east coast home of America’s nuclear ballistic missile submarines (photo AP): A press conference originally set up to announce the President’s pick for a replacement candidate for Labor Secretary , quickly turned into a venomous exchange with the media, which the administration has dubbed “the opposition party.” Russia was the main topic, and questions over the ousting of his short-lived National Security Advisor Michael Flynn took precedence. Trump denied any connections between him, or anyone on his campaign, and Russia. He also reasserted his message that the real story is unchecked leaks from the intelligence community—and most likely his own staff—not the actual possibility of having a Russian mole in the White House. During the fiery back and forth with reporters, which at times spun out into useless tangents and bizarre thought fragments, Trump brought up the presence of the Viktor Leonov. The comment was in relation to satisfying what he thinks is the media and the public’s overwhelming ire for Russia, stating, “The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship 30 miles offshore out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say “Oh, that’s so great…’ That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.” Another reporter listed recent military actions by Russia, including flying jets flying low near a US destroyer in the Black Sea, deploying ground-launched cruise missiles against a major weapons treaty, as well as the Viktor Leonov’s presence off the east coast. Trump replied in real time to each event repeating “not good” for every instance. He also said that the Russians are probably doing these things now because they think there is little chance of being able to get along with US under the current political conditions brought on by the accusations. Russia’s spy ship came up yet again during the press conference. Trump reiterated that he won’t discuss his military plans, and cited President Obama’s highly disclosed military timetables. Trump listed multiple examples of issues he was not willing to talk to the media about, stating, “What am I going to do with the Russian ship? Hopefully nothing. But I’m not going to tell you.” He went on to say the same thing for his plans for North Korea as well as other strategic issues. Overall, Trump made it clear that he would like to get along with Russia, and that taking a hard stance on Russian related issues now would keep him from doing “a deal” with Moscow in the future. As for the Viktor Leonov, it is hardly a pressing issue. Although sitting a couple dozen miles off the home of many of America’s nuclear fast attack submarines sends a message that “we’re here whether you like it or not,” the fact is Russia is not alone when it comes to standoff intelligence collection—far from it. America and its allies use ships and submarines to execute this same mission-set all the time, and Russia is often the target. Custom built-intelligence collection ships are forward based for the sole purpose of monitoring Russia’s naval operations near their own home port. The US in particular has a diverse armada of aerial intelligence gathering aircraft designed to fly along foreign borders to soak up electronic intelligence and to take pictures and synthetic aperture radar images of key installations—and it does it all the time. These include RC-135s, U-2s, RQ-4s, P-8s, EP-3s among others. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1j7sSFNUuZk Basically, the Russians are doing on a small scale what the US and its allies do on a daily basis around the world: that is spying in international airspace and waters. Certainly, having a Russian spy ship off the northeastern shores of the US may be interesting and something to keep an eye on, but it’s not as if the Russians sailed the Northern Fleet across the Atlantic to take up station off Washington, D.C. The ship’s actual intelligence gathering capabilities are also questionable. Sensitive information is highly encrypted and travels on discreet networks that are designed to take this form of spying into account. It doesn’t really help national security to act as if the presence of a signals intelligence collection ship going about its business is an overtly threatening act. America and its allies do similar things every day. In fact, portraying the ship’s presence in such a manner can put our own pilots and mariners—and those of our allies—in greater danger than they already are.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",Attack on Saudi Frigate off Yemen Was Made by Drone Boat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The successful swarming boat attack on the Saudi Frigate al Madinah in the southern Red Sea last January was thought to have been the result suicide bomber. Now, the US Navy claims that the boat that exploded at the stern of the frigate, killing two sailors and wounding three more, was remotely controlled. Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan, commander of the Fifth Fleet and head of US Naval Forces Central Command, told Defense News this weekend, “Our assessment is that it was an unmanned, remote-controlled boat of some kind.” He went on to describe why this is a troubling realization: “First that it is in the hands of someone like the Houthis. That’s not an easy thing to develop. There have been many terrorist groups that have tried to develop that, it’s not something that was just invented by the Houthis. There’s clearly support there coming from others, so that’s problematic. The second is the explosive boat piece—you don’t need suicide attackers to do a suicide-like attack. There are certain terrorists that do things and they get martyrs to go and do it. But there are many others that don’t want to martyr themselves in making attacks like that and that’s pretty much where the Houthis are. So it makes that kind of weaponry, which would normally take someone suicidal to use, now able to be used by someone who’s not going to martyr themselves.” Admiral Donegan talking naval warfare (AP photo). Admiral Donegan also noted that he was not certain that the boat was built by the Iranians, who back Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen, but he thinks its production is supported by Iran in some way. His conclusion comes as the result of examining reports detailing multiple shipments of interdicted arms and materiel sent from Iran to Houthi rebels. The admiral states: “So we know that weapons were shipped from Iran to Yemen. The question is at what level and how many, etc. We know what was in the weapon inventory of Yemen before the conflict started, and the Yemenis didn’t have a weapon that could range Riyadh , Saudi Arabia. That’s an 800-kilometer ballistic missile shot, whereas the Scud missile, about 200 kilometers is what it can do. They had a rudimentary coastal defense missile. But most of their systems had atrophied. So they’re being supported by Iran. Maybe there’s others supporting them, I don’t know. But for certain these things aren’t indigenous, there are parts and components that need to be coming from other places to make them effective like this… My biggest concern now is you’ve got nation-state-like weapons in the hands of non-nation-states. It’s not in the hands of the duly-elected government of Yemen. Some of them because they were able to pick up inventories of other weapons, and some because they’ve been augmented.” Video showing the attack from the rear flight-deck of the Saudi frigate, read all about it here. His fear is that these weapons will be turned against shipping through the critical Mandeb Strait, which could severely affect world commerce and the stability of an already unstable region. Roughly 65 vessels transit the strait on any given day. He also notes that over the last 15 years the US fighting conflicts in the region, this is the first time insurgent or rebel groups have moved a conflict into the naval realm ( partially accurate ), and that makes the idea that non-state actors have such capable weapons that much more concerning. “We’ve often talked in the past about the Strait of Hormuz being closed up. But the Bab al Mandeb and the Red Sea are so important for a couple of reasons. For one you have this flow of commerce that goes up to the Suez Canal. Anything going through the Suez Canal is feeding the Egyptian economy. We really can’t afford to have a reduction to the Egyptian economy. It’s fragile and we can’t have that. The other piece that happens is, diverting around the Red Sea and Bab al Mandeb is something potentially that the oil industry may be able to accommodate with some initial cost, but industries like liquid natural gas, there is no excess capacity in the transporting of it, nor is there excess storage capacity at the destinations. So any kind of slowdown in traffic through the Bab al Mandeb is going to have a pretty quick impact on both the region but also on the global supply of energy. Because of that just-in-time liquid natural gas piece, there’ll be a delay before the oil will be able to move in a different direction, and then you’ll have the impact on the local economies that are getting their money—especially Egypt.” I warned of the possibility of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels closing the strait two years ago just as the conflict emerged. I also described how the Iranian factor makes the situation far more ominous , as it’s possible they could act to close both the Strait of Hormuz and the Mandeb Strait simultaneously. The repercussions of such an act would be massive on a military, fiscal, and even humanitarian level. Iran is well known for their swarming fast-boat tactics and for their focus on pursuing unmanned technology , including remotely controlled surface vessels. The development of unmanned surface vessels is accelerating in the US and around the globe , but using them as guided munitions themselves is a development unique to the Middle East (AP photo). The fact that Houthi rebels are now fielding drone boats that can deliver deadly payloads by remote control is just another reminder of how improvised unmanned weapon systems are becoming the weapon of choice for traditionally low-tech insurgent and terror groups in the Middle East. A problem that is now moving from the air to the sea, which could wreak havoc on international shipping and the world economy. Just like the weaponization of hobby drones, this know-how will eventually spread to other parts of the globe and will represent serious security challenges for years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Blue Angels are hard at work at their winter home of NAF El Centro, California, preparing for the 2017 air show season. After a month or so of training under their belt, the fabled naval aviation outpost hosts visitors from all rungs of the aviation photography community to show off not just the Blue Angels, but also what the base is all about. Hosting the Navy’s flight demonstration team in the winter is just a small part of the base’s mission. It’s a Mecca of sorts for naval aviation training, with all types of US Navy and Marine Corps aircraft—and even those of other countries—flocking to the base to take advantage of the relatively clear airspace, great weather, and close-by bombing ranges. Before photographers venture “inside the wire” for an up-close encounter with the Blues and the visiting aircraft, the group often huddles outside the eastern end of the base to catch the action from afar. Aviation photographers are generally masters at finding even the tiniest advantage in angle and composition offered by their often-limiting perspectives. El Centro is a farming town along California’s Highway 8 that straddles the southern border. With farms come hay bales, and sometimes these are stacked in just the right position to offer an amazing view down the same runway the Blue Angels use for their practice demos. (The rooftops of cars can also do the trick.) It is under these circumstances that the incredible videos shot below are captured. It has to be the single best angle on terra firma of the Blues’ iconic diamond departure. I have spent weeks at NAF El Centro over the years snapping some of my favorite photos in my portfolio . The fact that the base has no permanent aircraft and is located near a remote rural town has zero impact on the esprit de corps of the sailors that work there. Of all the bases I have been to, El Centro is the most welcoming and its staff is consistently top notch. Above all else, their public affairs team is absolutely passionate about and creative when it comes to keeping the public interested and informed about the hard work that goes on there. Do yourself a favor and mark the El Centro Air Show on your calendar—it may not be the biggest in the US, but when it comes to air shows on military bases, it has the most heart. As you can see the public affairs team goes the extra mile to get the media absolutely as close to the action as possible. NAF El Centro is truly a unique place: Here is the Blue Angels’ schedule for 2017 . If you can’t make their opener at NAF El Centro on March 11th , then make sure you catch them somewhere closer to home.

China’s stealthy J-20 fighter-interceptor program continues to gain steam, with deep avionics integration work underway and even reports the jet is already deployed in a semi-operational state. Now the aircraft has appeared in a totally new configuration, toting a quartet of massive auxiliary fuel tanks (aka, drop tanks or “bags”) under its usually clean wings. #China #PLAAF #J20 #Stealth with four external drop tanks. via CDF/Deino,fxmdlr_ms pic.twitter.com/vTdUkyexSJ — 卫纳夜格.巴特 Col Vinayak Bhat (Retd) @Raj47 (@rajfortyseven) February 21, 2017 The J-20 is designed to capitalize on glaring holes in American air combat capabilities. This primarily includes US tactical air power’s lack of range and its dependence on force-multiplying assets like tanking, airborne early warning and control, data-fusion and other lumbering and potentially vulnerable aircraft. China building a stealthy fighter-interceptor that can range far from the mainland and work to pick off these enabling support aircraft, as well as other fighters, is tactically sound. On a larger level, the J-20 works as an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) weapon, pushing out the PLAAF’s anti-air reach while also bringing a whole new level of capabilities to the flying force’s tactical aircraft inventory. All this fits into China’s overall A2/AD strategy, which aims to deny an opposing force the ability to operate within hundreds, or even thousands or miles of the Chinese mainland—far enough that many of said enemy’s offensive military capabilities are automatically neutered. But executing long-range combat air patrols or stalking an enemy’s vulnerable force multiplier assets are not the only ways such an aircraft could be put to use. Outside of possible secondary air-to-ground, air-to-surface and suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses roles, the J-20’s advanced avionics can be leveraged to benefit lesser platforms within the air-to-air realm. If the photos are legitimate, and they appear to be, by adding auxiliary fuel tanks, the J-20 will be able to fly even further than it does today, not just for ferrying operations, but also for air sovereignty missions, just like F-22s do in Alaska. Additionally, the ability to haul thousands of pounds of fuel externally will allow the J-20 to loiter for long periods of time, during which time the aircraft can act as a sensor node and “quarterback” for other aircraft Chinese tactical aircraft. Once again, this is a tactic the F-22 pioneered to some degree, as even after its magazine runs dry, Raptors are often kept on the scene to direct other coalition aircraft not just towards the enemy to assist in kills, but away from them as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=syoGplWl8P8 Although cumbersome external fuel tanks sap the J-20’s low observable (stealth) qualities and maneuvering performance, it is likely that they can be jettisoned along with their pylons in a similar manner as the F-22. This allows the aircraft to recapture a large degree of its low observability, and is clearly useful if increased kinematic performance is needed. The tanks will also allow J-20s to reach stations hundreds of miles beyond what they are capable on external fuel alone. They will make the J-20 more independent of aerial tankers for certain missions, and even with four tanks, the J-20’s baseline internal weapon carriage capability is not disturbed. F-22A test aircraft during external tank/pylon jettison tests (USAF): It is also becoming increasingly evident that for some missions the J-20, or a least a portion of them, are likely to carry weapons under their wings. In particular, China’s new and nearly telephone pole sized very long-range air-to-air missile that is in development. You can read all about this missile here , but it certainly will not fit in a J-20’s weapons bay. That does not mean the J-20 won’t have great use for it, quite the contrary. J-20s working cooperatively are the perfect team to put such a weapon to use. For instance, a devision (flight of four) J-20s could work in two sections, one section of two jets in stealth configuration, and the other two carrying four long-range air-to-air missiles. The stealthy pair can venture forward to quietly (electronic emissions silent) obtain targeting information while the J-20s carrying the long-range missiles can act as weapons magazines, leveraging the targeting data obtained from their stealthy wingmen. These are similar to tactics being developed by the USAF for the F-15 and F-22 air dominance team . For instance, the stealthy J-20s can use their passive sensors (electronic support measures and infrared search and track ) to silently stalk targets far in front of the non-stealthy configured J-20s. Meanwhile the other non-stealthy J-20s operating many dozens of miles to the rear can use their radars freely, providing enhanced situational awareness to the stealthy J-20s ahead by sharing their radar “picture” via data-link. In doing so these non-stealthy configured J-20s also act as bait, drawing in enemy fighter aircraft, and leaving them vulnerable to ambush by their stealthy and silent counterparts. You can read more about these types of tactics here . One of the latest images of the J-20 to come out of China showing an increasingly missionized aircraft (Chinese internet): Although similar tactics can be realized via the interoperation between China’s Su-27 derivatives and J-20s, the J-20’s sensor suite and level of sensor fusion is supposedly a leap ahead anything else in the PLAAF. Most importantly the J-20 is built to work among its own kind above all else. Training is also simplified by keeping these tactics “in house” at least until the aircraft has many more years to develop and synergies with other PLAAF platforms are identified, tested and regularly trained for. Even then, a Flanker does not have the ability to blow off its external stores and instantly become much harder to detect, all the while still be armed w ith internal short and medium-range weaponry. Basically, seeing the J-20 tanked up gives us evidence of a potentially more flexible combat aircraft than we have known in the past, and it will be interesting to see other stores begin to appear under its wings. It is also another reminder that the J-20 is rapidly maturing and will soon become a front-line reality within the PLAAF. And this is just part of China’s stealth aircraft revolution. With a medium weight fighter also in the works— flying in its second and much more refined form no less—as well as a stealthy bomber program underway , the PLAAF of today is likely to be unrecognizable from what it will become a decade from now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 23, 2017",Has There Been A “Nuclear Incident” In The Arctic?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There have been rumblings regarding some sort of nuclear incident—or possibly incidents—in the Arctic over the last month. Multiple reports, some of them from official monitoring organizations , have reported iodine 131 —a radioactive isotope often associated with nuclear fission—has been detected via air sampling stations throughout the region. The first detection of the isotope came during the second week of January, via an air sampling station located in Svanhovd, on Norway’s border with Russia’s Kola Peninsula. Within days, air sampling stations as far south as Spain also detected the presence of small amounts of the isotope. The fact that iodine-131 has a half-life of just eight days would point to the release occurring just days earlier, and not being a remnant of a past nuclear event. Because of the low levels of concentration, there is no health risk to the public or the environment, at least on a wide scale. By comparison, these recent measurements are roughly 1/1000th the size of what was detected during the Fukushima incident and 1/1,000,000th the concentration found in the nuclear tainted cloud that washed across Europe following the Chernobyl disaster. Iodine 131 levels monitored across Europe last month (IRIN graphic): After weeks without answers, the story seemed to pass as a peculiarity, not nearly an unprecedented one at that , until Friday when the US dispatched its WC-135 Constant Phoenix atmospheric testing aircraft to Europe without explanation. The highly unique aircraft are specifically designed to respond to nuclear incidents—especially those that include the detonation of nuclear warheads. By sampling the air over wide areas and at altitude, the aircraft can provide critical data to better understand the “signature” of a radiation release. During nuclear tests, this can help scientists define what type of weapon was detonated, and, in conjunction with other data, how large the blast was. They can also be used to measure the effects and scale of other radiological events, like the meltdown of nuclear plants. For instance, the WC-135s went to work following the 2011 earthquake that resulted in the meltdown of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant. WC-135 taking off on a mission (USAF photo): This leaves us with a number of unanswered questions. The first: What are WC-135s doing up there? Was this a good opportunity for a training sortie and to support scientific endeavors, or is it in response to a specific incident? You can check twitter to see loads of people claiming this is proof that the Russians have restarted nuclear weapons testing at Novaya Zemlya near the Arctic. That assertion is problematic for a variety of reasons. The first is that we have no corresponding seismic data indicating a nuclear detonation from that region. Some have floated the possibility that a small tactical nuclear warhead may have been tested; once again, this still makes a big boom, and it is not clear if the levels of iodine-131 are indicative of such a test. Of course, politically speaking, restarting nuclear weapons testing would signal a massive shift in Moscow’s nuclear weapons policy. There has been some talk about even the US restarting its nuclear testing under President Trump, but this is largely speculation mixed with hyperbole. Even though we have seen Russia is willing to migrate away from key weapons treaties in order to obtain niche strategic capabilities, violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty would signal a whole other level of aggression and defiance. A more likely possibility is that some sort of limited nuclear material storage, research, or power generation incident has occurred. Russia uses nuclear propulsion for many of its active submarines as well as its Kirov class battlecruisers and its icebreakers . Russia also uses nuclear power in the arctic region for multiple applications. Not just that, but Russia’s northerly naval bases near the arctic are nuclear graveyards of the Cold War. The international community has worked with Russia over the last two decades to safely dispose of hundreds of Soviet-era nuclear submarines, but decommissioned hulls and reactor sections still sit idle waiting to be denuclearized and properly disposed of. Many have said that over the decades following the end of the Cold War, these vessels were just an accident waiting to happen. Some of these vessels remain on the Kola Peninsula near Murmansk. One of Russia’s largest nuclear waste containment facilities, where the reactors of these decommissioned submarines are stored, is also located nearby at Saida Bay . Today, some 80 reactors and their shredded components are stored there in massive casks. Eventually the facility will store 155 junked reactors and their waste. Disposing of such toxic, complex and ungainly machinery is no easy task and comes with its own share of risks. Photo via Sovfoto/UIG via Getty Images: The Arctic is also dotted with other Cold War relics that relied on nuclear power to function, these include Russia’s nuclear lighthouses and outposts. And this is just what you can see, below the surface, hulks of sunken nuclear vessels and other waste still pose a major threat to the environment. It is not really a question of i f they will do harm, but when . During the Cold War, Russia dumped all types of nuclear waste in the Kara Sea, including an estimated 17,000 containers and 19 vessels full of radioactive waste. The USSR also pitched 14 nuclear reactors, some with spent fuel rods, into the same body of water and other forms of lower-level nuclear waste was just poured directly into the sea. The Russian submarine K-27 , which was scuttled in the Kola Sea, is said to be literally a ticking time bomb. That is just that one area, and other areas in the region, such as the Barents Sea (K-159) and Norwegian Sea (K-278), also have abandoned nuclear submarines and who knows what else lining the sea floor. Even the US left its own portion of nuclear waste in the northern latitudes, such as the once secret reactor at Camp Century , in Greenland, although this is minuscule compared to what the Soviets left behind. A graphic showing the known nuclear waste and wreckage sites near northern Europe and the Arctic (Bellona.org graphic): On top of all the Russian nuclear material that is actually rotting in arctic, there are also nuclear power, ship maintenance, and research stations that also dot Russia’s northern reaches. With all this in mind, if there was a peculiar release of iodine-131 into the atmosphere, it is much more likely to have come from the nuclear wasteland that the Soviet Union created, or from operational reactors in the region, and not from some sort of clandestine atomic testing. That doesn’t mean it is impossible, just highly unlikely. There is even a possibility that it didn’t come from Russia at all, and was leaked by a reactor in Europe or elsewhere. Still, with the Arctic likely becoming a key battleground of the future—a reality that has been spurred by Russian military expansion into the region —and considering Moscow’s great change in geopolitical tone and military stance over the last few years, suspicions surrounding Russia’s true intentions in the region are at an all-time high. Now we’ll have to wait and see if the Pentagon releases more information on the movements and findings of its WC-135, and if there is yet another new spike in radiation coming from the region. If anything else, this mystery should serve of a stark reminder—and a warning—of what mankind has left behind near the arctic, and how perilous a threat it still poses nearly three decades after the Cold War officially ended.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 6, 2017",Check Out This Sweet Video Of A Smart Bomb Laden B-52 Going After ISIS,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-52H, which is quickly approaching its sixth decade of service, has become one of the stars of the coalition air operation to wipe out ISIS from Syria and Iraq. Like the B-1B “Bones” that had provided persistent, high-volume precision air support over Iraqi and Syria before it, the Big Ugly Fat Fucker is doing the same today—putting its SNIPER targeting pod to use not just in the targeting role, but also in the surveillance role. The video below gives us a little snapshot of such a mission. The load the B-52 is carrying is impressive–a quartet of 2,000lb bunker-busting BLU-116 munitions with GPS/INS guided GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits, as well as a similar amount of GBU-38 500lb JDAMs and a SNIPER targeting pod. Obviously one is for the heavy lifting and the other is for more customary close are support and strikes on smaller fixed targets. It is also possible the BUFF originally took to the air with six of each weapon on its wing pylons but had already dropped some by the time the tanker footage was taken. Also note just how much control input is needed to control the jet during takeoff and landing—classic B-52—an aircraft that has some of the most unique handling characteristic around . Here is what the B-52 can do with that big smart bomb load: The B-52 is going through a series of major upgrades that will only make it more deadly in the future, and finally getting the jet new engines is once again a hot topic within the USAF. A new “smart” rotary bomb rack designed for the B-52’s large weapons bay will vastly increase the BUFF’s smart weapons carrying capability as only the aircraft’s wing pylons are wired to handle these types of munitions today. New data-links, sensors—in particular a radar—and defensive countermeasures will also be added to help the jet stay potent for what will likely be nearly another half decade of service. If Secretary of Defense Mattis still supports the Obama-era “flying arsenal ship” concept , the B-52 could also find itself fulfilling a whole new role in the coming decades as well. The B-52 shown in the video and in the photo above already have upgraded color multi-functional situation displays installed among the wall of “steam gauges” that have dominated the BUFF’s cockpit for better part of a decade. , USAF Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",USAF’s Nuke Sniffing Plane Is Flying On A Mission Near The Arctic Right Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We reported in depth on the strange increase in nuclear radiation discovered in Europe in recent weeks, as well as what could be causing it . Now, the aircraft we speculated to have been sent by the Pentagon to investigate the mystery has launched on a mission to where it all began—near the Arctic and Russia’s northern border with Norway. A WC-135 Constant Phoenix, one of just two in existence, arrived in the UK this weekend. This morning it launched out of RAF Mildenhall as “FLORY58” on a mission that would supposedly take the aircraft over the Norwegian and Barents Seas. Svanhovd, Norway, which sits near the Barents Sea and right along the border with Russia’s heavily militarized Kola Peninsula, is where increased levels of the isotope iodine-131 was first detected in the second week of January. In the weeks that followed the isotope was identified in elevated levels by air monitoring stations across Europe. The USAF has kept mum about what one of its Constant Phoenix jets is doing in Europe, but after this mission, or possibly series of missions, we should may hear more from them as to why the aircraft was forward deployed, as well as what it found. A pair of KC-135R tankers also were reported to be accompanying the jet, and there is even an RC-135 Rivet Joint electronic intelligence (ELINT) collection aircraft and another KC-135R tanker headed in the same direction. If the WC-135 ventures near Russian airspace, which it very well could, having a Rivet Joint nearby would be beneficial to monitor Russia’s response to their presence, including eavesdropping on command and control communications and recording the emissions activity of Russian air defense network . There is the chance that the RC-135 could be on an entirely different mission, although considering the timing that is doubtful. Also of interest, is that all three of the KC-135Rs have returned to base at the time of publishing this post. Two returned near simultaneously, later the third made its way back to RAF Mildenhall as well. This makes some sense as the RC-135 is equipped with more modern and fuel miserly CFM56 turbofan engines, while the WC-135C is powered by relatively old and fuel-hungry TF33 engines . It seems much more probable that something is happening, or has happened, in the increasingly strategic and tense part of the world near the Arctic—something of enough importance and interest to deploy a niche asset like the WC-135 to investigate. Hopefully we will finally find out more now that a WC-135 mission has been launched. We will keep you updated over the next 24 hours here on this page if more information comes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I am incredibly excited to announce that Joseph Trevithick is joining The War Zone. Joseph will bring his outstanding research and writing skills to the site, and together we plan to greatly expand and deepen The War Zone’s coverage on all topics related to the military, defense technology, and human conflict. Joseph has degrees from Carnegie Mellon and Georgetown in history, conflict resolution and international relations and comes to us from Globalsecurity.org, and more recently Warisboring.com where he was an associate editor. His work has also been seen on many of the sites we link to regularly, including S mall Arms Review , Small Arms Defense Journal , Reuters , We Are the Mighty and Task & Purpose . Joe explains how he got into the defense journalism business and a bit about where his interests lie: “In 2008, I started tracking defense and security developments full time as part of my work at GlobalSecurity.org. When I had to move on five years later because of the organization’s funding constraints, I wasn’t sure where to go next. For me, this work is a lot like a puzzle. Research and other leads often turn up a lot of little bits that might not be of interest by themselves, but when put them all together you often find something really interesting. After picking up some small freelance work, I quickly realized that journalism blended so much of what I loved in one package. I could research, dig, pull at threads and put everything back together in a way that might put a different light on things. Often with help from thousands of pages I obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, I published stories at War Is Boring and other outlets on serious matters like civilian casualties  from coalition airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, shady contractors in Afghanistan and shadowy special operations missions. But I also explored historical curiosities like a C-130 that could take off and land from inside a soccer stadium, pigeon-powered sensors and plans for gun-toting space soldiers. Though sometimes humorous, these projects can offer insights into weapons and warfare today. So much of these business is connected—old things made new again—and that’s what I love about it. I hope to keep sharing my own curiosity at The War Zone.” So please, give Joseph a warm welcome and look forward to seeing his writing pop-up exclusively here on the The War Zone soon. Another programming note—the comments system is getting a series of rapid upgrades based on all your feedback. A white list option is now available that allows me to assign greater freedom to the discussion section’s most prolific, loyal and respectful voices. Basically it gives anyone who is on it the ability to post without any auto moderation. As you probably have noticed, we have tried to really tighten up moderation in the discussion section, getting rid of the overtly distracting or disrespectful voices wherever possible. This new option will just increase the already awesome quality of our community and will reward those who come wanting to add to the discussion in a quality manner—whether it be via great questions, answers or humor. Other functions, such a discussion threading, will be added soon along with some cool new tools we can use to move the discussion in unique directions. Also, if you haven’t please follow us on Facebook and Twitter , and be sure to follow my personal Twitter as there’s a ton of unique content that goes through there that doesn’t make it to the site. Often times I am asked why I didn’t cover this or that, and usually I have retweeted someone else’s coverage on that same topic because someone else had a good take on it. Beyond that, I would love to see and banter with you in the Twitter-verse. Above all else, I want to thank you all so much for all your comments, emails and reads over the last ten months. It was not easy leaving my past creation to start from scratch again, and you have all made it incredibly rewarding even on its toughest days.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 1, 2017",Four F-5E Tiger IIs Can Fit Inside a Boeing 747,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Jordan has been trying to liquidate its retired F-5E Tiger II fleet for years now, and a quartet of these jets recently found themselves hitching a ride inside a chartered cargo jet. The aircraft are said to have been hauled from Jordan to Florida, with a stop-over in Germany, aboard an Atlas Air 747-400F . As you can see in the photos below, the F-5s, with their wings and tail sections detached, had plenty of room to spare in the jumbo jet’s cargo hold. When countries buy second or even third-hand aircraft, part of their acquisition plan often includes having the jets updated and overhauled. For the F-5, which at one time roared around the skies across the globe in great numbers, Northrop Grumman’s St. Augustine facility is a prime choice for such work. The facility has been used to keep the Navy and the Marine Corps 41 adversary F-5N/Fs flying. It was also where a handful of F-5F “Franken-Tigers” were remanufactured due to an urgent Navy requirement for lower-time two-seat F-5s. International F-5 operators also use the facility to enhance their own F-5 fleets. For instance, Tunisia has a contract with Northrop Grumman to upgrade 12 of its F-5s at the facility, a process which is slated to end in 2018. Other countries also have aerospace industries that are capable of upgrading the F-5 and have upgrade packages already designed to do so, such as Turkey and Brazil. Even if the F-5s were airworthy, flying them across great distances—and especially large stretches of ocean—is problematic. Most F-5s were never fitted with aerial refueling capabilities, so “dragging” them across the ocean behind a tanker is not possible. The only other option would be to hop-scotch around from land base to land base. This increases risk, is expensive, and takes time. It also presents a huge logistical undertaking and some airports don’t have start carts (huffers) needed to wake the F-5E’s J85 turbojet engines. With this in mind, removing the Tiger II’s wings and tail and stuffing the jets in a transport ends up being the easier option. Even the Navy came to this conclusion when it acquired a large batch of low-time, late-build F-5Es from the Swiss Air Force to replace their aging F-5E adversary aircraft. Instead of attempting to fly them to the U.S., they just packed them in a KC-130T one at a time and flew them over the Pond as cargo. Smaller aircraft are transported by larger aircraft all the time. The An-124 Condor is often chartered to move around helicopters—both military and civilian—and they can even cough up large tactical aircraft from time to time. In fact, Jordan’s F-5s were originally delivered via USAF C-5 decades ago. What remains unclear is who these F-5s are being transported for. Jordan sold a batch of 15 F-5s to Kenya in the last 2000s, maybe these were some of those aircraft that are just now getting restored to flyable condition, although to my knowledge these aircraft were upgraded by Brazil to F-5EM/FM standard. The jets could also be destined for a commercial adversary support provider . We have contacted Northrop Grumman to see if they can add any information as to who their owner is and what is being done to them. We’ll let you know if we hear anything back.

What he was doing there remains unknown, though he is thought to have been active in Syria since his release from Iranian custody in 2015.

It’s almost as if an anvil was dropped on the car’s occupants. So what’s going on here? It’s not clear, but there are a few possible answers. A normal loadout for a MQ-9 Reaper. 4X AGM-114 laser-guided Hellfire missiles and a pair of GBU-12 Paveway laser-guided bombs. In over a decade and a half since the RQ-1 Predator became the MQ-1 Predator , adding the ability to kill to its repertoire, advancements in unmanned aircraft armament have followed at a less than spectacular rate. After the better part of a decade of relying on existing weaponry ported over from manned aircraft, guided micro-munitions that weigh less than 25 pounds—far smaller than the already pint-sized Viper Strike and Griffin air-to-ground weapons—began development. Packing an explosive charge as small as a 40mm grenade, these weapons allow for as little collateral damage as possible while still supplying the precision of their much heavier cousins. Guidance is usually provided by laser designation, or, in some configurations, via GPS coordinates. This new round of pint-sized drone weaponry would allow for smaller unmanned aircraft to kinetically effect the battlefield like never before. These little guided bombs—such as Raytheon’s Pyros and Lockheed’s Shadow Hawk , or the even tinier 8-lb Hatchet by ATK —enable diminutive, remotely piloted vehicles like the RQ-7 Shadow to become armed hunter-killers. Even the CIA and USAF’s RQ-170 stealth drone , or an evolutionary adaption of it , could carry such a weapon, or weapons, in a small weapons bay behind its electro-optical turret. The RQ-7 Shadow is a small and capable UAV able to be forward deployed quickly and launched and recovered in a small area. New munitions like Lockheed’s Shadow Hawk (left) turns these aircraft from hunters to hunter-killers) , Left Lockheed, Right DoD Although the initial development of these weapons had been quite public, their deployment status has not. Obviously a drone force like the one operated by the Central Intelligence Agency could leverage this technology clandestinely, and in doing so it may help them get around much of the controversy and political instability surrounding the targeted assassination drone program that President Obama famously accelerated during his term in office. Using these tiny weapons would likely result in far fewer innocent deaths and damage to surrounding property than their heavier and somewhat mis-matched counterparts. Also, having such weapons in a drone’s quiver means strikes can be made in places where they couldn’t in the past based on a static set of rules of engagement. Aside from a high-power laser against soft targets, these little smart bombs offer the most precise and surgical aerial precision strike capability on the drawing board today. Not just that, but they also allow for smaller unmanned aircraft with less cumbersome logistical footprints to be used offensively in areas where potential targets are known to be operating. It is possible that much of these weapons’ operational testing has gone on quietly at a very secure unmanned aircraft test base in the Nellis Range Complex not far from Area 51 , and now they are finally showing up operationally in the field. I know what you are thinking: “It has taken this long to put little guided bombs on small drones?” Yes, it has, even though it is just about the most logical and low-hanging tactical fruit imaginable. Just chalk it up to another frustrating Pentagon mystery . Other countries have also pursued these pint-sized guided weapons, including Israel, which has used them against Hamas in recent years. Even China’s Predator-sized Wing Loong unmanned aircraft features a selection of munitions that include relatively small guided bombs, although they still seem larger than the variety we are talking about here today. Still, these Chinese-built drones are increasingly active in the region , with Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt having acquired their own fleets of the type. The fact is, even if a guided micro-munition was used in the attack, we don’t know what type of platform it came from or even who was at its controls. On an even smaller scale, groups like Hezbollah and ISIS have both pursued the weaponization of hobby-like drones. You can read all about this here . It is possible that ISIS or Hezbollah , both of which oppose each other, and al Qaeda in Syria, could have used a small improvised unguided bomblet to attack al Masri’s car. Although doing so would have required a big dose of luck, especially if the vehicle was moving at the time of the attack as these weapons are mainly used against static targets as because just fall to ground via gravity and some stabilizing tail finds or even a badminton shuttlecock’s tail. Still, it is possible that such a munition could have found its mark and tore open the al Masri’s Kia like a can opener, killing its occupants inside without the presence of significant shrapnel, overpressure or fire. Another possibility is that a “suicidal drone” could have targeted al Masri’s vehicle. Read all about these here . These kamikaze drones of sorts, some of which are optionally disposable, are proliferating throughout the world. For instance, Aeroviroment’s Switchblade used by the US, or even an Israeli unit, like the long-range Harop or the much smaller Hero-30 , could have been used in the assault. The only problem is that the area where the attack took place remains highly disputed , and the US has no special operations forces anywhere near the area . An Israeli Harop could make it there from Israeli territory, although hitting a time sensitive target, possibly a moving one, over such range with a slow aircraft would require incredible luck and timing. Not just that, but they would need the intelligence to know who and what to target in real time once the drone arrived in the area. Russia, which has a hodgepodge of somewhat rudimentary unmanned aircraft working over Syria, including variants of the Israeli Searcher UAV , but is not known to have armed any of these drones. Although it is possible that this has changed in recent months, it is unlikely, and there has been no talk that they may be turning these into “suicidal drones.” If indeed a US drone executed the strike on al Masri, or at least on the amazingly intact car shown in the picture, maybe an inert 500lb GBU-12 laser-guided bomb could have been used against the target, but this would have required the bomb to strike the target dead-on. These “concrete” smart bombs have been used in the past to pretty much eliminate the possibility of collateral damage when prosecuting targets in urban areas. Maybe most famously, the Royal Air Force used them during Operation Telic to take out Iraqi combat vehicles hiding next to homes, schools and mosques in al Basra, Iraq. Later on, the French used them against targets in Libya . The concept is simple—a Mk82 high-explosive bomb is swapped out for an inert, concrete-filled training version of the Mk82 and the same GBU-12 guidance kit is attached to it that is normally attached to its live counterpart. The speed and high angle of the weapon at impact can inflict considerable damage without any explosion. Against soft targets, this configuration is extremely deadly but once again, it must hit dead-on to be effective. As such, if the target is moving its chances for success drastically decreases. It is an interesting tactic but in this case, considering the target was supposedly al Qaeda’s number two man who was already rolling around in a war zone, using such a weapon seems to inject needless risk into a very high-priority strike. Also, no components of such a weapon were shown in the pictures. In the end we can’t say for sure what exactly caused the highly localized and seemingly bizarre damage to the Kia in question, but whatever did so didn’t even blow out the car’s windshield. There could also be some other strange explanation for what happened that had nothing to do with a drone attack as being widely reported. But going on the limited information we have, we can pretty much ascertain that if this strike indeed came from a drone, that drone did not use an AGM-114 Hellfire missile or GBU-12 Paveway laser-guided bomb to execute its target below. With this in mind, this strike could be one of our first glimpses into the next technological phase of the drone war on terror.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 2, 2017",This Is What USAF Bomber Pilots Would Wear During a Nuclear Apocalypse,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During a nuclear exchange, as B-52H and B-2A pilots make their way to and from their targets, flashes from nuclear detonations would have the ability to temporarily blind them, making flying their aircraft impossible. This intermittent blindness could last two minutes during the day, or up to ten minutes at night. Different countermeasures were developed during the Cold War to counter this physiological reality. These included constructing thermal curtains to cover the B-52’s windows , along with a television camera and FLIR system that, along with the BUFF’s instruments, allow pilots to continue on their mission without external visibility. Polarized Lead Zirconium Titanate (PLZT, pronounced “plizzit”) flash blindness goggles are also used for the same purpose, and they look as otherworldly as can be. PLZT goggles attach to the pilot’s helmet and are interfaced with a igloo cooler-like control and power supply unit ( see the whole system here ). The system works to detect dramatic and fast changes in light. When that a happens, a circuit is broken. This triggers the goggles to quickly turn opaque. Once the light has returned to normal the goggles will turn translucent again. Flightgear.dk does a great job at describing this unique and somewhat obscure system and its genesis in great detail: “The most advanced thermal flash protective devices in use are the PLZT goggles. These goggles are made of sandwich composite of polarized glass with an inner layer of a transparent electro-optic ceramic called PLZT. When linked to an electric current, the lenses are clear. But any dangerous flash of light, such as lightning or a nuclear blast, instantaneously breaks the circuit. This causes the lenses to go black, protecting the vision of anyone wearing the helmet. The designers of the PLZT goggle had found that the material could be discharged quicker than when charged to change the transmittance. Unfortunately, in order to obtain the desired switching speed, this meant that when the nuclear flash protective goggle failed, it was basically opaque. PLZT is a ceramic material consisting of lead, lanthanum, zirconate, and titante and it can be electronically switched rapidly in polarity, such that when sandwiched with a near infrared blocking material and a fixed polarizing material, the visual transmittance can be varied from full open state (approximately 20%) to totally opaque within a ten-millionth of a second. The protection device ( helmet-mounted special goggles containing four lenses) was developed under a $7.2 million contract managed by Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The requirements for the goggles was orchestrated by Cal Crochet, SAC Life Support System program manager, who was the direct interface with Sandia Laboratories at Kirtland AFB, NM. The idea for the goggles came from Cal’s experience during his early days of flying helicopter (1957) at Eniwetok Atoll during nuclear tests under “Operation Hardtack” and later from his experiences with the flash curtain, gold goggles and eye patch problems encountered as a SAC B-47 and B-52 aircraft commander with the 306th and 509th Bomb Wings… What initially was a visor lens for B-52 pilots was later refined into glass that fit entirely within the viewing ports of an airplane cockpit, with 6-in. diameter shutters in the viewing windows. The original PLZT goggles, military designation EEU-2/P, were developed for nuclear bombers such as the B-52 and B-1 in the Strategic Air Command (SAC), where the crew members would hopefully be just outside the blast, radiation, and/or heat damage radius of the weapon. A later version was designated EEU-2A/P, the difference between them being that the EEU-2A/P changes to dark faster than the EEU-2/P. By 2003 Thermal Flash Protective Devices (TFPD) were required for all PACAF aircrews on SIOP missions . Either the MIL-G-635 or PLZT goggles at the wing commanders discretion would satisfy requirements for TFPD. On aircraft that were PLZT modified, it was recommended that the PLZT goggles be used.” Flightgear.dk After years of development, the first use of EEU-2/P goggles was by FB-111 crew out of Pease AFB in July, 1980. They then progressed to B-52, B-1 (which had a nuclear mission at the time), and KC-135 units, and eventually to the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The same units soldier on to this very day. A source intimately familiar with the B-2 described how the goggles are deployed operationally. They’re kept sealed (they are a one-time use kind of gear) and there are limited numbers of them remaining in USAF stocks. Although pilots generally do not train with them on while flying, they do go through an orientation to familiarize themselves with the process of attaching them to their helmet, and to experience what it’s like to see through them. Our source described them as similar to wearing “thick glasses” with a limited peripheral view, but they aren’t extremely heavy and would in no way keep a well trained pilot from flying the aircraft proficiently during combat. An eyepatch was also provided to cover one eye; the idea behind the eye patch being, if the goggles failed to activate when a blast went off, one eye would remain usable. In addition to fielding EEU-2/P goggles, the B-2 was also designed to accommodate a removable glass pane that mounted above the cockpit dash that would work just as the goggles do, turning opaque to protect the crew’s eyes during a flash. The glass pane leaves the dash inaccessible and it is supposedly easy to lean into if you forget it’s there when fitted. Even with this setup, during a nuclear operation the goggles would still be worn as a backup should that system fail. The technology described was originally tested on the B-1, but did not find its way its way into the aircraft operationally, but a modular version of it seems to be alive and well in the B-2. From a USAF technological document titled “Electro-Optical Performance Of PLZT Lenses” dated 1988: Another proposed solution to solve aircrew fatigue from goggle use was to integrate the photo protective material with the aircraft windshields. This was first tested and developed for use in the B-i Bomber. The entire window from the side of the cockpit was made utilizing PLZT materials. The control circuitry was essentially the same as for the goggles, but modified to provide a higher voltage. Prototype tests showed the window responded slightly slower than the goggle yet still provided ample protection against simulated nuclear flashes. Electro-Optical Performance Of PLZT Lenses Although they have been a staple in the cockpit of American strategic bombers and tankers for nearly 40 years, PLZT goggles were never adapted for use on tactical air combat assets. Flightgear.dk describes why: “Tests in 1978 revealed that while tactical fighters could also deliver smaller nuclear weapons, use of the PLZT goggles in fighter aircraft was not favourable, due to the weight and visual transmittance. Also, the tactical fighters would probably have delivered the weapons in the daytime during this era and the effects of temporary flash blindness in the daytime would be minimal for the smaller nuclear weapons. US Army Aviation Research Laboratories (USAARL) evaluated a nuclear flash blindness protective device with the initial development of the HGU-56/P helmet program in the early 1980’s. Among other things they found that the PLZT electronics, which detected a certain increase in ambient luminance in approximately 4 microseconds, could be accidentally activated by the rotor blades and when near a radar station. However, the real problem with the nuclear flash blindness protective device requirement is the concept for helicopter operations. In the European scenario with a tactical nuclear war with the former Warsaw pact, the very basic unclassified war game models showed that the only helicopters that could survive were the ones hidden in bunkers. Therefore, it did not make sense to use a nuclear flash blindness protective device for Air Warrior or Army aviation with the known technology.” So there you have it—the PLZT goggles, an obscure Cold War relic still soldiering on today as we enter what appears to be yet another Cold War.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Spec Ops MC-130 Provides Forward Arming And Refueling Point For F-22 Raptors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Forward arming and refueling points , better known as FARPs, often conjure images of transport and gunship helicopters and rugged close support jets like the A-10 Warthog or AV-8B Harrier operating from some rough and austere base along (or beyond) the battle lines. At a FARP, aircraft can quickly receive fuel and fresh weapons, and they can do it in a hurry often times without even shutting down their engines. In both Iraq and Afghanistan FARPs were used accelerate the fight by dramatically increasing sortie rates. In some cases, they can also be used as a more “down and dirty” alternative to aerial refueling. Now, with the US facing serious access issues when it comes to fighting against a near-peer state competitor, the need for this tactic is resulting some strange bedfellows. Case in point—the strategic pairing of the MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker and America’s most capable fighter, the F-22 Raptor. America’s fighter aircraft are born addicted to tanker gas. As enemy long-range defenses evolve , their limited combat radius is increasingly putting lumbering jet tankers and other support assets in harms way—a reality we have discussed in great detail before . Not just that, but considering that all nearby basing, as far as 1,500 miles away from the enemy’s mainland—and even farther in some cases—is vulnerable to cruise- and especially ballistic missile barrages, the idea that the USAF can just stack hundreds of fighters at their master air bases in a region is a dangerous notion indeed. Instead, during a time of war or of greatly increased tensions, American airpower should be dispersed in smaller numbers throughout a region, occupying austere airstrips on small islands that are not normally considered high-value targets. Distributing air combat power throughout a huge theatre like the Pacific, and just getting tactical aircraft from larger bases thousands of miles away, to the target area and back will be no easy task. The USAF is beginning to come to terms with this and is tapping Air Force Special Operations Command for their expertise in setting up a gas station on the ground pretty much anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. This is the job of the MC-130 community, which now flies the MC-130J Commando II. These aircraft are multi-role, being able to interdict at low-level into enemy territory at night to deliver special operations forces, material , or to refuel thirst spec-ops helicopters. They can also take this capability and port it over to the ground, hauling in many thousands of pounds of jet fuel and ground crews that can fuel up aircraft that have landed. And these can be virtually any aircraft, including 5th generation jet fighters. This is exactly what the 9th Special Operations Squadron and F-22s from Tyndall AFB were practicing at Hurlburt Field this week, using a single MC-130J to “hot pit” refuel a trio of thirsty Raptors. Because the F-22s don’t have to shut down their engines during the fueling evolution they can not only be back in the air faster, but they are much less susceptible to breaking while on the ground. The thing about these operations is that theoretically, everything has to be “flown in,” but that’s not necessarily a bad thing as it gives the enemy little advance notice that the airfield we become active. Another transport aircraft could also bring along ordnance and technicians to re-arm the F-22s before going on their way. This could drastically increase the Raptor’s sortie rate and presence near or over enemy territory.Under another variation of this type of exercise, a handful of F-22s could actually sustain operations out of a remote airfield for a finite period of time. Many of these tenets, along with the need to get high-end force multiplying assets into a combat zone as fast as possible, are the impetus behind the “Rapid Raptor” concept that the USAF has been evolving for a few years now. In the end it is all about introducing logistical and basing flexibility into what is really quite an inflexible, infrastructure-heavy support system for America’s fighter aircraft. By distributing the USAF’s top-of-the-line fighter force in small numbers throughout a region, they are less susceptible to being wiped out on the ground. Additionally, by doing so they threaten the enemy from many more vectors, which spreads the enemy’s defenses over a wider area. Additionally, an MC-130J that can fly into airspace at low altitude and setup refueling operations on the ground is less susceptible to enemy targeting than their high-flying jet tanker cousins in many instances. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YUw55UsrZ0g It will be interesting to see the relationship between AFSOC and ACC expand, especially surrounding the “Rapid Raptor” concept, austere operations, as well as a similar concept that is bound to be built around the F-35A. Developing such a set of tactics as quickly as possible could allow for at least a interim solution, even if just a very limited one, to America’s short-ranged fighter conundrum and aerial tanker and basing vulnerability woes.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 27, 2019",The Army’s Elite Special Ops Aviators Sure Burn Through A Lot Of Rockets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. By their nature, special operations are secretive and discreet. Unless something goes wrong , we might never hear about them at all. But the Pentagon does have to restock the fuel, ammunition, and other materials troops use on those missions, just like any other. If the the number of rockets burned through in the past few years by the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) is any indication, that unit has been particularly busy. In June 2016, the Pentagon sent its omnibus budget request to Congress. In it, the Army asked for a little more than $20.2 million to buy an extra lot of more than 19,000 70mm Hydra rockets of various, unspecified types. The “funds are required … to replenish unguided rockets expended by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) in direct support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel and and [Operation Inherent Resolve] and in pre-deployment training,” the request explained. In January 2015, the Pentagon officially renamed the American mission in Afghanistan Freedom’s Sentinel. Inherent Resolve is the U.S. moniker for the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which officially began in October 2014. AH-6 firing rockets during joint training. , USMC We don’t know what kind of rockets the regiment employed in any of these instances. The Hydra family includes a variety of warheads connected to a common, modular rocket motor. The additional rockets could have been a mix of versions packed with high explosive filler, visible or infrared flares, small metal darts called “flechettes,” or red or white phosphorus, as well as dedicated training types. On top of that, the Pentagon’s “Rocket, Hydra 70, All Types” line item included the new, laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) variant. Able to slot in between the motor and the warhead, the APKWS II kit can turn an unguided rocket into a far more deadly precision-guided missile, giving aircraft an added punch. In 2015, the upgraded rockets were the primary armament for a pair of refurbished OV-10 light attack aircraft during secretive missions in Iraq . The year before, a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey fired some of the weapons during a series of test flights. We also do not know how many rockets 160th SOAR fired in combat versus practice sessions, or how long it took them to shoot all of them. At the time of writing, U.S. Army Special Operations Command’s public affairs office had not yet responded to a query about the figures. However, given the operations Pentagon officials noted and the date of their request, the period of expenditures should have been around 21 months. That’s an average of more than 900 rockets every month . That’s a lot, especially for just one unit. 160th SOAR aviators do most of their work at night. Fighting in an MH-6 is “intimate” with crews coming very close to their targets. , DoD Consider that, in the Pentagon’s Fiscal Year 2016 base and “overseas contingency operations” budget requests , the Army included plans to buy more than 125,000 Hydras of all types. In the defense budget outlined for the next fiscal year, it asked a little more than 74,000 rockets. That’s approximately 199,000 rockets in total. The 160th SOAR’s expenditures are equal to 10 percent of those purchases. And they rippled off all those Hydras in less than two years in and while preparing for combat. That’s impressive. It’s even more so when you realize not all of the regiment’s helicopters can even fire these weapons. 160th SOAR has approximately 51 A/MH-6M Mission Enhanced Little Birds (MELM), according to one 2016 briefing . The unit had another 72 MH-60M Black Hawks. Only some of each type can employ rockets. The MELBs are the latest evolution of the Army’s iconic Little Bird family. The nimble, single-engine helicopters are a significantly advanced outgrowth of the Vietnam War-era OH-6 scout choppers. With a crew of two, the MH-6M variant can carry another six special operators on special platforms on either side of the fuselage. Able to cruise at speeds over 100 miles an hour, the tiny transports can insert teams of elite troops into relatively small spaces, as well as perform scout and command and control missions, if necessary. A MH-6 Little Bird shows off for a NASCAR crowd, Special Operations Command But these versions have no weapons. The AH-6M is the gunship configuration of the same helicopter, able to carry a mix of machine guns, rockets, and missiles on a special weapons rack installed in the main cabin. In publicly available images, these diminutive attackers—sometimes referred to as “Killer Eggs” because of their armament and distinctive shape—regularly carry two fast-firing 7.62 mm Miniguns and two M260 seven-tube 70 mm rocket pods. While the AH-6Ms can technically carry the 19-round M261 pods, they reportedly sit dangerously close to the ground, making rough terrain landings problematic. In addition, while the weapons planks fold up so crews can rapidly load and unload the choppers from C-130 transport aircraft, this doesn’t work with the larger rocket packs in place. Defense contractors Dillion Aero and Fulcrum Concepts have both experimented with a modified M261 design for the Little Bird, using only half the pod, which can old 12 Hydras. Another company, Arnold Defense, offers a similar model, the LWL-XII-A , weighing less than 60 pounds empty. As with the Little Birds, not all of the twin-engine MH-60Ms are set up for attack missions. A subset of those choppers, known as Direct Action Penetrators (DAP), have provisions for a broad array of weapons, including Hydras, in addition to more traditional defensive machine guns. Stub wings fitted above the crew chief windows on these Black Hawks can carry any of the standard rocket pods. The larger, more powerful MH-60s have no problem carrying M261s. So, it was highly trained Army aviators flying less than 150 helicopters who were responsible for shooting off all of those 19,000 rockets. To put that in perspective, the Army and Army National Guard have more than 700 AH-64 Apache gunships. Remember that, in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, the service felt buying less than 200,000 more rockets would be adequate to replenish supplies for regular and special operations training and combat purposes. This isn’t surprising. 160th SOAR is the Pentagon’s main supplier of helicopter support for special operations around the world. After  9/11, the regiment’s four battalions repeatedly deployed on counter-terrorism missions to countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Philippines. The elite fliers routinely bring their aircraft to training exercise from Europe to Africa to Asia. On May 2, 2011, they took part in the famous raid in Abbottabad , Pakistan, where members of SEAL Team Six killed Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The regiment has been shuttling special operators around Iraq and Syria for years now, as the U.S.-led coalition helps Iraqi and Kurdish forces battle Islamic State terrorists. In November 2014, U.S. Central Command let slip video of MH-60M transports refueling in midair and on the ground in Iraq. Two years later, the unit’s larger MH-47G Chinooks were among some of the first visitors to the newly liberated and repaired Q-West air base south of Mosul. In February 2017, photojournalists inside the still contested city caught a glimpse of another MH-60M, again without rockets. With Islamic State still holding on in Iraq and Syria, franchises spreading elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, Al Qaeda still a threat, and the Taliban and its allies resurgent in Afghanistan, it looks like there won’t be much rest for the 160th SOAR. We can probably expect the unit to fire off thousands more rockets in the near future—whether we ever know about it or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 10, 2017",A-10 Warthogs Practice Blasting Swarms of Small Boats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The idea that the venerable A-10 Warthog is a “single mission” aircraft is just flat-out wrong . In February 2017, the blunt-nosed attackers showed off their maritime abilities by flying mock attack runs against small boats as part of a routine training exercise. But even more interestingly, the practice targets looked suspiciously like the kind of speedboats the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) operates in the Persian Gulf. Of course, the U.S. Air Force regularly puts squadrons through these exercises to test their proficiency in actually delivering ordnance. The service refers to the ground attack portion of the training program as Combat Hammer. In addition to the low-flying A-10s, this particular exercise included U.S. Navy helicopters and faster-flying Canadian Forces CF-188 Hornet multi-role fighters. To make the training more realistic, the Air Force hired more than 30 local civilian mariners to pilot their own “pirate” craft around the practice area in the Gulf of Mexico. None of the participants fired any live weapons near these boats. During a separate live-fire portion of the event, the Warthogs shot rounds from their signature 30 mm cannons, fired AGM-65 Maverick missiles and dropped laser and GPS-guided bombs on stationary targets. Officially, this iteration of Combat Hammer did not focus on any particular enemy. Fast-moving ships are the kind of target American fliers could encounter almost anywhere and this general threat is very real. “There are plenty of places in the world where low-tech adversaries can mount 50-caliber machine guns and rocket launchers on small boats for use against us,” Air Force Lt. Col. Sean Neitzke, head of the 86th Fighter Wing, said . “They could also use other types of shoulder launched weapons, all of which could be a threat to American assets.” In an infamous incident on Oct. 12, 2000, Al Qaeda members slammed tiny watercraft packed explosives into the A rleigh Burke class destroyer USS Cole as it sat in Yemen’s Aden harbor. The attack put the warship out of action, killed 17 American sailors and wounded nearly 40 more. In January 2017, Yemeni militants conducted a similar operation against the Saudi frigate al Madinah in the Red Sea. The rebels appear to have guided a remote-control boat to strike the much larger ship. Since then, terrorists and insurgents from the Arabian Peninsula to Sri Lanka have used small vessels as improvised warships and suicide bombs on various other occasions. On top of that, drug cartels employ unarmed “go-fasts” to smuggle drugs throughout Latin America. But the kind of craft Neitzke was talking are a particular hallmark of Iran’s irregular naval forces. The country routinely shows the boats off during flashy war games squarely aimed at the United States. Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC) “are lightly armed small-boats that have been a mainstay of the IRGCN since its inception in the 1980s,” the Office of Naval Intelligence noted in a February 2017 report . “they are by far, the most numerous of all IRGCN vessels.” “Usually fitted with only machine guns and/or rockets, and used en masse, these vessels are capable of harassing merchant shipping and conducting swarm tactics during a force-on-force naval engagement.” Most of these boats are armed versions of commercial speedboats. Common armament includes 7.62 mm and 12.7 mm machine guns, 107 mm rockets and individual sailors with weapons ranging from rifles and rocket propelled grenades to man-portable anti-aircraft missiles. It was IRGC sailors in exactly these sorts of boats who captured two American riverine craft in the Persian Gulf in January 2016, touching off a major international incident. The Navy ultimately blamed its own commanders in the region for the circumstances leading to the incident, but insisted Iranian forces had acted illegally. Bladerunner fast attack craft built in Iran The actual effectiveness of these impromptu warships is a matter of debate. During the Tanker War sideshow to the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, American warships and helicopters took on a variety of Iranian Navy ships. Over the course of a series of operations between 1987 and 1988, American sailors and aviators sunk and damaged number of enemy vessels, including diminutive FIACs and larger corvettes and mine layers, which threatened international oil shipments and their U.S. escorts. The term “ Boghammar ,” the name of a Swedish boat manufacturer that had supplied some craft to Iran, quickly became synonymous with a whole category of IRGCN vessels. Though Iran conclusively lost these battles, the experience only seemed to reinforce its interest in speedy boats. “The IRGCN’s infatuation with speed has also influenced its FIAC acquisition efforts,” the Navy’s report added. USAF In 2010, Iranian officials debuted the latest addition to the country’s fleet of small attack boats, an armed copy of British shipmaker Ice Marine’s Bladerunner series. Known as either the Siraj-1 or Seraj-1, the craft had a typical armament of one 12.7 mm DShK-type machine gun and an 11-tube 107 mm rocket launcher. The IRGCN touted its new acquisition as the “fasted military vessel in the world.” Reports suggest Iranian engineers may try and add torpedoes or anti-ship missiles to the stealthy-looking ship or additional derivatives in the future. In any renewed conflict with Iran, American ships, gunship helicopters, drone and warplanes would probably all end up hunting down these fast moving opponents. As the Combat Hammer session showed, the A-10s could be one valuable addition to those operations. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Sea Small Boats"

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull stated the following about the jet during their arrival: “It is an example of how our defense industry plan is not simply securing our Air Force and our Army and our Navy with the capabilities they need to keep us safe in the 21st Century but it is driving the advanced manufacturing, the jobs, the advanced technology that Australians need to make sure our children and grandchildren have the opportunities in the years ahead.” Australia is prepared to spend roughly $17 billion on 72 F-35As, with the first jets being formally delivered to Australia in 2018 and full operational capability expected as early as 2020.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 7, 2017",American Stryker Armored Fighting Vehicles Appear Near Syrian Hotspot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images appearing on social media today show American Stryker armored fighting vehicles in northern Syria. Deployment of these vehicles signal a large shift in force posture for US special operations forces operating alongside Kurdish and other anti-ISIS allies under the banner of Syrian Democratic Forces. In the past, US special operations teams have been seen operating in technicals, lightly armored cars, and Humvees—not in high-tech, heavily armored fighting vehicles. Not just that, but some of the Strykers in these images appear to be unique to the US Army’s special operations community. 16 Strykers were ported over to the 75th Range Regiment over a decade ago and were outfitted for their use; these vehicles saw action at least in Afghanistan and also possibly in Iraq. Considering the Trump administration’s more aggressive foreign policy when it comes to US military engagements and fighting Islamic extremism overseas, and following a series of Syrian and Russian air strikes that appeared to target areas where US forces were operating, the sudden arrival of the much more protective and capable Strykers makes sense. Strykers can be deployed via C-17 to relatively austere airfields. US forces in the northwestern part of Syria are known to use a number of remote airstrips and abandoned air bases to support US and SDF forces working in the region to rout ISIS. The “cages” surrounding the Stryker vehicles— also known as slat armor —have become a common accessory for armored personnel carriers, including the Stryker, following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. They are meant to defeat high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and other shaped-charge rounds such as those found on some RPGs that are extremely prevalent in the theatre. This revelation comes as all eyes turn to Manbij—a town recaptured by Kurdish fighters that’s roughly a dozen miles west of the Euphrates River. It may be the Turkish military and their allied fighters’ next stop on the way to the ISIS capital of Raqqa. Turkey’s “Euphrates Shield” operation that saw troops strike out into Syria for the first time last Summer is not just aimed towards ISIS—it is also directed at YPJ and YPG fighters that are directly connected to the Kurdish Worker’s Party, also known as the PKK. Turkey sees the PKK and their militia arms as terrorists, and there is no doubt that they have been part of a bloody conflict with Turkey for decades . These are the same forces that the US actively backs and is fighting alongside in Syria, a reality that has caused great tension between the two faltering NATO allies. Turkey has demanded that the US make Kurdish fighters pull out of Manbij and other towns west of the Euphrates River or there will be consequences. So far this hasn’t happened as the Kurdish fighters say they recaptured those towns at great cost and do not want to give them up to a power that’s overtly hostile to their existence. Clashes between Turkish and Kurdish forces have occurred sporadically in the region over the last six months, but a full-on armed confrontation has not occurred—yet. At the same time, the Assad regime, backed by Russia and Iran, see Turkey’s push into Syria as a threat to the Assad regime—one greater than that posed by Kurdish and other fighting units aligned under the Syrian Democratic Forces banner. With all this in mind, Manbij may be a showdown of sorts between US and Turkish policy in Syria, as well as the ambitions of Assad, Russia and Iran. Now that ISIS is routed from the city of al Bab , if Turkish forces bypass Manbij and head towards Raqqa, it will signal that they have acquiesced to the Kurdish presence in Syria west of the Euphrates River, at least for now. If not, and Turkish troops move to take Manbij, the outcome could be explosive, both geopolitically and literally. There is also the problem of exactly how they will bypass the Manbij, or any towns held by Kurdish forces, on their way to Raqqa if that is where they choose to go next. From the al Monitor : “When Turkish officials were pointing to Raqqa as their next objective, the Syrian army had not yet severed the road connection between al-Bab and Raqqa. The closure of that route left Turkey with three alternatives to reach Raqqa: Manbij, Kobani and Tell Abyad. But the Kurds and their allies control all of these locations. If Turkey insists on hitting Raqqa first, it will have to fight the Kurds and their allies.” As for where exactly the US Strykers are in northern Syria, all signs point that they are nearby Manbij. They were photographed on the east side of the Euphrates and heading over a bridge that would take them west, to the city located just a dozen miles away. Other images show the vehicles already on the western side of Manbij and there are reports that there are already clashes between Kurdish/SDF and Turkish-backed rebels on the outskirts of the city.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 29, 2016",Check Out This Pic of an F-35B Firing its Gun Pod in the Air for the First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35B and C’s belly-mounted gun pod has finally been fired in the air. BF-1, the first F-35B built, was used for the test which occurred near Naval Air Station Patuxent River on February 21st. You can read all about the F-35’s GAU-22 25mm gun pod and watch it being fired during ground tests in this past post. The ability to fire the gun—both the F-35A’s internal cannon and F-35B and C’s podded version—as well as its limited amount of firepower has been a controversial issue for the F-35 program. And even though the gun is seen firing in the air in the image above, the software to actually aim it is still a ways out as we discussed in a a previous post : “Among a slew of deficiencies, Gilmore also highlights the F-35’s gun woes, and that it may not even meet its revised testing and operational dates. Bloomberg quotes the memo: “All three models of the F-35 are ‘are at risk of not having a functioning and accurate gun’ in time for the combat testing because ‘significant deficiencies discovered during initial testing’ in 2015 ‘require multiple modifications’ before accuracy testing can begin.” As we have stated previously , the F-35 will likely not be able to test its cannon and helmet-mounted display aiming scheme until at least 2018 (now possibly 2019), as software and hardware delays continue to loom even though the USAF promised it operational by 2017 after previous delays. “ Still, it’s good that some progress is being made, and seeing a fifth generation super-fighter with a gun pod strapped to its belly in a very old-school manner is bound to bring smiles to the faces of military aviation aficionados around the globe. As for the pod and its degrading effects on the aircraft’s low observable qualities—it was built with reduced radar signature in mind but it will increase the detectability of the F-35B and C somewhat when it is fitted, and it induces a drag and weight penalty like any external store. Still, the F-35, at least historically, will do most of its fighting in low to medium threat environments where external stores can be carried. For those missions at least the gun pod gives the B and C model the option of having a gun at all. A slightly stealthier version of the pod called the Multi-Mission Pod can also be adapted to a wide variety of other roles in the future. These include the possibility of hauling extra sensors, communications arrays, electronic warfare components, defensive systems, maybe one day even lasers, and pretty much whatever else designers can stuff in it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 6, 2017","US Stryker Deployment to Manbij, Syria Appears to Have Been a Blocking Move","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last weekend, US Stryker armored fighting vehicles appeared seemingly out of nowhere in Syria and descended onto the Kurdish-held town of Manbij. Their arrival was anything but inconspicuous, as the convoy of multiple Strykers, in various configurations, along with tricked-out Humvees rolled across the Euphrates river in broad daylight, with giant American flags whipping in the air above them. After we reported on the story, the vehicles appeared to have made it to Manbij, and proceeded to move all around the vicinity of the city and its outlying villages, making their presence known. For US special operations teams, who have kept an incredibly low profile in the war-torn country for a couple years now, the show of force was something totally new, and it was clearly a signal to America’s enemies and friends alike. The Pentagon, commenting on the arrival of the vehicles in northern Syria, stated that the convoy was a “visible symbol that the enemy is cleared out of Manbij.” The spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve also tweeted the reasoning behind the Strykers’ high-profile arrival in the flashpoint city: As we discussed this weekend, Manbij could turn into a standoff between US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces which are dominated by Kurdish fighters aligned with the PKK—Turkey’s bitter enemy —and Turkish-backed forces that have sacked the city of al Bab to the west. Turkey has since said made it clear that they are ready to push east toward the ISIS stronghold of al Raqqa. The only problem is that Turkey has also stated that all Kurdish forces need to retreat east of the Euphrates River as this was one of the key goals of Operation Euphrates Shield. This operation, launched by Turkey last summer and ongoing to this very day, is aimed at ISIS as well as pushing back Kurdish forces from the towns they had seized west of the Euphrates during bloody battles with Islamic State fighters. Manbij is one of these cities. Kurdish fighters sacked it last August, something that the Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman also underlined in a tweet: So basically America’s flag-waving increase in visibility around Manbij, as well as their upgrade in armor that has rumbled its way all around the town and its nearby villages, seems to serve a couple purposes. First off, it tells Turkish, Syrian and Russian forces that Americans are operating openly in the strategically located city and by traveling all around its outskirts in a blazon manner, literally acting as bait, they have shown that ISIS has been neutralized in the area. As such, any attack on Kurdish or US forces by Turkish, Syrian or Russian-backed forces could not be “confused” for one against ISIS. As such, there is no excuse for Russian or Syrian jets to bomb locations in or around the city, and no reason for Syrian forces to be there at all at this time. The operation also serves as a warning to Turkey in particular, that any move against the town could not only endanger US forces, but it would see two NATO allies pitted against one another. The thing is that the main highway that linked al Bab to al Raqqa was blocked by Syrian troops recently, leaving Turkey with few options to easily access the Islamic State stronghold. The road through Manbij is one of a handful left that can take Turkish-backed forces from al Bab to al Raqqa in a round-about way, and the others go through towns that are also held by Kurdish and SDF forces. This has pushed Turkish forces and their proxies in a corner of sorts. In yet another tweet made over the weekend, the OIR spokesman said something somewhat peculiar: It could be that the US plans to drastically increase its presence in Manbij so that Kurdish YPG rebels could drastically decrease their presence there, and thus making it possible for Turkish troops to traverse the city on their way to al Raqqa without a major battle erupting. So what seems to be happening here is that the US has executed a fairly brilliant but also risky play—a grand blocking maneuver of sorts. The up-armored vehicles and Strykers are there because of the increased risk to US soldiers for taking on a high profile and to make a big footprint in the sand. Now it seems by the tweet above that the US may open the road through the city to Turkish soldiers if Americans are in control of that road and Kurdish fighters are largely playing a secondary support role, if they have not vacated the city in total. Basically it forces all sides to concentrate on taking out ISIS, not on slugging it out amongst themselves. DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images In the end, if this proves to the US strategy in play, it puts the most pressure on Islamic State because it keeps Turkey in the game, as well as Syria, Russia and the US and its allies, and it bypasses a potential all-out battle between the Kurds and the Turkish military and their proxies. The risk comes into play in that now US troops have taken up a much heavier rolel in the stability of at least one city in Syria, and they also have a much higher profile in the region. And they may be the thin green line that stands between a full-out brawl between Turkish and Kurdish forces. Considering the US is a NATO ally of Turkey, if anything goes wrong the repercussions could be massive on a geopolitical scale. The other alternative is that the US does not open up Manbij or another route that runs through a Kurdish-controlled town to Turkey, although doing so could have even worse repercussions, and a higher probability of those repercussions actually occurring. Turkey could just decide to push through anyway, or take another route from the Turkish-Syrian border in the western part of county, which is largely controlled by the Kurds and SDF as well. Turkey could also be forced into Assad’s arms, and could work out a deal with him and Russia to open up access to al Raqqa. Such a move would not be a welcome outcome for the US which has maintained an anti-Assad policy since the Syrian civil war began. We will have to wait and see what happens next, but there is a good chance that Turkey and the US military are talking right now about what it would take for their forces and proxy fighters to move through Kurdish territory without shots being fired. Above all else, the Strykers’ appearance in Syria signal a new bolder policy in the region, one that we have seen other hints of since President Trump was inaugurated six weeks ago. UPDATE: 3:35pm PST- It seems that these are “ double V-hulled” Strykers , giving them similar resistance to IEDs as MRAPs, and they do indeed belong to the 75th Ranger Regiment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019","After North Korean Missiles Fly, THAAD Missile Defense Suddenly Arrives","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After literally years of debate and planning, America’s Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile system has finally begun to arrive in South Korea. The system’s long-awaited deployment came just hours after North Korea executed a series of simultaneous ballistic missile launches that captured the world’s attention. Although THAAD’s emergence on the Korean Peninsula was announced nearly a day after the North Korean missiles flew, it is likely that these missile tests were actually a preemptive show of defiance by Pyongyang towards the anti-ballistic missile system’s looming arrival. Monday’s missile launches didn’t showcase any new capabilities, but how the missiles were fired, and where they were fired towards says volumes about the intent of the exercise. Three out of the four modified Scud missiles flew from North Korea’s west coast, across the country and out into the Japan’s exclusive economic zone in the Sea of Japan. The total distance flown by the missiles was roughly 600 miles. The fourth missile landed short, in another area of Sea of Japan. It remains unclear if this was by design or by failure. If the missiles had been launched from North Korea’s east coast they would have been able to reach much of the lower two-thirds of Japan’s Honshu island and all of Kyushu island. Clearly, the test was intended to underline the fact that even North Korea’s cruder ballistic missiles are capable of hitting US interests far off the Korean Peninsula, and could do so in a barrage. In fact, North Korean state news said as much, stating that the test saw their Hwasong ballistic missile division “tasked to strike the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in Japan.” Not just that, but these missiles flew outside of the known engagement envelope of a theoretical THAAD battery placed towards the southern end of South Korea. In other words, the missiles were a clear reminder that THAAD—while it can protect much of South Korea against certain threats flying certain profiles—is in no way a panacea for North Korea’s regional ballistic missile capabilities. North Korea launched a similar salvo of missiles back in September , also at a time when the deployment of THAAD was topping the news cycle, and that launch had a similar aim. The fact that four missiles were launched simultaneously in a similar direction also acted as a reminder that North Korea can and would saturate US, Korean and Japanese targets in an attempt to overwhelm regional missile defense systems. Although sea-based Aegis ballistic missile defense, which is fielded by both the US and Japanese navies (at least three of South Korea’s Sejong the Great class Aegis-equipped destroyers will be upgraded soon with a similar capability) has been tested against limited multiple layer attacks, even these advanced assets’ ability to counter larger barrages of ballistic missiles of various capabilities and flight profiles is doubtful. THAAD, in its current form, also has limited capabilities when it comes to high saturation attacks. A follow-on system dubbed THAAD-ER that is now starting development aims to improve this aspect of the weapon system, along with many others, but that system is still years away—that is if it ever gets fielded at all. The hard truth is that the best place to take out these missiles is on the ground, but that would mean a full-on war had already erupted and there still is a good chance that North Korean forces would get off large quantities of missiles before US-South Korean battle plans could mature. Also, as Pyongyang continues to make strides in solid-fueled missile capabilities , they will be able to deploy mobile ballistic missiles that can be launched far quicker than their liquid-fueled counterparts. This makes finding and taking out these missiles and their transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) preemptively an ever tougher proposition. As for how North Korea could have executed such a tailored show of force before the news of THAAD’s arrival on the Korean Peninsula was made public, well that’s not too hard to figure out. North Korea’s intelligence gathering apparatus run deep in South Korea, and it’s not like such a monumental military milestone just happens overnight. It is very possible, if not probable that North Korea knew about THAAD’s arrival days before its first components rolled off a C-17 at Osan Air Base last evening. Otherwise we can mark this rounds of launches up to a very peculiar coincidence. The US is using North Korea’s most recent missile test as a springboard for justifying THAAD’s presence on the Korean Peninsula, with Admiral Harry Harris Jr., head of the US Pacific Command, stating yesterday that the “continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday’s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea.” All this comes as the US and South Korea are undergoing their annual “Foal Eagle” war games , which always causes heightened tensions on the Peninsula, and as a new American President has yet to clarify his administration’s policy towards North Korea. It also comes as the gulf between Beijing and Pyongyang appears to be widening at an accelerated pace. This development is especially troublesome because China has been long-viewed as the one power that could actually have a serious impact on North Korea’s strategic and geopolitical trajectory. The arrival of THAAD in the region will certainly disgruntle China who has long argued against its deployment, positing that THAAD poses a threat to the credibility of their own nuclear deterrent capabilities and thus the strategic balance in the region. But with Kim Jong Un pushing to obtain long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads as fast as possible and at all costs, Beijing has little grounds to argue against THAAD’s deployment. This reality certainly won’t help when it comes to deteriorating relationship between the once extremely close neighbors, and just because China’s arguments against THAAD’s deployment may be weakened by North Korea’s actions, Beijing will surely respond militarily to its presence. The strategic picture on the Korean Peninsula continues to morph in unprecedented ways, as does that of the region as a whole. Hold on folks, it’s going to be a wild ride.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 30, 2018",Littoral Combat Ship Fires Its First Vertical Launch Hellfire Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On February 28th, the Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship USS Detroit fired a Hellfire missile for the first time. The event came nearly three years after the Navy identified the Hellfire Missile to replace the cancelled XM-501 Non Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) missile system. It was not only the first time a Hellfire had been fired off from an LCS, but also the first time one had been launched vertically—or anything else that had been launched vertically from an LCS for that matter. The Hellfire vertical launch system—dubbed the Surface-to-Surface Mission Module, or SSMM—is envisioned to be part of the LCS’s Surface Warfare Mission Package, which also includes a pair of 30mm bushmaster cannons and an 11 meter rigid-hull inflatable boat. This test launch was intended to see if the missile’s hot gasses and flames impacted the ship and its systems. Guided tests of the missile will commence aboard the USS Milwaukee late this year. The Navy hopes the Hellfire portion of the Surface Warfare Mission Package will be operational sometime in 2018. The Hellfire missile was largely a conciliation prize for the troubled Littoral Combat Ship program after another far more capable system was cancelled. I wrote all about how the Hellfire ended up on the LCS a few years ago, stating: “The Navy has been kicking around ideas to add some sort of guided weaponry to the LCS after its Non Line Of Sight (XM-501 NLOS) missile was cancelled. In fact, both LCS classes, the Independence and the Freedom, were built with space for a miniature vertical launch system containing NLOS missiles to be housed. The NLOS was to designed as two separate variants, the Precision Attack Munition (PAM), with a range of about 30 miles or so, and the Loitering Attack Munition (LAM) that could hang around looking for targets for around a half an hour. When the army cancelled the NLOS program , and the Navy did not pick up the slack, the LCS was left with no punch aside from its Phalanx or C-RAM close-in weapon system, its 57mm automatic cannon, a pair of 30mm chain guns and its MH-60R helicopters.” The Hellfire missile was originally fielded as a laser-guided anti-tank weapon for the AH-64A Apache, but over the decades it has been adopted by a dizzying amount of platforms. Most famously, the Hellfire became the weapon of choice for America’s Predator and Reaper drones, and was used extensively to prosecute America’s targeted assassination program overseas. The Hellfire system being adapted for the LCS is based on AH-64D Apache Longbow’s radar system and the radar-guided AGM-114Ls that are used in conjunction with it. As opposed to Hellfire missiles that use laser guidance, this variant of the missile allows for rapid engagement of multiple targets in any weather conditions and lock-on after launch capability. From my prior piece on the system : “The AGM-114L was built to accompany the AH-64D’s APG-78 “Longbow” mast-mounted fire control radar. The concept behind this capable duo is that the Apache could survey the battlefield within its immediate proximity, even while partially masked behind terrain such as a ridge or a bank of trees, and assign targets identified and classified by the radar to its AGM-114L missiles. At which time the missiles could lock on using their millimetric radar seekers, or they could lock on after launch and use their internal inertial guidance system to bring the target within lock-on range… A whole barrage of them can be fired off at individual targets… Additionally, because we are talking about radar detection and targeting instead of infrared/electro-optical detection and laser targeting, the system can work in any weather and visual conditions as visibility is irrelevant to the Longbow radar.” What we are talking about here is a system that is being deployed specifically to counter swarming boat attacks, and it should be quite capable of doing so—at least until its magazine runs dry. But what is left on the table is the multi-role function that was lost with the cancellation of NLOS, especially in regards to that system’s range. NLOS could have been used to attack targets well over-the-horizon, such as other vessels or targets on shore. As such, LCSs could have provided special operations forces precision air support at standoff ranges in low and medium threat environments. The Hellfire system, on the other hand, has a much narrower mission set. It is just another aspect in which the Littoral Combat Ship concept has not lived up to its hype—a failed “Power Point” weapon system that now features a patchwork of capabilities that offer questionable utility in actual combat situations. As recent history has shown us , even in relatively low-threat littoral combat environments, $2 billion Aegis-equipped destroyers are called in to do the heavy lifting, not the Navy’s overgrown aluminum jet boats. Additionally, it’s odd that the two places where swarming boat tactics are alive and well, the Strait of Hormuz and Mandeb Strait , the Littoral Combat Ships are nowhere to be found. In fact, the fleet is still mired in retraining and other issues after the program was restructured following a series of high profile mechanical incidents, and one LCS crew remains stuck in Asia because of this . Also of note, the first four LCS ships are now test and training ships and will not be deployed operationally. Meanwhile, in Washington DC, calls for axing the so called “up-gunned” frigate version of the Littoral Combat Ship are growing louder, especially as the Navy is set to receive a large influx of funds under the Trump administration. House Armed Services Committee Chairman and outspoken critic of the LCS, John McCain, made it clear last week that he intends to reexamine the entire frigate program, especially in reflection of the realities of modern naval warfare and operational needs. McCain said: “The frigate acquisition strategy should be revised to increase requirements to include convoy air defense, greater missile capability and longer endurance…When you look at some of the renewed capabilities, naval capabilities, that both the Russians and the Chinese have, it requires more capable weapon systems.” There is also timing of procuring this new frigate. The 2018 budget is slated to include a block buy of 12 of these ships, which means that studying the possibility to move the purchase to a new platform, or further adapting the LCS with needed capabilities, will be a challenge. As such, there are calls to slow the purchase so that the same mistakes that spurred the LCS in the first place are not further extrapolated in frigate form. USNI News states : GAO Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management Michele Mackin told lawmakers that frigate cost was unknown and risk too high, and that the Navy did not need to rush into the program because both LCS builders had a backlog of work – a statement the Navy strongly pushed back against. “Our work has shown that both LCS shipyards are running quite a bit behind in delivering ships already under contract. Backlogs are many months long and up to a year or more in some cases. So the bottom line here is that both shipyards will be building LCSs for years to come, at least into 2021 at this point. So there’s no schedule imperative to add frigates to the pipeline right now,” she said. “There’s an opportunity here to not repeat the mistakes of the past. Continued concerns about the capability of LCS, testing that’s years away from being complete, unknowns about the frigate and production backlogs at the shipyards are all factors that need to be taken into account. This potentially $9-billion investment can wait until more is known about what the taxpayers are being asked to fund.” Attractive options—including procuring a proper frigate like the Patrol Frigate family of ships concept Huntington Ingalls has developed based on the Coast Guard’s Legend class National Security Cutter—have been floated for years now (and the author has been pushing for as long as they have existed). Or even just further evolving the LCS to handle anti-air warfare operations so that it can provide area air defense for itself could be an acceptable but not ideal compromise. This could go along with a potential Saudi purchase of a similarly configured LCS variants, saving billions in development dollars. No matter what, building even more LCS-derived ships that will be just as dependent on over-tasked and very expensive destroyers for protection as they are today is a miserable idea. Hopefully common sense will prevail and at the very least, the “frigate” version of the LCS will get the air defense capabilities it desperately needs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","Vietnam Eyes Israel’s Delilah Standoff Missile, and F-16s Could Be Next","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s militarization of its man-made islands in the South China Sea and the resulting anti-access/area-denial bubbles that will cover massive swaths of that body of water in the not-so-distant future, has Vietnam shopping for weaponry that can counter Beijing’s grand plans. Hanoi has already forward-deployed Israeli-built GPS-guided Extra multiple launch rocket systems to their own islands in the South China Sea—a weapon system that could rain down rockets on China’s outposts with little warning. Now, Vietnam is looking towards Israel once again for its weapons needs, this time to provide an standoff multi-role cruise missile that can strike targets over 150 miles away with pinpoint accuracy. According to Flightglobal.com , Israel’s Delilah missile system was a topic of discussion between Vietnam’s President Tran Dai Quang and Israel Military Industries chairman Yitzhak Aharonovitch while he was visiting Hanoi. Israel Military Industries Delilah air-launched cruise missile has evolved over the last decade to become a reliable, highly flexible and extremely accurate standoff weapon. Delilah is quite compact when it comes to cruise missiles, weighing in at just over 400 pounds. It can pack different warheads in the 50 to 75 pound weight class and flies to its target at subsonic speeds and at various altitudes. The missile evolved from an air-launched decoy design, having roots going back decades, but its first known operational use was in 2006 against targets in Lebanon. Since then it has been a front-line weapon of choice for the IAF and it would have been heavily used in an Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear and air defense sites if that operation were to have been launched. IAF Delilah uses inertial navigation with embedded GPS coupled to an autopilot for down-range navigation, and then it can switch to imaging infrared or CCD imaging for terminal guidance. It does this via data link allowing for man-in-the-loop control of the missile for final targeting. What this means is that a weapon system officer in the back of a fighter jet 150 miles away can make fine tuned adjustments on the missile’s point of impact, giving the missile an extreme level of accuracy. For instance, instead of hitting a designated building, a controller can have Delilah fly through an air duct or window on that building. It can also hit a moving vehicles and can be used as an anti-ship missile. Israel has long chosen a man-in-the-loop control option for some of their most capable air-to-ground missiles. The much larger AGM-142 Have Nap/Popeye missile , and even the much smaller anti-armor Spike/Tammuz missile use similar control concepts. Delilah can also loiter over a target area, throttling back its turbojet engine to conserve fuel, and be retargeted on the fly. It can even be told to “go around” if the target can not be identified clearly by the operator. Although it is a key feature of the missile’s design, this man-in-the-loop control concept is not absolutely necessary. The weapon can also attack fixed targets autonomously using GPS/INS guidance alone. Delilah can also be configured for the suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses role where it loiters over an area for a period of time. Once it detects an enemy radar emitter it homes in on that target and destroys it. Although Delilah is best known as a fighter-launched medium range multi-role missile, because of its small size and relatively light weight it can also be carried by helicopters and can even be deployed via ground launchers. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OtuEDR9kRBc IMI has been working on more advanced versions of the Delilah for export purposes, ones that could feature more range and warhead choices, and are capable of avoiding or attacking air defenses autonomously. Additionally, automatic target recognition and scene mapping capabilities could take the place of man-in-the-loop targeting for certain missions. Similar abilities are being integrated into the latest Tomahawk cruise missiles as well as Lockheed’s promising and very stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) , among others. So what you have here is a single missile that can accomplish what a series of discreet missiles types would be traditionally needed to do so. Which along with its range and size make it perfect for a country that needs a diverse set of standoff missile capabilities but is on a tight budget. As an air launched system, a Vietnamese fixed-wing aircraft would have to fly just 150 miles from Vietnamese mainland before launching a Delilah missile at a target on China’s sprawling Fiery Cross Reef island outpost . A Delilah missile could reach China’s strategic Hainan Island without needing an aircraft delivery system at all, instead it could be shore-launched. As such, you can see how the system is uniquely suited for Vietnam’s regional needs, and the fact that it can attack ships too makes it all that more attractive. IAF There is the issue of what Vietnamese aircraft would put such a missile to use. Their Su-30MK2 Flankers could possibly be adapted to employ the missile, and it would not be the first time Israeli avionics found their way into to Russia’s iconic heavy-fighter design. Vietnam’s Russian-built helicopters could also be adapted to sport the missile, but it would not be ideal. Beyond their existing fighter platforms, Vietnam may also opt to procure western fighter aircraft, and there are rumblings that this could be underway as part of a larger initiative to turn away from Hanoi’s traditional sources of weaponry. Israel may have just the jets to sell them with their new missiles— 40 surplus F-16A/Bs “Netz” fighters that are currently up for sale. Israel Aerospace Industries could refurbish these jets indigenously with advanced multi-mode radars, electronic warfare suites and new cockpit avionics. Additionally, IAI can also apply structural upgrades to the used jets to give them thousands of hours of additional service life. Doing so would give Vietnam a uniquely capable and supportable western fighter aircraft that is tailored to employ the Delilah missile, along with other Israeli-built air-ground and air-to-air munitions—and they would not have to deal with the Washington bureaucracy to obtain them. IAI If Vietnam were to execute such a strategy, China would not be happy. But considering the changing geopolitical and military realities in Southeast Asia, Vietnam has to do something to further bolster its offensive capabilities. Seeing that a unique Israeli weapon system is already being by Vietnam used to counter-balance China’s military expansion in the region, it makes sense that Hanoi would go to the same source to continue doing so, especially if that source can provide big capabilities at a relatively low price. Not just that, but with Vietnam spending increasing defense dollars with Israel for other air combat needs, including ordering high-end SPYDER air defense systems , getting a fighter aircraft that can interoperate intimately with these systems is only logical. One thing is for certain—fielding a couple squadrons of highly upgraded F-16s armed with Delilah missiles would give Vietnam a considerable boost in power projection capabilities, and would be a worthwhile step in countering China’s military expansion into the South China Sea.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 12, 2019",Watch A-10s Lob Laser-Guided Bombs At Remote-Controlled Humvees,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Saylor Creek Bombing Range is located about 25 miles southeast of Mountain Home AFB in Idaho. The range spans over 100,000 acres and is one of the most advanced in the country, drawing USAF aircraft from around the coutry and even allied aircraft from overseas. These foreign aircraft often times prepare for participating in exercise Red Flag by flying missions out of Mountain Home AFB to the Saylor Creek Range in the weeks leading up to the exercise . According to one source the range is described as being “covered with simulated hostile radar facilities , most of which are moveable electronic “threats,” like those used on the Nellis Range in Nevada and elsewhere. Simulated surface to air missile batteries, employing “Smokey SAM” simulated rockets , are in use on the range. Visual targets, electronic warfare training, and live bombing are also components of the range’s function.” As you can tell, this is not just some basic gunnery range. The video below shows A-10s from the 124th Fighter Wing busting up remote-controlled Humvees near a mock village, giving us just a glimpse of the facility’s capabilities. The idea behind all this is to make training as realistic as possible. Since A-10s are often tasked with taking out moving targets , hitting derelict tank hulks just doesn’t always do the trick. That’s where adapting surplus vehicles into remote controlled targets comes into play. Because inert ordnance is used—in this case laser-guided 500lb GBU-12 bombs—a single remote controlled vehicle can be used over and over, just like their full scale aerial target cousins. If the bomb drops land within a certain number of feet of the target it is still considered a kill because the blast of the GBU-12 would disable or destroy the target if the bomb were live instead of filled with concrete. As for the A-10’s 30mm GAU-8 Avenger cannon—well nothing lasts long against it. Google Earth The range is dotted with a mock airfield, villages and other structures, and can also be used by ground forces for training, including practicing for military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) . It is especially useful for USAF military police to train in an air base installation-like setting, as well as for combat controllers and even PJs as you can see in the images below. But mainly the range supports A-10s and AH-64 Apaches based at Gowen Field in Boise, and Strike Eagles and visiting aircraft stationed at Mountain Home AFB nearby. USAF USAF 366th Operations Support Squadron that runs the Saylor Creek Range won the Defense Logistics Agency Range of the Year award in 2016. According to a USAF article , the competition included “layout, overall range capabilities, reutilization totals, cleanliness of the facility, overall appearance, and what’s been accomplished using DLA equipment.” Curtis Viall, a range officer, described how his unit fills the range with surplus items as targets: “Generally, the ranges have to buy soft targets that are made of plywood and cardboard. An alternative to these soft targets is to use a vehicle that has been deemed excess or unserviceable… Finding valuable ways to utilize excess property, vehicles and equipment on the range provides our aircrews realistic tactical targets and saves a significant amount of money. Last year, over a thousand vehicles were reutilized on ranges, saving thousands of dollars.” “We typically acquire tanks, self-propelled and towed artillery, armored personnel carriers, (shipping) containers, Humvees and construction equipment. Once at the range the vehicles are prepped to go on range as targets. In some cases targets require no modification and can go directly onto the range to be used, but quite often we will make modifications to make them look more realistic.” USAF Nice work guys!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Awesome Photos Show Early Days of Canada’s Most Elite Special Operators,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Most countries are tight-lipped about their special operations forces, and their activities. Canada, which has a very active group of elite units conducting sensitive missions at home and abroad, is no exception. So it was a pleasant surprise when the Canadian Forces’ official Twitter account posted a number of unusual pictures from the very early days of the country’s secretive Joint Task Force 2 (JTF 2) on March 10, 2017. This is the country’s “Tier One” force, equivalent to the U.S. Army’s Delta Force or the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team Six. The four photographs show operators training to rappel from CH-146 Griffon helicopters and down the side of a building, assaulting a mock suspect vehicle and stacking up outside a building. They wear blue uniforms and have only a limited amount of gear, while carrying an assortment of regular and suppressed 9mm Heckler and Koch MP5 submachine guns with red-dot sights and Sig-Sauer pistols with flashlights underneath the muzzle. All in all, the troops look more like a police-style special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team than a military organization. This reflects the unit’s very early history and origins. Canadian Forces “By the early 1990s, the continuing efforts of the Federal government to combat its enormous deficit led to continuing deep budget cuts to all government departments,” Canadian Army Col. Bernd Horn, who served as deputy commander of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM), wrote in a 2012 monograph for  the U.S. Joint Special Operations University. “Faced with financial constraints, the requirement to pay overtime to members of the SERT – a force that had been in existence for years but had not yet deployed – as well as the requirement to continually rely on military airlift and other support provided the impetus for change,” he continued. “Moreover, the military in the post-Cold War era was also amenable to taking on new roles.” Canadian Forces SERT members trained the first JTF 2 cadres and the task force became officially operational on April 1, 1992. Two years later, Canadian military officials decided to transition the troops from a pure counter-terrorism focus to a broader special operations role. More recent photos and video depict a more traditional-looking special operations element, with troops wearing camouflage uniforms, extensive web gear and other equipment and carrying 5.56mm M4-style carbines, sniper rifles, light machine guns, and grenade launchers. The official JTF-2 website has an image gallery consisting entirely promotional shots highlighting the various specific duties within the task force, from “medical technical” to “assaulter. Still, some operators appear to still be wearing SWAT-style solid green uniforms. And though their existence is now a public fact, Canadian authorities have done done their utmost to keep the unit out of the public eye. When officials in Ottawa had announced the JTF 2 was in Afghanistan fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban in October 2001, “the revelation came as a shock to most Canadians,” according to Horn. “Few actually knew that Canada possessed ‘commandos,’ or more accurately special operations forces.” “We do what the Government asks of us, but please respect that we can’t tell everyone how we complete it,” the unit’s webpage says. As of 2017, JTF 2 still has a range of responsibilities inside the country and around the world. Canadian Forces Since its formation, JTF 2’s operators have deployed to Bosnia, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Iraq, as well as within Canada to help protect events like the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In 2006, the Canadian Forces assigned the unit, along with the Canadian Special Operations Regiment (CSOR), the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit (CJIRU), and 427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron (SOAS), to the newly formed CANSOFCOM. But despite the task force’s history, for domestic counter-terrorism operations “you don’t use military force of that description unless you’ve exhausted what’s available in the law enforcement portfolio,” Maj. Gen. Michael Rouleau, then in charge of CANSOFCOM, told The Toronto Star in 2010. “We’re not first responders.” More recently, in 2014, Canada sent members of CSOR to train and advise Kurdish forces in Northern Iraq as they fought Islamic State. Two years later, three CH-146s from 427 SOAS arrived in the city of Erbil to support the Canadian mission. We don’t know if the top secret JTF 2 has any operators in the fight against the brutal terrorist group, but it wouldn’t be surprising.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan’s Izumo class helicopter carrier will be sent on an unprecedented three month long patrol the the tumultuous South China Sea . The Izumo will call on ports in Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Indonesia ahead of joining the large scale “Malabar” international naval exercises in the Indian Ocean. These exercises usually include India and the US as primary players. With the addition of Japan’s helicopter carrier and its escorts, the exercise could see carriers from the three most powerful navies in the region, aside from China, working together in joint drills—a revelation that is sure to perturb Beijing. Yet it was the People’s Liberation Army Navy that sent its own carrier to the region on a similar operational proof of concept and show of force cruise just three months ago. The Izumo is 814 feet long and displaces 27,000 tons. Although Japan likes to downplay its capabilities, even calling it a “helicopter destroyer” instead of a helicopter carrier, the ship can theoretically deploy dozens of helicopters far from Japanese shores. These include anti-submarine, utility, and attack helicopter variants, of which Japan has some of the most capable models around, including Merlins, Black Hawks and Chinooks, as well as Cobras and Apaches. Even if the massive helicopter carrier just focuses its mission on anti-submarine warfare, it would pose an increased threat to China’s highly-active submarine operations in the region . CIMSEC Although Japan doesn’t have any claims over the South China Sea, it has its own separate maritime squabbles with China and the one surrounding the Senkaku Islands has gotten especially tense in recent years . Both issues—China’s claims on the South China Sea and the Senkaku islands—will likely come up next month when Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with President Trump for the first at Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aILaV9AMHks For post WWII Japan, whose constitution limits itself from procuring and deploying “offensive weaponry,” the massive Izumo, as well as her sister-ship Kaga that will be commissioned very soon, are another reminder of Japan’s changing geopolitical and military role in the eastern hemisphere and beyond.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 26, 2018",Gray Eagle Drones Are Not Being Deployed To South Korea As A Reactionary Measure,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The news that the US Army is deploying MQ-1C Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft to South Korea came yesterday packaged in a strange manner. News outlets and the US government seemed to be making the point that the aircraft’s new assignment was part of some sort of escalation in response to North Korea’s continued missile tests and nuclear ambitions . State Department spokesman Mark Toner stated: “In addition to THAAD these drones are defensive measures that are a response to what we—and by ‘we’ I mean South Korea, the United States and Japan—view as a real and credible threat to our security.” Yet the truth is that the armed reconnaissance drone has been made an integrated part of the US Army’s master rotary-wing aviation plan, and its arrival on the Korean Peninsula is just part of the implementation that long-standing plan. Along with the latest iteration of the AH-64 Apache, the Gray Eagle replaces the retired OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter. It just so happens that the last of the OH-58Ds are being fully retired from service, and the final unit using the type —the 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade—was forward deployed to South Korea up until very recently to work alongside and to provide armed scout capabilities to the resident 2nd Aviation Regiment’s Apaches one last time. The MQ-1C Gray Eagle is an evolutionary outgrowth of the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator . Where the Predator system is built around a stationary, cockpit-like man-in-the-loop control concept that primarily leverages a satellite data-link for connectivity, Gray Eagle and its sensor and weapons payload can be controlled by operators in, near, or even above the battlefield. Primary control of Gray Eagle is still executed through a ground control element, but one that is simpler and more transportable than those used by the Predator. These units can be mounted on the back of a truck or they can be offloaded and set up quickly at an in-theatre base. Like the Predator, the Gray Eagle also has satellite connectivity, so operations are not limited to line-of-sight operations. But ground operators can “pass off” control of the drone to other elements over or very near the front lines, such as to an AH-64E Apache’s crew, or a forward air controller, or even to another ground control element that is mobile and operating as part of a larger ground force. Inside the tight confines of the Universal Command Station that can control the Gray Eagle. No control stick or throttles here!, US Army When a Gray Eagle is teamed with an Apache, the helicopter crew can use a “point and click” semi-autonomous interface to extend their surveillance and attack range, as well as their overall situational awareness, via the Gray Eagle. This could include commanding the drone to go scout an area ahead for dangerous enemy air defenses, or it could be to designate targets beyond the Apache’s own sensor reach. Or simply the Gray Eagle could be directed to get “eyes on” a target area in advance of the Apache crew’s arrival. Eventually, Apache crews could take out targets using the drone’s own Hellfire or Viper Strike missiles, thereby allowing the helicopter to attack on two fronts at once, or to “soften” a particular target area before making their own attack run. Because the Grey Eagle can stay aloft for over 24 hours, multiple “users” could leverage the aircraft during a single sortie. For instance, an Apache could use the Gray Eagle for a period of time, and once they leave their station, a forward-deployed ground unit could take it over to scout their route ahead and to provide overwatch and organic close air support if needed. Kiowas Warriors have held their own on the cheap over 15 years of war overseas., DoD It is this “manned-unmanned teaming” concept, which is still in development, as well as the AH-64’s higher-end sensors and enhanced survivability, that the US Army used to justify the retirement of hundreds of battle-tested and relatively cheap to operate OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopters. The diminutive Kiowas and their notoriously aggressive crews were known to have been incredibly effective in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their ability to work close to both friendlies and enemies alike (Kiowa pilots are known to engage the enemy with their own M4 carbines), and their high readiness rate and relatively small logistical footprint made them a greater force than the sum of their parts. This is precisely why many were incensed by the US Army’s plan to remove all H-58/Jet Ranger derivatives from its fleet as part of a sequester-era, cost-saving aviation restructuring plan. This plan also resulted in the Army’s practically new fleet of roughly 200 UH-72 Lakota twin-turbine utility helicopters being made into primary trainers, with the Army’s massive fleet of far simpler and more cost effective TH-67 Creeks being put out to pasture. That’s right, student pilots are going through primary helicopter training with the US Army in $6 million Eurocopter EC145 derivatives. Under the same plan National Guard and Reserve AH-64 Apaches would be transferred to the active service, with some units receiving Black Hawks in exchange. According to the US Army: “The Gray Eagle UAS company consists of nine unmanned aircraft, five Ground Control Stations (GCS), six Ground Data Terminals (GDT), one Mobile Ground Control Station (MGCS), three Satellite Ground Data Terminal (SGDT), an Automated Take-off and Landing System (ATLS), and other ground-support equipment, operated and maintained by a company of 128 Soldiers.” , US Army Fast forward to today, and the Kiowas are all gone, with some units still converting over to the Apache and MQ-1C to take up the armed reconnaissance mission. Thus establishing an MQ-1C presence on the Korean Peninsula with the Army’s 2nd Aviation Regiment that is permanently based there as part of the 2nd Infantry Division is more a part of the Army’s larger tactical aviation master plan than anything else. Not just that, but the MQ-1C is incredibly well suited to the tactical situation in the Korea area of operations. When not teamed with Apaches or forward ground-based elements, these aircraft can fly along the demilitarized zone, carrying different sensor packages to suck up image /WAAS , radar , electronic , communication and other forms of intelligence. In Korea, Gray Eagle can also do this largely within line of sight of its ground control stations, without the need for a continuos satellite data-link. During a time of war, Gray Eagles can jam enemy radio communications, hunt for active artillery positions, missile launchers, regime elements and track troop movements. It can even take out targets of opportunity itself if it ends up being operated in an armed state, a move that will require the approval of South Korean government. In the end the Grey Eagle’s arrival in South Korea fits in with the US Army’s master plan for tactical aviation, and beyond that the aircraft provides relevant capabilities to allied commanders. But the idea that its permanent deployment, which will likely be to Kunsan Air Base, is some type of escalating response to North Korea’s recent missile launches and other acts, is likely inaccurate, but it does make for a good headline and impactful propaganda.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 15, 2017",The USMC’s New CH-53K King Stallion Is One Royally Expensive Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USMC’s much needed replacement for the notoriously unreliable CH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift helicopter has had its fair share of issues. But now as the CH-53K accelerates its flight testing, its price tag is what’s most concerning—costing a projected $122 million per helicopter. Yes, this is nearly the same unit price as the F-35B, the Joint Strike Fighter variant intended to replace the Marine Corps Harriers and and hundreds of their Hornets. The thing is, the USMC, once known for “getting more done with less,” has been aiming to have its air arm transform into an all high-end, “silver bullet”-technology equipped force. Case in point, the backbone of their helicopter fleet isn’t even a helicopter at all, it’s a tilt-rotor airplane—the MV-22 Osprey. Although the King Stallion’s price tag may seem outrageous, the USMC has spent tens of billions of dollars equipping itself with an all Osprey medium-lift “helicopter” fleet. Each Osprey, even after hundreds have been built, costs roughly $72 million each, and whereas the King Stallion is an absolutely necessary procurement item, the Osprey was a luxury the USMC chose to pursue. The service could have bought roughly three medium-lift helicopters for same price of a single MV-22. DoDBuzz.com reports that the decades-old CH-53E Super Stallion , the progenitor of the CH-53K, cost roughly $41 million in today’s dollars. But considering the capability that the CH-53K brings to the table and how badly it’s needed—not to mention the high cost of an Osprey—its price tag is a little easier to swallow. Just like most new military aircraft, the first examples cost the most, with the unit cost usually dropping fairly dramatically as the system enters full rate production. In total, the USMC looks to buy 200 CH-53Ks. Lieutenant General Gary Thomas stated that the cost per King Stallion will drop below $89 million once the helicopters enter full rate production around the turn of the decade—that is, if everything goes as planned. Sikorsky As for what Lockheed ( which now owns Sikorsky ) says on the issue, spokesperson Erin Cox told Military.com : “The CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter, as previously known and reported, overcame developmental issues as are common with new, highly complex programs and is now completely  on track and scheduled for Milestone C review leading to initial low rate production… The program is performing extremely well.” Although the USMC may be stuck paying whatever it has to when it comes to replacing its Super Stallions, the fact that the military branch seems to only settle for the most expensive flying machines is drawing ire from Congress. Niki Tsongus, who is a ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, made her concerns clear during a recent hearing, stating : “While the Marine Corps certainly has a need for aircraft of many types, the ratio of spending on aircraft compared to ground equipment is striking. The Fiscal Year 2017 budget request was no exception to this trend: in it the Marine Corps requested approximately $1.5 billion for procurement of ground equipment and ammunition, however in the same president’s budget it requested $5.3 billion for just five aircraft programs: the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, the CH-53K King Stallion helicopter, the V-22 Osprey, the AH-1 attack helicopter and the KC-130 refueler… While the individual aircraft programs in question are likely very important when taken individually, the scale of the imbalance, more than three to one in just this fiscal year, suggests that upgrading aircraft is currently valued higher than upgrading ground equipment. I have some concerns about this ratio of spending on aircraft versus ground equipment, given the Marine Corps’ mission to be the premiere force in readiness and the historical reliance that the nation has placed on the Marine Corps’ role in ground combat.” The numbers are striking, and considering USMC air elements are supposed to exist primarily to support the Marine rifleman on the ground, it all does seem quite out of whack, but this is really nothing new. The USMC could have replaced at least a portion of their falling apart Hornets with Super Hornets, but instead they waited for the top-of-the-line stealth fighter and would take nothing less. Splitting up the MV-22 buy with an aircraft like the S-92 would have also saved billions that could have been redirected to support new equipment purchases for the USMC’s ground forces. For the vast majority of missions, an MV-22’s capability is a luxury, but one that many head-honchos within the Marine Corps will defend vehemently. Lieutenant General Gary Thomas stated to the committee the following to justify the split: “We are a light general purpose force. One of the things that gives the Marine Corps an advantage on the battlefield is its mobility and its fires. Much of that comes from aviation… The ground side, in terms of fires, mobility, those are equally as important, but if we were just to look relatively how we’re investing across aviation and ground, without looking at the cost, although there are significant differences there, but in terms of capability and capacity, we think we’re balanced.” Still, considering the age of many of the USMC’s ground/amphibous vehicles , it is clear that the fiscal priority has been placed overwhelmingly on the aerial side of the USMC’s combat equation—possibly to an extent that is it actually illogical and “un-balanced” so to speak The CH-53K’s sticker price may be a shocker, but the bottom-line is that USMC has had many chances to rationalize their spending on aerial programs and has chosen a “no compromise” route instead. As such, there are few areas within their aviation plans left to modify in order to save money and invest in more basic needs. The CH-53K is a must have, its heavy-lifting capabilities are essential to the USMC’s mission, and there is really no alternative to the type available off the shelf. So the F-35 may be an interesting comparison price-wise, but they are apples and oranges when it comes to the basic needs of the Corps.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It looks like something out of dystopian hellscape because it is—that hellscape being war-torn northwest Mosul, Iraq. And this crudely armored loader just barreled through the front lines and into a Iraqi security forces forward operating base before exploding into a massive fireball. Northwest Mosul is the last quarter of the city held by the Islamic State, and the last major concentration of the terror group left in Iraq. With nowhere to run, ISIS is making the Iraqi Army, led by Iraq’s battle-hardened Golden Division, pay dearly for every last inch. A major uptick in improvised explosive devices (IEDs), booby traps, and drone-dropped bomblets have punctuated the last few weeks of fighting. The worst flavor among them are the especially deadly vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIED) that have a suicide bomber at the wheel of what is basically a guided missile. What’s worse is that ISIS has learned all too well that armoring these vehicles—and especially adapting heavy equipment that can plow through barriers—makes them even more effective. Today, one of these vehicles did just that. This horrifying death machine was filmed on its way to its target and overhead by a drone as it detonated at the Iraqi security forces makeshift base. Here’s the video of the VBEID and the attack: The attack supposedly just happened, so we don’t know how many Iraqi security forces personnel were harmed in the blast. But it is a stark reminder that after many months of intense urban combat , the fight for Mosul is still very much underway. Here’s a great animated map showing the progress of the operation. Below that is Iraq’s official map of what districts have been recaptured and where ISIS continues to hold ground. The eastern half of Mosul is no longer shown on maps from the Iraqi Army because ISIS has been removed from that area for some time now. Iraqi Army/Nineveh Media Center The end may beginning to appear within sight, but actually realizing it will be one bloody march. Still, it is amazing the progress the Iraqis and their coalition partners have made. It was questionable whether Iraq’s security forces, which had chronically failed even after well over a decade of training and material support, would be able to hold up to such a grueling fight. They have done incredibly well under abhorrent conditions, with special operations units leading the charge. We have no metrics on the overall casualties sustained during the operation; the Iraqi government is totally unwilling to release them for public consumption. But we know it has been a brutal fight with a very high toll—largely the result of an entrenched and fanatical enemy that has weaponized anything they can get their hands on to take the fight to the Iraqi security forces on multiple fronts. Now, the final test begins. The density of ISIS fighters is likely to only increase as Iraqi forces push northward. After months of continuous fighting, it would be a challenge for any military to keep up the operations tempo against such a challenging set of circumstances. We’ll have to wait and see if the Iraqis are up for the ultimate charge. Still, the big question looms—with so many battle hardened factions armed and mobilized, as well as their individual proxies’ interests, what comes of Iraq after Mosul and ISIS? Will these factions lay their arms down in a push for peace, or will they turn on one another in what could be a far more devastating civil war than what Syria has experienced in recent years? Only time will tell.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The old adage goes, when the President is faced with an international crisis overseas his first question is, “Where are the carriers?” Regardless of how truthful that statement remains today, America’s supercarriers and amphibious assault ships remain the most complex and potent weapon systems the world has ever seen. They can be used as much for responding to disasters and providing humanitarian relief as for offensive capabilities. The locations of America’s carriers has been a fairly controversial subject as of late, with the so-called “carrier gap” causing a short period of time in January, the first since WWII, where no US carrier was deployed overseas. Fast forward to today, and President Trump wants to increase the carrier fleet by one supercarrier for a total of 12 ships going into the next decade. So, where are the carriers today … as in, right now? The folks over at Stratfor have put together an awesome weekly report showing just that: where America’s supercarriers and amphibious assault ships are in near real time, and where some of them are heading in the near future. Check it out here. The US Navy is really the only navy in the world that would require an entire web page to show where all its aircraft carriers are. The US has roughly five times more carriers as any other navy in the world, and other Navy’s carriers are mostly amphibious assault ships or helicopter carriers, not CATOBAR supercarriers . As the F-35B comes online, the capability of America’s “gator navy” flattops, largely relegated to low- and medium threat combat environments, will be able to provide a low-density (albeit top-of-the-line) air warfare capability even in high-threat combat environments. You can read all how the F-35B will change where and how America’s amphibious assault ships can be employed here , but suffice it to say that they will be able to offer close to the same offensive strike capabilities as a supercarrier, just at a much lower sortie frequency. As for where potential peer state competitors Russia and China’s sole carriers are at the moment, Russia’s dilapidated Admiral Kuznetsov is undergoing a deep overhaul that will put it out of action for years—possibly until the early 2020s. China’s Liaoning is tied up at its home port of Qingdao on the Yellow Sea.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 20, 2017",Arrow Missile Intercepts Syrian SAM Fired At Israeli Jets Following Strikes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a first, Israeli’s Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile system intercepted a surface-to-air missile fired at Israeli Air Force (IAF) jets that had struck targets in southern Syria. The action began overnight at around 2:30 am local time when IAF jets supposedly attacked a weapons shipment intended for Hezbollah. Shortly after, the jets were fired upon by Syrian surface-to-air missiles as they were flying back into Israeli airspace. At least one of the missiles was engaged by an Arrow 3 battery located in northeast Israel. Nobody on the ground was injured in the incident, and although Syrian forces claimed they downed an IAF fighter , Israel says the jets made it back to base without issue. Photos of what appeared to be the hulk of a missile, possibly the booster of an Arrow 3, were posted on social media shortly after the incident: תיעוד מירדן: פינוי שרידי הטיל של מערכת חץ שנפל במדינה @samiaah10 pic.twitter.com/35465FojN1 — חדשות 13 (@newsisrael13) March 17, 2017 The missiles were supposedly fired from southern Syria by Assad’s military, and traveled over Jordan towards the Jerusalem area. They were apparently SA-5 (NATO reporting name: Gammon) surface-to-air missiles, which have been in Syrian service for many years. Although dated, these are very large missiles that feature a fairly long-range and high operating altitude. The IDF said the missiles did not pose a threat to Israel or its fighters that were close to or already in Israeli airspace when the Arrow 3 engaged. With all this in mind, it may seem puzzling why the Arrow 3 was used to engage the Syrian SAMs, but there may be one easy explanation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wv36ABSZe0Y Arrow 3 is a midcourse ballistic missile interceptor system , and was never meant to counter surface-to-air missiles or even aircraft. It was primarily designed to counter ballistic missiles launched form Iran, but it can also be used to counter those launched from Arab states and even work as an anti-satellite weapon. Arrow, now in its third evolutionary configuration, has been developed over 20 plus years. It occupies the “top tier” of Israel’s layered missile defense concept, with David’s Sling, (and the Patriot to some degree) and finally Iron Dome fulfilling its lower layers. Arrow 3 just became operation in January and this was the first operational use of an Arrow missile. USMDA It is possible that some of the SA-5s, or whatever missiles were launched by Syrian forces, were fired in “ballistic” mode as a defensive measure. During a ballistic launch, SAMs are fired unguided toward a suspected threat to put that threat on the defensive, or as an act of desperation because the target can’t be successfully acquired by the system’s fire control radar. The missiles either self destruct once reaching a high altitude or continue on their ballistic trajectory once their rocket motors burn out. It is possible that Israel’s integrated air defense system, and the Green Pine radar system that provides tracking and targeting for Arrow 3 in particular, picked up the ballistic track of the telephone pole sized SA-5 and categorized the threat as a short-range ballistic missile and engaged it as such. This may be the first time a surface-to-air missile was shot down by another ground-based air defense system. The launch of the Arrow missile activated Israel’s rocket alert system along the country’s eastern border, with sirens going off as far as the West Bank, and explosions were heard after the sirens had sounded. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gehmvpdmWQw The news of yet another Israeli airstrike in Syria and retaliation SAM launches by Syrian forces comes after some experts posited that Israel is already using their two F-35Is in an offensive role over Syria, even though the jets were just delivered a few months ago. It has also been claimed that S-300 SAM systems—which only the Russians possess in Syria—had been engaging the F-35Is and other IAF aircraft in recent months. Both claims are very unlikely to be true . But what is true is that IAF aircraft have been fired on before while operating over Syria and Russia’s tacit agreement with Israel for “deconfliction” of airspace over the war-torn country seems to have begun to unravel in recent months . Still, there is zero evidence that Russia has anything to do with attacks on Israeli jets that have carried out airstrikes in Syria on targets related to the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah . Israeli airstrikes seem to have accelerated in recent months following the fall of Aleppo to the Assad regime, Russian special operations forces and Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters, with strikes occurring on what seems like monthly basis since then. F-16I Soufa and F-15C Baz seen during an exercise Blue Flag., AP This incident appears to be the most serious engagement between the re-empowered Assad regime and Israel since the Syrian civil war began almost six years ago to the day. Israel has been able (at least to public knowledge) to penetrate Syrian airspace since Operation Orchard—the 2007 bombing of a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site near Dier ez-Zor. This has largely been possible due to a cocktail of measures that rely heavily on advanced electronic warfare and cyber attacks on Syria’s air defense network. A test launch of the Arrow 3, USMDA Since the Syrian civil war began, Assad’s air defense system has remained largely intact. It wasn’t knocked out as a result of the crossing of President Obama’s “red line” when chemical weapons were used by regime elements against Syrian civilians, and an unspoken agreement between the Assad regime and the US-backed coalition has existed whereas Assad’s air defense network has been left untouched in exchange for Assad’s forces not targeting US and other allied aircraft. Now that the Assad regime, which was near failing a year and a half ago, has been propped back up into a fairly stable state by its Russian and Iranian backers, it is no surprise that his air defense forces are becoming more bold and protective of their airspace. Still, at this point in time the good news is that none of Russia’s advanced “triple digit” S-300 and S-400 SAM systems that are deployed within Syria’s borders have engaged Israeli jets. If that were to occur it would represent a very robust and new challenge for the IAF and would signal a massive shift in the already incredibly dicey geopolitical balance of the region.

"Joseph Trevithick, Tyler Rogoway","Updated on Jun 29, 2019","Despite Tough Talk, U.S. Responses to North Korea Are Business As Usual","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump and his administration have been talking tough on North Korea—but so far, the actual policies have been business as usual, and the escalating rhetoric may only serve to validate the reclusive regime’s paranoia. On March 17, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with his South Korean counterpart, Yun Byung-se, as part of his first state visit to the country and a larger tour of American partners in Asia. At a joint press conference, he offered the latest tough talk at his host’s northern neighbor. “Let me be very clear: the policy of strategic patience has ended,” America’s top diplomat declared. “If they [North Korea] elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, that option is on the table.” Tillerson and his South Korea counterpart Yun Byung-se meet in Seoul during his first trip as Secretary of State to the region. , AP The statement was part of a clear trend. On March 4, 2017, The New York Times reported that Trump himself had received a briefing on “all options” for neutralizing North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. At least one South Korean news outlet interpreted this as a possible discussion of reintroducing American nuclear weapons onto the Peninsula. Washington removed its stockpile of tactical nukes from the country in 1991. Later in the month, the Pentagon has made two notable permanent deployments to the Korean Peninsula. U.S. officials did little to dissuade the public from the idea that the arrival of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) missiles and MQ-1C Gray Eagle Drones were both linked to North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. “Any attack on the United States or on our allies will be defeated and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with the response that would be effective and overwhelming,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis had said at a press conference in Seoul on Feb. 3, 2017. “Due to North Korea’s threatening rhetoric and destabilizing behavior, we are taking defensive steps, like deploying the highly effective THAAD antimissile unit to the Republic of Korea, to protect its people and our troops that stand beside our ally.” Tillerson and US and South Korean military commanders meet at The Joint Security Area in the DMZ., AP Also in March 2017, American and South Korean troops started the annual Foal Eagle and Key Resolve war games. These practice sessions reportedly included mock “ decapitation attacks ” against North Korean leadership and key infrastructure, according to South Korean media. However, on closer inspection, Washington’s actual military moves have been business as usual. Beyond the stronger language, there is little as of yet to distinguish the actual policies from that of President Barack Obama. They do, unfortunately, fit perfectly in line with North Korea’s state-run media, including the Korean Central News Agency, which routinely warns that a threat to the regime is imminent. It is hardly uncommon to read official screeds declaring the United States and its southern “puppets” are one step away from a massive, unprovoked invasion on their path to colonize all of East Asia. In 2009, the Pentagon ended a previous policy of rotating Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries through deployments to South Korea and instead permanently based two battalions of the weapons on the Peninsula. Afterwards, Washington and Seoul began actively discussion sending THAAD to the region. In light of delays and developmental hiccups with THAAD , in 2013, South Korea declared it would invest in building its own system. Three years later, with Lockheed’s ballistic missile defense system showing improvement, the Pentagon announced it had finally reached an agreement with South Korean officials on the deployment of a single battery of the missiles—the same battery that started arriving in March 2017. As this debate had long been controversial and public, North Korea was well aware that the plan to deploy THAAD to South Korea was underway. “The projected deployment of THAAD in South Korea brings to light the adventurous scenario of the U.S. bellicose forces to invade the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea], threaten its neighboring countries and dominate the Asia-Pacific region,” North Korea’s state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun had declared in its typical style on June 17, 2014. Pyongyang’s extensive intelligence networks in the south may have even been aware of the exact timeline for THAAD’s arrival. As such, it is very possible that North Korea’s March 2017 missile tests were actually an act of preemptive protest rather than an arbitrary provocation. Yet if you were to read U.S. government officials’ quotes on the deployment, it sounded as if the arrival of the first THAAD components on South Korean soil—just hours after North Korea had launched a series of missiles—was a reaction to those launches and some form of a tit-for-tat  military escalation. Some South Koreans have long protested THAAD’s deployment to the country. , AP Similarly, rather than a reaction to any new developments, the Pentagon’s decision to send Gray Eagle drones to South Korea was part of a long-standing and broad plan to reorganize its aviation units . The Army plans to add at least one company of the unmanned aircraft to each of its combat aviation brigades. The 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade is based in South Korea. The pilotless planes partially take over the role previously filled by the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopter. In February, the very last of those helicopters in the Army returned from a deployment to South Korea. The service ultimately hopes to employ a “manned-unmanned team” of MQ-1Cs and AH-64 Apache gunships on any future battlefield. But once again, many official comments made about the drone’s deployment would make you believe it was in reaction to North Korea’s actions and part of a new hard line policy by the Trump administration, instead of just a long planned upgrade of hardware. And as already noted, Foal Eagle and Key Resolve are annual exercises. The training missions invariably cause heightened tensions on the Peninsula and provoke North Korea’s ire. North Korean forces often respond with shows of force such as artillery barrages and missile launches into the sea nearby, ballistic missile tests and even nuclear detonations. During the 2016 iteration of Ulchi Freedom Guardian—another yearly war game—officials in Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike on South Korea. The same year, North Korea said it would launch a nuclear-tipped missile at the U.S. Air Force Base on Guam after the Pentagon announced a new deployment of long-range bombers. The four missiles Pyongyang launched in March 2017 appeared to be practice run for an attack on Japan. This could have been an attempt by the regime to stage a counter to exercises it sees as a direct threat to its existence, and it is not the first time they have launched practice ballistic missile attacks . The focus on preemptive strikes to decapitating the regime and its weapons of mass destruction reflects the current military strategy for an open war with the North, called Operations Plan (OPLAN) 5015 , which the Pentagon reportedly implemented sometime in 2015. Regardless, though the exact details have been classified, experts have long conducted open source analysis of OPLANs relating to scenarios on the Korean Peninsula. These include OPLAN 5027 , a response to a North Korean invasion and subject major war, and OPLAN 5029 , a plan for handling a complete collapse of the strict dictatorial regime. Tillerson also mentioned the possibility of harsher sanctions, but this came following a February 2017 report from the U.N. detailing North Korea’s extensive flaunting of international sanctions. The Communist regime had “intensified” these activities and the international community’s efforts to implement new controls had been “insufficient and highly inconsistent,” the panel of independent experts explained . So, it seems unlikely that the sterner American statements will goad North Korea into changing its own policies unless they’re actually coupled with a new, cohesive strategy. They will undoubtedly inflame the regime’s own pronouncements and paranoia about the United States. They could also serve to lighten the hair-trigger that separates a shaky peace from total war on the Korean Peninsula. Whatever happens, the truth is the U.S. has always put all the options on the table and North Korea knows it. North Korean soldier creepily takes pictures through the window of Sec.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",Shadowy Unmarked S-92 Superhawk Reemerges in Middle East Hotspot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A gray, unmarked S-92 Superhawk with military modifications, including what appears to be elaborate communications and self defensive suites, as well as a rescue hoist among other add-ons, was spotted last week in the northern Syrian border town of Kobani. Very similar, if not identical Superhawks were also spotted at America’s Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti roughly 20 months ago. It remains unclear who these aircraft belong to, and what exactly their purpose is. As detailed in my previous report , these aircraft could belong to a regional government, likely Saudi Arabia, although S-92s also fly for the governments of Turkey, Bahrain and Kuwait, but they have never been seen in this color scheme or configuration. The S-92s could also be used by the US State Department, CIA or another US agency. US Special Operations Command could also be contracting the helos for their unique needs, although they have plenty of other vertical-lift assets in the region at their disposal. Officially there are no S-92s flying operationally for the US Government today, but that doesn’t mean a contractor or shell company isn’t operating them on behalf of a US government agency. Eventually the S-92 will enter the Pentagon’s inventory in the form of the VH-92A —the helicopter that is slated to replace the VH-60N and VH-3D as Marine One . The location of the helicopter shown in the photo is also interesting, as just like Djibouti , there is a strong, and increasing US special operations presence in northern Syria . Kobani in particular was the site of fierce fighting in 2014 between ISIS and Kurdish fighters who, with the help of American air power , eventually routed the Islamic State from the town. Kobani was badly damaged in the fighting, but is now in the process of being rebuilt as many residents who ran from the fighting have begun to return home. A citizen-centric police force known as the Asayish patrol Kobani and many other towns in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region that makes up much of Northern Syria, also known as the “Rojava.” The men in uniform seen standing in front of the helicopter in the picture are likely members of this indigenous security force. Other mysterious S-92s have appeared elsewhere in the region, like this one that arrived in the Kurdish enclave of Erbil, Iraq, but not wearing the flat gray paint scheme and not as highly militarized as the one shown above or photographed on the Horn of Africa. We’ll just have to wait to see where these shadowy Superhawks pop up next or if more info as to their origin and mission finally comes to light. Update: 3/19/17 6:15pm PST- Fellow TWZ writer Joe Trevithick reminded me that this same helicopter, or at least one identical to it, was also spotted last fall at a forward operating base near Kobani.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 17, 2017",Israel Warns It Will Destroy Syria’s Air Defenses “Without Thinking Twice”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After six years of fighting, the chances that Israel may wade into the maelstrom that is the Syrian civil war is increasing after two more Israeli airstrikes rocked Syria over the weekend. One of the strikes was delivered Sunday via drone against a truck traveling between the Golan Heights and Damascus. One of the two people killed supposedly had close military ties to the Assad regime. The other strike came overnight and was rumored to have been aimed at another Hezbollah weapons convoy. These strikes follow an early Friday morning Israel air raid that targeted a Hezbollah weapons transfer in southern Syria. That mission resulted in Syrian surface-to-air missile batteries firing on Israeli jets. At least one Syrian SA-5 SAM was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow anti-ballistic missile system during the volley. The engagement was the first time the Arrow system has ever been used in combat. Now, Israel’s Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has clearly warned Syria of what will come if another missile is fired at an IAF jet, stating : “The next time the Syrians use their air defense systems against our airplanes, we will destroy all of them without thinking twice.” This stern warning comes as the region is bracing for a possible expansion of the already sprawling, convoluted and border-hopping Syrian civil war. In the last three days, Israel has targeted two shipments of advanced weapons supposedly destined for Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. In the past, Israel has made it very clear that they will interdict such shipments at will, and has done so many times in the last half decade or so, but until this Friday they did not openly admit their aircraft were flying strike missions over Syria to do so—although it was a commonly known fact. IAF KC-707s and F-15C/Ds, Oren Rozen/Wikicommons As we discussed on Friday , Assad’s air defense network remains largely intact, at least in the areas where the regime has held control over the last six years. Although it is made up mostly of dated Soviet-era systems, many of which are fixed or semi-fixed emplacements, some road-mobile units also exist, including the SA-6 and more advanced SA-11 systems . Shorter-range point defense Pantsir-S1 systems are among the most modern systems in Syrian hands. Although they are designed to defend the immediate area around high value installations or troop movements, they are especially focused on low-flying aircraft, drones and cruise missiles, and are capable of wide-area air defense. The truth is that Israel would have little problem dismantling Syria’s entrenched air defense network. In fact, much of the work could be done in the short-term with a combination of standoff and direct attack munitions. Israel has unique capabilities, both in the form of unmanned aircraft and missiles, to take on this exact mission set . Finding and targeting Syria’s road-mobile SAM systems will be more of a challenge, but if they emit RF energy they can be geolocated and destroyed. Israel has trained tirelessly at using both traditional and non-traditional suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) and destruction of enemy air defense (DEAD) tactics against such systems, and even if these systems don’t activate or pose an immediate threat to IAF aircraft, they can be found using traditional surveillance assets. Still, hunting them down and killing could take some time. IAF F-16Is are some of the IAF’s most potent deep strikers., DOD All this assumes that Israel would commit to all-out destruction of enemy air defenses campaign against Syria if IAF aircraft are again challenged in the air. What is more likely is the IAF would execute a limited, localized DEAD campaign in southwestern Syria, in which Assad’s fixed SAM sites and radars would be quickly knocked out and mobile systems would be attacked if they dared to activate. Even if a structured campaign weren’t launched, at the very least the IAF would include dedicated wild-weasel aircraft in strike packages to perform the defensive SEAD/DEAD role for strike aircraft that are called on to operate over Syria in the future. If these aircraft are targeted, IAF fighters could quickly kill the threat emitter and then lay waste to the entire SAM site and even nearby support sensors and communications nodes. The reason why a larger scale air campaign against Syria’s air defense network scattered throughout the country is unlikely is because Israel is already walking a tight rope with Russia. And Russia has far more capable air defense systems in the northwestern part of Syria. These advanced “triple digit” SAM systems can potentially target and engage IAF jets flying over Lebanon and southwestern Syria, and Russia’s reaction already very unpredictable if Israel goes directly after any of Assad’s military capabilities—including his air defense network. At least staying as far away as possible from Russia’s air defense systems in Tartus (S-300) and at their master airbase south of Latakia (S-400) , both of which protect Moscow’s more direct interests in Syria, would lessen the chances of a miscalculation or a massive international escalation in hostilities. Still, Russia could easily simply announce that they will engage any Israeli aircraft flying over Syria—a move that could set off a major international military standoff—and although Israel could take out both of Russia’s advanced SAM batteries it could mean going to war with Russia in doing so. The Gulfstream 550 based Eitam and Shavit are among the IAF’s most potent air warfare weapons that allow Israeli fighters to access enemy airspace at will. , Oren Rozen/Wikicommons The reality is that the IAF has the ability to go where it needs in Syria today using electronic warfare and cyber intrusion techniques. But without surprise on their side, and over time, the potency of those techniques degrades. Still, the idea that Assad’s old missiles are a major threat to IAF F-16s and F-15s is just not accurate. However, that doesn’t mean they don’t pose some potential hazard to IAF aircrews. Above all, today’s strong message to Assad is more about what Israel sees as the growing rise of Iranian influence in the region, and especially a reinvigorated, battle-hardened and much more heavily armed Hezbollah . The IDF is planning for a far more high-tech and bloody potential war Hezbollah in Lebanon in the future. Israel has warned the Lebanese government, which has been increasingly permissive towards Hezbollah , that they will not tolerate Hezbollah’s continuing rise in terms of both military capability and influence within Lebanon. And this is precisely where two wars could quickly merge into one. If an all-out conflict with Israel and Hezbollah were to ignite, it would range from western Syria to the Mediterranean. With Russia fighting alongside Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in Syria, and directly backing the Assad regime, and the US directly backing Israel as well as fighters opposed to both Assad and Hezbollah in Syria, what would start as two wars could rapidly coalesce into one. Not just that, but with so many other international players actively involved in Syria already on some level—Jordan, the Arab gulf states, multiple NATO members, Australia and the list goes on— and especially Turkey who is fighting on its own behalf—one can easily see how such a conflict could spiral into something far wider and darker in scope than it is today. IAF is planning for the worst if another war in Lebanon erupts., IAF Under normal circumstances, the US would do all it can to keep Israel out of any conflict involving a standing Arab coalition, and especially in one that could easy explode throughout the region. Under the current administration, it’s unclear if such a diplomatic overture will be made. If Israel were to start attacking Syrian military targets, it would complicate what is an already ridiculously complicated situation, and could see the current US-backed alliance fighting against ISIS disintegrate overnight. If a brutal war in Lebanon were to break out, it’s geopolitical shockwaves could be far worse. Israel’s relationship with the Arab world has changed significantly in recent years , and Sunni Arab gulf states are certainly no fans of Iran. But a war in Lebanon which could also stoke massive uprisings in the Gaza Strip and West Bank could tax that fledgling relationship to its breaking point. On the other hand, if the Arab gulf states actually sided with Israel, even if just in a tacit manner against Iran’s Hezbollah proxies and the Assad regime, it could lead to a war in Persian Gulf and would definitely deepen the proxy conflict between Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen . You are probably rolling your eyes right now trying to keep track of all these threads, but that’s the point—the Syrian conflict game tree is already ridiculously complex and extremely volatile, but it gets exponentially much more so when Israel is thrown into the mix. Bottom line—Israel’s direct involvement in the Syrian conflict could be the flying ember that sets the region ablaze.

As the fight for Mosul enters its final and likely bloodiest stage , coalition airpower is stacked high above the city delivering precision air support. The hardest hitting weapon in the coalition’s forward-deployed arsenal is the B-52H Stratofortress, which, like the B-1Bs before them , have provided a massive weapons magazine in the sky that can orbit for hours on end and provide precision attacks as well as limited surveillance. B-52H lugging a quartet of BLU-118s with GBU-31 JSAM kits., USAF We have seen “BUFFs” lugging deep penetrating 2,000-pound BLU-118 munitions with GPS guided GBU-31 JDAM tail kits attached to Iraqi in recent months. Obviously, ISIS does not have the ability to build high-end hardened bunkers or other elaborate fortified structures, but they do commandeer large and robust existing buildings, including bunkers and high-rises, and are known to build complex tunnel networks. These weapons are adept at taking down these types of targets. The deep-penetrating BLU-118 munition, when paired with proper fusing, can also have unique blast effects against soft targets, in some cases limiting damage to nearby structures and bystanders. With all this in mind, you can see why these are very likely the weapons dropped from a B-52H in the video below. The building targeted is violently but surgically destroyed via multiple deep-burrowing, highly precise JDAM strikes : The building seen struck in the FLIR video was the Ashur Hotel—supposedly once one of Mosul’s largest and nicest hotels—that is before ISIS converted it into a private citadel. It was right along the leading edge of the battle lines on March 10th when it was struck. Four days later the area was declared under Iraqi security forces control. But even now, some ten days after it was destroyed, it is just behind the forward edge of the fighting. The area around the Ashur Hotel on Mosul’s west bank., Google Maps The images coming out of Mosul are stunning. The city looks totally destroyed after years of ISIS occupation, coalition airstrikes and street battles. Now add the Ashur Hotel to the list of buildings in Mosul that will never be habitable again, although it was necessary work that few airplanes aside from the B-52 could handle alone.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2019",Is This Russian “Forever President” Vladimir Putin’s Yacht?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is no doubt about it: For better or worse, Vladimir Putin has been on one hell of a roll. Since the conclusion of the 2014 Winter Olympics, the man has seized territory thought impossible to seize, consolidated power in the Middle East, injected doubt into America’s democratic process, caused near hysteria on Capital Hill, and seen solidarity among NATO and the European Union begin to fray. So what does a judo gi-wearing “forever president” at the controls of the world’s largest nuclear arsenal do to relax beyond riding shirtless on powerful steeds and hitting the weight room with his number two man? Perhaps it includes taking a spin on the 269-foot super yacht named Graceful . It is no secret that while Vladimir Putin may fancy himself a state employee, he is one of if not the richest man in the world —and he clearly has a penchant for the finer things. One of those things appears to be a unique super yacht with a rather opaque existence. Although details surrounding Graceful’s genesis remain sketchy, we do know some facts about the vessel. Officially launched in 2013, Graceful displaces 2,500 tons, has a steel hull with an aluminum superstructure, features a bulbous bow , and is powered by a pair of 3,100-horsepower diesel engines that push twin screws. Supposedly, she can sleep 14 guests in six rooms, including one large owners suite, two VIP staterooms, and another three guest cabins. The ship is designed to accept a crew complement of 24. The yacht has few uncovered or non-concealed areas, with a comparatively large flight deck for her size. Supposedly, her most unusual luxury is a 50-by-10-foot indoor pool that can be converted into a dance floor ( see renderings here ). Although Graceful stands out for her size and beauty, there has been much speculation that another yacht was was gifted to Putin by Russian oligarch and super yacht aficionado Roman Abramovich . The businessman owns the world’s second largest super yacht, the massive Eclipse , among a fleet of other yachts and exploration vessels. And Russia’s wealthiest citizens clearly have a flare for the nautical. For instance, take Andrey Melnichenko and his other-worldly tumblehome hull design super yacht A , or Alisher Usmanov’s imposing Dilbar — the world’s largest yacht by gross tonnage — or Andrei Skoch’s rakish Madame Gu . In fact, Russia’s wealthiest have largely shaped the yacht industry for the last two decades. So it is not reaching to think that the guy at the very top of the pyramid would have his own piece of sea-going pleasure. Putin and his family aboard his private yacht in more quaint times. Photo taken in 2002., Russian Federation/Wikicommons Beyond her basic stats, Graceful is interesting on a number of levels. First off, her owner officially remains anonymous. This is not unheard of by any means—but in the yachting world, and especially when it comes to those owned by Russian business kingpins, the level of anonymity surrounding Graceful is less than common. Second, although she was designed by H2 Yacht Design and outfitted by Blohm and Voss in Germany, she was constructed in Russia’s Sevmash shipyards on the White Sea, which is far better known for building nuclear submarines and oil derricks than super yachts. There has also been talk that the Graceful is captained by a Russian with an extensive naval background. Another interesting aspect of the ship’s short history is that it has spent a tremendous amount of time in Putin’s beloved Sochi—Russia’s resort town on the Black Sea. Sochi has hosted the Olympics and a slew of other high-profile international sporting events in recent years, and is the location of lavish properties directly associated with the Russian ruler, some of which have murkier origins than others . Although Sochi offers some of the best weather within Russia, it is not exactly what comes to mind as an ideal home base for the average billionaire’s super yacht…but it would be for Putin. The yacht ‘Graceful’ of Russian President Vladimir Putin is moored at the port of Sochi., Marcus Brandt/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images That’s not to say that Putin uses the vessel regularly, but as with other yacht owners, it is something to be enjoyed when applicable—and especially something that friends and business connections can be invited to use extensively. And really, the idea that there is a pink slip somewhere for the yacht with Vlad’s name on it is laughable. These assets, like so many others, are bought, transferred, held and transferred again across a web of nebulous shell companies and individuals that do not reflect their intended user. It’s also possible that the yacht is owned by another prominent Russian official, like Putin’s number two man Dmitry Medvedev—a guy who shares in the great luxuries that go along with running modern Russia. These include access to mansions, motorcades and of course, Russia’s fleet of dedicated VVIP jets and helicopters—Medvedev likes to use the new AW139 while Putin still prefers the Mi-8 . Beyond these peculiarities, there is nothing but persistent rumors that the ship belongs to Russia’s ruler. And although there has been no concrete evidence that seems to make such a conclusion irrefutable—and there likely never will—it also has not been unproven even years after Graceful hit the seas. And hey, we all know Vladimir loves the ocean. He has even dived deep below it in submersibles on multiple occasions, not to mention having a unique connection with marine life . In addition, for a President, he sure gets photographed on a lot of yachts . So maybe even if it’s just going on a little quiet spin around the Black Sea for a weekend, Graceful could very well give the Russian strongman a moment of tranquility in what has become a very turbulent geopolitical sea.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. US-backed Syrian fighters and US special operations personnel, along with a cadre of Marines, have been deployed to the al Tabqa Dam, also known as the Euphrates Dam, located roughly 25 miles west of ISIS’s self-proclaimed capital of al Raqqa. The dam and the nearby town that shares its name are placed along two highly strategic routes that if left unsecured could give ISIS militants an escape route out of al Raqqa once the offensive to take back the city officially begins. The surprise deployment to the dam was said to have been largely made possible via US airlift capabilities and fire support. Although the number of troops involved in the operation remains unconfirmed, multiple reports put it around 500. The dam provides electricity to the region, making it an especially high-value asset, and the BBC reports that a military airbase and a detention center holding prisoners of ISIS are also nearby. The airfield in particular could provide a valuable hub of operations for aircraft and command and control assets, not to mention a firebase, if it were to be secured by US-backed forces. Top: The Euphrates Dam during construction in 1973. Bottom: Map showing relation of Euphrates Dam to al Raqqa. , AP top images. Google Earth satellite image. Blocking the western approaches to al Raqqa may block fleeing ISIS fighters, but it also could work to block Syrian, Russian and Hezbollah troops from approaching the Islamic State stronghold. The US has executed a similar strategy to the north in Manbij , a move that has resulted in US and Russian troops staring each other down at a distance, while Turkey has said a military operation to route Kurdish fighters from the city is on the table. To call the town that is held by US and Syrian Democratic Forces—which are made up primarily of Kurdish fighters—a potential international flashpoint would be an understatement. US special operations forces in Manbij., AP This latest action comes after the Trump administration enacted a major uptick in US military operations in Syria, including deepening US troop commitments as well as the introduction of regular forces in the form of a USMC fire support base into the conflict. It also comes as airstrikes in and around al Raqqa have ramped up markedly in recent days. US special operators in the country have also been allowed to move far closer to the front lines than they had been allowed to in the past. Many more US troops could also be on their way to Syria as the force structure to support the fight for al Raqqa continues to coalesce. Some see these moves as long overdue pointed actions that are required to deliver a final blow to the Islamic State. Others see them as an ominous sign of mission creep in what is an incredibly complex and bloody conflict that has become defined as much by its external influences as anything else. Meantime, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is leading a gathering of some 68 countries in Washington who have come together to discuss reforming a strategy to eliminate ISIS. It is the biggest gathering of its kind since the US waded into the fight against the Islamic State years ago. In early 2016, the Obama administration executed a similar meeting of the minds regarding ISIS , the results of which were underwhelming. Tillerson stated during the summit that the US is committed to setting up “interim zones of stability” in Syria for refugees returning home. Exactly how, where or when such a concept would be enacted remains unclear. If the US intends to lead such an operation it could mark yet another massive increase in US involvement in the conflict. Without Russian, Syrian and even Turkish cooperation, such a plan could also become another potential international flashpoint. Although the Turmp administration still says their anti-ISIS strategy is developing, we are starting to see a larger penchant for risk than the Obama administration was willing to assume during its time dealing with the ISIS and Syrian issues. Whether or not these gambles will pay off is another matter. On one hand this change in strategy could knock ISIS a massive blow, one that could deny the terror group from any major territorial claims in Syria or Iraq. Also, a more aggressive US strategy in Syria could “get it over with” so the US could leave and let the remaining factions battle out their own agendas. On the other hand it could draw the US not just into a bloody siege against ISIS, but into a complex and chaotic civil war that has elevated itself to an international level—a volatile and crude “game of thrones” that could leap borders and quickly spread to a much larger and higher stakes venue.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Lockheed to Move F-16 Production From Texas to South Carolina,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly a half-century of producing F-16s in Fort Worth, Texas, Lockheed Martin will move its production line to Greenville, South Carolina. The last of the Vipers built in Texas will be delivered to Iraq in September, after which the line will go dark for two years before being reconstituted in South Carolina. The move will make room at the Fort Worth plant for F-35 production, which has nearly 9,000 employees and will likely grow to over 10,000 by 2020, whereas the F-16 has just a few hundred. The plant hopes to build over 160 F-35s a year once F-35 production is in full swing. The Greenville production facility is also where the company’s T-X candidate, the T-50 , would be built. There is some commonality between the F-16 and T-50, which is derived from the KAI/Lockheed Golden Eagle, which itself was modeled after the F-16. The line for the F-16 in South Carolina will be fairly small, but it still means hundreds of new jobs for Greenville. Whereas union members build the F-16 in Texas, South Carolina is a right to work state, a reality that has pulled major aircraft manufactures to the state in recent decades. Dutch MoD The news is actually good for the F-16 program overall. Instead of being pressured to shutter the line as orders become small and less consistent, a smaller and more adaptable footprint in Greenville will allow the line to better survive slow production periods or even small gaps in production. Although there are smaller prospective customers in the Middle East and South America for the Viper, the only big potential sale that currently could give the F-16 an order in the hundreds of aircraft is from India which is re-launching its medium fighter bid to a certain degree. The F-16 lost the last tender to the Rafale after putting forward the specially equipped F-16IN variant. This new tender is for 200 single engine fighters, and the F-16 seems to be a very good fit. Still, in the past Lockheed said it would provide massive offsets for the order, including assembling the jets in India and even building key components in the country. Under a Trump administration, this type of job-zapping arrangement seems to be taboo, and endangering the cozy relationship between the White House and Lockheed , and especially the future of its banner F-35 product over an export order like this just doesn’t make sense. Above all else, keeping any sort of F-16 line warm in the US is a big strategic win for America whether the USAF wants to admit it or not. The F-16 is a known commodity and is a relatively efficient and still deadly machine, especially in its new Block 70 form which evolved out of the so-called F-16V . Depending on the USAF’s force mix of choice, it still could fulfill a whole range of missions for the USAF at a far lower price than its stealth stablemate, the F-35A. In life as in war, options are a good thing to have.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",USAF Looks To Retire The F-15C Eagle And Replace It With Upgraded F-16s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This startling news came during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on the current state of the U.S. Air Force. Chairman Joe Wilson asked right out of the gate about a previously unknown USAF plan to retire the F-15C/D Eagle fleet and replace them with F-16s. The subject of the question itself seemed to be big news to the committee with Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler later asking about what upgrades the F-15C/D was going to get so it could meet modern threats. Obviously the answer is not many if the Air Force is going to retire the jets in the relatively near term. Eventually the floor passed to Representative Martha McSally, an A-10 pilot herself and one of the most outspoken critics of the USAF’s failed and misleading plan to retire the A-10. McSally is by far one of the most credible voices when it comes to air combat on The Hill. She was shocked by the news and demanded further information about the plan. Watch the Chairman’s initial question at the 34 minute mark, Harzler’s follow up at the 55:20 minute mark, and most importantly, McSally’s exchange with the generals at the 1:06:30 mark: The summary of these exchanges is that the USAF is seriously considering axing the F-15C/D fleet entirely, if it’s not outright planning to do so already. The plan does not include the F-15E Strike Eagle. This is totally new as the “Golden Eagle” force of roughly 179 F-15C/D, as well as training aircraft, is slated to serve for decades to come and is in the process of receiving a series on extensive upgrades to see that it can do so credibly. Many of the jets have already received multi-million dollar APG-63V3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar sets, vastly increasing their capabilities. Currently, this is the most powerful and capable fighter-borne air-to-air radar in the world. In the F-15C/D’s place, the USAF wants to put upgraded F-16C/Ds sporting their own, smaller AESA radars. The generals at the hearing stated that the plan is a tough choice that would lead to fewer types of aircraft to support overall, thus freeing up funds for other priorities. The service could make the final decision as early as this year for the 2018 fiscal year budget, or more likely it could inserted the plans into the next budget cycle. When grilled by McSally about where the USAF is exactly in this so far secret decision making process, the panel replied that the matter is still “pre-decisional.” It sure sounded otherwise. This news impacts a whole slew of critical issues and is clearly reminiscent of the A-10 retirement saga of the last half decade. It is true that many of America’s F-16s are in need of a major avionics, structural and radar upgrades. The USAF has deferred these to help fund the F-35 program. You can read all about this issue here . The question of whether or not to upgrade the USAF’s F-16s never had anything to do sacrificing the F-15C/D community in the process. The vast majority of the Eagles are tasked with both overseas contingency operations and for protecting America’s airspace at five operating locations that ring the US coastline. In addition, the move would throw out much of the work that already been done or is underway on upgrading the F-15C/Ds, as well as efforts building tactics and unique capabilities that will allow the Eagle to become a force multiplier for F-22s and even F-35s. There is also the question of the dwindling size of the USAF’s tactical fighter fleet, which has dropped down to just 55 squadrons—a shadow of its pre-Operation Iraqi Freedom self. The force is already incredibly strained and the USAF F-15C/D community has been essential in providing a deterrent force along Russia’s border with Europe under Operation Atlantic Resolve. Eagles stand alert along America’s ocean borders. Their APG-63V3 AESA radars are extremely capable and hugely improve the jet’s ability to target low-flying cruise missiles., Tyler Rogoway (author) Finally, with only 187 F-22 Raptors ever built, and just roughly 125 combat coded at any given time, the retirement of the F-15C/D will mean America’s air superiority-focused fighter force will become more or less a niche capability. Although some have hoped that the F-22 could go back into production , and supposedly the USAF was undergoing a study of the feasibility of doing just that, it is highly doubtful this would actually happen. This is not so much due to the logistical or financial hurdles involved, but because it would threaten the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. In the end, all USAF fighter dollars seem to get pulled into the stealthy fighter’s budgetary black hole. We’ll save the analysis for later, but clearly today’s news will send ripples through the USAF, especially among units flying the F-15C/D today. In all, the Oregon Air National Guard stands to lose the most if such a plan were enacted, as they not only have the 142nd Fighter Wing, which flies the F-15C/D out of Portland International Airport, but America’s only F-15C/D schoolhouse, situated in Klamath Falls, Oregon. There the 173rd Fighter Wing’s primary mission is to train new Eagle Drivers. The retirement of the F-15C/D would likely see the end of the base’s pilot training mission. Kadena Air Base in Japan also has two F-15C/D squadrons, but both would likely be re-equipped with new aircraft in the process. The 173rd FW is the USAF sole F-15C/D schoolhouse. , USAF We’ll be back soon with further insight and analysis, as well as reactions from key players in Washington regarding this news.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 20, 2017",Suicide Drones Have Migrated To The Conflict In Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has been smuggling suicidal drones, similar to models developed by Israel, to Houthi rebels in Yemen. The drones are outfitted for attacks on UAE and Saudi Patriot missile batteries. The news comes via examination of seven Qasef-1 drones that were interdicted or captured in Yemen. Iran runs a fairly elaborate smuggling operation that furnishes weapons and other material to Houthi rebels in western Yemen. According to a report by Conflict Armament Research , six of the drones were captured last October along a known smuggling route that runs through Oman. Another was recovered following a February attack by Houthi rebels on government forces in central Yemen. The design shown is very similar in configuration to Iran’s Ababil series of drones, and the serial numbers found on the drones’ internal components are also evidence of its Persian origin. These drones can be outfitted with a rudimentary optical payload for surveillance or they can be configured to go after enemy air defenses in a similar manner as Israel’s Harpy drone system . This can include adding a radio frequency homing seeker or even just a GPS autopilot that can fly the drone to a known radar emitter location. When it arrives at that location, the explosives packed inside would detonate. According to the report, all the drones that were seized or recovered appear to be configured for attacks on air defense systems. Conflict Armament Research The use of robotic weapons by Houthi rebels is not new. A successful attack on a Saudi frigate was performed by a remote controlled boat —which also had Iranian origins. In fact, Iran has developed drones specifically for such a purpose. What’s most interesting about this development is that these weapons are strategic in purpose, bringing a very low-end suppression of enemy air defenses capability to the Houthi rebels’ arsenal. Obviously the Houthi have no airplanes, so why would Iran smuggle these types of weapons to them? The answer is clear—because Houthi rebels do have ballistic missiles and rockets, some of which are capable of reaching as far as Riyadh. Iran is also believed to be supplying missile components and expertise to Houthi rebels. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YfsV6C4W8b4 Saudi and UAE MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries are designed to swat the same types of ballistic missiles Houthi rebels are firing out of sky, and they have done so successfully in the past. Saudi Patriot batteries have been especially active near the Saudi-Yemeni border since the conflict erupted two years ago . Fielding Qasef-1 drones to the Houthis is a classic asymmetric play by Tehran that aims to take the fight, even if just to a small degree, to Saudi and UAE Patriot units, while also attempting to open up windows for their ballistic missile barrages. Whether deploying these drones against the Patriot system has actually worked or not is unknown—we don’t even know how many of these things have made it into Houthi rebels hands or have been used—but even a drone that costs a few thousand dollars sucking up multi-million dollar Patriot missiles could be considered a relative win. On the other hand, striking a Patriot’s expensive phased array radar with one would be a major victory. In fact, just creating any sort of threat at all to these high-end SAM systems may be considered as a worthwhile endeavor by Tehran. The Patriot’s phased array radar is the heart of the system and is considered a high-value, low-density asset. , Boevaya mashina/wikicommons Last week, many tech websites ran with a story about how crazy and ironic it is that an American ally used a multi-million dollar Patriot missile to take down a small drone. That commentary was naive on multiple levels—just ask Israel who has fired hundreds of $50,000 Tamir interceptors at $200 rockets launched by Hamas, has used Python air-to-air missiles to shoot down Hezbollah and Hamas drones , and was likely the same nation that used the Patriot to down the small drone talked about in the story. In fact, Israel has used the Patriot system against small drones many times before with inconsistent results . Regardless, the story came from General David Perkins talk at this year’s AUSA symposium. During his speech he stated: “That quadcopter that cost 200 bucks from Amazon.com did not stand a chance against a Patriot…Now, that worked, they got it, OK, and we love Patriot missiles… I’m not sure that’s a good economic exchange ratio…In fact, if I’m the enemy, I’m thinking, ‘Hey, I’m just gonna get on eBay and buy as many of these $300 quadcopters as I can and expend all the Patriot missiles out there’.” You can see this part of his presentation here at the 14:50 minute mark: Shooting down a few hundred dollar drone with a multi-million dollar Patriot missile may seem like a lousy disparity in exchange cost— and it is— but without a better solution readily available , using surface-to-air missiles against small drones is not illogical. Especially considering even the cheapest remote controlled drones are actively being weaponized by terrorist groups such as ISIS . On top of that, if anyone knows that small drones can be made deadly, and can even seek and destroy hugely expensive air defense radars, it’s Israel. They pioneered the idea, and others have since followed, including Iran. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are fully aware of all this, so it is understandable why they too would attempt to protect their airspace, or that of their Yemen allies, even from a diminutive drone like the Qasef-1. For now these Iranian drones may only threaten surface-to-air missile systems and other radar arrays, but that doesn’t mean that Iran won’t start sending ones with optical payloads next, or that Qasef-1’s GPS can’t be programmed to hit other fixed targets. When an optical payload is paired with onboard explosives, such a capability can be used against targets of opportunity, including boats, vehicles and exposed personnel. Just like the anti-ship missiles and anti-ship drones Houthi rebels have used in recent months, the idea that a non-state actor has their hands on this type of weaponry is quite troublesome, and it could go from being used against combatants in a brutal civil war to being used as a weapon of terror in a blink of the eye. If anything else, the arrival of the Qaser-1 drone in Yemen is another reminder of how small unmanned aircraft are changing the nature of warfare, and are slowly beginning to degrade the effectiveness of much higher-end and more expensive capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 10, 2017",Florida’s Full Court Press to Bring a Supercarrier Back to Mayport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been a decade since a US Navy supercarrier called Naval Station Mayport home. With the retirement of the conventionally-fueled USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67), the base was left partially vacant as it did not have the facilities to support a nuclear-powered carrier over the long term. Now, Florida’s entire congressional delegation to Washington is joining forces in an attempt to make Mayport a supercarrier base once again. Mayport has long been seen as a strategic offset to the Navy’s master naval base in Norfolk, Virginia , where all of its East Coast supercarrier fleet is currently based. The fear is that a single attack or natural disaster could see not just a large portion of America’s carrier inventory destroyed, but also the only facility on the east coast that can support them. Currently, five of America’s ten supercarriers are based in Norfolk, with two more being constructed nearby. Modern supercarriers take many years to build and don’t come cheap. They are the most expensive single weapon system in the world, with the new USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-79) costing a whopping $13 billion—and that’s not including research and development expenditures. In other words, they’re not something that can be easily replaced and are very much considered a low density, high-value military asset. Naval Station Mayport seen in the early 1990s with the USS Saratoga and USS Constellation pier-side. , USN The idea that the Navy has invited too much risk by over-centralizing its east coast carrier fleet is nothing new. Shortly after the “Big John’s” retirement in 2007, studies like the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, defense secretaries and other force posture influencers have called for upgrading Mayport to support a nuclear-powered supercarrier, but the funds have never materialized. The naval station and the colocated air station have remained active, with four destroyers, four cruisers, two Littoral Combat Ships, three coastal patrol vessels, an amphibious transport dock, a dock landing ship, and the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima based there. A Medium Endurance Coast Guard Cutter and smaller auxiliary vessels also reside at the base. But bringing back an aircraft carrier to the naval station would not only be a huge boost to the local economy, but it would also provide strategic hedge. With all this in mind, Senators Rubio and Nelson spearheaded the movement to get all of Florida’s representatives banned together to send a collective letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Acting Secretary of the Navy Sean Stackley arguing for the necessary improvements to the naval base to accept a nuclear carrier as part of the 2018 budget. You can see the letter below: https://www.rubio.senate.gov There is a clear logic behind spreading out America’s most prized warfighting assets a bit more than they currently are, and considering the massive investment in these ships to begin with, the cost of upgrading an already largely outfitted facility and operational facility would be a small price to pay for the strategic benefits. The total cost to do so was estimated by the Navy as $540 million, but the GAO says it will cost far less, coming in at between $258 and $356 million depending on a range of factors. That is roughly the cost of between two and three F-35C Joint Strike Fighters. The west coast has two major carrier bases—San Diego and Bremerton—another supercarrier is forward-based in Japan. Providing the ability disperse supercarriers in a similar fashion on the east coast carrier should be a priority for the Navy, not an afterthought. From time to time all of the east coast’s carrier fleet is docked at Norfolk at the same time., US Navy Considering President Trump wants a 12 carrier force—an 11 carrier force is currently stipulated by congress but only ten ships are active due to the early retirement of the USS Enterprise —there may be even more supercarriers to spread around in the future. A lot of this also comes back to the Navy’s insistence on building only supercarriers instead of a mix of smaller carriers and supercarriers. These smaller carriers could be designed as nuclear or conventionally powered vessels , and they could allow for more flexible basing and less rigid deployment and maintenance schedules. The “Big John” at rest in its berth at Mayport prior to its retirement., AP It is somewhat upsetting that the Navy has not already moved ahead with making Mayport capable of housing a supercarrier once again, but it is also not that surprising. The Navy brass is far more obsessed with buying new toys than taking the proper steps to make sure the ones it already has are based in a resilient manner. Hopefully Secretary of Defense Mattis will agree with the congressional delegation’s arguments and Mayport will be the home of a supercarrier once again in the not so distant future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 27, 2017",Syria Says It Will Rain Scud Missiles On Israel If Airstrikes Don’t Stop,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Multiple outlets are reporting that Russia has delivered a message to the Israel government on behalf of Syria’s Assad regime stating that any more Israel Air Force strikes into Syrian territory will be answered with a barrage of Scud missiles. In particular, it describes what will be targeted and why. If a Israel air strike hits civilian infrastructure, Syria will launch missiles aimed at Israel’s port in Haifa as well as its nearby petrochemical plant. If strikes hit Syrian military-related targets, the Scud missiles will be targeted at Israel Defense Force bases. The message brings a whole new level of potential escalation to what have been brewing tensions between Damascus and Jerusalem. It started on March 17th when Israeli warplanes were fired upon by Syrian surface-to-air missile sites after executing an air strike in southern Syria. The IAF had made dozens of similar bombing runs over the last five years, focused on taking out weapons shipments destined for Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. The Syrian SAMs missed their targets but one was intercepted by an Israel Arrow anti-ballistic missile system battery—a system that is designed to take out ballistic missiles like the Scud, not a Soviet-era SA-5 SAM. USAF A few days later, after the Assad regime made it clear that any IAF jets that make forays into Syrian airspace will be engaged, the head of the Israel’s Ministry of Defense made it clear that the IAF would “destroy Syria’s air defenses without thinking twice” if their jets were fired upon. Meanwhile, Russia summoned Israel’s ambassador, which sent rumors flying that Moscow had told Israel that it will no longer allow the strikes in Syrian territory to occur—a move that has been hinted at for many months . Following these reports, Benjamin Netanyahu stated “it’s simply incorrect to say the Russians are changing their policy toward us,” although what exactly is going on behind closed doors remains a mystery. Over the last week, Israel has only ramped up its strikes in Syria, with multiple missions being carried out including the assassination of a militant leader with close ties to the Assad regime. Since the Syrian civil war began six years ago, Israeli air strikes in Syrian territory were far less frequent, and the Israeli government did not officially even admit that they had been occurring until Syria fired on the IAF’s jets nearly two weeks ago. As far as Syria’s ability to carry out such a counterstrike against Israeli targets—there is no doubt that the Assad regime still retains hundreds of Scud derivatives of various origins. These include copies from North Korea and from Iran. Since the conflict in Syria began, Assad’s forces have used Scuds against their own people on numerous occasions. Israel has an extremely capable anti-ballistic missile defense system that has a multitude of layers aimed at countering everything from small improvised artillery rockets to medium-range ballistic missiles. Still, a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles from Syria, even if they are all intercepted or fail to hit their targets, would result in a major IAF operation to route Assad’s ballistic missile capabilities, and could even include the targeting of Syrian command and control or regime targets as well. If Israel were to react to such a missile attack with a prolonged air campaign of their own over Syria’s already crowded skies, Iranian-controlled Hezbollah could be ordered to retaliate against Israel with scores of its own rockets and other advanced weaponry it has obtained from Iran in recent years. By all accounts, a war between Hezbollah and Israel will be far bloodier this time around than a decade ago, a grim reality Israel is actively planning for. It doesn’t take much creativity to see how such a course of action could spiral the already highly convoluted Syrian conflict into a much wider war. Russia’s air defense systems at Tartus and at Russia’s master airbase south of Latakia could prove to a be a major tactical and geopolitical hazard for Israel should Russia officially deny Israeli movement through the area. The US, with its very close ties to Israel, would also be put in a tight spot as the Pentagon wishes to solely focus on the campaign against ISIS, not be drawn into a larger geopolitical affair with Russia and the Assad regime. The Israeli government has been clear that it has no intentions of stopping its airstrikes on weapons shipments headed for Hezbollah. As such, the Assad regime’s latest threat will likely be put to the test in the coming days.

The video below shows a Spanish Navy AV-8B Harrier pilot flying off Spain’s sole aircraft carrier, the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I (L61) , for a low-level training sortie over the countryside. The headcam perspective, high definition and quick frame-rate of the video makes you feel as if you are right there in the cockpit with the pilot as he sweeps in between windmills, and flies low and fast over the lush landscape. At the end of the exhilarating video, the pilot and a flight of Harriers make a vertical recovery back aboard the ship. You can click on the youtube logo at the bottom of the player to get the full HD and high frame rate capability out of the video. Here is another awesome perspective on a nearly identical mission , and you can also see the Juan Carlos tower perspective of a Harrier recovery operation here . The AV-8B Harrier is more versatile than ever before, and Spain’s AV-8B+ jets are some of the most advanced in the world. Originally Spain looked to replace their Harriers with the F-35B , but this plan was deferred in 2014 due to financial constraints and developmental issues with the F-35. As a result, Spain’s 13 Harriers are slated to stay in inventory through 2024, getting some upgrades along that timeline. Now Spain has reengaged in talks to procure the F-35 once again . Outside of trying to extend the life of its Harriers farther, if that is possible, or obtaining surplus aircraft from USMC stocks , the Spanish Navy will need an aircraft to operate from Juan Carlos when the AV-8B is finally put out to pasture, and the F-35B is the only new aircraft available that can fill that role. What remains unclear is what modifications would be needed to be made to the Juan Carlos’s deck and other systems to accommodate the F-35B. Recent history has proven that ships that were even built with the F-35B in mind have required extensive modifications to handle the thermal loads and blast put out by the F-35B, not to mention additions of tactical systems needed to leverage the F-35’s unique sensor capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",This Is Russia’s Warship Built Specifically For Arctic Fighting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Much has been made about America’s so-called “icebreaker gap” —Russia has roughly 40 with many more in production while the US has one that is operational —and we have talked extensively about how the frigid arctic is likely to be a contested territory and battlefield of the future . But Russia isn’t just building more icebreakers or ice-capable logistics ships—they are also building fighting ships that can go independently where few other surface combatant can, and carry much heavier firepower while doing so. Russia has ordered two of the 6,800 ton displacement, 374 foot-long Project 23550 Ice class patrol ships, which are more like polar Corvettes than anything else. Russia’s Ministry of Defense claims the ships will have the fighting capabilities of a Navy surface combatant, as well as those of an ice breaker and tug, and that there are “no analogues in the world” for the unique concept. Pella Shipyard Russia Supposedly, these ships will sport reenforced hulls that will allow them to break through ice up to five feet thick. Armament will include a medium caliber deck gun and two payload bays on the ship’s stern capable of carrying containerized missile systems such as Club-K and Kalibr-NK cruise missiles. The ships also feature a flight deck and hangar for a Ka-27 anti-submarine or utility helicopter. The ship can quickly deploy small boats, too. Other armaments may also be included, such as anti-air point defense system and small defensive arms. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qyrg9AnMM1c https://youtube.com/watch?v=IIwz9wdZ2_s The ships are being built by Russia’s Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg and will supposedly enter into service in 2020. The vessels are being built as part of a larger naval procurement strategy that will help fortify Moscow’s designs on the Arctic region. This strategy includes Russia’s new Project 21900 icebreakers and planned Project 22600 diesel electric and 2220 nuclear powered icebreakers , as well as Project 03182 multi-purpose tanker and Project 20180 armament support and logistics ships. One of five Project 21900 icebreakers that have come on line since 2008. Russia is building a whole armada for arctic operations., Tuomas Romu/Wikicommons The truth is that Russia’s Ice class patrol vessels do have peer competitors that accomplish similar missions: Most notably the ice-capable Svalbard operated by the Norwegian Coast Guard —the same design that Canada’s upcoming Harry DeWolf class —and even the smaller Knud Rasmussen class that belongs to the Denmark. But where Project 22550 ships differ is that they are capable of carrying heavy missiles that can strike targets hundreds of miles away, whereas these other ships are used more for localized security and ice navigation missions. The Norwegian Coast Guard’s Svalbard , Marcusroos/wikicommons The inclusion of long-range anti-ship and land attack missile capability in the Ice class design is intriguing. Considering that even the most powerful ships are slow-moving sitting ducks in many parts of the Arctic operating environment, and that bases in the region are small and highly localized in configuration, this makes both very susceptible to cruise missile attacks. With this in mind, Russia’s plug-and-play canister missile system is definitely a niche capability aimed at threatening any vessel or land station within its missiles’ reach. Targeting over very long ranges against fixed targets in the region is not as challenging an issue as doing so against moving vessels, but maritime patrol aircraft or even satellite surveillance could provide good enough targeting information to get an anti-ship missile into the general area of a target. At closer ranges, the Project 23550 own Ka-27 helicopter could provide real-time targeting telemetry against other vessels. But like everything in the Arctic, it just isn’t that simple. Changing sea ice and well-known navigational issues associated with the poles would make successful strikes on surface or land targets more challenging in certain aspects than when doing so in the the open ocean or other littoral environments. The USCG’s Polar class icebreakers are 40 years old and only one is actually serviceable with the other being used as a parts donor. , AP If anything else, Moscow’s Ice class patrol ships are just another reminder of the country’s designs on the Arctic and just how far the US is behind when it comes to fielding any sort of a credible counterforce. The USCG was hoping to build three new icebreakers for service in the coming decade. The Trump administration is making the first down payment in the form of $150 million on this $1 billion project in its current budget request. But more resources will likely be needed, as will hard diplomacy and coalition building to construct a capable allied Arctic force.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",USAF Aggressor F-16 Freshly Painted In “Shark” Scheme To Mimic Latest Russian Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 64th Aggressor Squadron, based out of Nellis Air Force Base, is one of only two USAF units that provide dedicated adversary support. The 64th aims to take the whole threat presentation mission to an extreme level. This doesn’t just include emulating potential adversaries’ tactics and procedures, as well as their weapons and aircraft capabilities, but also presenting front-line pilots with some of the same camouflage paint jobs they could see on enemy planes in battle. As a result, you would be hard pressed to find a more eclectic looking lineup of F-16s than on the 64th AGRS flightline. Now the unit has added a new paint job to its repertoire—one that reflects that being flown on some of Russia’s most advanced fighter aircraft. The so called “shark” scheme features a sky-blue bottom and a dark charcoal counter-shaded top, as well as red stars on the wings and a red “bort” number on its forward sides. It is nearly the same paint job as the ones currently applied to many of Russia’s top fighters, including the Su-34 , Su-35 , Su-30 and MiG-29K . The color combo is also worn by other Russian tactical jets as well, like the Su-25, not to mention some helicopters . The 64th AGRS’s newest paint scheme blasts out of Nellis AFB., Bruce Smith: www.flickr.com/photos/eor1/ The US Navy is already flying a very similar scheme on some of its aggressor aircraft, specifically the F/A-18A+s of VFC-12 “Omars.”  VFC-111 “Sundowners” have also added a similar scheme , although it is closer to that seen on one of Russia’s T-50 prototypes than the simpler “shark” scheme seen on Russian fleet aircraft. The Su-34 was among the first of Russia’s jets to wear the imposing “shark” scheme. , AP The 64th’s sister unit, the F-15C/D flying 65th Aggressor Squadron flew jets also painted in unique schemes. Before this “shark” paint job became popular, the unit introduced a “splinter” scheme very similar to those worn by early test examples of the Su-35 and T-50. The 65th was permanently shuttered in 2014 as a cost saving measure. For about a year after, the 65th’s last F-15s were temporarily integrated into the 64th, but today the full-time aggressor role within the USAF belongs to the F-16 alone. The now defunct 65th AGRS with their F-15C/Ds flew alongside their F-16 flying counterparts in some gorgeous color combos., USAF Still, the 64th has adopted some of the 65th’s most iconic looks on its Vipers, namely the “splinter” scheme mentioned above . It is all part of a an ongoing and evolving process that is supported by the 57th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Viper Maintenance Unit’s corrosion shop at Nellis AFB. Thhere the 64th AGRS colorful dreams come to life by dedicated craftsman who have a fairly unique job within the USAF. Russia’s most advanced operational fighter, the Su-35, has also worn the scheme, and these aircraft air being marketed for export abroad. , AP In a USAF article , Jeff Denzell of the 57th’s corrosion ship gave an idea of what goes into painting one of the 64th Aggressor’s Squadron’s unique Vipers: “On a standard F-16 like this, it’ll take us about a week to finish repainting it… It’s kind of cool because on a Monday the worst looking jet in the fleet will come to our shop and on Friday the best looking jet will go out. It’s rewarding from that point of view. It’s like making them brand new again… Every aircraft is supposed to be painted on a six-year cycle. When we’re not doing a full paint, we’re doing major touch-ups to an aircraft. An aircraft might require a new wing or stabilizer or a new piece added to it because the old one was bad. It may not generate the need for the whole aircraft to be repainted, but it may come in for about three days to have that particular component painted. So, there’s always an aircraft in here, they’re just not always being fully painted… So the owning unit decides what color they would like the aircraft to be painted based on their needs as well as how many of that particular paint scheme they might need. We have the Aggressors stationed here, and other than Eielson AFB, you wouldn’t see these paint schemes at any other base. We have paint schemes that they don’t even have up there. We designed the blizzard paint scheme here and it was coordinated into the technical data based on our original drawings and measurements.” The F-16 corrosion shop at Nellis refreshes one of the 64th AGRS elderly F-16s with a new aggressor paint job. , USAF In an article in Aerotechnews.com , Captain Ken Spiro, the chief intel officer for the 64th AGRS described how they come up with these threat paint jobs. Of interesting note is that the new “shark” scheme seen today has been in the works since at least August of 2016: “The paint scheme is a means of representing threats more accurately… There are real world threats that paint their jets in this way so we are changing over to make it more physically like their aircraft. Once a pilot who is training comes within visual range of the new Aggressor, they’ll be seeing a similar situation to what they would see with an actual threat aircraft… The idea started at the 64th AGRS because we’re always looking for different ways to be more threat representative, and make the training more realistic… The 64th AGRS gets creative in extra ways, such as paint schemes to accurately and better represent threats. We act like, look like, or anything you can think of we try so we can be true to the threats… We are working on a second ‘shark’ scheme because the 64th AGRS would like to see two threats eventually. That scheme is in the design stages right now and the preliminary designs have been sent over to Viper for their changes and approval.” The idea of US aggressors sporting the shark scheme adorned with red stars is maybe a little more controversial than other paint jobs that have come and gone in the past as US-Russian relations have hit an all time low, and the paint job is being flown on Russian jets in Syria today. But really, the fact that the 64th can jettison the political correctness to bring a richer threat representation to front-line fighter pilots underscores how big of a deal their job is, and it is more important now than ever. Fighter pilots have been known to get “buck fever” the first time they see an enemy aircraft in real life. This distraction can lead to mistakes being made and to slower reaction times right when brevity is needed most. The 64th gets pilots accustomed to this phenomenon in a synthetic manner, so that on the battlefield they will be able to overcome their natural tendencies. 414th CTS provided aggressor support at Nellis up until the 1991. The 64th AGRS would take over the mission. The 414th flew in a variety of paint schemes, but this “Fulcrum” style scheme was among the most striking., DoD This all fits into the larger picture of exercise Red Flag as well—an elaborate aerial war game that gives pilots their first ten combat missions (roughly speaking) without real missiles flying through the air. The Vietnam War proved that aircrews are especially vulnerable to being shot down or even worse, dying by making a dumb mistake over an unforgiving war zone, within their first ten missions. After that their odds of surviving go up dramatically. The 64th supports and helps direct Red Flag among other responsibilities, and making sure aircrews get as realistic experience as possible during Red Flag is the name of the game. Obviously resources are limited, maybe too much so as the 64th AGRS flies some of the oldest F-16s in the USAF, but for decades the presentation of accurate looking aggressor aircraft has been considered well worth the investment. In the end the idea is that if a fighter pilot ever sees the a Flanker wearing a strange paint scheme in real life they will have already “been there and done that” and can concentrate on what’s most important—making sure the other guy, who is probably not so lucky when it comes to training, dies first.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 20, 2017",Buzz Aldrin Blasts Off With The USAF Thunderbirds For A Record Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At 87 years old, famed astronaut Buzz Aldrin is still breaking barriers and having a damn good time doing it. The USAF Thunderbirds invited the icon for a ride in their F-16D while they starred in the Melbourne Air & Space Show over the weekend. Aldrin now holds the record of being the oldest person to ever fly with the USAF Flight Demonstration Team. Melbourne is located south of Cape Canaveral—where Buzz blasted off to the moon in a Saturn V rocket in 1969 as part of the pioneering Apollo 11 crew. Just a few years earlier he rocketed into orbit as part of Gemini 12 from a launchpad nearby. But before being one of the first humans to execute a spacewalk—and a long one at that—or the second human to step on the moon, Buzz was a USAF fighter pilot, flying 66 missions in F-86 Sabreas over Korea. He also bagged a couple of MiG-15s in the process. Buzzaldrin.com After Korea, Buzz went on to be an gunnery instructor at Nellis AFB and to fly F-100 Super Sabres in Germany before hitting the books for his doctorate. He entered MIT’s masters program in aeronautics, and extended his schooling so that he could receive a doctorate of science in aeronautics. His thesis was titled “ Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous.” The dedication on his thesis stated: “In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country’s present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!” NASA Obviously Buzz wanted to be part of the space race, but he had never been a test pilot. Still, his theoretical expertise on how to actually make complex spaceflight happen was undeniable and after applying twice, NASA gave him an astronaut slot. Buzz on the intricacies of docking with another spacecraft: “Flying a spacecraft is very different than flying a plane. There is no true up or down and the dynamics of orbital flight make maneuvering to dock, or rendezvous, two spaceships very complex. I focused my research on solving the problems of speed and centrifugal energy which lead to an ‘orbital paradox’ – a situation in which a pilot who speeds up to catch another craft in a higher orbit will end up in an even higher orbit, traveling at a slower speed and watching the second craft fly off into the distance.The solution to this paradox is counter intuitive, and required new orbital mechanics and procedures. Later, after joining the NASA astronaut corps, I spent time translating complex orbital mechanics into relatively simple flight plans for my colleagues – they thanked me (with a mixture of respect and sarcasm) with the nickname Dr. Rendezvous.” Buzz heading out on a space walk on his Gemini 12 mission., NASA Buzz has gone on to many other adventures following his career as an astronaut. He has dove in a tiny submersible to explore the wreckage of the Titanic , swum with sharks, was a model in NYC Fashion Week and was recently exploring the South Pole , among many other endeavors. He even was a used car salesman in Beverly Hills following his retirement—a grand adventure in itself. Above all else, Aldrin has been an incredibly outspoken and passionate advocate for a manned mission to Mars. Buzz Aldrin was programming computers nearly 60 years ago and has been no stranger to technology since. , NASA So basically if anyone deserves to be honored by the Thunderbirds, it’s this guy. The flight was not just some celebrity incentive ride, it featured a formation flight over nearby Kennedy Space Center, including Launchpad 39A where Apollo 11, with Aldrin onboard, headed to the moon nearly 50 years ago. Check out the awesome images below of the fight: USAF Thunderbirds Who knows what is going on with the “shuttle” over at the Shuttle Landing Facility?, USAF Thunderbirds USAF Thunderbirds USAF Thunderbirds USAF Thunderbirds USAF Thunderbirds USAF Thunderbirds You will notice the USAF Fighter Weapons School patch on Buzz’s left arm. After Korea he returned to Nellis AFB as a instructor at the Aircraft Gunnery School, which was an early progenitor of the elite USAF Fighter Weapons school that was established in 1965. , USAF Thunderbirds Upon landing, the crowd supposedly gave Buzz a massive round of applause. And rightfully so. The harsh reality is that our space faring legends are disappearing at an alarming rate. I have had to write two articles ( here and here ) in less than a year saying goodbye to two of these iconic explorers. That is why it’s so great to see Edwin Aldrin strapping on a Viper for a high-speed joyride over low his old stomping grounds. I mean they don’t call him “Buzz” for nothing.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Marines Want More Second-Hand F-5 Aggressors And A Light Attack Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USMC’s 11 F-5Ns and single F-5F just won’t do it anymore when it comes to providing fleet adversary support for dozens of Marine fast-jet squadrons. Now the Corps wants to procure more second-hand F-5s from around the globe to bolster its aggressor ranks, and to set up F-5 detachments at three other bases in addition to VMFT-401 “Snipers'” home base at MCAS Yuma in Arizona. In addition, the Marine Corps master aviation plan also calls for adding a light attack turboprop aircraft to its tactical training fleet, such as the AT-6C Coyote or A-29 Super Tucano. The Marine’s call for more adversary support capacity has been a long time coming—I have written extensively on the subject dating back many years . The introduction of the F-35 in particular will continue to grow adversary support demand based on cost concerns alone. The Joint Strike Fighter will cost at best a third more to operate than the majority of aircraft it replaces, and that number is likely going to be much larger in reality. Then there is the fact that training depletes airframe life, which is a given, but when the aircraft an F-35 is training against could just as easily be a F-5, it makes little sense to use another F-35, or a tired legacy Hornet for that matter. When the jet, in this case  the F-35B, costs $120 million and has a service life of 8,000 hours, $15,000 is being depreciated off the aircraft every hour it flies. USMC The Navy and the Pentagon have learned the hard way what a depleted tactical air force looks like, as all three services struggle with aging fighters that have had near-literally their wings flown off over a 16 years of perpetual warfare. Even the young F-22 fleet has largely been augmented by incorporating T-38 aggressors at a squadron level. This is not only to better challenge the F-22, which has a huge capacity for chewing through enemy targets, but it is also to save precious F-22 airframe life and save money on operating the expensive Raptors in the process. In essence, when a fast group of aerial targets is needed, using other F-22s to provide this has been deemed a waste. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6HDIKOtS9to Keeping this in mind, burning hours on advanced fighters in training where much less expensive aircraft could adequately fill the role may not just make sense, but it may be a fiscal necessity, too. The services are already struggling to afford to fly the fighter fleets they have , yet alone ones dominated by expensive 5th generation stealth fighters in the future. The USMC makes sums up its case for more F-5s, stating: The F-5 fleet consistently meets readiness goals while supporting as many MAGTF adversary commitments as possible based on limited structure. USMC adversary requirements have grown significantly over the past thirteen years of combat operations. Today, the adversary capacity gap is growing, with VMFAT-501 (F-35B FRS) requiring more than 1,500 per year and MAWTS-1 requiring more than 420 annually from VMFT-401. Some of the additional requirements that have increased adversary demands are: 1) FY10 MAWTS-1 reconstitutes Marine Division Tactics Course for the F/A-18 fleet 2) FY13 AV-8B training and readiness manual increases focus on additional air defense capabilities 3) FY15 Continued transition of legacy TACAIR to F-35 4) TBD VMFAT-502 (2nd F-35 FRS) stand-up at MCAS Beaufort USMC The Marines’ reasoning for wanting more F-5s makes sense. In recent years, the AV-8B+ in particular, with its relatively new AIM-120 AMRAAM capability, has put an extra strain on the USMC’s adversary support capabilities. Now with the F-35B standing up on a grand scale, and the establishment of a “graduate level” tactics course tailored to the legacy Hornet community, the demand for the F-5’s services has skyrocketed even higher. But the USMC’s justification does not clearly identify the aforementioned underlining issue that flying an F-35 against another F-35 for many air-to-air training tasks is a massive waste of money and airframe life, and it is likely unsustainable as a whole. The USMC aviation plan describes the F-5’s effectiveness and future: “The F-5 fleet is funded for life limited components of upper cockpit longerons, wings, horizontal stabilator pairs, and vertical stabilators that will enable the F-5 to achieve its 8,000 hour life. This extends the Department of the Navy’s 44 F-5airframes to 2025 and at least 12 aircraft to approximately 2028 in support of fleet training… The current configuration of the F-5 meets all MAGTF requirements except for F-35 and F/A-18. Upgrades to provide improved beyond visual range situational awareness, as well as passive weapon systems are being studied. Advanced electronic attack capabilities will continue to be fielded… Current USMC inventory is 12 F-5s assigned to VMFT-401 at MCAS Yuma. Based on the low cost per flight hour and ease of maintenance of the F-5, plans to expand the adversary capacity and capability while improving accessibility are being sought.” USMC The plan continues to lay out how the F-5s should be redistributed: “Further desired expansion of the F-5 program, to potentially include a permanent footprint at MCAS Beaufort in FY18, and conceptual plans for adversary elements at MCASs Miramar, Yuma, and Cherry Point are being explored. Efficiently colocating adversary support with the operational forces generates the most readiness for our operational forces at the least cost. Composite training squadrons beneath 4th MAW will also leverage on extensive TACAIR experience and contribute to enhanced Reserve integration across aviation… Procurement of numerous F-5s with significant service life remaining would allow the USMC to meet, with organic assets, most requirements for adversary training. The first phase of expanded adversary capacity will be to establish a detachment on the East Coast in support of VMFAT-501 at MCAS Beaufort, S.C. for F-35 pilot production requirements.” USMC In addition to wanting more F-5s spread across key locations, the USMC also wants to procure a light air support aircraft for training purposes. These aircraft could work not just in concert with an expanded F-5 adversary corps, but also for training Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTACS), airborne forward air controllers, and providing a basic airborne surveillance and fire support platform for other training purposes. This would all be part of a greater shift in tactical air training strategy called the Composite Training Squadron Concept. The report states: “USMC fixed wing adversary and fleet Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) and ForwardAir Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)) training requirements will persist, and likely grow. Headquarters Marine Corps Aviation is examining alternatives and solutions for these high demand/low density adversary and CAS training platforms.The Marine Corps composite training squadron concept could address those needs. This squadron, likely in 4th MAW, would provide low cost, regionally distributed adversary and light attack-capable fixed-wing airframes to support fleet aviation and TACP/FAC(A) production, while improving readiness across the MAGTF… Research is ongoing to examine low-cost turbo-propeller aircraft alternatives to employ alongside the F-5. Marine aviation is examining options to purchase and/or lease contractor-owned and maintained airframes that could be operated by USMC aviators from the composite training squadron and local flying units… An ordnance-employing light attack turbo prop airframe with variable communication and sensor suites would help support all air and ground terminal attack control training requirements. Procurement of additional F-5s with significant service life remaining along with leasing or procuring a light ordnance capable turbo prop could allow the USMC to meet, with a combination of organic assets and contracted solutions, most of the requirements for adversary training and appropriately augment close air support for TACP and FAC(A) training Procuring a light attack aircraft like the USAF’s A-29 Super Tucano or the AT-6C Coyote would bring a cost effective, organic, fixed-wing aerial training asset to the USMC that can do a lot of things for many different critical players in the force. It could also potentially lead to fielding a similar aircraft in a combat role, something the USMC has not had for decades, with th e OV-10 Bronco being the last platform with a similar mission. After flying the life out of their tactical fast-jet fleet, the USAF has finally come to the conclusion that it needs an aircraft like this, and the USMC may arguably have a greater need for it than any other service. Reading between the lines, fielding a light air support aircraft for USMC training could be a backdoor way of potentially introducing the concept back into the front-line force. As you can see below, it seems the USMC wants to roughly double its F-5 fleet, from 12 to 24, and then add an additional 24 light attack aircraft to go along with them at four key bases around the US. USMC All this is all good and well, but what’s missing is the contractor option. There is a growing list of adversary support companies that provide solutions for all these mission sets, including JTAC training, “red air” services, and the like. By using a contractor to expand its aerial training capacity instead of doing it organically could provide the USMC with a cheaper and more elastic solution. As the F-35 matures and hundreds of the 5th generation fighters fill the USMC’s ranks, outsourcing adversary support will be necessary anyways. On the other hand, the Marine’s F-5 fleet, with its private contractor support, is a cost effective supersonic-capable adversary. And adding a light air support aircraft to the USMC’s inventory could have positive “springboard” effects as we discussed earlier and it can work with the F-5s or alone to fulfill lower-end aggressor commitments. But still, a heavier reliance on contractor adversary support should be a part of the Marines’ master air plan going forward, especially since firms like the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) have already successfully  supplied thousands of hours of “red air” training for the USMC and US Navy. In other words, the model is well proven. The A-29 is a purpose-built light attack platform is already in limited service with the USAF., USAF Also clearly mentioned in the USMC’s master air plan is that the F-5 cannot provide all the USMC’s adversary support needs, and this is nothing new. Although the F-5 is dissimilar to existing USMC tactical fixed-wing aircraft, and remains a highly maneuverable and hard-to-spot foe, it can’t replicate 4th generation fighter threats adequately. Primarily, it lacks a capable radar system, and although some modular radar options exist for the jet, their range is limited due to the size of the array that can fit in the F-5N’s platypus nose. Also, it is not capable of maneuverability that reflects that of Flanker or Fulcrum performance, among other potential enemy aircraft. This role is provided by F/A-18s from the USMC, as well as NSAWC F-16s and fleet fighters from external services like the US Navy, and to a lesser degree, the USAF. Still, the F-5 has room for enhancement. In addition to a radar upgrade, the jets could make use of a helmet mounted display and a high-off boresight air-to-air missile. Many off the shelf solutions exist for this capability, including those from Israeli and European manufacturers. Additionally, Navy and USMC F-5Ns have already received an internal electronic warfare suite in recent years, with its emitters placed where the aircraft’s 20mm gun barrels once were. But this system is somewhat rudimentary and it could also be upgraded, or foreign jamming pods, like the Elta EL 8222 self-escort jammer , could be procured to better replicate a capable electronic warfare threat. Although these upgrades would not give the F-5 a full 4th generation fighter capability, combined with its small size, it would be one hell of an adversary. There is nothing to say that this 4th generation threat presentation requirement cannot be outsourced to the private sector. Draken International currently flies A-4K Skyhawks that pack a modified version of the APG-66 radar found on the F-16A/B. These aircraft have been put under contract by the USAF to support aggressor activities alongside the 64th Aggressor Squadron at Nellis AFB . Supposedly their performance has been quite appreciated.  Draken’s L159 fighter-trainers also pack the compact Selex Galileo “Grifo” pulse-doppler radar. But these aircraft do not possess the raw performance of a true 4th generation fighter. With this in mind, some adversary support providers are looking towards more modern aircraft, such as the F-16, to provide a robust, 9G-capable threat presentation to customer air forces. ATAC flies the supersonic F-21 Kfir, Hawker Hunter, and L-39 in support of NAVAIR training. , Tyler Rogoway/author In the end, no matter how the USMC acquires it, it is good news to hear they are looking to invest more heavily in fleet adversary support as well as opening up to procuring a light attack aircraft laden with advanced sensors and avionics, even if it’s just for training—at least for now. And who knows, the USMC’s hunt for more low-time F-5s may have already begun. The need for more adversary F-5s, and possibly extensive upgrades to go along with them, also serves as yet another reminder of how it is too bad Northrop’s ultimate F-5 evolution— the F-20 Tigershark —never made it into production, yet alone the aggressor fleet .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 17, 2017",Russia Reportedly Sending World’s Largest Submarine to the Baltic Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s gargantuan Typhoon class nuclear ballistic missile submarine, Dmitry Donskoy —the last of its kind—is reportedly slated to travel from its home on the White Sea around Norway and Denmark, and into the increasingly tense confines of the Baltic Sea this summer. Eventually, it will end up in St. Petersburg to take part in a high-profile Navy parade on July 30th. Also said to be dispatched for the display is Russia’s only active Kirov class battlecruiser , the Pyotr Velikiy . These these huge vessels represent Russia’s most feared and destructive naval relics of the late Cold War, and if this reported plan proves to be accurate, the world will closely watch their voyage deep into the heart of NATO’s “swimming pool.” The 574-foot-long Dmitry Donskoy is the last operational Typhoon class—indigenously known as the Akula class—boat in the Russian Navy’s inventory. It was the first of six similar vessels, all of which retain the mantle as the largest submarines ever built. The class was built to be the backbone of Soviet Union’s second-strike nuclear deterrent, carrying 20 massive R-39 “Rif” SLBMs with up to 200 warheads in total, for months-long patrols. It was the most deadly single weapon system Russia ever designed during the Cold War. The Typhoon class was made especially famous after its likeness was used as the experimental Red October in hit film Hunt For The Red October. Since then, the boat’s size and unique creature comforts have captured the imaginations of military and naval enthusiasts around the globe ( read all about it here ). Today the Dmitry Donskoy serves as a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) test boat, supporting the development of the Russian Navy’s accelerated strategic missile programs . This has included testing Russia’s current SLBM of choice, the RSM-56 Bulava missile that fills the launch tubes of Russia’s Borei class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Bellona Foundation/wikicommons The Baltic Sea is usually the playground of smaller attack submarines, namely of the diesel electric variety , not of huge ballistic missile carrying “boomers.” The body of water is very much a littoral environment, with an average depth of around 180 feet, which is hardly the environment for a Typhoon class submarine that displaces 48,000 tonnes while submerged and was built to literally find a place in the deep and remote ocean to hide for long periods of time. According to The Barents Observer even transiting into the region will be a tight squeeze for the Dmitry Donskoy : “For those who want to see, but can’t go to St. Petersburg, the vessel will have to sail at surface under the Great Belt bridge where vessels with a maximum draught of 15 meters can sail. According to Swedish Maritime Administration, the waters under the Öresund bridge or the Flint channel are too shallow. The draught of a Typhoon submarine is 12 meters.” But even if the huge submarine doesn’t have a tactical purpose in the Baltic Sea, its appearance there will send a very big reminder to the region and beyond of the heavy-hitting naval capabilities the Russian Navy retains. A Kirov class battlecruiser is also not especially well-suited for operating in such a environment, but its abilities do pose a threat to the region. HMS Dragon shadowing the Pyotr Velikiy , Royal Navy The ship was built to tear apart American carrier battle groups in the open ocean, but their missiles can be used against other targets as well, and  its long-range air defenses pose a credible challenge. But the fact is Russian long-range air defense assets , ballistic missiles, and even possibly land-based cruise missiles are already present in Kaliningrad , so although the Pyotr Velikiy does bring some new capabilities to the table in the region, Russia already has plenty of ways to turn on a no-fly-zone at a flick of a switch, and bombard NATO countries from nearly the inside-out if they actually wanted to do so. Not to mention the fact that a huge battlecruiser in a closed body of water is a big fat target itself. NormanEinstein/wikicommons Maybe above all else, the fact that multiple nuclear reactors (both vessels run on nuclear power) of Soviet vintage will be plodding through the region is likely to draw the most ire from Moscow’s European neighbors. We’ll have to wait and see if the Kremlin confirms the deployment, but considering the region already experiences nearly constant maritime war games , contentious aerial encounters , and even full-on public submarine hunts , it could end of being one hot summer on the Baltic Sea.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s deep inventory of land-based missiles can get a little confusing, especially in recent years as the Kremlin has turbocharged its strategic weapons development initiatives. Luckily the Center For Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Missile Threat Program has posted an ingenious graphic that gives us a snapshot of each Russian missile and its reach. The graphic goes from shorter-range tactical systems, to much longer-ranged strategic ones . The graphical map on the top left shows how far Russia’s tactical missiles based in Kaliningrad, and especially the highly modern Iskandar tactical ballistic missile, can reach out into greater Europe. The background map depicts the range for strategic missiles, but for the entire world. You can also access the graphic in high definition as well as a chart showing the ranges of a few additional Russian missiles here. Of unique interest is the inclusion of the SSC-8 nuclear-tipped land-attack cruise missile that was reported to have become operational recently—and in doing so shattering a previous arms control agreement between the US and Russia. CSIS estimates the cruise missile’s range at 1,242 miles, allowing it to reach into all of Alaska, the entire Persian Gulf, parts of France and parts of the UK.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Striking Assad in Retaliation for Gas Attack Is a Horrible Idea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The pictures are devastating, the accounts are even worse. The early morning aerial gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province, Syria, that killed 83 people and wounded over 150, has reverberated throughout the international community. Now, just a couple days after the Trump Administration seemed to turn away from the policy of regime change in Syria, the White House may be preparing to take military action against the Assad regime—which would be a first since the Syrian civil war began over six years ago. And although Assad is a miserable tyrant and war criminal, attacking him now is a terrible idea. Here’s why: It’s all about destroying ISIS. So far, the US has successfully kept at bay a direct conflict with Assad’s forces through careful geopolitical and military maneuvering. The height of complication, and peril, seemed to occur just over a month ago, when US Rangers were suddenly deployed into the northern Syrian city of Manbij. Located west of the Euphrates River, the town was being held by US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are made up primarily of Kurdish fighters—the same fighters that Turkey sees as a mortal foe. Turkish forces in Syria needed to travel through that city in order to move on to the ISIS capital of al Raqqa, which was at the time Ankara’s stated goal. In addition, it has long been Turkey’s other military goal as part of “Operation Euphrates Shield” to route Kurdish forces from positions west of the Euphrates River. On top of that, Assad’s forces, which are backed by Iranian-controlled Hezbollah fighters and the Russians, were also on the outskirts of the city. The three-way showdown looked like it could have become a huge bloodbath and international geopolitical powder keg. But in the end, a mix of the genius blocking maneuver by US Rangers and diplomacy won out, and not only has Turkey stopped their eastern advance, they also have ended direct military incursion into Syria all together. Meanwhile, Assad’s forces’ attention on the city, as well as elsewhere in the country, have allowed the US and its local allies to pull off yet another key blocking maneuver. US Ranger fly the flag atop their Stryker armored fighting vehicles in Manbij, Syria, AP The US leveraged its ability to vertically envelope an enemy area via helicopter assault, by striking south with its SDF troops, and seizing a key airfield and the al Tabqa dam just to the west of ISIS’s capital of al Raqqa. With indigenous troops and US Marine artillery already located north of the terror stronghold, this eastern location blocks the only other western approach to al Raqqa, and will likely be the scene of a major fire support and logistics hub as the operation to wipe ISIS from al Raqqa officially begins. It also largely blocks Assad’s forces from pushing east towards the ISIS stronghold. These advances have just come in recent weeks, but they are also the product of years of engagement in Syria by US and coalition forces. The ability to move about the country in the air at will has been a massive help for the operation. Throngs of drones , helicopters, transports , surveillance, and fighter aircraft have benefited from a tacit agreement with Assad that they will not be fired upon as long as they do not threaten his own forces—especially his air defenses and air combat capabilities. This has been the reality over Syria since the US first executed airstrikes in the country in September of 2014. Ospreys and other somewhat vulnerable transports fly over eastern Syria freely. , USAF Now, after these recent successes, and just as ISIS’s seat of power is in the coalition’s sights, the idea of attacking Assad and turning his air defenses against the coalition is just about as counterproductive as it gets. And doing so would come with extreme geopolitical peril. First, you don’t just “knock out Assad’s air force.” This is a poor description of the air campaign that will be needed to truly neuter his aerial war fighting abilities, and even then Russia could just resupply him with deadlier equipment. It’s true that cratering Assad’s runways would keep his fixed-wing air force from flying temporarily, but that air force is a miserable hodgepodge of dated Soviet-era fighters and trainers. The main airborne weapons delivery system Assad’s forces prefer to use are helicopters, and the improvised “barrel bombs ” that they chuck out the back of them. Helicopters don’t need runways and they can be dispersed throughout the countryside instead of being concentrated at a handful of airfields. Also, when it comes to chemical weapons, artillery shells can be just as effective as air dropped weapons. Finding and destroying every piece of large caliber artillery in Assad’s possession is an all but impossible task. As for where his chemical weapons are hidden, nobody seems to know. A Syrian Army soldier fires an artillery cannon. , AP Then there are Assad’s air defense capabilities , which will be turned against coalition aircraft if they were to attack. Many of them are installed at fixed positions, but others are road-mobile—such as the SA-6, SA-11 and highly modern Pantsir-S1—and far harder to find and destroy than their stationary counterparts. These systems pose the greatest threat to coalition air power as they can “pop up” unexpectedly at any time. During a large air offensive against Assad’s aerial forces, everything from suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) fighters to high-end electronic warfare and cyber attack capabilities can be used to protect coalition aircraft, as well as leveraging America’s stealth combat aircraft and standoff weaponry. But the US still has a long road ahead in Syria, and those assets will not be able to protect the hundreds of sorties that fly over the country on a daily basis. By turning Assad’s air defense capabilities against the coalition, the fight against ISIS in that country will get much tougher, harder to sustain, more complex and far more expensive. There is also the reality that Iran and their Hezbollah proxies are on the ground in Syria in support of the Assad regime. A direct attack on the Assad’s forces by US-led air power could result in a series of unintended consequences. For instance, Iran could order Hezbollah to attack Israel—a potential conflict that is already reaching a boiling point—or Iran could pull one of its own direct levels or power, such as threatening shipping in the Persian Gulf or Strait of Mandeb. If Hezbollah fighters die in the bombardment, Iran could make attacking US troops in Syria a high priority. The list goes on and on. There are limitations to what air power can achieve, and regardless of these limits, the potential geopolitical ramifications of a major air campaign against Assad need to be considered carefully. , USAF Maybe most importantly, you have the Russian wild card. If the White House decides to go after Assad’s air force and air defenses, among other war fighting capabilities, Russia could just say they won’t allow it and that they will defend Assad and his airspace. And the Russians have the ability to do just that, unless US forces are actually willing to attack Russian surface-to-air missile batteries, aircraft, and material. And even if the US decided to take that risk, it would not be without extreme peril. Russia has S-400 and S-300 batteries in western Syria, which range out far into the Mediterranean and deep into central Syrian airspace, where US aircraft operate now freely. They also have some of their most advanced fighter aircraft based at their airfield south of Latakia. Taking out those batteries would open up a huge geopolitical “Pandora’s Box,” and killing the Russians operating them would likely see the conflict explode in a way few are willing to realize. The cold, hard truth is that the US had an opportune time to leave Assad’s aerial combat and air defense capabilities in rubble, but the Obama Administration failed to act. Yes, I am talking about the 44th President’s infamous “red line.” The first time Assad gassed his own people —a move the US said they would never let stand after watching the atrocities Saddam Hussein enacted on his own citizens—America should have vanquished not just Assad’s air force, SAM systems and gas sites, but also large portions of his war fighting capabilities. Much of this could have been done via standoff weaponry and there weren’t any US or coalition aircraft flying regularly over Syria at the time. Instead, Obama fumbled, and eventually took the Russian-brokered deal that supposedly removed all Assad’s nerve gas and the regime’s ability to build more. It seems like that deal was not as effective as touted, because Assad still clearly has nerve gas in his arsenal. The fact is some of us were talking about the need to take out Assad’s WMD stockpiles long before that deal was reached, a subject matter that largely was ignored by the mainstream media at the time. The Danish cargo vessel Ark Futura transported Assad’s chemical weapons stockpiles to Italy where the US flagged ship Cape Ray took the cargo out into the open ocean and incinerated it in two reactors. The Russian-brokered deal now seems to have been ineffective.  , AP Once Russia descended onto their newly gifted air base south of Latakia, Syria, in September of 2015, the option of militarily going after Assad and his war fighting capabilities without serious repercussions came to a rapid end. Russia’s grand blocking maneuver changed the game and has altered the outcome of the Syrian civil war dramatically ever since. There is also the question of why Assad used gas again, and why on that particular target? It doesn’t make much sense. In fact, it puts his absolutely necessary relationship with Russia at risk, and invites massive strikes against his own regime. It also shows that he still retains chemical weapons capabilities, which he supposedly gave up nearly four years ago. It almost seems like Assad is trying to internationalize the conflict even more than it already is. His recent firing on Israeli fighter aircraft who have hit Hezbollah weapons transfers in Syria for years was also peculiar. As was Damascus’s threats to shoot down any IAF jet over his territory and that his forces will rain down Scud missiles on Israel ports and military bases if the strikes continue. Obviously, bringing Israel into any conflict in that part of the world can result in fractured coalitions and rapid escalation. Although nothing can be said for certain, it is almost as if Assad is baiting the powers that be to change the conflict’s dynamic once again. The B-2 and F-22 like those shown here would likely figure in heavily with a war plan to strike Assad’s forces, but even then the consequences of such a strike could be damning, USAF Regardless of Assad’s intent, if the US can’t strike at Syria’s air force or other war fighting abilities, then what should be done? First, Assad and his buddies in Moscow can hang in the court of public opinion. Seeing images of dozens of little kids gassed sure doesn’t help either of their images, and seeing that Russia not only brokered the gas removal deal, but that they also are known to hold extreme leverage over Assad, they can answer for his crimes and for their support of his regime. In fact, there are signs that cracks in the Russian-Syrian relationship are beginning to emerge. Putin’s spokesman said today that Russia’s support for Assad is not unconditional and that they want a full investigation into the gas attack. This is not that surprising as it is key that Putin sells himself domestically as a bold terror fighter. Seeing images of civilians gassed at the hands of a regime that Russia has propped up at a substantial cost fundamentally darkens Putin’s “terror warrior” image. The reality is that Russia does not care about Assad; they care about their air base and strategic naval base in Syria that they now have basically an infinite lease on (a thank you gift from Assad for saving his regime from collapse) and their overall image as power brokers in the region. Assad can be replaced, and Russia could act to see it happen. Assad has held on to power with the help of his Russian and Iranian backers. , AP With all this in mind, the US should push as hard as it can to underline who Russia is supporting in Syria, and tie the crimes of Assad to the Kremlin on the world stage. Guilt by association if you will. What comes out of such a diplomatic offensive may not be the immediate satisfaction of revenge that some air strikes would provide, but the lasting impact could be far greater. In fact, this may have been one step too far for Assad, embarrassing his Moscow backers, and the wheels of power may already be in motion to oust the leader, saving Russia from yet another round of impending ire from the international community. Although Russia claims that the Syrian Air Force hit a terrorist chemical weapons depot, and that caused the release of the gas, nobody is buying it, and like other Russian explanations for events that do not benefit their image, their account is likely to change, if it hasn’t already. Secretary of State Tillerson, who has spoken little to the press since taking office, said today that steps were underway within the international community to remove Assad from power. This omission came after Tillerson had a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about the attack. Tillerson is headed to Moscow next week, and it is very likely that some sort of roadmap to oust the tyrant once and for all will be discussed. Syrians march against Assad and Putin in the west. , AP In the meantime, the US and its allies need to keep hyper-focus on their own interests in Syria—stamping out ISIS and specifically brining the de facto capital of their so called Islamic Caliphate in Raqqa crumbling to the ground one and for all. Anything else is a distraction and counter-productive to America’s immediate goals in the region. In the end, Assad will get his well-deserved punishment, but now is not the time for that and executing some near-sighted and vengeful air campaign is not in the interest of the American people nor our allies. Above all that, such an act only invites what is already a horrifically bloody and complex conflict to become even more so and such an operation be the catalyst for a much wider conflict with far more terrifying stakes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 10, 2017",US Launched Tomahawk Missile Attack On Shayrat Air Base In Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but by most credible accounts the US has launched between 50 and 60 BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles at Shayrat Air Base in western Syria. The strikes were limited to the base itself, including aircraft, runways, munitions dumps and fuel facilities at the base. The missiles were all fired from two US warships operating in the eastern Mediterranean. The targeted base is not that large or elaborate, with about 40 hardened aircraft shelters, a small dispersal area, a single 10,000 foot runway and some smaller buildings and structures. It appears that Su-22 Fitters are based there. According to the White House’s narrative the base is where the gas attack on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province was launched. The air base is roughly 70 miles south east of that site. Shayrat Air Base, Syria, Google Earth It is not surprising that the US claims to know this base is where the strike came from. The skies over Syria are closely monitored with dozens of information, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets in the air at any given time, as well as surveillance from Syria’s neighbors which is constant and elaborate. As such, tracking Syrian airstrikes and even filming their aftermath is nothing new. As for what this highly limited strike actually solves—and what it invites —is up to debate. It isn’t even likely that any of Assad’s functioning aircraft were still at the base, as it was fairly clear the base where the attack was launched was on the top of the target list. Also, the use of cruise missiles is a tell that the US is not comfortable operating manned aircraft, or even committing our top-line stealth assets , over western Syria where Russia’s advanced air defenses are active, along with Assad’s. This is nothing new : American and coalition aircraft have not been present over the western part of the country since Russia began operations there. Russia supposedly was told when and where the attack would take place far in advance. USN We will keep this post updated over the evening with more information as it becomes available. Update 7:50pm PST: CNN reports that Russians had a known presence at the air base. And historically they are right, Russia has used the base extensively as a forward operating base for its attack helicopters. Update 8:05pm PST: Here is some footage of the TLAMs being launched. Total fired: 59. Update 8:15pm PST: I am hearing USS Porter and USS Ross , both Arleigh Burke class destroyers based in Spain , launched the TLAMs. Update 8:50pm PST: The official Pentagon statement on the attacks- At the direction of the president, U.S. forces conducted a cruise missile strike against a Syrian Air Force airfield today at about 8:40 p.m. EDT (4:40 a.m., April 7, in Syria).  The strike targeted Shayrat Airfield in Homs governorate, and was in response to the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack April 4 in Khan Sheikhoun, which killed or injured hundreds of innocent Syrian people, including women and children. The strike was conducted using Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) launched from the destroyers USS Porter and USS Ross in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.  A total of 59 TLAMs targeted aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems, and radars.   As always, the U.S. took extraordinary measures to avoid civilian casualties and to comply with the Law of Armed Conflict.  Every precaution was taken to execute this strike with minimal risk to personnel at the airfield. The strike was a proportional response to Assad’s heinous act. Shayrat Airfield was used to store chemical weapons and Syrian air forces.  The U.S. intelligence community assesses that aircraft from Shayrat conducted the chemical weapons attack on April 4.  The strike was intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again. Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line.  U.S. military planners took precautions to minimize risk to Russian or Syrian personnel located at the airfield. We are assessing the results of the strike.  Initial indications are that this strike has severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure and equipment at Shayrat Airfield, reducing the Syrian Government’s ability to deliver chemical weapons.  The use of chemical weapons against innocent people will not be tolerated. Update 9:05pm PST: The rumor mill out of Syria is saying that heavy fighting is occurring near the base: Update 9:27pm PST: So here is the evidence the Pentagon says proves the chemical attack originated from Shayrat Air Base (hat tip to Marcus Weisgerber )- DoD DoD Update 11:43pm PST: Here’s the first official response from Putin’s office regarding the attack. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated : “President Putin regards the US attacks on Syria as an aggression against a sovereign state in violation of the norms of international law, and under a trumped-up pretext at that… Putin also sees the attacks on Syria by the US as an attempt to divert the international community’s attention from the numerous casualties among civilians in Iraq.” Peskov continued, saying that the Assad regime has no chemical weapons and that “…the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles has been recorded and confirmed by the OPCW, a specialized UN unit… At the same time, in Putin’s opinion, total disregard for the use of chemical weapons by terrorists only drastically aggravates the situation… This step deals significant damage to US-Russian ties, which are already in a deplorable state.” Iran has also strongly condemned the attack, which is totally unsurprising, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi stating : “We condemn all unilateral military action and the missile strike by US warships against Shayrat airbase under the pretext of Tuesday’s suspected attack on Khan Sheikhun.” Now that the sun is up in Syria, a few photos are beginning to show up on the net of the aftermath of the attack, with conflicting casualty accounts also starting to emerge . There is also talk that not even the runway was targeted at the air base, and that most the destruction was centered around the eastern and more remote end of the base. We will have to wait and see how this correlates with the Pentagon’s official damage assessments. Update 3:30am PST: More videos and photos are being posted online showing the aftermath of the attack. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4CbxpQKFbPE Video shows SAM emplacement still intact: https://youtube.com/watch?v=RaLALdwnkbw This Russian UAV video supposedly shows that many aircraft were moved into the open prior to the attack: https://youtube.com/watch?v=oKtJjPypT7I Russia says the strikes were pre-planned before the gas attack and that they are suspending their agreement with Washington put in place to ensure safe passage of US and Russian aircraft in Syria’s crowded airspace. This could massively effect America and its coalition partners’ ability to freely fly around the country, at least the eastern half of it, and specifically ongoing operations against ISIS. Even more importantly, and as predicted , Russia says it will strengthen Syria’s air defenses following the strike. Update 3:58am PST: Here is the official statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense. The translation is through a web translator, so keep that in mind: 04/07/2017 (12:52)Statement by the spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defense on the fact of a missile strike by the US Navy at the air base of Al-Shayrat in Syria On April 7, from 3.42 to 3.56 Moscow time, a massive rocket attack was carried out from the Mediterranean Sea in the area of ​​Crete from two destroyers of the US Navy (Ross and Porter) with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Syrian airbase ” Al-Shayrat (Homs province). According to Russian means of objective control, only 23 missiles flew to the Syrian airbase. As a result of the attack, a warehouse of material and technical property, a training building, a canteen, six Mig-23 aircraft in repair hangars and a radar station were destroyed. The runway, taxiways and airplanes of the Syrian Air Force are not damaged in the parking lots. According to the command of the Syrian airbase, 2 Syrian military personnel were missing, and 4 – were killed and 6 were burned in the fire fighting. Thus, the combat effectiveness of the American massive missile strike against the Syrian airbase is extremely low. We regard these actions by the American side as a gross violation of the Memorandum of Incident Prevention and Security in the course of operations in the airspace of Syria, signed in 2015. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation suspends cooperation with the Pentagon within the framework of this Memorandum. All put forward by the US as a justification for damaging the Damascus accusation of alleged violation of the 2013 Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are groundless. We have already said that the Syrian troops did not use chemical weapons. We are waiting for explanations from the US on the existence of indisputable, in their words, evidence that chemical weapons were used by the Syrian army in Khan Sheikhun. I want to remind you that from 2013 to 2016, the Syrian government has fully implemented all measures to eliminate the existing chemical weapons, their delivery means and its production base. All the stocks were destroyed and the components for the production of chemical weapons, which were destroyed at the enterprises of the USA, Finland, Great Britain and Germany, were exported beyond the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. US administrations are changing, and the methods of unleashing wars since the bombing of Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya remain unchanged. Again, the reason for unleashing aggression is not an objective investigation, but unfounded statements, fraudulent facts, shaking photos and pseudo-tubes in international organizations. I draw your attention to the fact that immediately after the massive missile strike against the Syrian airbase, a large-scale offensive of the gangs “Igil” and “Jabgat an-Nusra” began on the position of the Syrian troops. We hope that these actions of the militants are not consistent with the American side. Today it is already clear that the attack by American cruise missiles on the Syrian air base was prepared long before today’s events. To prepare such a strike, it is necessary to conduct a large set of activities for reconnaissance, planning, preparing flight missions and bringing the missiles into full readiness for launch. For any specialist, it is clear that the decision to strike a missile strike against Syria was made in Washington long before the events in the settlement. Khan-Sheikhun, which served only as a formal occasion, and the demonstration of military force is dictated exclusively for internal political reasons. To cover the most sensitive objects of the Syrian infrastructure in the near future will be implemented a set of measures to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the air defense system of the Syrian armed forces.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 26, 2017",Does US Carrier’s About Face In Asia Signal Impending North Korea Showdown?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The news hit this weekend that the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group, which was visiting Singapore and slated to move south to Australia, has been ordered north, toward the Korean Peninsula. The order came as President Trump wrapped up his first state visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which North Korea was supposedly a top topic for discussion. The White House had increasingly made it clear that it is prepared to “deal with” North Korea and their ballistic missile and nuclear programs alone if China will not help out. Another ballistic missile test launch just last week seems to have accelerated this initiative, and a possible major missile or nuclear test on April 15th—the locally cherished birthday of Kim Il Sung —would only put more pressure on the Trump regime to act in some way. This all comes as it has been widely reported that Trump’s national security team has wrapped up a review of options for taking on the Kim regime. These options have ranged from enacting even more invasive sanctions on Pyongyang, to changes in strategic posture, to direct military actions. The changes in strategic posture options in particular seem to include forward deploying tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea—something that has not occurred since 1991 —and would require the approval of the South Korean government. It is uncertain if such a plan would be possible to achieve seeing as one of South Korea’s Presidential candidates, Moon Jae-in, looks to take a far less iron-fisted approach with North Korea than his ousted predecessor, and would even put the deployment of the American THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system up for review. The other front runner candidate, Ahn Cheol-soo, looks to increase South Korea’s hardline approach toward its pesky neighbor to the north. USN Aside from longer-term strategic options and possibilities, there is real concern that some sort of military action or showdown will occur once the USS Carl Vinson and her flotilla arrive in the waters off the Peninsula. In recent weeks, there have been somewhat vague indications that have pointed toward something like that being in the works, so it is not just the fact that the Navy has suddenly ordered a carrier to head in that direction that is causing anxiety about what’s to come. In fact, the Carl Vinson recently left South Korean waters after partaking in large scale exercises over and around the Peninsula. Just last week Trump made it clear that “if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will.” And this weekend, the meeting with Xi Jinping didn’t seem to result in some overwhelming breakthrough in cooperation, yet alone an agreement on a firm plan between Washington and Beijing on the issue. Still, it seems China was willing to put a bit more pressure on North Korea than before. This morning Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated : “President Xi clearly understands, and I think agrees, that the situation has intensified and has reached a certain level of threat that action has to be taken… We’re hopeful that we can work together with the Chinese to change the conditions in the minds of the DPRK leadership. And then, at that point, perhaps discussions may be useful… But I think there’s a shared view and no disagreement as to how dangerous the situation has become. And I think even China is beginning to recognize that this presents a threat to even to China’s interests as well.” There was also this Tillerson quote from his trip to South Korea: “Let me be very clear: the policy of strategic patience has ended. If they [North Korea] elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, that option is on the table.” Then this short but ominous statement from Tillerson following North Korea’s latest missile launch: “North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.” Tillerson greets Jinping after landing in Florida., AP So we are left with a bit of a mixed bag as to understanding exactly what comes next. But above all else, Thursday’s token attack on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base has led many to think that the President may be more open to grabbing for the military option in the near term than as a last resort when it comes to North Korea. The reality is that the missile attack did no real damage to Assad’s war fighting machine —in fact it strengthened it drastically—nor did it threaten Assad himself in any way.  And no, the attack was not a credible warning to North Korea, it was an omission that Trump’s White House may not only react nearsightedly in a military manner to changing events, but also that they are only willing to do it in a highly limited and symbolic way. And North Korea is no Syria. At Kim’s fingertips, in addition to nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, is a massive, blunt and deadly military force, much of which has been contoured to cause as much immediate pain and suffering to South Korea, the US and its regional allies following an attack than anything else. As such, there is no real limited “military option” when it comes to North Korea. Anything “kinetic” in nature is a crap shoot that could result in the immediate release of tens of thousands of artillery guns and rockets emplacements, most of which are buried in highly fortified revetments along the DMZ. These weapons, which can contain gas, will rain down on South Korea, including large parts of Seoul. The destruction and loss of life would be on a scale we have not seen since WWII, and no, there is no super weapon that can intercept this barrage. Korea has made amazing progress in their missile programs over the last year., North Korea State Media There has also been some talk that Trump could order special operations raids into North Korea—ones that target regime interests and critical infrastructure. This would be just as reckless and bombing those North Korean targets. And it is not as if Pyongyang doesn’t have their own massive cadre of special operations forces that basically run on a suicide pact mentality. These forces are meant to infiltrate into South Korea during the opening hours of a conflict via submarines, low-flying and hard to target An-2 biplanes, and clandestine paths through and under the DMZ. Their one mission—to wreak all out havoc on South Korea’s population and military installations. In the end the ante for “testing” North Korea militarily is exponentially greater than for Assad’s regime in Syria, regardless of their Russian backers. In fact, last week’s missile strike on Syria has only reinforced North Korea’s rationale for obtaining nuclear weapons and a credible delivery system that is capable of threatening the US. With that reinforced rationale and increased paranoia comes a lighter hair trigger that could set the region on ablaze. Tense days along the DMZ, AP So what could Trump do right now that would put greater pressure on North Korea without realizing a major escalation militarily?  More military presence is always the first go to, hence the Carl Vinson’s new orders. This would also include more bombers and fighter aircraft being deployed to the Peninsula on training missions. The US Navy could also be ordered to interdict any and all naval traffic headed to North Korea and confiscate anything but the most basic human needs items. Electronic warfare and cyber attacks on North Korean communications and infrastructure could also be used to put pressure on the regime. Finally, and this would be a risky move but not as risky as attacking targets on North Korean soil or unleashing special operations forces into the country, Washington could order any North Korean test launch that ventures into international airspace shot down. Doing so would be tricky, as the flight profiles that North Korea’s most advanced missiles fly for testing purposes can be unusually steep, but the idea would be to take them out when possible—and America’s Aegis ballistic missile defense equipped destroyers and cruisers would be the the right tool for that job, a handful of which are part of the Carl Vinson strike group. Still, even doing this would risk a violent reaction from Pyongyang, but the precedent of shooting down a missile in international airspace is a far cry from attacking targets within North Korea’s own borders. By limiting each missile’s flight time, it could slow North Korea’s ballistic missile program that has drastically accelerated over the last year . The scene at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club during a mini summit between Turmp’s and Jinping’s staffs., AP These tactics could be paired with an increased push by China to get Pyongyang to sit down for talks. China is the only country who really holds sway over North Korea as the so called “Hermit Kingdom” relies on Beijing almost exclusively for energy, food stuffs and most other things. But if China won’t act, or if Kim simply won’t listen, and depending on which direction the political winds will blow in South Korean Presidential election, the US could find that enhanced deterrence is the only logical option, and that may very well include not just deploying US tactical nukes to South Korea, but having South Korea build out its own nuclear deterrent , a massive strategic shift that Trump has floated in the recent past. Above all else, the idea that some grand “military option” exists today in dealing with the ongoing North Korean crisis—one that won’t feature a high probability of leaving scores of South Koreans dead and a region totally destabilized—is at best an absurdly high stakes game of chance, and at worst a nearsighted invitation to the worst war the world has seen in 70 years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 7, 2017",America’s Tomahawk Missile Attack on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base Was a Sham,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Shortly before two US Navy destroyers let 59 Tomahawk missiles fly, I wrote in detail about why striking Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad’s forces now, in revenge for gassing his own people, was a terrible idea. After a picture of last night’s missile attack on Shayrat Air Base has become clearer, I can tell you that this operation wasn’t only counter-productive, it was a sham. In an age where BS seems to comes first, and “alternative facts” have been weaponized for mass consumption on an unprecedented scale, the decision to toss $100 million worth of cruise missiles at a token target and claim doing so was a measured response for the throngs killed or hurt by Assad’s heinous gas is not surprising. But the fact that so many of our leaders are playing it off as some incredible act—and so many cable news pundit generals seems just giddy to see some action to talk about—is downright troublesome. When considering any military action, one has to weigh the many dimensions of cost versus benefits, both near and short term. Simple questions like “does this act have a true military purpose? Does this act make America more secure? Does this act bring America closer to achieving its overall goals in a region? Will this act further endanger our soldiers?” are just a few questions among many that have to be considered carefully. The attack on Shayrat Air Base fails the vast majority of these tests glaringly. Unless you count old concrete as a weapon system or enemy, last night’s strikes did no substantial damage to Assad’s war fighting capability. A few hardened aircraft shelters were damaged, along with a handful of old tactical aircraft—their prior serviceability unknown—and some smaller buildings and miscellaneous material were harmed. The strike did not even take out the base’s runway or taxiways temporarily, meaning more missions can be flown from Shayrat in the near term. Even the base’s air defenses were left intact. Some of this has to do with the fact that the Russians, which have had a strong presence at the base in recent years, were warned well in advance of the strike, and apparently the Syrians were as well. Most of the aircraft were likely moved to other locations, as were high-value materials and personnel. Killing Russians, even if they were complicit in the gas attack, is not a good thing. But if a warning made good strategic sense, why leave anything at the airfield intact after giving said warning? The answer to that question is extremely frustrating. Pentagon bomb damage assessment slides released to the media., DoD Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs), in their normal configuration, are not well suited for the target set at hand. Their standard unitary warheads are capable against non-fortified structures and material, but are not capable of laying waste to a hardened airfield, at least not alone. On the other hand, their use is extremely low risk—which makes them a favorite of politicians—as no aircrews are put in harm’s way during an attack. But is a target like Shayrat Air Base even worth striking at all if you are not willing to use the proper weapon system, or combination of weapon systems, to do it? In effect, by sending throngs of TLAMs against hardened aircraft shelters and the like, commanders are knowingly putting the missiles to work in a symbolic gesture, with limited expected results. A trio of B-2 Spirit stealth bombers , with their ability to sling 16 2,000lb “bunker buster” JDAMs, or up to 80 500lb JDAMs each, would have left that airfield, its runway, its hardened aircraft shelters and air defenses in ruins. This is why the B-2 was used to go after Libya’s key airfields during operation Odyssey Dawn , not some of the nearly 200 TLAMs fired during that military excursion. If you are going to go after a highly limited target like a single airfield, which is a very questionable decision in itself, at least get the job done. Not just that, but B-2s could have also done the job also at very low risk , and could have approached the target from the east, instead of having to fly over Russia’s air defenses along the Syrian coast. F-22s would have given the B-2s proper counter-air cover, if even that was needed which is unlikely. Even a strike package of various fighter aircraft—some acting in the counter-air, strike and wild weasel roles—as well as electronic warfare aircraft, aerial surveillance support aircraft and bombers, such as the B-1B, could have turned that base into rubble, although with a higher assumed risk and mission complexity than just using the B-2s. And no, the no-goodnicks of the world are not cowering in fear of America once again because Trump decided to toss some missiles at a throwaway target. They aren’t as easily duped as the average cable news viewer. These bad guys have teams of people to closely evaluate the threat the US poses to them and their capabilities—it’s called a military—and seeing the US throw 59 $1.5 million Tomahawks at an old and tired Syrian satellite airfield with little effect makes us look weak and stupid, not strong. Also, if Assad and Russia have missile capabilities that not even the B-2 and all of America’s electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defenses, and cyber intrusion capabilities can deal with than what can these assets do against a major peer-state competitor? Once again, the choice of how to destroy the target has hurt America’s military credibility, not helped it. The B-2 is uniquely suited for the mission of efficiently attacking enemy airfields., USAF In the end, no we didn’t go after Assad’s air force, or even his air defense capabilities. In fact we didn’t even go after his deadly gas. So as far as Assad is concerned, militarily nothing has changed for the worse. And despite what you hear from the giddy generals, Assad has not paid for his dastardly acts, he didn’t even receive a slap on the wrist. But still we have to pay for this attack in the form of major repercussions nonetheless. Just as predicted, Russia has now pulled out from their agreement with Washington to work to deconflict the crowded airspace over Syria so that coalition aircraft don’t end up in a shooting match with Russian aircraft. Not just that, but now we have no way to get in touch with Russian commanders if Syrian or Russian jets bomb American or allied forces. And the hotline setup under this agreement is no theoretical game of geopolitical paddy-cake. It has been used numerous times before. Now that this no longer exists—and yes our commanders in Baghdad have said the line has gone dead—our troops and aircrews are in far greater danger than they were before. Not just that, but there is a much better chance that a relatively small incident that could be forestalled from spinning out of control with a simple call will now lead to a far darker place. The Kremlin has also said that they will now re-equip Assad with high-end air defenses as a result of the attack, something Russia has held off from doing for some time. Currently there is a single Russian S-300 battery in Tartus and an S-400 battery at Russia’s airfield south of Latakia. These are very capable systems that Russia has not pointed at US or coalition aircraft as they go about the air war against ISIS and other extremist groups in the country. Russia has now announced that it will use these systems to defend Assad’s own military capabilities and airspace. Tomahawk missiles are launched toward Syria by a Navy destroyer in the eastern Med. , USN Assad, even with his older air defense systems, has had a tacit agreement with the US not to engage coalition aircraft if the US does not bomb his forces, and especially not his air defense or air combat capabilities. That deal is now also toast. Our aircraft, many of them defenseless against radar-guided surface-to-air missiles, will now be flying under threat in the skies over Syria. Add the fact that Russia will likely deliver long-range advanced air defense systems to Assad, and you have what amounts to a total change in the aerial equation over Syria—and that change will greatly increase the complexity and danger of America’s fight against ISIS in the region. It will also make future attacks on Assad’s military capabilities far more perilous. The worst part—all this was totally predictable. Why this all matters is that we are supposed to be laser-focused on defeating ISIS, and primarily on sacking the capital of their so-called Caliphate in Raqqa. As I have explained in my earlier piece , we have gone through great lengths to keep the airspace over Syria open to our coalition’s drones, helicopters, surveillance and attack aircraft, by not getting drawn into Syria’s larger civil war. Now all that work, some of it at great risk, has been jettisoned for a useless “revenge” strike. The fight against ISIS, what should be our preeminent focus, is now going to be much harder after yesterday’s act. And the change is coming right when we have the Islamic State’s seat of power finally in our sights. I would love to be able to cheer on Assad’s demise, or even the neutering of much of his war fighting capability at the hands of American air power. What he did to those innocent people, and to his own country as a whole is atrocious. But I am not stupid enough to not realize that doing so will only put our greater goals and national interests in danger in the process. And more than anything else, it now puts our soldiers at far greater risk in Syria than they were on April 6th. And in return we have nothing to show for it militarily. Assad still has his air force, his air defenses, even his gas. In fact, he still has the same airfield and much of its material that we slung 59 cruise missiles at. Don’t be surprised if fighter aircraft begin flying operations once again from Shayrat Air Base’s untouched runways this afternoon. On top of it all, now Russia is going to protect Assad’s airspace with their advanced missile batteries and are going to rebuild Assad’s own air defenses to boot. And no, the bad guys around the world aren’t any more scared of us than they were a day ago, in fact they are almost certainly less scared. A pair of Su-22 Fitters left untouched in their hardened shelters at Shayrat Air Base following Thursday’s missile attack. , AP There will be a time and place for Assad and his evil henchmen to get what is coming to them, but yesterday was absolutely not that time. The operation displayed a lack of vision, understanding about the limitations of our military capabilities, and a total vacancy of strategic thought by all who were involved with it, and that is very worrisome to say the least. Sometimes doing nothing is a far better decision than “doing something.” In this case that wisdom was overcome by reactionary thinking by leaders that don’t have the long-game in mind and Assad is the benefactor of their nearsightedness. In the end you have to ask yourself: are America’s interests in the region better off today than they were before yesterday’s strike? Across the board the answer is clearly no.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The whole region is on edge as President Trump appears to be ready to confront North Korea militarily, just as the Pyongyang readies for yet another nuclear test. The next few days are going to be strenuous to say the least. The 18th Air Wing based at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan is keeping frosty by ordering a large-scale, no-warning sortie generation drill. The impressive pictures below depict the result of this surprise exercise. USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF The “elephant walk” occurred on April 12th, with the 18th Wing’s F-15C/D Eagles, HH-60G Pave Hawks, E-3B Sentries and KC-135R Stratotankers taking part. Being that the drill was unannounced, what you see here a probably a fairly good snapshot of what the 18th Wing can put in the air on short notice. Keep in mind that all the F-15s were armed up before “launching.” There are two F-15C/D squadrons, the 44th FS and 67th FS, based at Kadena and both are part of the 18th Wing. Most F-15C/D squadrons have 18 primary aircraft and three backup aircraft in inventory. Only one other F-15C/D “active” USAF squadron exists, the 493rd FS based in RAF Lakenheath, the UK, the rest are all Air National Guard units. Obviously this high-profile training evolution comes as a showdown with North Korea looms. These elephant walks are a fairly regular occurrence in South Korea , but in Japan, that’s is a different story. Sprawling Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. The base would be one of Pyongyang’s top targets for its increasingly capable ballistic missiles. , Google Earth With a redirected US carrier strike group now arriving off the Korean Peninsula, a large flotilla of Japanese warships rendezvousing with that strike group, and the whole region on maximum alert for yet another North Korean nuclear test and/or large-scale missile test, what comes next may not be pretty. Trump has made it clear that he is prepared to deal with North Korea unilaterally, but as of right now it seems that China may be at least partially privy to any plans the Pentagon may have. Multiple sources have also reported that roughly 150,000 Chinese troops have been moved to the North Korean border. It is unclear if these reports are fully accurate or not, but the reality is the border is already heavily patrolled by the PLA. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG 108), one of newest destroyers in the Navy’s inventory, is part of the Carl Vinson Strike Group that is currently on its way to the shores off the Korean Peninsula. , USN The big question, as we have discussed earlier in the week, is will Trump preemptively or postemptively strike a nuclear or missile test, or attempt to swat a North Korean missile out of the sky? Any of these acts could lead down an uncertain and perilous road for both Pyongyang and Washington, not to mention South Korea and the region as a whole. The main unknown being, what is the Kim regime’s threshold for a kinetic attack, and especially, at what point in time does he put his artillery along the DMZ to work and execute other war plans which will likely mark the end of his regime, although at tremendous cost to all those involved. Kim Jong Un made a rare appearance in front of international media today for a residential block opening in Pyongyang. , AP We also don’t know what is being done to get the Kim regime to the negotiating table. China would be the wild card here, and this massive show of force could be working as the military anvil to China’s diplomatic hammer, trying to force the Kim regime to negotiate or at least stand down from further tests. But it seems more and more likely that even Beijing have lost all control over the Kim regime—short of purposefully starving out the country and letting its energy reserves run dry. We will be on watch this weekend to see how things develop. April 15th is Day of The Sun in North Korea. Usually some sort of major military weapons test or other high profile military act occurs around that date. But this time the paradigm appears to have changed geopolitically in a fairly dramatic fashion. Seeing if Kim Jong Un goes through with any sort of major test in the coming days will be a key indicator as to his appetite for risk-taking going forward.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 20, 2017",US Drops Its Most Powerful Non Nuclear Bomb On ISIS In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain sketchy, but CNN reports that a MC-130 Talon dropped a GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) bomb—also known as the Mother Of All Bombs—on ISIS tunnels and personnel in the Achin district of the Nangarhar province, Afghanistan. The attack supposedly occurred around midnight local time. MOAB is the most powerful conventional bomb in America’s arsenal, and is an evolutionary follow-un to the 15,000lb BLU-82 “Daisy Cutters” used from Vietnam all the way up through the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Daisy Cutter was replaced in 2003 by the GBU-43, with the program taking only nine months to design, construct and test during the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq. The weapon was never used during that conflict, although the Daisy Cutter was on multiple occasions. Daisy Cutter in action: The 22,600lb, 30 foot long weapon is used for attacking soft targets dispersed over a large physical area, such as anti-aircraft emplacements or trenches, and is especially deadly for attacking cave and tunnel systems, and forces concentrated in mountainous terrain. Like its Daisy Cutter progenitor, it can also be used to clear landing zones and minefields as well. The MOAB has been forward deployed to the middle east for a decade and a half, but it has never been used until today., USAF MOAB can be delivered by C-130 via being hauled out the rear ramp via drogue chute before entering a free-fall stage. It uses GPS and inertial guidance coupled to maneuvering fins to strike its targeted area with high-accuracy, unlike the unguided Daisy Cutter. Because it does not require a parachute for its entire drop phase, the aircraft launching the MOAB can fly higher than those that launched the Daisy Cutter could. The MOAB primarily leverages 18,700lbs of “H6” for its explosive fuel, which is a mix of roughly 45 percent RDX and Nitrocellulose , 30 percent TNT and 20 percent aluminum powder, along with five percent of other compounds. The aluminum powder accelerates the speed at which the blast develops and increases its overall pressure. MOAB detonates just above the ground, allowing the blast to spread out laterally. Its casing is made of light aluminum so as not to interfere with the blast’s potential. Its blast radius is said to be about a mile wide, but supposedly it can still do significant damage and even cause serious injury over about two miles. It is a ferocious and nasty weapon, and like its Daisy Cutter ancestor, its use can be as much about its psychological effects as it is about its physical effects. MOAB under construction. , DoD It will be most interesting to hear more about the Pentagon’s decision to use MOAB. Was the use of one of these weapons, which supposedly we only have a handful of, really necessary and if so why? Obviously doing so would make major headlines, and the administration nor the Pentagon have been hush-hush about its use, so hopefully we can get some detail about what justification there was to employ it. The biggest question being why couldn’t a series of smaller thermobaric and high-explosive bombs be used instead of something as exotic and wide-reaching as MOAB? We also don’t know if President Trump was involved with the decision to put MOAB to use for the first time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HsQdeAeOEg4 On the other hand, if ISIS was occupying a fairly large but centralized area where innocent lives were not at risk, and they had built tunnels and fortifications that smaller air-dropped munitions would have a hard time striking, then why not put MOAB to use? Using troops to clear such an area would be a needless risk to soldiers’ lives. On top of sucking the air out of anyone’s lungs within the vicinity of its detonation, and creating a massive and very hot shockwave, the psychological effects of the sounds and tremors from the blast, as well as the resulting widespread devastation following its use would be just a bonus. We will keep this post updated as more information comes available. Update 12pm PST: Here’s the official statement on the MOAB’s use, and it pretty much sums up the weaponeering for the target in question- DoD Document An updated story with FLIR video of the strike can be seen here.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",USAF Operationally Deploying F-35A To Europe This Weekend For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF will send an F-35A contingent of unknown size to Europe this weekend. The Air Force says the deployment has been planned for some time, although the timing of it is thorny: It follows increased tensions with Russia over America’s Tomahawk strikes in Syria, as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s chilly visit to Moscow. The mission will be the first of its kind for the USAF’s F-35A variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. The jets will be from the 388th Fighter Squadron based at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The unit recently completed exercise Red Flag where they performed well and garnered somewhat outlandish praise from the press . The deployment will likely mirror that of the F-22’s first deployment to Europe , with follow-on deployments growing drastically in both scope and complexity . In the F-35’s case, the jets will likely hopscotch around to some of the Western European countries that are slated to purchase it, giving their Air Forces a bit of a hands-on look at the aircraft’s capabilities on their own turf. It is also possible that the jets could visit NATO allies in eastern Europe, such as Poland or Romania, a move that would be seen as more aggressive when it comes to US-Russian relations. The aircraft’s ability to soak of electronic intelligence could be put to good use near the Russian border, but no matter where exactly they end up, it will be a highly publicized excursion to say the least. With USMC F-35Bs already in the Pacific Theatre , the arrival of the A model in Europe will be considered a massive milestone for the F-35 program as a whole. Last summer, just the fact that the aircraft finally “crossed the pond” to an air show in Europe made persistent international headlines. With tensions on and around the Korean Peninsula reaching an all time high, a contingent of F-35Bs currently forward deployed to Japan has also made news by descending onto South Korea for joint training. Don’t be surprised if the presence of these jets in South Korea are more heavily publicized in the coming days as well to coincide with the F-35s media blitz that is about to hit Europe.

We knew it would be just a matter of time, and just a day after it unleashed its most powerful non nuclear bomb for the first time— the 22,600lb Massive Ordnance Air Blast , or MOAB for short—on a key ISIS position in eastern Afghanistan, the Pentagon has released infrared footage of the strike. Just as The War Zone assessed, the weapon was used against a sprawling target nestled among mountainous terrain, with the nearby topographical variations working to magnify yet also contain the weapon’s massive concussive effects. The Pentagon also claims 36 ISIS fighters were killed in the blast. This number disappointed some, but taking on dozens of ISIS foot soldiers embedded in fortified, unfamiliar and likely boobytrapped positions via other means could have been a very deadly affair for Afghan National Army or even US special operations troops.

There may even be a little BD-5 in there as well. Although it is hard to tell from the picture, it also looks like the design may possibly rely on a single center-line pusher-prop configuration, but the aircraft seems quite large for just a single engine.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The amphibious assault ship and helicopter carrier HMS Ocean is currently the largest vessel in the Royal Navy—it’s also the flagship of the fleet. With years to go before the first of the Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers become operational, the HMS Ocean —which isn’t even 20 years old—is slated for retirement next year, and according to reports she might be sold off for a bargain price to Brazil. HMS Ocean is a capable ship. She displaces 21,500 tons, was commissioned in 1998 and was just refit a few years ago. She can carry around 18 helicopters—but usually totes around less than a dozen—of various types, including large Chinook transports to Apache attack helicopters. Past operations of one of HMS Ocean’s tailored air groups., MoD Since the canning of the UK’s Harrier force , along with its carriers HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal, HMS Ocean has been the sole air warfare power projection vessel in the Royal Navy’s inventory—with Royal Army Air Corps Apache Longbows providing the ship’s over-the-horizon striking power. And this capability has been used successfully in combat before. Although the UK’s Apache force largely wrote the book on deploying the AH-64/AH Mk 1 to sea, HMS Ocean is meant to have a highly flexible air wing that can feature a composite of various cross-service, and even cross-national, helicopters depending on the mission. The ship is also built to execute amphibious assaults. In addition to her baseline crew of nearly 300, with another 200 attached to her air wing, up to 800 Royal Marines can be embarked at one time, along with 40 of their vehicles. The ship also carries four 51.5 foot landing craft (LCVPs) and has extensive command and control capabilities. US Marines riding HMS Ocean’s elevator during multi-national training exercises. , DoD The Royal Navy gets a pretty big bang for their buck out of the relatively young HMS Ocean. She can do a lot of things, from anti-submarine warfare to amphibious assault, without the massive logistical footprint of a dedicated aircraft carrier. Above all else, the ship keeps the Royal Navy in the carrier game, which is not just a big deal geopolitically, but it is also significant when it comes to keeping skills needed to operate such a vessel fresh. One of HMS Ocean’s four LCVPs. The ship does not have a well deck, although other RN amphibs do. Instead, HMS Ocean lowers the vessels down to the water from storage positions on the sides of her hull. , MoD But under the MoD’s often puzzling defense spending choices, the versatile vessel will be retired next year. Many have called for her to stay in service at least until HMS Queen Elizabeth becomes operational, while others have demanded she be put in reserve for contingency operations. But recently it seems more likely that the ship will be sold. Her young age, updates systems, relatively economic operating costs, and versatility making her an attractive purchase for cash-strapped naval arms with big ideas. HMS Ocean with Apache, Chinook and Merlin helicopters on its deck., MoD Brazil in particular appears to be interested in buying the ship. That makes good sense considering their antique aircraft carrier, the Sao Paulo , which was supposed to go through complex overhaul, has now been decommissioned due to its poor shape and the large sum of money it would take to get it back in operation. This leaves the Brazilian Navy without any sort of a flattop for the foreseeable future. HMS Ocean can vary her aircraft compliment widely depending on the mission. Although not designed as an anti-submarine warfare ship, she has acted as one in the past successfully , MoD Sure, HMS Ocean cannot operate fixed wing aircraft like the Brazil’s AF1 Skyhawks , but the need for that capability has been of debatable for some time now. HMS Ocean would provide a good mix of more usable everyday capabilities, like working as an anti-submarine and sea control platform or being able to quickly deploy Brazilian commandos ashore or deploying relief during a natural disaster. It would also work as the centerpiece of Brazil’s small but significant amphibious assault flotilla, which is made of a hodgepodge of four second-hand vessels of French, UK and US origin. Sao Paulo at sea with Skyhawks aboard during better times. , Rob Schleiffert/wikicommons Supposedly there is a fixed price offer from Brasilia for the ship for £80.3 million pounds ($100,950,000). That is less than the cost of a single F-35B that will fly from the HMS Queen Elizabeth’s deck, and payment for the ship from Brasilia to London may be broken down in installments. The Royal Navy has not confirmed that the deal with Brazil is done, but has alluded to the fact that “a number of options are being considered” including selling the vessel to a foreign government. HMS Ocean is not an old or tired vessel. It will have served just 20 years at the time of its retirement and has been kept updated with modern sub-systems., MoD Helicopter carriers with amphibious assault capabilities have become somewhat of a hot commodity in recent years, with many navies procuring them with power projection in mind . The topic blasted onto the geopolitical stage in recent years following France’s axed deal to provide a pair of Mistral class helicopter landing docks to Russia. Who should have bought the orphaned vessels was up to hot debate in the international press until it was announced that Egypt would be their new owners. Egypt’s new ENS Gamal Abdel Nasser , one of two Mistral class amphibious assault ship now in Cairo’s possession. , Ahmed XIV/Wikicommons Suggestions that Canada, India, Vietnam, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, China and even NATO should buy the ships were posited in high-profile ways before the purchase by Egypt was announced. Brazil was also thought to have been an ideal candidate, although this was a couple years ago, when the Brazilian Navy still thought they would bring Sao Paulo back to life. We will have to wait and see if any other bidders for HMS Ocean come to the table. A NATO ally would seem to be the ideal buyer for the ship, as its combat systems, communications and other support systems are meant to interoperate with the alliance’s forces. Plus a low selling price point could be justified to the public as a move to enhance NATO’s strength overall. HMS Ocean has served as the centerpiece of many NATO naval exercises, including sailing into the Baltic Sea as part of BALTOPS., Allied Joint Force Command NATO/Wikicommons Then again the UK could just find the funds to operate the ship, at least until they can claim a replacement is active in the form of HMS Queen Elizabeth . The plan also puts into question how the Royal Navy will afford two 65,000 ton class aircraft carriers—and an all-stealth fighter fast-jet contingent to fill their decks—when they seem to be unable or unwilling to fund even a single medium-sized helicopter carrier—one that pulls in aerial assets from across the MoD’s inventory. Supposedly the budgets are in place to see both Queen Elizabeth class carriers become operational, but it will be interesting to see if HMS Prince of Wales — HMS Queen Elizabeth’s sister ship—will be sustained in an operational state over the long term. With HMS Ocean long gone by the time HMS Prince of Wales is supposed to become optional, sustaining one large fixed-wing capable carrier and one smaller helicopter carrier, and either putting HMS Prince of Wales in mothballs or selling it off, will not be an option. Still years away from being declared operation, the HMS Queen Elizabeth is complete, while HMS Prince of Wales is far along in its construction., AP Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 10, 2017",Carrier Group Nowhere Near North Korea Last Weekend: Feint Or Fumble?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The about-face of the supercarrier USS Carl Vinson and good portion of her escorts made huge news all last week as increasingly louder war drums were signaling a confrontation between the US and North Korea. By the time North Korea was parading ballistic missiles through its streets, and a missile test launch or nuclear weapons test was likely imminent, it was assumed the ships were closing in on the area, along with a contingent of Japanese warships they were supposed to meet up with. Now it appears this was not the case. The Navy posted a picture on Monday of the USS Carl Vinson traversing the Sunda Strait—a patch of water that bisects Java and Sumatra—some 3,500 miles from the Korean Peninsula. The photo was dated Saturday, April 15th, which is a week after reports regarding the orders to send the carrier towards the Korean Peninsula began appearing. Here is that photo: SUNDA STRAIT (April 15, 2017) The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) transits the Sunda Strait. The Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group is on a scheduled western Pacific deployment as part of the U.S. Pacific Fleet-led initiative to extend the command and control functions of U.S. 3rd Fleet. U.S Navy aircraft carrier strike groups have patrolled the Indo-Asia-Pacific regularly and routinely for more than 70 years. , U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Sean M. Castellano/Released Traditionally speaking, the rumor mill is ripe in the world of defense reporting as so much having to do with military hardware, operations and movements is placed under a shroud of secrecy. But in this case, that was not so. The reports of the Carl Vinson’s repositioning orders were confirmed by the highest levels of the US government. On Saturday, April 9th, Admiral Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, supposedly redirected the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group towards the Korean Peninsula, with an official Navy release stating that the flotilla “will operate in the Western Pacific rather than executing previously planned port visits to Australia.” F/A-18C catapults off the deck of the USS Carl Vinson in the South China Sea. , USN On Sunday, April 10th, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster stated the following on Fox News Sunday when asked about moving the Carrier Strike Group to the waters off North Korea: “Well, it’s prudent to do it, isn’t it?” He also added that “the President has asked to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat the American people and to our allies and partners in the region.” Then there is White House Press Secretary Spicer’s exchange with a reporter on Monday the 11th regarding the carrier’s change of course: Reporter: “Putting that strike carrier group in the Sea of Japan, in that region, is that also a messaging circumstance? Or is that simply protective for our allies in Japan and Korea?” Spicer: “A carrier group is several things. The forward deployment is deterrence, presence. It’s prudent. But it does a lot of things. It ensures our — we have the strategic capabilities, and it gives the President options in the region. But I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence. So I think it serves multiple capabilities.” Then two days later, Defense Secretary Mattis stated the following during his first Pentagon press conference after a reporter asked him about sending the carrier back to Korea and canceling its planned exercises with the Australian military: “She’s stationed there in the western Pacific for a reason. She operates freely up and down the Pacific, and she’s just on her way up there because that’s where we thought it was most prudent to have her at this time. There’s not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we’re sending her up there.” SecDef Mattis during his first Pentagon press briefing. , AP There were plenty of other statements as well made on background to the press that fortified the idea that the carrier was being redirected. And certainly the comments and tweets from President Trump himself reinforced that a military showdown with the Kim regime was looming. During an interview by Maria Bartiromo , she asked Trump about the carrier being sent to the Korean Peninsula, here’s his reply: “I don’t want to talk about it. We are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you.” So what happened here? How could everyone think a carrier strike group was heading in one direction, when it was really headed in another? Although maybe improbable, it is possible that this was not the case at all. This apparent massive mix-up could have been a feint to put pressure on North Korea and keep them in check temporarily during a high-risk date on the calendar. In fact, as the weekend grew near, it seemed less likely that a war would erupt between the US and North Korea. President Trump flew down to his Mar-a-Lago resort without his national security team—something a President would not likely do if they were planning a high-stakes contingency operation that could erupt into a massive war. At the same time, Vice President Pence’s trip to South Korea wasn’t cancelled, with a Sunday arrival date still in place. And Pence ended up making that trip, which included a visit to the DMZ. VP Pence visits a lookout along the DMZ., AP In the meantime it became more and more plausible that coalition building was underway, instead of the execution of a war plan, with Pence meeting with top South Korean and later Japanese officials in what seems like an effort to get everyone on the same page going forward when it comes to dealing with the Kim regime. Maybe most importantly, as last week drew to a close, it seemed as if China was beginning to enact a far more hardline policy toward North Korea than in the past. China even turned around coal shipments from North Korea—one of the reclusive country’s ultimate sources of revenue—and diplomatic relations between the long-time neighbors appeared to be crumbling on a world stage . All this was happening as President Trump’s tone toward China had appeared to of changed dramatically, and he didn’t mince words as to why: Now it also seems clear that two more carrier strike groups will become available in the coming weeks. The USS Nimitz is just completing its run-ups to deployment and USS Ronald Reagan , which is forward-based in Japan , will be available once again for deployment in the near term. There are also reports that the Carl Vinson Strike Group is now slated to be back in the Sea of Japan by around the end of the month. It is very possible that attempting some sort of military action, or even applying extreme military pressure on Pyongyang in a coordinated and extended manner was deemed premature last week by the administration. This, along with China’s efforts to get North Korea in check, may have left Trump’s national security team with the reality that more time would be needed to move forward in both military and diplomatic mediums. On the other hand, there is much talk that this was simply a communications blunder of fairly epic proportions—not just externally, but especially internally. If this were the case, it exposed key fissures in the military’s chain of command and its ability to communicate with civilian leadership. It also makes it seem as if the administration does not know what the military is doing and vice-versa. This seems extremely odd considering that we are talking about the position of a carrier strike group here, not a small tactical anomaly or operation. Carl Vinson CSG alongside Japanese warships in March., USN Although at first glance the onus would be put on the press for the mix-up, but as you can see by the statements made by top US government officials, there was every reason to believe that the Carl Vinson and her escorts were headed toward the Korean Peninsula, even by the Navy’s own written statement. The truth of the matter is that you couldn’t watch the news—network or cable—or read a paper or an online news site without the carrier’s repositioning orders being a major story—all week long. So how was it, that the thousands of people in the Navy involved with the carrier’s movements, the messaging associated with them, and the area of operations as a whole, did not work to correct the error? This includes those onboard the carrier and her escorts who have access to satellite TV news. So we are left with more questions than answers. Was this a case of ‘the tail wagging the dog,’ in which the administration and the Pentagon at large were working off of apparently unquestioned reports stemming from an inaccurate Navy press release? Or was this some sort of a disinformation operation that is yet to be publicly understood? We just don’t know. If the former is true, then that is a very scary thing. If the latter is the case, then we are possibly seeing the underpinnings of a much wider, far reaching and wily strategy concerning North Korea than we have grown accustomed to in the past.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Multiple reports state that Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad has ordered his best combat aircraft to relocate to Russia’s Hmeymin air base located south of Latakia, Syria. If these reports prove to be accurate, the move puts Syrian air power under the protection of Russia’s advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missile batteries, Pantsir-S1 point air defense systems, and Su-30/34/35 Flankers fighters. It also makes attacking Assad’s air power a geopolitical non-starter going forward—unless the US is willing to kill Russians and attack what is basically Moscow’s own micro-territory within the war-torn country. The move was entirely predictable, and just another major negative repercussion of the Trump administration’s reckless sham of a missile strike on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base on April 7th. I will save you the diatribe here, you can read exactly what I wrote as to why we shouldn’t strike Assad before the cruise missiles were fired, and why it was a hollow and sickeningly counter-productive decision to do so after.

By moving Assad’s air operations alongside Moscow’s at the ever-expanding Hmeymin air base, there will likely be deeper cooperation among the two air arms, and don’t be surprised if Russia also begins to re-quip Assad’s air force with surplus aircraft in the near term. In the meantime, Syrian and Russian aircraft seem to have accelerated the practice of dropping phosphorus and other area munitions on opposition filled towns.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Estimates as to how many ISIS fighters were killed as a result of America’s highly publicized Mother Of All Bombs attack on an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar Province continue to grow. New estimates based on what the Afghan National Army saw at the site nearly tripled the original estimate to nearly 100 fighters . That may or may not be accurate, but by looking at new before and after satellite imagery of the target area, it seems as if nearly all features built up on the targeted hillside were wiped off the face of the earth by the strike. The massive air blast appeared to have worked just as advertised, with the mountainside focusing it effects, and the shockwave expanding down into the valley below. The images above also closely correlate with the official infrared video we have seen of the strike. When Defense Secretary Mattis was asked earlier today for an updated casualty report from the MOAB strike he said “frankly digging into tunnels to count dead bodies is probably not a good use of our troops’ time when they’re chasing down the enemy that’s still capable.” Mattis also elaborated on his disdain for killed in action metrics as a focus of ongoing military operations, telling reporters while traveling to the Middle East that “for many years we have not been calculating the results of warfare by simply quantifying the number of enemy killed. You all know of the corrosive effect of that sort of metric back in the Vietnam War. It’s something that has stayed with us all these years… You don’t want to start calculating things, as far as what matters, in the crude terms of battle casualties.” Fair enough, and considering all the streaming video and hyperspectral and radar imagery from aerial and satellite sources the Pentagon has at its disposal, they can ascertain better than anyone that what was is no longer when it comes to ISIS’s remote hillside fortification in Nangarhar province. Mattis speaking to the press aboard an E-4B during his trip to the Middle East. , AP The area remains closed to civilians and journalists supposedly because fighting continues in pockets throughout the region, and in the vacinity of the MOAB strike. Some think the level of devastation caused by the exotic attack is something the US does not want to share with the press. FLIR imagery of the blast and even satellite photos are one thing, but seeing close-up what an air burst weapon like MOAB can do may be another manner. Mattis and his team are also fully aware of how big an impact the use of the GBU-43  would have on the media, and like its BLU-82 “Daisy Cutter” predecessor, MOAB is as much a psychological weapon as anything else. When asked about his commanders’ decision to use weapon, and if they realized how big of a story it would become, Mattis responded that “I have no doubt that they do.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 15, 2017","Analyzing North Korea’s Missile Parade: Prescription For Fear, Dose Of Reality","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An unprecedented number eyes were focused on Pyongyang yesterday for this year’s Day of The Sun military parade. Largely this was because the rhetoric between the US and North Korea has never been so hot, and there has been real posturing to go along with it . Intelligence agencies and journalists alike watch the display closely to see what new military capabilities the Kim regime will put on display, and as a result you probably woke up to headlines like “North Korea shows off sinister new ICBM” and the like. It seems like many are quick to forget that this event happens on parade grounds, not a military technology testing and proving ground. Parades usually have floats, and big ominous looking missile canisters, and even missiles themselves, can be just that—elaborate displays—and nothing more. Here’s video of the whole parade: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZQxW_ipxEEo We know what missile capabilities the North Koreans have actually tested, and what remains on their wish list. The War Zone was among the first to warn of Kim’s changing missile development strategy , and we have followed every major launch very closely since. There is no question North Korea has gained incredible momentum towards a true intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine-launched ballistic missile capability over the last year, but that doesn’t mean rolling a big transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) with a massive missile canister on top proves that there is anything inside. The event featured a bizarre but unsurprising mix of imagery., AP It is best to think of this event as a place at which Pyongyang can make their end-game aspirations a brief but synthetic reality—a blank canvas for which to paint their most deadly hopes and dreams. So no, just because it rolls through Kim Il Sung Square does not make it real—at least not real yet. But that also doesn’t mean that it is all fake—far from it. Once again, many of these systems are actually in testing, and outgrowths of their original designs are both logical and expected. With these key caveats in mind, here is our breakdown of the parade’s technological highlights: Here is a good cheat sheet to remind you of North Korea’s various ballistic missiles, there is even a more expansive list at the link to CSIS’s Missile Threat website posted on the tweet below: KN-11 Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile For the first time, North Korea publicly showed off its KN-11 “Polaris” sub-launched ballistic missile . This is a real system in development that has been successfully fired from the country’s only Sinpo class submarine . The missile is thought to use solid fuel as a propellant and is in the medium-range class. Being submarine launched, it would be able to be fired outside the engagement zone of THAAD . AP AP AP KN-15 MRBM This tracked transporter-erector-launcher is a familiar system that carries another real missile system that is currently in testing—the medium-range, solid fueled KN-15. The missile is a land-based version of the KN-11 seen above, and was tested successfully just last February . Its tracked TEL would allow it to hide in many places, even far off-road, and its fairly mature state makes it one of North Korea’s most credible emerging missile threats. AP Scud SRBM with active maneuvering control surfaces This Scud adaption that uses what looks like an early Scud-tracked TEL is interesting in that its nose section appears to have maneuvering fins. This would be an indication that North Korea is working on, or has, a maneuvering variant of the popular short-ranged ballistic missile. The ability to make hard maneuvers during its flight makes intercepting the missile much more challenging, especially during the terminal phase of flight. Also, North Korea has long shown interest in anti-ship ballistic missile technology to counter US, South Korean, and Japanese naval power. Adapting the Scud to go after nearby threatening ships would seem like a logical, if not reaching move for the DPRK, especially since the capability is now proliferating to multiple countries , some of which are very friendly with North Korea (Iran). AP Tractor-trailer mystery TEL This massive missile canister hauled by a simpler tractor-trailer TEL is for an unknown missile, although it could be for the liquid-fueled KN-14 ICBM that has been in development for some time. The missile is thought to be an outgrowth of the KN-08, but with a shorter , blunter ablative nose cone and featuring two instead of three stages. The configuration is similar to that used by China for its DF-31 TELs . Currently the KN-14 may be North Korea’s most credible ICBM program as components of the missile have been seen mocked up as a whole, and in storage at key North Korea’s nuclear and missile sites. Still, there is no indication the missile has actually been successfully flight tested as of yet, although there are indications that a failed test may have occurred in October of 2016. AP AP North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile? These impressive TELs, which we have seen in past April 15th parades, were seen this year carrying imposing launch canisters, and were the highlight of the display for many. Their appearance also resulted in plenty of news outlets proclaiming North Korea was showing off a new massive solid-fuel ICBM. Once again, we are only seeing a canister and a pre-existing TEL here, and the canister it carries could have no intended occupant—and least not yet. On the other hand, it could show the intended configuration for an operational KN-08, which is longer than its KN-14 cousin having three distinct stages, or a missile based on it but having adopted solid propellant as a fuel source for even just one or two of its stages. The KN-08 missile, North Korea’s largest (by length) land-mobile ballistic missile design, has been in development for years and has even been displayed on the same TEL but without a canister in the past . On the other hand, sure, this could be designed to carry a massive, totally new solid fueled ICBM akin to Russia’s road mobile configuration of its Topol ICBM . But really, that is unlikely in the near term, and like we discussed in the opening of this post, this TEL configuration is more likely a “blank slate” aspirational piece of propaganda and disinformation than a real system that will be entering into testing in the near term. AP AP Stretched BM-25 Musudan IRBM This missile is puzzling, to say the least. At first glance it almost appears to be a new version of the KN-08, but without its distinctive three-tier layout . Instead it seems that the missile is nearly un-tapered at its second stage joint, and its nose section has been completely remodeled. Upon closer examination it really seems more plausible that it is a lengthened BM-25/HS-10 Musudan IRBM . It is even being hauled around in a Musudan’s TEL. Not just that, but it matches the black and white paint job of Musudan missiles that have been test fired over the last year. Even though its success record remains poor, the Musudan has been successfully test fired, and this new and improved version would be a threatening development for the region. There is also the possibility that this new version could use solid fuel for its upper stage. AP AP New coastal defense system The inclusion of what appears to be a coastal defense system built around a land-based version the Kh-35 anti-ship cruise missile was also a major point of intrigue during the parade. It was fairly recently discovered that North Korea had received the type from Russia in the mid-1990s. North Korea has since put its own knock-off into production, which it has also exported. Now it looks like they put the missile to use in this system. The TELs tracked configuration would allow it to rove rugged areas of the North Korean coastline, making it exceptionally hard to target and kill. Like the aforementioned Scud with potential anti-ship aspirations, the existence of this coastal defense system is another tell that North Korea is working to, or at least wanting to, build out an anti-access/area-denial strategy to a greater degree than it ever has in the past. AP Upgraded Pokpung-ho main battle tank North Korea’s indigenous Pokpung-ho main battle tank appears to have been upgraded with some sort of remote anti-aircraft turret housing a pair of SA-16 Igla man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) missiles. It is unclear how target acquisition would work, but one would think it has a camera to lock onto low flying enemy aircraft, namely US and South Korea attack and reconnaissance helicopters. On the right side of the turret (as pictured) there is also what appears to be two anti-tank missiles, likely the locally built and somewhat archaic “Firebird” system , which itself is developed from the generations old 9K111. Supposedly the system recently received a laser-guidance upgrade. AP New ground-mobile point defense system? This ground mobile point air defense system appears to be new, at least to my eyes. It is unclear what type of missiles it uses, although some sort of indigenous command-link guidance and boosted variant of the SA-16 is possible. Still, those strange looking nose elements of whatever is inside the launchers are odd. Also it is unclear how the system would search for targets. Maybe that is a radar array above the left side launch canister that pops up and rotates. AP AP Tricked out special ops North Korea’s special operations forces looked pretty spooky during their march. They were wearing some pretty cool camo, sporting night vision goggles, and toting Type 88s (local AK-74 derivative) with top-folding stocks and helical high-capacity magazines which store at least 100 rounds. These soldiers have the primary mission of infiltrating behind South Korean lines via tunnels, submarines and An-2 biplanes to wreak absolute havoc on the South Korean populace during a time of open warfare between the two estranged countries. AP AP Big state Mercs Last but not least, here is a good look at the S class armored Mercedes limos that port around Kim Jong Un and his top staff. AP What were your thoughts of the display?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 10, 2017",It’s Far Too Soon For The Military Option When It Comes To North Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The potential for a real showdown between the United States and North Korea seems to be manifesting itself via grand displays of force on and around the Korean Peninsula. The US is very publicly loading additional firepower into the region, and North Korea doesn’t seem ready to tamp down on their own form of high-profile militarism—nor on their rhetoric towards the US and its allies in the region. After what seemed to be an embarrassing false start , the White House is in the process of laying the groundwork for something big regarding America’s dealings with Pyongyang. This could amount to anything from garnering support for a large shift in policy towards the reclusive military state, to a preemptive strike aimed at taking out the Kim regime’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. But whatever it is, it is supposedly going to be presented in what will be an unprecedented style of briefing for the entire US Senate at the White House on Wednesday . When it comes to showing the sword, the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group is finally arriving in the region . Along with Japanese Navy and likely South Korean Navy vessels, it will be drilling in the waters off of the Korean Peninsula—a move that has resulted in grandiose threats from Pyongyang . In addition, large scale war games are underway between the US and South Korea near Poncheon, which is located close to South Korea’s northeast border. North Korea has responded with massive exercises of its own, putting to use hundreds of long-range artillery systems during drills near Wonson in what was supposedly one of the largest ever coordinated live-fires by its military. High intensity military drills are underway in both South and North Korea., AP But among all this brandishing of weapons, maybe the most glaring show of force came in the form of the arrival of one of the Pentagon’s most potent conventional weapons—an Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarine that has been converted into a guided missile arsenal ship and special operations platform—at Busan, South Korea. Suffice it to say that the USS Michigan (SSGN-727), nor her three sister ships ( read all about them here ), don’t generally make highly publicized port visits abroad. Seeing her arrival at Busan splashed all over the news today is no accident. It was a carefully orchestrated information warfare play aimed directly at the Kim regime. A massive but near silent nuclear submarine packed with 154 RGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles and a platoon of Navy SEALs isn’t much of a threat unless the bad guys know it is sitting off their coast. Thrusting the submarine into port in Busan and splashing it all over the news makes its presence a guaranteed reality for the Kim regime. The Michigan packs a massive amount of standoff weaponry that theoretically could reach anywhere into North Korea with a high chance of survival. It is in many ways a reminder of just how little the US would need to commit in terms of risking its own warfighters during the opening strikes of a conflict. All of this sounds impressive—and it is to some degree—but to the Kim regime it likely means very little. AP Although North Korea may have their garish military parades , the US has now shown off every single known piece of conventional military hardware to Pyongyang, and it has had zero effect on the Kim regime’s behavior. The USS Michigan’s presence nearby will be no different. Not just that, but its cruise missiles only represent a tiny fraction of the targets that would be needed to be attacked during an open conflict with North Korea. But most importantly, they are nearly useless against the regime itself, which has deeply buried and highly fortified bunkers spread throughout the North Korean countryside—some buried under entire mountains. The only weapon (short of a nuclear barrage) that threatens these bunkers is the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) —but you have to know where all these bunkers are—and where the regime may be hiding—before you can put these exotic and limited weapons to use. Still, don’t be surprised if we get to see the MOP in action in the near term, because the Pentagon has run out of conventional weapons with which to intimidate the North Koreans. With bomber flights over South Korea becoming little more than a lame exercise in routine saber rattling , a highly publicized practice bombing run by a MOP-lugging B-2 Spirit on a range in South Korea could be in our near future. MOP being dropped by a B-52H during a test mission., USAF There are no doubts that North Korea will lose any conflict with the US and its allies, but the loss of life in the process will be extreme. Maybe the worst part of a post-totalitarian North Korea is the psychologically damaged population of 25 million that will become refugees overnight. Not just that, but the North Korean population has already suffered the physical effects of living in a failed state, making them especially vulnerable to the chaotic aftermath that would follow the end of a Kim regime. The possibility of needing to contain a leadership-less North Korea is likely the reasoning behind the widespread reports that both China and Russia have fortified their borders with North Korea in recent days. Regardless of whether or not these reports are true, they are an accurate representation of what would likely occur if the Kim regime were to fall—either through external military action or an internal power struggle. And the former is a real possibility, as the pressure continues to increase on the North Korean regime. Kim Jong Un has consolidated power greatly over the last five years, but that does not mean his rule is totally secure. , AP Although Kim Jong Un has “removed” a large portion of the established power structure he inherited (roughly half, by some accounts), with many of the more pragmatic individuals with close ties to Beijing ending up in front of firing squads, there is still the chance that Kim can be removed from inside. This is not necessarily a positive development: It could throw the country into chaos—at least temporarily. The inner workings of the Kim regime remain somewhat opaque , even to South Korean and the world’s intelligence agencies, and we aren’t talking about gossip related to petty palace intrigue. Predicting what the regime will do when venturing into uncharted territory—and it’s already there to a large degree—is unreliable. Kim’s lust for a credible nuclear deterrent, even at the risk of a conventional preemptive strike, could result in factions within the military elite to turn on him. For many of these old North Korean generals, the only business they know is all about keeping the standoff in place, and business has been very good for many years. For some, ending that status quo so that Kim can chase his dream of a credible nuclear deterrent is likely a risk they have little self interest in taking. The road to that credible nuclear deterrent may have been greatly accelerated in recent months and years as we continue to report on in great detail , but its end is still years away. The North Koreans don’t have an intercontinental ballistic missile, much less a proven and reliable miniaturized nuclear device fitted into a deployable warhead. In fact, they don’t even have a intermediate-range ballistic missile that can reliably threaten the region. And although they are making great strides in mastering solid-fuel rocket technology, it’s very much a work in progress. That doesn’t mean North Korea is not a threat to the region today, because they are. But to the US mainland and Hawaii? Not so much—at least when it comes to using their nuclear weapons and missile technologies in a traditional manner. Of all the missiles paraded around on April 15th’s military parade through Kim Il Sung Square, this elongated Musadan IRBM may pose the the biggest tangible threat for America’s regional allies in the near term, as the Musadan had been flight tested successfully last year. Although its failure rate still leaves much to be desired, North Korea will work out its kinks. North Korea’s solid-fuel, medium-range KN-11 and KN-15 ballistic missiles are also a major source of concern. ., AP This doesn’t mean the North Korean issue is not a major concern that Washington needs to begin actively dealing with on an unprecedented level immediately, but it still doesn’t mean striking the North Korean military—at least targets within its own territory—is warranted at this time. The White House still has at least a couple of years to use every other option first. This includes demanding China dramatically change its policy towards Pyongyang, something it appears to be in the process of doing . If need be, trade with the US must be put on the table to spur Beijing to act to push North Korea to work out some agreement that will avert a horrific conflict. And no, North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons, suddenly adhering to international human rights standards, and thrusting itself out onto the world stage in a grandiose fashion is not going to happen. Trump and Jinping have seemed to come to an agreement to work together to change North Korea’s trajectory. So far China has taken unprecedented steps to follow through, but how long it will last, and how far Beijing will go to avoid a conflict on the Korean Peninsula remains anyone’s guess., AP A much more realistic deal would include Kim freezing his nuclear weapons and delivery systems programs, as well as limiting the number and types of operational ballistic missiles in his arsenal. At the same time, North Korea would garner certain assurances and benefits from the US, South Korea, and the world community as a whole. This could include a non-aggression pact and a deal to deliver tightly prescribed food stuffs and energy supplies in return for cooperation. The removal of some US military capabilities in South Korea would also likely be part of such a deal. Most importantly, this could include axing the deployment of America’s THAAD anti-ballistic missile system to the Peninsula—a move that would make China very happy as well. Other moves to scale back the alert posture on both sides along the DMZ may be also possible, but the main thing is to create a jumping off point from the current march to war, and then work on that progress to further the situation in a positive manner. Military activity around North Korea’s borders has reached a fevered pitch, with intelligence gathering flights using a whole slew of aircraft being deployed to build up a near real-time intelligence profile on the reclusive military state. , AP Yes, this means North Korea would be able to keep their pocket arsenal of nuclear weapons, but they could not test them, expand their arsenal, nor could they continue development of a reliable delivery system to work in conjunction with it. This keeps the US mainland outside of North Korea’s reach. This may seem less than optimal, but such a framework would be a reflection of reality of where we are at today with the situation. And better this than a reality where Kim has achieved a reliable long-range missile capability that threatens the US mainland, not to mention throngs of shorter-range missiles that have South Korea, Japan, and other US allies in their crosshairs . The deal would also keep his arsenal from becoming one stocked with hundreds of nuclear warheads , rather than a couple dozen, and would keep North Korea’s nuclear designs and components from being exported for hard currency to other rogue actors around the globe. Above all else, it is also better than a war where many thousands die, the world economy shatters and unpredictable geopolitical consequences plague American foreign policy in the region for decades to come. Vice President Pence hopscotched around the region recently in what seemed to be an effort to build support for a new strategy in regards to North Korea. Here he is seen getting out of a Black Hawk while visiting South Korea., AP So yes, Trump has some options to move through before a preemptive strike in North Korean territory would be warranted. And as we discussed before, swatting Kim’s test missiles out of the sky once they enter international airspace is one of them, but it comes with its own risks. Not only is North Korea’s reaction an unknown—and could result in a quick “tit-for-tat” escalation that runs out of control—but it could also show off embarrassing vulnerabilities in American, Japanese, and soon to be Korean naval-based anti-ballistic missile capabilities. We simply don’t appear to be even there yet, and electronic warfare and cyber intrusion may be able to keep key telemetry and missile performance data from North Korean scientists without the need for a kinetic attack. So as the Senate convenes in the White House tomorrow for its high-profile brief, hopefully cooler heads have already prevailed and the levers of diplomacy can take their time to have an affect. As we have discussed time and time again, there is no good military solution when it comes to the North Korean issue, and the stakes are far higher attacking a North Korean target than a derelict airfield in western Syria . We will have to see what Senators’ reactions are after the brief, but if it sounded anything like the case for invading Iraq in 2002 and early 2003, we should all be very, very concerned. And as far as military posturing goes, sure it may be an abstract tool to put pressure on the Kim regime in an attempt to have it change its ways, but it invites substantial risk in itself, and it is an unsustainable tactic at that.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2018",China Launches Its First Home-Built Clone Of An Aircraft Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has launched its first home-built aircraft carrier—a clone of the Russian Kuznetsov class carrier Beijing obtained through a dizzying transfer scheme executed nearly two decades ago. Since then, China restored the rusting hulk of that carrier, known originally as Riga , into its first operational carrier, the Liaoning (CV-16). Deeply refurbishing a carrier that many thought was unsalvageable gave China a thorough understanding of how the ship was built, which was absolutely necessary in order for the country to construct a carrier on its own. As such, China’s home-built carrier is truly an example of reverse engineering on a grand scale. Today’s launch is not only a logical step, but also an impressive one that brings Beijing closer towards achieving its goal of fielding a robust carrier-borne naval aviation capability. It will also work as a springboard for developing an entirely original carrier design that leverages catapult and other more complex technologies. Defense analysts have closely watched the relatively fast construction of this new aircraft carrier over the last few years at Dalian Shipyards. In recent months, it was apparent that the vessel was nearing completion, and last week a launch of the vessel, known now only as Type 001A, was deemed imminent. It is unclear what her exact designation will be, but pennant number CV-17 is almost certain, and the name Shandong is rumored to be her title once she is commissioned. AP The carrier is nearly identical to its foreign-born sister ship, although there are slight differences. Its planform has some small modifications—a nip here and a tuck there. Our friends over at CSIS have kept a really close eye on this new Kuznetsov class derivative and concluded that these are the small differences between Type 001 and Type 001A: The control tower island of the Type 001A is approximately 10 percent smaller than that of the Liaoning . It displaces roughly 65,000 – 70,000 tons, a few thousand more tons than the Liaoning . It features the advanced Type 346 S-band AESA radar system. Its air wing is expected to be slightly larger than that of the Liaoning , featuring around 8 additional aircraft. The Type 001A may have an internal arrangement that is better optimized than the Liaoning’s . This new carrier will become active around 2020, and will serve alongside Liaoning as China’s primary means of power projection throughout the region. But before then, it will require its sub-systems to be installed, including its sensors and defensive weapons, and it will have to go through a series of sea trials and certification activities before officially being deemed fit for duty. AP Since it has two very similar aircraft carriers in service, China will have optimized its ability to keep one of the vessels ready for deployment, on deployment or undergoing training at any given time. China can also amortize its investment in developing and fielding its carrier-borne J-15 fighter—which is also an indigenously-built clone of an existing Russian design. In this casem it is a updated version of Russia’s Sukhoi Su-33 that has operated aboard the country’s only carrier— the Admiral Kuznetsov —for nearly 30 years. Beijing can also make better use of other investments in infrastructure, support capabilities, and manpower with two similar vessels in inventory at the same time. China’s J-15 carrier-borne fighter., Garudtejas7/wikicommons Much is made of China’s aircraft carriers and their capabilities versus America’s nuclear powered supercarrier force. This debate is really just a distraction as these ships are not meant to go toe-to-toe with their American counterparts, especially not in a “blue sea” vacuum-like combat environment. Instead, these carriers and the flotillas that will accompany them are meant to project power on a regional scale—to dominate small nations and their territorial claims within China’s immediate sphere of influence—and to maintain parity, if not outright superiority, within the naval realm among more powerful potential foes, such as India and Japan. Liaoning with her air wing embarked., Photo by VCG/Getty Images Above all else, this ship and the aircraft that will dot its deck, is part of a long-term plan in which China aims to make steady progress towards mastering naval aviation, and having a plentiful carrier force of their own. It seems that most indications put such a force at roughly six ships. But they won’t all look like the Type 001A—instead the People’s Liberation Army Navy will quickly ditch the ski-jump configuration and move to a catapult launch system configuration, better known as CATOBAR (catapult aircraft take-off barrier arrested recovery) . By doing so, China will realize far higher sortie rates, a larger range of aircraft it can deploy, and the ability to send jets off with full fuel and weapons payloads from its future carriers. AP It is thought that China will start building a CATOBAR carrier design, dubbed the Type 002, now that this new ship has been launched or possibly after one more Type 001A class carrier is constructed. China has been testing steam catapults—and what appears to be a system similar to the Navy’s magnetic EMALS catapult system—for some time now at a specially-built facility similar to the Navy’s Lakehurst test center . A J-15 specially modified for catapult operations, featuring a nose gear launch bar, has also been spotted. India is also working to field a CATOBAR carrier as well, with a design that will feature EMALS technology (via the US), as well as nuclear power, slated to be in service in the mid to late 2020s. Above all else, constructing the Type 001A has given China direct insight on how to build a massive war fighting ship, and specifically one capable of operating large fixed-wing fighters from its deck. As a result, the country has made a giant leap toward successfully generating the necessary set of skills to build even more complex CATOBAR carriers in the not so distant future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 26, 2017",Israel Strikes Supposed Arms Depot At Syria’s Damascus International Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The outskirts of Syria’s capital were rocked in the early hours on Thursday by what is now reported to have been an air strike conducted by the Israeli Air Force on a compound located on the southwestern edge of Damascus International Airport. According to Reuters , the targeted facility supposedly was the location of a large weapons depot housing arms that were destined for Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shiite militias. The strike occurred at around 3:30AM local time, with a resulting fire lighting up the night sky over southeast Damascus. No casualties at the site have been reported. The Bashar al Assad government has already blamed Israel for the attack, and Israel doesn’t seem apt to deny that claim. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Army Radio this morning the following concerning the attack : “I can confirm that the incident in Syria corresponds completely with Israel’s policy to act to prevent Iran’s smuggling of advanced weapons via Syria to Hezbollah in Iran. Naturally, I don’t want to elaborate on this…The prime minister has said that whenever we receive intelligence that indicated an intention to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah, we will act.” Damascus International Airport, Google Earth Supposedly the depot is used to supply multiple Iranian-backed militias operating in Syria, not just Hezbollah, although Hezbollah largely coordinates their operations. The weapons are dropped off regularly by Iranian cargo jets that are a frequent fixture at the airport. The fact that this facility seems to be more like a distribution hub for war fighting material than a distinct weapons cache or advanced arms caravan that is destined for Hezbollah’s forces in Lebanon could mark a major escalation in Israel’s interdiction operations in the war torn country. If this ends up being accurate, and the facility directly supports Assad’s war fighting efforts, its destruction could enrage the regime far more than the destruction of the far more discreet shipments that Israel has struck in the past. Israeli incursions into Syrian airspace and strikes against weapons transfers that are destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon have been a sporadic occurrence in recent years, but have accelerated quite drastically in recent months. For the first time, the Assad regime fired on IAF jets that were carrying out one of these operations on March 17th—a move that resulted in one of the Syrian SAMs being intercepted by an Israeli Arrow anti-ballistic missile. This incident marked the start of a rapid crescendo of saber rattling between Damascus and Jerusalem. F-16I Sufa., IAF The reinvigorated Assad regime quickly stated it would no longer tolerate the strikes, and Israel replied that it could and would wipe out Assad’s air defenses if their aircraft are threatened. In response, the Assad regime said it would rain down Scud missiles on Israeli ports and air bases if the operations continue. There has been absolutely no sign that Israel would scale back its operations over Syria as a result of Damascus’s threats. Prime Minister Netanyahu has kept to the narrative that the strikes are defensive in nature as the weapons—some of them quite advanced —are meant to be used against Israel during a future conflict. We will have to see what happens after this somewhat bold strike. Although Israel possesses highly advanced electronic warfare and cyber intrusion capabilities that have proven very capable against Assad’s air defenses, the window in which IAF aircraft can operate with near impunity over western Syria may be closing. Russia has proclaimed that they would begin to upgrade Assad’s air defenses after the US strike against Shayrat Air Base . At the same time, three more F-35Is have arrived in Israel, which makes the IAF’s current “Adir” inventory set at five aircraft. With four months of bedding down behind them, and with the USAF’s F-35As and USMC’s F-35Bs making their first operational trip overseas, it is only a matter of time before the IAF declares its F-35s operational. Whether or not the IAF would use their new stealth fighters for these types of missions is a whole other story. Unless Assad’s organic air defenses do end up getting upgraded, or if future targets emerge that are in close proximity to Russia’s advanced air defenses in Syria, and if Russia officially shuts the airspace off to the IAF, it is highly doubtful. The fact is that Israel doesn’t really need to penetrate Syrian airspace to hit targets, even moving ones, inside the country. Israel’s armed forces have weapons specifically designed for this type of mission that can be launched at standoff ranges and controlled in real time. This enables them to be highly accurate—even against targets like fast-moving vehicles. The IAF’s drone force can also hit these smaller targets, and some of those drones are designed with a one-way trip in mind . We will keep this post updated with any new information as it becomes available over the next 24 hours. Update 1:10pm PST: An Israeli Patriot missile battery fired on and supposedly downed an unmanned aircraft over the Golan Heights.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 20, 2016",Air Force Releases Causes Of Recent B-52 And U-2 Crashes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New information has come to light regarding two major mishaps we covered in detail here at The War Zone. The first has to do with the total loss of a B-52H Stratofortress that was taking off from Andersen AFB in Guam last May. The second is regarding the total loss of a TU-2S Dragon Lady trainer in Sutter County, California last September. All crew escaped safely from the incident involving the B-52, but, sadly, one of the two pilots involved in the U-2 crash was not so fortunate. The B-52 crashed upon takeoff after the aircraft’s crew saw birds flying at roughly the same height as the airplane’s wings, followed by the sensation of a series of “thuds” on the B-52’s right side. Three of the B-52’s eight engines were observed operating below optimal takeoff performance following right after the potential run-in with birds occurred, and a fourth engine was displaying a high oil-pressure warning light. A sharp yaw from left to right indicating asymmetric thrust was also abruptly felt by the crew. These factors prompted the B-52’s pilots to execute an aborted takeoff procedure at 142 knots, which included deploying the aircraft’s drag chute at 135 knots, and slamming on the brakes. The chute ruptured on deployment and the aircraft’s brakes failed after exceeding their design limits, resulting in the bomber plowing its way roughly 300 feet beyond the runway’s extended threshold. The aircraft, which was laden with fuel at the time, burst into flames. Although the crew escaped, the B-52 was a total loss. Although bird activity was clearly a contributing factor to the mishap, and it is a chronic cause of mishaps and damage across the USAF’s fleet, it is not clear if the engines ever sucked in any birds at all as no organic residue was found during the investigation. Still, the aircraft was badly burned so it is possible that ingestion had occurred but did not manifest itself as it regularly would during examination. In the end, mechanical issues, such as the engine oil pressure alert, as well as the failed drag chute doomed the jet. You can read the whole mishap report here . The TU-2S crash in California has now been attributed to pilot error. The incident occurred during the first of three “acceptance flights” for a pilot that was “interviewing” to become part of the elite U-2 pilot cadre. The pilot was executing training that brought the U-2 to the edge of a stall. The maneuvers are used to familiarize new pilots with the how a U-2 feels before it enters a stall, and how to recover from such an event if it were to occur. The U-2 is infamous for its challenging handling qualities, especially at slow speeds around the landing pattern. During the recovery procedure, the new pilot inadvertently commanded the aircraft into a second stall. This event resulted in an abrupt wing drop to the left, leaving the TU-2S with its nose approaching nearly perpendicular to the ground. With decreasing altitude left for a safe recovery from the deep stall and an extremely depressed attitude, the instructor U-2 pilot called for an ejection. The trainee U-2 pilot separated safely from the aircraft, but the instructor pilot and his ejection seat impacted the U-2’s right wing, which caused fatal trauma. The Dragon Lady trainer quickly impacted a remote hillside below, leaving strewn debris and a large scorch mark. In the end, veteran U-2 pilot Lt. Col. Ira Eadie died as a result of the mishap.

Just looking at the size of the CH-53E’s tail rotor, and its close proximity to the operators below, is a bit bewildering. You can imagine that the swimmers being deployed would want to get away from its rotating blades as fast as possible, especially considering the water and the helicopter itself can bob in the vertical dimension at any given moment. If the Facebook embedded video below does not appear for some reason, here is the direct link. Helocasting is used to quickly insert small teams of soldiers in the water, and sometimes it includes the deployment of rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBS), commonly referred to as Zodiacs or combat rubber raiding craft (CRRC). The deployment of these boats can come in three forms—hard duck, soft duck, and rolled duck. Hard duck is where the RHIB is fully inflated and ready to go when it is inserted into the water, which is likely what we see here. Soft duck is where the RHIB is partially inflated, with the operators pumping it up full of air once in the water. Rolled duck is where the boat is not pumped up at all when it is dropped from the aircraft. Which of these methods is used for an operation is predicated upon what helicopter is being used for the insertion—and specifically its size—as well as the mission’s requirements. Soft Duck configuration in back of a CH-46 Sea Knight., USMC The H-60 Black Hawk crews utilize the “soft duck” delivery method, also known as a K-cast, or “Kangaroo Cast,” by strapping the RHIB to the bottom of the helicopter. Here a USAF Pave Hawk is seen executing such a mission., USAF There is even a dynamic recovery operation available for the RHIB and its occupants. This action movie like extraction method is dubbed the “Delta Queen” maneuver and is used by some of the countries who operate the CH-47 Chinook. In this case, the team literally drives the RHIB up the ramp of the Chinook, with the rear of the helicopter being partially submerged in the water. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7_eV4Y1DIao In the case of the CH-53E video, the Super Stallion nearly dipped its ramp into the water while the special operations team deployed their RHIB—a great display of fine control by the big triple turbine engined helicopter’s pilots. The CH-53Es are tired machines , and the USMC had until recently neglected their upkeep and their community horribly , but their replacement is on the way. Although it won’t come cheap, the CH-53K is absolutely necessary to the USMC’s mission, and its operational debut is coming in fast . Other international customers will likely emerge as well for the “King Stallion,” with Israel, Germany and Japan being likely adopters of America’s most powerful and expensive helicopter. In the meantime, the “Shitter” will continue to soldier on— sling loading vehicles , hauling around Marines, and helocasting special ops teams into the seas—just as it has done for nearly the last four decades.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 25, 2017",It’s a North Korean Missile Media Frenzy!,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The media has been waiting with bated breath for North Korea to test another ballistic missile or to detonate another nuclear device. Yesterday, the Kim regime did one of those things, firing off a ballistic missile in defiance of the world. What followed were an avalanche of reports that varied widely concerning the details of the launch, the nature of its results, and even what missile was fired. The mismatching of missile types, their supposed range classes, and their potential capabilities were an omnipresent component of this instant tidal wave of raw speculation. It quickly appeared that the media had largely settled on the idea that the missile fired was a KN-17—the Scud/Hwasong/Nodong derivative that appeared to have a maneuverable warhead vehicle —resulting in bold claims that North Korea had tested its “carrier killer” missile to intimidate the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group now operating in the region. Wow, that escalated quickly, right? The truth is we only know a handful of facts about the launch. This is PACOM’s official statement: PACOM The missile was supposedly launched on an extremely steep trajectory. South Korea says it reached an altitude of 44 miles, flying for roughly 15 minutes while only traveling about 22 miles down-range before blowing up. Many outlets and pundits turned the missile’s failure to reach the sea into a laughing matter. First off, we have no idea at all if this launch was actually a failure. With anti-ballistic missile capable American and Japanese Aegis destroyers on high alert in the region, and with tensions very high, North Korea may have decided to execute the test within their own territorial boundaries, opting for a very steep parabolic trajectory instead of cross-range performance. The missile’s abrupt end could have been a command destruction, not an inadvertent failure. North Korea’s supposed KN-17 with its maneuvering fins on its warhead vehicle. , AP As for North Korea’s little “carrier killer,” well we really don’t know if the KN-17 was actually the missile tested, and it is highly doubtful it is anywhere near capable of actually engaging a surface vessel at this time. It is more likely that the missile, if it indeed exists as a real concept that North Korea is actually testing, will be designed to maneuver dynamically during its terminal phase of flight to make interception more challenging. Considering that THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system is now coming online in South Korea, accelerating development of a short-range ballistic missile with such a capability makes sense. But making a warhead vehicle travel erratically during its terminal phase of flight is a far cry from striking a moving and highly defended aircraft carrier far out at sea. To use a similar technology to attack an aircraft carrier or other large ship, North Korea would have to master a cocktail of challenging technologies. These include the ability to reliably provide initial and possibly mid-course targeting of the naval target via some sort of secure, over-the-horizon data-link, and a sensor platform that can detect and track a carrier and survive doing so. Land-based over-the-horizon radar may be able to provide some detection and tracking of ships far out to sea, but they are extremely vulnerable to attack and they wouldn’t likely provide precise enough coordinates for an anti-ship ballistic missile like the notional KN-17 to leverage effectively. Not to mention that North Korea doesn’t seem to even possess such a radar system. The missile’s maneuvering payload vehicle would also need a form of terminal homing, like an infrared or radar seeker that can survive extreme thermal loads and be effective even when advanced countermeasures are deployed. This is very high-tech equipment for North Korea to build, successfully test, and put into operation in a reliable format. China has spent years and billions of dollars working to develop and field a similar capability, with elaborate testing done against carrier-like silhouettes in the country’s desert frontier. There is no doubt that North Korea has shown high interest in this type of naval area-denial weapon system in the past, but just because they can mock something up that looks the part for a parade doesn’t mean they can actually implement such a capability at this time, even for testing purposes. Considering the DF-17 is basically a Scud/Hwasong/Nodong missile with a maneuvering warhead section/reentry vehicle, why couldn’t yesterday’s test just have been of one of these standard short to intermediate range missiles instead of a DF-17? In fact, this is a far more probable explanation and we have no real evidence that a maneuvering warhead vehicle was present on the test missile in question. The missile’s launch location, near Pukchang, is also somewhat odd. Roughly 50 miles from the North Korea’s western coastline, and 70 miles from its eastern coastline, it is a strange place to test a ballistic missile. Although there is a handful of large airfields nearby that are known for their fortified underground bunkers, using the area as a ballistic missile test launch complex seems odd. But if the goal is to keep a test missile within the bounds of North Korean territory, the location makes quite a bit of sense. In the past month, two other launches attributed (probably falsely) to the KN-17 occurred at Sinpo, which is appropriately located on North Korea’s central eastern coast. But these launches occurred before a phalanx of anti-ballistic missile capable destroyers moved into the region, and just as the Trump administration’s rhetoric was heating up. When you look deeper to find any hard evidence that the DF-17 has ever been tested you can’t find anything more than reports based on a few undisclosed sources. That’s not to say that the missile hasn’t been launched, but there is little proof that it actually has, and especially multiple times in succession. Considering it was one of the “stars” of North Korea’s April 15th “Day of the Sun” parade , and giddy defense reporters began extrapolating elaborately from there, it seems that any Scud-like short to intermediate range missile test is now attributed to the DF-17 with no real facts to back it up. All this isn’t that surprising as the media has been hyper-focused on events on and around the Korean Peninsula since the Trump Administration began giving hard indications that a military intervention of the Kim regime’s missile and nuclear programs was imminent. In the end these threats proved to be hollow, and thankfully the White House has made an about face and is now publicly seeking a diplomatic solution to the standoff, with military action being once again reserved as a defensive measure. Department of State So with media big and small still on what seems to be a sugar high supplied by the daily North Korean headlines streaming out of Washington, they are quick to label any North Korean military activity as either a laughable failure or an ominous sign of an impending attack. As we stated a year ago when Pyongyang began changing its missile development strategy, the truth is that even in failure, North Korean scientists learn more about their various missiles in development or about ones already deployed. With this data they can continue to tweak their designs, making existing missiles more reliable and capable of longer range or of carrying heavier payloads, or improving designs being tested so that one day they may become operational. Another area of hyperbole surrounding North Korea’s missile program is that now every missile seems to magically use solid propellant—even liquid fueled Scud derivatives like the KN-17. In fact, many media sources state that the DF-17 is solid fueled, when there seems to be no indication of that being true. If anything its the opposite way around, with all indications being that the missile relies on liquid fuel just like its progenitors. North Korea is still in the early stages of solid-fuel missile development, and has had some success, most likely with its submarine-launched KN-11 and its land-based KN-15 derivative . But just because these programs seem to be leveraging solid fuel technology, it doesn’t mean that overnight Pyongyang’s entire missile arsenal has been re-designed and re-deployed to do the same. That’s simply not how it works. In the end just be careful what you believe when reading, watching or listening about any shadowy new weapon emanating out of the Hermit Kingdom. Often times even major NGOs will be wrong about some aspects to some missile programs that defense bloggers are right on, and visa-versa. In other words, nobody has the entire picture—not even US or South Korean intelligence agencies—and those who seem quickest to “bring you all the details,” and speak definitively about any of these questionable programs, are often the least accurate at doing so. In the meantime, no our carriers are not sitting ducks for North Korea’s fantasy missiles, and just because a missile blew up after being aloft for 15 minutes it doesn’t mean that such event was unplanned or that the test was a failure. And no, not every short-range ballistic missile that is fired off from North Korean territory going forward is a “KN-17.” If anything else, this all shows how successful North Korea’s propaganda machine, and its great missile parade, has been at brainwashing the western press.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 13, 2017",Japan’s Biggest Helicopter Carrier To Provide Escort For US Supply Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan is deploying its newest and largest helicopter carrier, the Izumo , to escort a US supply vessel from the waters off Tokyo south, and possibly into the Sea of Japan. There it is supposedly tasked to rendezvous with vessels associated with the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group . At that time it is highly possible that the Izumo will also join the growing armada of vessels exercising off the Korean Peninsula in an effort to put increasing pressure on North Korea and possibly to contain or respond to additional missile and nuclear tests ordered by the Kim Jong Un regime. The mission sounds somewhat odd, as US supply vessels traverse the region without escort regularly, but this is likely more of a show of force and an exercise in interoperability among allies than anything else—although there is clearly a naval threat posed by the North Koreans. The mission also underlines the reality that during a time of war, especially against a peer competitor, there would be few sea lanes in the region that won’t be under threat, especially from attacks by lurking enemy submarines. Izumo is imposing in size to say the least., AP Without a constant stream of consumables, spare parts, jet fuel and other materials, America’s supercarriers and amphibious assault ships become useless liabilities, and the phalanx of escorts that protect them rely on copious amounts of fuel to remain on station. “Logistics win wars,” as they say, and keeping America’s vast array of supply ships moving safely to where they need to go would be a major priority and a major challenge if conflict were to break out in the region. This is where the Izumo can be useful. The carrier is especially adept at working as a anti-submarine warfare platform, with the ability to create a large screen around the ships it protects via its embarked sub-hunting helicopters. It can also provide mine sweeping, surveillance, command and control and other capabilities in addition to additional fuel carriage—especially aviation fuels—which can be pushed to other assets like guided missile destroyers. Hyuga with SH-60Ks deployed aboard., USN Although the Izumo class is far larger than its predecessor, the Hyuga class “helicopter destroyer,” the smaller Hyuga class is really a better fit for the job of independent escort duty. The Hyuga class ships displace 19,000 tons fully loaded, while the Izumo class displaces up to 27,000 tons, and they carry fewer helicopters, 20 versus the Izumo’s 28 (less are carried by both classes for normal ops). When it comes to length, the Izumo class also dwarfs Hyuga class class, clocking in at 814 feet versus 614 feet. Yet the Hyuga class features two Mark 41 vertical launch systems (VLS). This allows them to provide area air defense for themselves and any ships directly under their escort umbrella. The ship’s 16 VLS cells are filled with RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs), four of which can be quad-packed into a single VLS cell, and RUM-139 vertical-launch ASROC rocket propelled anti-submarine torpedoes. Hyuga at dock. You can see the twin Mark 41 VLS system near the edge of the ship’s aft deck area. , AP These two weapons, along with its embarked anti-submarine helicopter force, give the Hyuga class the ability or defend itself and ships under its protective custody from submarine and air breathing threats at standoff distances. The vessel’s ESSM capability also means Hyuga can sail into all but the highest threat environments without the need of a multi-billion dollar Aegis capable destroyer nearby. The convoy escort mission eats up a lot of end strength, and the US Navy is not well setup for the realities of this unsexy but demanding mission set. Only US destroyers and cruisers can provide a credible anti-air capability, and there isn’t enough of those multi-billion dollar ships to go around as it is. You can read more about this issue and a possible solution for it here , but the fact that Japan’s Hyuga class can provide both very high-end anti-submarine capability and area air defense is a huge plus. It also means that ship can operate independently, without the need for an escort of its own. The larger Izumo class does not feature a VLS system—it just has Rolling Airframe Missiles and Phalanx CIWS for close-in self protection. This is likely due to the idea that for most missions it will usually have destroyer escorts. This makes sense not just because of the size of these ships but also because they have more of a marine assault capability than their Hyuga class predecessors, with the ability to deploy with 400 Marines and roughly 50 light vehicles at the ready. And just because Japan’s SH-60 and MCH-101 maritime helicopters makeup the ship’s primary air wing, the massive Izumo can deploy anything in the Japanese Self Defense Forces rotary-wing arsenal. This includes everything from Chinooks to Apaches, giving the ship an over-the-horizon heavy lift and strike capability if needed. Izumo during docking procedures. , AP North Korea presents no real fixed-wing aviation threat against vessels operating in the region, but they do have what appears to be a budding shore defense capability based on their indigenous version of the Kh-35 anti-ship missile . Their hodgepodge of missile corvettes and handful of larger surface combatants rely largely on dated Soviet-era systems, including older anti-ship cruise missiles. These assets have to get close enough to their targets to acquire good targeting data in order to have any chance of a successful and accurate ship-to-ship engagement. Otherwise they would have to let loose a missile to find anything to attack on its own within a certain area, a reckless tactic that can have unforeseen consequences . As a result, even the close-in kinetic defensive capabilities aboard a ship like Izumo— along with its potent radar system, decoys, electronic warfare capabilities and early warning systems — should be able to handle such threats. And really, the Izumo won’t come close to North Korean shores to begin with, and considering how many allied vessels are operating in the area, surface vessels pose little threat to the helicopter carrier or of the ships she escorts relatively from Korean shores. The Seahawk helicopter makes up the backbone of Japan’s sub-hunting capability and are both classes of “helicopter destroyers” primary aerial asset. , AP What could be something of a threat is North Korea’s old but plentiful diesel-electric submarine force. This is maybe one of Pyongyang’s most under-estimated military capabilities. Often this submarine force is blown off as “noisy” and “rusting” but quantity has a quality all its own. In the past, North Korea’s Navy has shown itself almost freakishly capable of sortieing a large portion of their submarine force suddenly, and it is fairly well known that trying to keep tabs on dozens of submarines at once has been challenging for the South Koreans, the US and its allies. Although this somewhat simplistic submarine force may not prove dangerous to an American Carrier Strike Group, especially one that has been augmented by the South Korean Navy and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Forces, but a defenseless and unescorted resupply ship or fleet oiler moving into the region, that may be another story. Obviously the North Koreans firing a torpedo at a South Korean, US or allied supply ship would be a massive escalation, but its not unheard of, and that doesn’t mean training as if it were a threat is a bad idea. This is likely the essence of the the Izumo’s mission. At the very least, it will give the big vessel something to do as it makes its way to its station, which could include meeting up with the Car Vinson Carrier Strike Group and its armada of allied surface combatants. Hyuga seen during multi-national naval drills., USN It isn’t clear at this time if this mission will mark the beginning of Izumo’s highly anticipated three month long deployment to the South China Sea and beyond. When the deployment was originally announced months ago, early May was supposed to be when it would begin. France has also sent one of their Mistral class amphibious assault ships , the Mistral , around the world on a similar deployment, it having arrived at Japan’s naval base in Sasebo this weekend. Mistral with her well deck and rear aircraft elevator visible., AP Mistral , which also has Royal Navy helicopters aboard, is scheduled to participate in a multi-national marine landing exercise on Tinian Island near Guam in the coming weeks. From there it will likely head toward the tumultuous waters of the South China Sea, although with the situation on the Korean Peninsula becoming so volatile, who knows where it will end up.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 15, 2017",Trump’s Openness to Direct Talks With Kim Jong Un Is Still a Good Idea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Trump said today that he is willing to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in an attempt to diffuse the escalating crisis on the Korean Peninsula, telling Bloomberg News “If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it. If it’s under the, again, under the right circumstances. But I would do that.” Trump added, “Most political people would never say that, but I’m telling you under the right circumstances I would meet with him.” The comments came as news broke that America’s controversial THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system that has been installed in an accelerated fashion on a golf course in South Korea has come online, and is now officially deemed operational. Most people would likely say that it is never appropriate to have the leader of the free world talk directly to a deviant despot like Kim Jung Un. For others, there are sure to be many different ideas of what “the right circumstances” would have to be in order to make such a meeting possible. Most within the Washington establishment would probably agree those circumstances would be nothing like they are in reality today—not even close. But White House press secretary Sean Spicer seems to have an idea of what those circumstances could look like for the Trump administration, and they don’t seem like too much of an ask, really. “Clearly conditions are not there right now … We’ve got to see their provocative behavior ratcheted down,” Spicer said. The idea of “elevating” a rogue regime that puts large portions of its population in brutal labor camps and executes by means of anti-aircraft guns and other exotic methods anyone its ruler thinks may defy or challenge him—not to mention the whole still-at-war-with-South-Korea, the nuclear weapons, and the missile-development issues—by giving its leader the opportunity to meet with the leader of free world is seen as a non-starter by most in the diplomatic community. And it has been argued that doing so would legitimize the regime and its heinous activities. But look where this thinking has gotten us: more than 60 years after the Korean War ended there is still no closure to that conflict, and the security situation is rapidly deteriorating in the region, with the US mainland likely coming within reach of Kim’s ballistic missiles by the beginning of the new decade. Trump sees himself as the world’s greatest negotiator. Why not give him the shot to prove his skills with the North Koreans?, AP The fact is that this isn’t the first time Trump has stated that he would negotiate directly with Kim Jong Un. He did so at the end of the primary season last May . Although his strange fascination with the strongmen tyrants of the world is nauseating, Trump’s willingness to attempt to usher in a new paradigm when it comes to the North Korean issue is a breath of fresh air. Not just that, but talking with North Korea unilaterally at the highest levels has little downside if framed properly: as another step to do anything possible to achieve peace, even if there are low expectations for success. I wrote about this in detail last May following Trump’s admission that he would meet with Kim directly, here was my take on the issue: “The fact of the matter is that the North Koreans have had one major ask over the last decade-and-a-half of fragmented negotiations: unilateral negotiations with the United States, which they still ask for today. The US has been absolutely steadfast in not granting this single request, and it’s infuriated the North Koreans. Sure, old-school diplomatic insiders and traditional pundits will say that doing so will simply elevate the North Korean regime and lend legitimacy to Kim Jong Un’s rule. Well, guess what? Kim Jong Un is the ruler of North Korea whether you like it or not, and considering that we’ve talked to other dictators in the past, and have even subsidized their power structure , why is talking to Kim Jong Un any different? Above all, the long-standing policy toward North Korea has been a therapeutic solution at best. Now that the North Korean state is racing towards long-range nuclear ballistic missile capability and miniaturizing its nuclear warheads, the time for a change in our diplomatic strategy has clearly come. Simply sitting down with Kim Jong Un, or at least having high-level unilateral negotiations with officials from both sides, will change the game and will at the very least allow us to see if this new approach is capable of being effective or not. Going into the room with an incredibly strong package—including energy and food resources, a structured plan to open up the North Korean economy to foreign investment, illustrating what the lifting of harsh sanctions will look like for the North Koreans, and a route for normalization and reconciliation with South Korea—will provide the best shot at ending 60 years of bitter and dangerous tension. In addition, China and other nations can be a major part of this opportunity, but the US has to lead it and a President should deliver it. Doing so will mark an unprecedented and powerful diplomatic gesture, one that North Korea will know they won’t likely ever get again. If such an effort fails miserably, what’s lost? Nothing tangible. The North Koreans will spin their state-level propaganda any way they want, regardless of the outcome. They do it every day. The US will look like it’s serious about peace on the world stage, and is willing to do anything it can to see the tension on the Korean Peninsula come to an amicable end. For those who think it will embarrass the United States, I ask how so? If we come ready to make a deal and North Korea clearly does not, we would then be more certain of their intentions than ever, and could adjust our foreign policy and military footprint accordingly. It’s not as if the world community thinks highly of North Korea as it is; if they decided to walk away, or not show up at all, they would just go back to being the dangerous, clown-like regime they were before.” There is always some common ground—both Trump and Kim seem to love ribbon cutting ceremonies., AP Although President Trump may be among the most “love-hate” Presidents of all time, it is worth applauding him for being willing to get hands-on with this critical issue, including being willing look Kim Jong Un in the eye and make a case for peace and a better way forward for the North Korean people. He can also make it clear that the US will not allow him to obtain a long-range delivery system like an ICBM. As I put in my earlier piece on the subject, the President should not be above this type of engagement in the first place: “Finally, this proposition brings up the question of how, exactly, we as Americans view the President of the United States. Has the office become a royalty-like position, one where the king or queen does not dirty their hands with such unpleasant matters as direct peace negotiations with a bitter foe? Or does the President work for the American people to better our situation in any way possible, including using his power directly and in person to negotiate monumental deals even with our most dangerous enemies? I would like to think it’s the latter. The office was never supposed to be “above” so many tasks of state; the fact that it has become so over the years is not a welcome, or beneficial, development. As for the hardliner “we don’t talk to our enemies” crowd, usually of the neoconservative variety, Ronald Reagan directly engaged the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. The personal relationship between Reagan and Gorbachev that resulted from this approach was key to ending the most perilous standoff in the history of the world. Why is this fact selectively unaccounted for by the same folks who seem to admire Reagan’s every move? It’s not like talking to one’s enemies about a clear path to peace, while also illustrating how bad the alternative option would be in a military sense, is an ineffective geopolitical negotiating strategy. If anything, it’s proven to be the most effective in modern times. You make think Trump is a blustering fool, and he may lack critical foreign and defense policy knowledge , but on this one issue he has the right idea—one that, to be honest, is refreshing to hear.” It is likely China would also back this sort of engagement, and could even help with making it happen. The fact that America’s THAAD anti-ballistic missile system has gone active while this news was breaking is a reminder not just of how the region is becoming increasingly militarized and at an alarming rate, but also that China, which directly opposes THAAD’s deployment, has interests that are also morphing and becoming more complex due to North Korea’s unchecked belligerence. THAAD being installed on the first hole of a golf course in South Korea., AP It will be interesting to see if Pyongyang responds in some way to Trump’s overture—the first of its kind he has made while being President of the United States of America.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",Russia’s Massive Arctic “Research” Submarine Will Be The World’s Longest,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The record for the world’s longest submarine has been held by the massive Soviet-era Typhoon class for nearly the last four decades. That is about to change as Russia’s currently under construction arctic “research” submarine, which is a highly modified variant of the Oscar II class of nuclear-powered guided missile subs, will be lengthened from 505 feet to (roughly) an even more impressive 604 feet. The Typhoon boats, of which just one remains in limited service , have a length of 574 feet. The Oscar II class, which was made famous by the loss of the Kursk in 2000, is already a hulking design. Its wide beam is necessary so that angled anti-ship cruise missile launch tubes, 24 in total, can line their outer hulls. Each of these tubes houses a single P700 Granit (SSN-N-19 Shipwreck) missile that is capable of carrying a conventional or nuclear warhead. The primary purpose of these vessels is to launch a devastating cruise missile barrage on unsuspecting US carrier battle groups. These huge underwater arsenal ships of sorts are notoriously quiet and hard to detect, and they also pack an arsenal of torpedoes for taking on other submarines or hunting vulnerable surface vessels. The Oscar II class makes one hell of a dent in the ocean’s surface when not submerged. , AP In 2015, Russia announced that its eight Oscar IIs will be reconfigured to carry more modern supersonic 3M55 Oniks and subsonic 3M54 Klub cruise missiles. The upgrade has the potential to give the type a credible land attack capability as well as a more modern anti-ship weaponry. Supposedly the upgrade will increase the boat’s missile magazine to 72. Other upgrades to the ships combat, communications and sensor systems are part of the upgrade. These enhanced Oscar IIs are known as the Project 949AM class. Russia’s one-off larger and far more exotic version of the Oscar II class is being built out of the previously unfinished hull of the Belgorad . Instead of carrying all those missiles, this special-mission “research” submarine will carry a large array of special equipment, including submersibles, ROVs, spools of cable, airlock chambers for divers and even large pieces of cargo that can be mounted on the sea floor. It can also carry extremely large cargo on its back. This may include self-contained nuclear generators that can be placed on the seafloor to power equipment for very long periods of time autonomously. A roughly 100 foot long plug in Belgorad’s hull will help make room to accommodate these special capabilities. A Oscar II coming into frigid port., Russia MoD/Wikicommons The last American Seawolf class submarine built, the USS Jimmy Carter , was modified along the same lines for underwater espionage operations on the sea floor, such as tapping fiber optic cables and recovering sunken technology. But even though the Jimmy Carter’s hull was also extended, and it displaces roughly 12,500 tons, the Oscar II class displaces nearly 20,000 tons, and that is without modifications. The Belgorad will likely displace close to 30,000 tons when fully outfitted. Officially the Belgorad will be used to study the sea floor in the arctic, and will hunt for mineral and oil deposits. But its actual mission set will likely include installing a new “submarine communications systems” and possibly a network of hydrophones along the arctic shelf. Akin to something of an arctic SOSUS network used for tracking foreign submarines, this surveillance system could give Russia a heavy advantage when it comes to undersea operations in and around the polar icecap. Belgorad is clearly being built with arctic operations in mind, but it would also likely venture outside the frigid waters of the far northerly latitudes to work as an espionage ship like the Jimmy Carter . The 453 foot long USS Jimmy Carter is part of the proud lineage of US special purpose submarines whose tales still cannot be told. , General Dynamics There have been well established fears that Russia has interest not just in tapping certain fiberoptic communications cables, but in cutting them completely as a information warfare tactic. Being able to blind an area of the globe from the constant flow of information they have become accustomed to is a powerful strategic capability to have in one’s back pocket. And reports that Russia may be working acquire such a capability came before the revelations of the 2016 US Presidential campaign cycle, where Moscow mined sensitive party communications via hacking and cyber espionage and weaponized wikileaks as a delivery system for strategically distribute this private information. A slide from an unclassified briefing on NORTHCOM’s capabilities of interest specifically mentions the Losharik class nuclear midget submarine that can operate at extreme depths and is thought to utilize a large mothership submarine for transport and mission support activities.  , DoD Being able to mount an undersea cable cutting operation clandestinely, without exposing a ship on the surface to detection, would not only give Russia the element of surprise, but it could also give Moscow some level of plausible deniability—which has been an omnipresent tactic in its current hybrid warfare playbook. The thing is that Russia already has two other submarines that are supposedly capable of at least some aspects of this type of work— one a converted Delta IV nuclear ballistic submarine and the other a converted Delta III. Both of these subs are also known to be motherships for deep-diving midget submarines, including the shadowy nuclear-powered Losharik class. A Oscar II class submarine docked., AP There has been some speculation that the Belgorad’s enhanced length could also allow it to act as a mothership for deep diving, long endurance mini-subs as well. Or during a time of war, it may be able to carry and deploy a brace of shadowy “ Kanyon ” nuclear-tipped, very long-range super torpedoes. It is worth noting that Kanyon (also referred to as Status Six ), although hyped majorly in the press, is likely to be a conceptual weapon system at this time or one that could be just beginning development. It could also be a big disinformation play as well. The existence of Kanyon and its relation to the Belgorad was originally “leaked” on Russian TV, which makes the whole program suspect. Here is one artist’s take on the Belgorad and its possible components speculative configuration. Even so, the idea may be that one day Belgorad could be used for such a purpose if the Kanyon system is ever fully developed. The concept could offer Russia an alternative nuclear second-strike capability—one that is not vulnerable to US anti-missile defenses. If anything else, Moscow’s disdain for America’s ballistic missile defense capabilities has been made clear. The country has even broken a major arms proliferation treaty to develop and deploy a land-based nuclear tipped cruise missile in an attempt to get around the reach of these defenses, even if they are nowhere near capable of fending off a large barrage of nuclear ballistic missiles. With this in mind, the Kanyon concept may be an attractive one, but it would come at a high price—both monetarily and geopolitically. This “leaked” document not only shows the Kanyon super-torpedo, but it also appears to show the Belgorad on the upper left hand side., Screencap from Russian TV Maybe the biggest mystery is what Russia needs with three massive and very costly spy and mothership submarines? Sure all that capability is nice to have, but Moscow is not exactly rolling in rubles right now, and prioritizing such a fleet over say building more fast attack or AIP capable diesel electric submarines is a bit confounding. Their existence has to be part of a grander wartime strategy than just being used as espionage and underwater exploration vessels. Still, even just fielding the Belgorad alone is another stark example of how committed Russia is to dominating the arctic region. One recent, although highly doubtful claim that has been made by a former Russian colonel is that Russia has planted, or plans to plant, nuclear warheads on the seafloor off America’s coastline. These weapons supposedly can be detonated on command, resulting in a massive radioactive tsunami roaring toward America’s coastline and wiping out key infrastructure and military installations in the process. It all sounds totally ridiculous, but considering the Russian Navy’s growing fleet of elaborate submarines that can work on the ocean’s floor, along with all the other components that go with them—like even deeper-diving nuclear-powered midget submarines—such a claim almost sounds a bit more plausible. We’ll keep an eye on the program as it progresses. The Belgorad is slated for commissioning in 2018.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 21, 2016",What’s the Deal With China’s Surface Skimming Anti-Ship Drone-Missile Hybrid?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The news that China is working on an anti-ship drone-missile hybrid of sorts has been bouncing around social media as of late, after a photo and details about the weapon surfaced recently. The system is centered around a wing-in-ground-effect optimized airframe—a concept made famous by the Soviet Union’s enigmatic Ekranoplans, and in particular, the giant Caspian Sea Monster . Ground effect craft can efficiently skim very low over the ground at high speeds by leveraging the decreased drag and increased lift that occurs as a result of an aircraft’s wings interacting with the air directly above the planet’s surface. Although some were quick to think this weapon system is some sort of an elaborate unmanned combat air vehicle, that is almost certainly not the case. It seems pretty clear that it is far more expendable missile than anything else. After being launched from a shore battery, it would likely skim out to a target area at relatively high speed and very-low altitude. Then its onboard radar seeker would search for and prosecute an end-game attack solution of its target much like a standard anti-ship cruise missile. It would then slam into a ship and detonate what would be a far larger payload of explosives than a traditional anti-ship missile would carry. The weapon is supposedly designed to fly as low as three feet above the water’s surface for an hour and a half, and deliver a whopping 2,200-pound explosive payload onto its target. Overall, the weapon weighs 6,600 lbs fully loaded. The system’s seeker, engine, and possibly other components like its navigation system are likely ported over from existing, reliable anti-ship missile systems, such as the C-602/YJ-62 , C-704 , C-802/YJ-8 series of missiles. So where does this type of system fit in with China’s overall anti-access/area-denial strategy? First off, it offers yet another threat layer to China’s multi-tiered naval defense capability, while at the same time being not too dissimilar to its existing shore-based anti-ship missile defenses. Where this system differentiates itself is likely in its range, payload—and to some degree, its detectability during its midcourse phase of flight. The Soviet Union’s Ekranoplans, and especially the Caspian Sea Monster, have elevated the once obscure technology to near mythical levels: Because the system blends unmanned air vehicle, missile, and wing-in-ground-effect concepts, it can use lift to drastically increase its range and increase its overall size and load carrying capability compared to its traditional missile counterparts. This means more fuel and a larger explosive payload can be carried. Most importantly, normal anti-ship missiles fly anywhere from low to high altitudes during their flight out to the target area, before dropping down to very low altitude for their terminal attack run—skimming over the horizon at their target and thus giving said target’s defenses little time to react. This hybrid system would presumably stay at extremely low altitude throughout its entire flight profile following launch. Although the air is thick at low altitudes and drag is high, the wing-in-ground-effect design overcomes that drawback by providing copious amounts of lift and a “cushion” of air below the craft as it rips across the ocean’s surface. By staying so low throughout its flight, this missile-drone of sorts would remain harder to detect than higher-flying traditional missile systems, as it could consistently hide from radar among the reflective clutter of the ocean’s surface. Massive leaps in radar capabilities have been realized in recent years, especially when it comes to active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar sets’ “look-down/shoot-down” abilities. These technological leaps have made it much easier for fighters and airborne early warning and control aircraft to detect very-low flying targets—but depending on the situation and the combat environment, the tactic of flying low still offers a substantial added degree of survivability. Additionally, not all combat aircraft are equipped with active electronically scanned array radar systems that excel in this unique niche. For older pulse Doppler radar sets, detecting and successfully shooting down very low-flying targets with small radar signatures can be extremely challenging. So for this new weapon system, staying not just low but a mere handful of feet above the waves at any given time throughout its flight profile means it stands a better chance of remaining undetected—or at the very least, unengaged—than normal anti-ship missile systems. Range is probably the biggest benefit of such a system. Where a normal shore defense system’s cruise missile could fly out 100 or 200 miles, this thing could potentially reach distances of double or even triple that. With a 1.5-hour endurance, even if the system is only capable of say 300 miles per hour, that would give it a range of 450 miles. If the craft can reach higher speeds, say 500 miles per hour, that range increases drastically to 750 miles. That gives China a fairly potent( although lower-end) anti-access weapon system for contending navies to deal with during a time of conflict. There is also the swarm factor. Although a sea-skimming threat that flies at subsonic speeds is not a high-end capability for well-defended surface combatants to deal with, if used as part of a larger anti-access strategy, it could be deadly. These missile-drones are not super high-tech craft and are likely comparatively cheap to manufacture, so China could potentially sling dozens or even hundreds of them in a large volley at a known area where enemy naval assets are lurking. Combined with aircraft, ship and submarine launched anti-ship weaponry, as well as China’s budding anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities, even the most well armed naval armadas—like a US carrier strike group—would likely be overwhelmed with targets to engage. Considering how low this system stays throughout its flight profile, it would be challenging to engage many of them at standoff ranges. As a result, “leakers” could get through….and with 2,200 lbs of explosives onboard, just one of these things could do a huge amount of damage to a targeted combat vessel. China’s far more traditional C-602 anti-ship missile in action: https://youtube.com/watch?v=GgFFoouvOew At shorter ranges, say less than 200 miles from a coastline, traditional shore-based anti-ship missiles would be added to this threat cocktail. For instance, this weapon system may be very hard to deal with in the Taiwan Strait combat environment, and it may be able to be modified to attack fixed coastal targets as well as ships at sea. Depending on its performance capabilities, it may even be able to climb out of ground effect and bombard targets located inland, although it would be far more vulnerable during that type of end-game flight profile. So yes, even this fairly basic, lower-performance hybrid anti-ship drone-missile system could prove to be a credible threat if paired with the right tactics. Above all else, it is yet another reminder of China’s quest to build an impenetrable anti-access/area-denial fortress within the naval domain that reaches out far from its shores. This system would help make up the lower end of this overall strategy; traditional anti-ship missiles, both subsonic and supersonic , would make up the middle end, while anti-ship ballistic missiles and continued heavy investments in hypersonic technologies would make up up its high end. China is not alone in a revived interest in wing-in-ground-effect capabilities. Iran has actually designed a far lower-end anti-ship system that leverages a similar concept, and it won’t likely be their last. And Russia, historically the biggest believers in wing-in-ground-effect concepts, is also showing renewed interest in the technology. Who knows, maybe Moscow will follow China’s lead and make a blended wing-in-ground-effect unmanned aircraft and missile concept of their own in the not-so-distant future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2017",Japan May Acquire Aegis Ashore To Defend Itself From North Korean Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan has accelerated a study examining if installing the Aegis Ashore anti-ballistic missile system would be an effective means of dealing with the increasing threat of a ballistic missile barrage from North Korea . Japan has also looked into acquiring America’s Terminal Hight Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system as an alternative to Aegis Ashore, but the increased coverage that Aegis Ashore provides would be more applicable to Japan’s unique geographic and strategic needs. Also, Aegis Ashore can better interoperate with Japan’s Aegis mid-course intercept capable destroyers, not to mention the fact that there is a high degree of commonality in sensors, launch components, weapons, and even operations between the two systems. Cost is also an issue. Japan Times states that “THAAD costs about ¥125 billion ($1.1 billion) for each unit, and Japan would need around six units to protect the whole country. An Aegis Ashore unit costs about ¥80 billion and only two would be needed to cover the same amount of area.” Aegis Ashore would provide Japan with a two-tiered land-based anti-ballistic missile defense strategy, with their PAC-3 Patriot batteries offering a last line of defense against short and intermediate range missile warheads as they fall through the atmosphere towards their targets during the terminal phase of their attack profile. The Aegis Ashore deckhouse in Deveselu, Romania., AP Aegis ashore seems so well suited for Japan’s unique defensive needs that it almost would be strange if Japan were not to procure it. Japan has six Aegis equipped destroyers, four of which were outfitted for ballistic missile defense, with the other two being upgraded for the mission set by 2018. These ships can perform very similar tasks as Aegis Ashore, but doing so requires keeping a number of them on station continuously in the Sea of Japan to persistently counter the North Korean threat. These ships are very expensive multi-role assets, and keeping them assigned just to offshore picket duty indefinitely would be a poor use of such a capable resource. That’s why installing a pair of Aegis Ashore batteries along Japan’s western coastline makes so much sense, as it takes the pressure off of Japan’s high-end destroyer fleet and allows for a more flexible defense posture that can be adapted to the circumstances at any given time. Atago class Aegis equipped destroyer Ashigara . , USN For instance, during a time of heightened tensions, a Japanese Aegis equipped destroyer or two can augment the Aegis Ashore batteries, providing another line of defense. These systems can interoperate via data-link to work as a networked team—sharing information, prioritizing threats and assigning missiles to targets based on each system’s location, readiness state and available weapons. If an Aegis Ashore battery is down for service, the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force can even send a ship to stand in for it temporarily. Basically, for the cost of one Atago class destroyer, Japan can have two Aegis Ashore batteries providing constant monitoring and ballistic missile defense coverage against North Korea’s short to medium range ballistic missiles. There is also additional value being added to America’s Aegis Ashore batteries in Poland and Romania in the form of a secondary anti-air warfare capability . In other words, with upgrades, these installations will be able to also fire on aircraft and cruise missiles, not just ballistic missiles. In time, Aegis Ashore could feature the SM-6 missile alongside its hit-to-kill SM-3 interceptors. The SM-6 is capable of engaging certain ballistic missile threats during their terminal phase of flight, as well air breathing ones. SM-6 also has a secondary surface and land attack capability. As such, Japan’s Aegis Ashore stations could even potentially operate as a coastal defense system that leverages third party targeting data, such as that from maritime patrol aircraft, satellites or ships out at sea. Aegis Ashore can interoperate with sea-based Aegis BMD capable combat systems, using launch on remote tactics and even assigning SM-6s to engage inter-atmospheric targets. , DoD We will have to wait and see if Japan decides to move forward with Aegis Ashore after its study is completed, but one thing is certain—China will not be pleased if this system is installed on Japanese shores. The deployment of THAAD, which is non-permanent, has a more narrow engagement window and features an overall far more focused capability set, to South Korean remains a major issue for Beijing . But a pair of Aegis Ashore stations setup along Japan’s west coast would be seen as a much larger provocation—one that China would claim dilutes their own nuclear deterrent’s credibility significantly. Considering the Trump Administration’s so far cozy relationship with China, it will be interesting to see how Washington would handle the final approval of the sale of such a politically sensitive weapon system to Japan, especially at a time when the US is leaning hard on China to take unprecedented measures to reign in the Kim regime in North Korea. In that respect, just Japan’s move to accelerate its study on acquiring Aegis Ashore likely puts even more pressure on China to get North Korea to deescalate, which really isn’t such a bad thing.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain sketchy, but we know there has been a major incident at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. A tunnel full of railcars filled with nuclear waste has collapsed, sending workers at the sprawling installation scurrying to shelter in-place indoors where they were told by officials to secure ventilation and not to drink or eat anything until further notice. Supposedly, there are no signs of a large radiological release at this time, although that is based on initial reports from Hanford officials. More testing will likely be needed to ascertain the extent of the immediate danger and ongoing risk following the incident. We will have to wait and see if this will include the rapid deployment of unique Department of Energy and Nuclear Security Administration assets that are tasked with dealing with these types of emergencies. These assets usually include an Accident Response Group that is on call to jet off at short notice. Also the deployment of a specially configured Bell 412 helicopter, known as the Airborne Measuring System , that is used to map radiological incidents like dirty bombs or industrial accidents, would be something to watch for. These silver helicopters with large pods hanging off their sides, along with their King Air spotting aircraft, are part of the Remote Sensing Lab and are based primarily at Nellis AFB, just outside of Las Vegas.

Their presence over urban areas often raises a lot of interest and is usually the source of numerous local conspiracy theories, but really they are just training to execute their high-priority mission. The data they gather would likely save countless lives during an actual disaster The sprawling Hanford nuclear site, which is roughly half the size of Rhode Island, has roots dating back to the dawn of the atomic age. It was established during the early 1940s to produce plutonium for the Manhattan Project. During the Cold War, Hanford’s nine reactors and five processing facilities helped produce enough enriched nuclear material for the US to assemble tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images The site also participated in a slew of scientific breakthroughs that added to our understanding physics and nuclear applications. A sad byproduct of these activities was the large-scale contamination of the site, with some 50 million gallons of high-level nuclear and 25 million cubic feet of solid nuclear waste being crudely stored there over the years. This has caused the water beneath the site to be highly contaminated, and the fact that it straddles the Columbia River makes the situation all the more concerning. In recent decades, the site’s precarious nature has been the source of escalating concerns. With what seems like a never ending string of new contamination events and human health risks identified , some have posited that it is just a matter of time before a major nuclear incident occurs. Nuclear waste transport containers at Hanford., Jeff T. Green/Getty Images Today Hanford is by far America’s largest nuclear waste site and it is the largest environmental cleanup project in the United States. And although remediation efforts are ongoing, even if the site can be cleaned up over many decades to come—some think it is an impossible task —the massive amount of nuclear waste stored there, even if all of it is transferred to more modern storage containers, will remain a potentially disaster in waiting We will keep this page updated for the next 24 hours with more information as it comes. UPDATE 11:55am PST: The collapse is said to be associated with Tunnel #2. Some say there is only solid waste stored there but this is not confirmed officially. Here is where the tunnel is located supposedly. Once again, waiting for confirmation on these details. The airspace has been closed up to 5,000 feet over and five miles around Hanford. UPDATE 2:27pm PST: As of now, officials claim that no radiation has been released. The collapse occurred near the plutonium uranium extraction (PUREX) plant. A robot has been sent into the area to better assess the environmental factors there. Destry Henderson, the news manager for the Hanford Joint Information Center, told NBC that “I would underscore this is confined to a small area of the Hanford site… The facility does have radiological contamination right now but there is no indication of a radiological release.” So at this point it seems that things are relatively contained.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 8, 2017",Japan May Buy Tomahawks For Retaliatory Strikes On North Korean Missile Sites,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late last week we reported that Japan is seriously considering procuring Aegis Ashore in the near-term as part of an attempt to counter the North Korean ballistic missile threat. Now, it appears that Tokyo may also be looking to procure Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States. The missiles would be used as standoff retaliatory strike weapons against North Korean missile launchers and launch facilities. Although it seems perfectly fit for Japan’s pressing strategic needs, procuring a long-range land attack cruise missile may be a leap too far when it comes to Japan supposed “self defense” military posture. A urgent proposal is supposedly being circulated at the highest levels of the Japanese government that recommends Japan arm itself not just to defend itself from an initial ballistic missile barrage, but also to execute a counter-strike against Pyongyang’s ability to launch more if an attack occurs. This is where a standoff land-attack missile comes into play. After an initial launch, Japan could unleash throngs of Tomahawks aimed not just at striking targets based on real-time, or near-real, time intelligence, but they could also bombard known launch points and locales, as well as known missile support facilities. North Korean military command, control and communications targets could also be on Japan’s targeting list for such a weapon system. Tomahawk launch from Mk 41 VLS, USN Japan acquiring what is largely seen as an offensive weapon is bound to draw the ire of those already troubled by ( and who question the constitutionality of ) Japan’s ever more outward facing military capabilities . The fact that these missiles would likely be fielded aboard Japan’s Aegis and Mark 41 vertical launch system equipped destroyers would only inflame the situation. These ships are some of the most powerful surface combatants in the world and can sail many thousands of miles from Japanese shores. When armed with a weapon that can fly over 1,000 miles into denied airspace, the ships mean Japan could attack targets located on the vast majority of world’s landmass. A novel way to deal with this issue may be to base the missiles at fixed installations inside Japanese territory, instead of on naval ships capable of projecting power over great distances. This could be paired with a stated policy to only use these missiles in a retaliatory nature. In other words, Japan will never use them to strike first. The fact that Japan is now very closely examining procuring Aegis Ashore for a fixed, land-based missile defense capability, means that it could potentially kill two birds with one stone so to speak. Aegis Ashore makes use of the same Mark 41 vertical launch system (VLS) that US Navy’s surface combatants use to fire the BGM-109 Tomahawk. Just like the US destroyers and cruisers that use the Aegis combat system and its Mark 41 VLS system at sea, Japan could integrate Tomahawk capability into their Aegis Ashore facilities. Recent versions of the Tactical Tomahawk , often referred to as the “Tac-Tom,” has the ability to be re-targeted dynamically in flight, and can loiter over a targeted area waiting to engage targets of opportunity. Even the ability to hit moving targets is something the missile can be outfitted with. These are especially attractive capabilities when it comes to striking things like ballistic missile transporter-erector-launchers (TEL) Mainland Japan sits as close as 310 miles from North Korea’s border. This gives the Tac-Tom plenty of fuel to loiter over known TEL operating areas and other launch facilities and pads. All of this could be done without putting a pilot at risk and without introducing new fixed-wing aircraft related equipment, munitions and training demands on the JASDF. Even without Aegis Ashore, Japan could still land-base Tomahawks using a standalone Mark 41 VLS or armored box naval launchers and the system’s command and control elements. Decentralization of a Tomahawk arsenal can also be had by procuring four-round transporter-erector-launchers like those used by the US Army BGM-109G Gryphon derivative of the Tomahawk. The system no longer exists in the US arsenal as the ground-based nuclear-tipped cruise missile fleet was put out of service as part of the Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty Treaty. Still, integrating a Tomahawk retaliatory arsenal into Aegis Ashore would be the most logical and least politically sensitive way to go about fielding the system. BGM-109G Gryphon TEL, DoD Fielding a force of Tomahawks as both a countermeasure and as a deterrent would allow Japan to have more independence when it comes to protecting itself and striking back against an ever more aggressive North Korean regime. It would also put further pressure on the North Korean regime to better contemplate the stakes of not just attacking its neighbors but also slinging test missiles into the Sea of Japan. Paired with Aegis Ashore, it seems like the Tomahawk is a near perfect combination for Japan’s needs. The only thing that could be better in some aspects would be a cruise missile capable of far higher speed to more rapidly strike back at the North Korean TELs that originally launched an assault. But in order to do this, Japan would need very accurate intelligence as to where exactly the missiles were fired from in order to strike their launchers in a rapid manner. This would likely require satellite data from launch detection and tracking satellites that only the US has. Japan could launch its own similar satellite to stare at the Korean Peninsula, but doing so would require a very large additional investment. Armored Box Launcher for the TLAM., USN Still, even if there were a cruise missile option capable of reaching speeds of say mach 2.5, it would take such a missile ten minutes to travel from the closest part of the Japanese mainland to closest part of the North Korean border. When you add in time to classify the threat and to go through the command and control process, by then the North Korean TELs would have likely packed up and moved on. And a missile of that speed would likely sacrifice range, payload and especially the ability to loiter and be retargeted dynamically. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dWOoHx2c3i4 With all this in mind, the Tomahawk seems like as good a solution as any for what are a fairly complex tactical and strategic set of issues. Although the Tomahawk alone can’t neuter North Korea’s ability to launch follow-un missile attacks on Japan during a time of war—far from it really— when you pair it with Aegis Ashore it provides a sensible and scalable defensive capability and deterrent. We’ll have to wait and see if Shinzo Abe and his team agree with this analysis.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 23, 2016","Trump Tells Navy To Ditch New Catapult, Babbles Incoherently About F-35","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Excerpts from Time’s latest interview with Donald Trump have been released and in them the President talks about Navy’s chronically troubled Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for the service’s new Ford class supercarriers and makes some very odd remarks about the F-35. His words on EMALS may not be crystal clear, but they are not unfounded, but his remarks regarding the F-35 are bewildering and downright childish. Let’s start with Trump’s F-35 musings: “When [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō] Abe came from Japan, first thing he said to me when I first met him. He walked out. “Thank you, thank you.” I said, “For what?” F-35. You bought, you saved us one hundred million dollars. Because they’re part of the group that buy the ninety planes. It’s a lot. We get, they get, different allies. But I saved Japan a hundred million bucks. Took me probably an hour if I added up all the time. But I will be saving, when we put that out over two, the two thousand five hundred planes, billions of dollars. Nobody ever wrote a story about that. But they said the F-35 program is now straightened out and the costs are way down. They’re down because of me. Then Boeing when the F-18, I mean I must have got thirty-five million of each plane off. . . . You know they had the F-35s, they had thirty-five of them fly over Japan when [Defense Secretary] General [James] Mattis was there, and they were not detected by the radar. They flew over and everyone said where the hell did they come from? That’s stealth. It’s pretty cool, right. Thirty-five of them flying at a high speed, low, and they were not detected. They flew right over the top of the deal, nobody knew they were coming. Pretty cool, right?” I really don’t want to rehash the whole “Trump saved millions per F-35” fiasco but lets just say, he didn’t . But the defense industry, which has little shame in licking boots to make a buck, played to his ego so he could say he did. Scary. F-35Bs on their way to Japan., DoD Then there is the claim that he knocked $35M off the price of $55M Super Hornets too. Being lied to in this manner is grotesque. Then again, maybe he actually believes what he is saying because those around him who are actually in the know just play along. Who knows. But what is most bizarre are his words about 35 F-35s flying over to where? Japan? Korea? And surprising, well… Someone. First off, no, 35 F-35s did not deploy to Japan or anywhere else in Asia. In fact, 35 F-35s have never deployed anywhere in the world. A single Marine squadron of less than half that (16 jets) did . Additionally, the jets didn’t arrive by surprise, at low level or at high speed, nor would they. Maybe this is Trump reiterating some engrandized story of the jets arriving over MCAS Iwakuni for recovery—hardly a test of an aircraft’s combat capabilities—or a second-hand account of operations by the jets after they arrived in the region. But either way it sounds super childish and clearly shows a lack of comprehension on the subject. F-35B executing a STOVL landing at MCAS Iwakuni. , USMC It is pretty clear Trump has been personally spoon-fed the F-35 brochure from LockMart and the program office. Without any point of reference, it all must seem pretty wondrous. Oh and the program he was so critical of during his campaign is now magically fixed because he made a phone call. Totally ridiculous to the point that its downright insulting. And really, nothing of this has to do with the jet itself, just a new slathering of politics that surrounds it. To be honest, I had high hopes that Trump could spur systemic change within the DoD’s procurement process. Those hopes have faded rapidly over the last three months. It seems that he is far more interested in selectively intervening in a few high-profile programs he has interest in so that he can claim fake victories and gloat about them endlessly to the press, and the defense industry is happy to oblige him if it means funding certainty and a strong order book. As Trump would put it: “sad.” Now onto Trump’s comments on the Ford class supercarrier’s new and very much unproven catapult system: “You know the catapult is quite important. So I said what is this? Sir, this is our digital catapult system. He said well, we’re going to this because we wanted to keep up with modern [technology]. I said you don’t use steam anymore for catapult? No sir. I said, “Ah, how is it working?” “Sir, not good. Not good. Doesn’t have the power. You know the steam is just brutal. You see that sucker going and steam’s going all over the place, there’s planes thrown in the air.” It sounded bad to me. Digital. They have digital. What is digital? And it’s very complicated, you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out. And I said–and now they want to buy more aircraft carriers. I said what system are you going to be–”Sir, we’re staying with digital.” I said no you’re not. You going to goddamned steam, the digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it’s no good.” I have been talking about this issue for years , and if you strip out all the digital vs analogue nonsense Trump is spouting, his concerns are totally justified. The USS Gerald R. Ford i s stuffed full of unproven technologies —as in still unproven experimentally not just operationally—and that is far too much risk for a $12B asset that we only build a couple of ever decade. The Ford , which is just beginning sea trials now after a long string of delays, was procured under the flawed model of concurrency , and it remains uncertain when the ship will actually be ready for operations. USS Gerald R. Ford heading out for builders trials in April. , USN Recently the Navy made the decision to continue with building EMALS and the even more troublesome Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) into future carriers of the Ford class, even as a deep review of the program was ongoing . With the USS John F. Kennedy’s (CVN-79) construction well underway, and construction of the USS Enterprise (CVN-80) beginning next year, any failure of these unproven components to live up to their promises could trigger major redesigns and extremely expensive physical modifications of these ships. The thing is, both of these components are absolutely critical to the carrier’s mission and are heavily integrated into the vessels. Also they don’t have to work reliably just some of the time, but all of the time. Aircrew’s lives are literally depending on them as is the carrier’s actual war fighting ability. So if they are not able to function in a highly reliable manner, it equals a mission kill for these massive ships. EMALS demo being shown to VIPs aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford. , USN Trump likely learned about the Ford’s exotic catapult system and its issues during his visit to the ship last March , during which he toured the vessel, spoke with sailors and shipbuilders working aboard it, and met with the ship’s command staff. Before the visit he singled out the Ford class as one of the Pentagon’s most appalling  over budget and underperforming programs, and questioned its entire viability. He was far more cordial during a speech aboard the ship, where he declared a goal of fielding a 12 carrier force. This is one more ship than currently mandated by congress, and two more ships that what the Navy has now due to the early retirement of the USS Enterprise (CVN-65). In order to make such a goal a reality, the new Ford class of carriers must perform, and installing reliable catapults in them is a big part of the equation. The grim truth is that the Navy has already signed contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars with General Atomics for EMALS catapults on the next two Ford class carriers. So going back to steam will not be as easy as simply ordering steam catapults for the new ships, not to mention massive design and construction issues that would go with retrofitting such a system back into the Ford class design. Not just that but the Mark 12 catapult system that outfits the Nimitz class is now out of production, so it would have to be either re-sourced or a new design would have to be developed in its place. None of this is cheap, but it may be cheaper than having tens of billions of supercarriers sidelined for years as bugs with these new systems are worked out. Sailors working on an EMALS shuttle., USN The Navy doesn’t have the luxury of building experimental supercarriers, especially now when the fleet is already a ship short and experiencing the effects of the so called “carrier gap.” These systems could have been spiraled into new carriers as the technology matured. But that didn’t happen. And EMALS is a technology worth pursuing. It could one day lead to a far more flexible launch system that is even capable of deploying light drones and other unconventional carrier aircraft designs. It could also even prove more reliable than the Mark 12 steam system… One day. But that day isn’t here, and we need operational carriers yesterday. So its not the EMALS idea that is wrong, it’s the Navy’s willingness to gamble so recklessly on it before it was more fully developed and vetted. Even if it turns out that the system works acceptably based on the current revised timeline for the USS Gerald R. Ford , the practice of concurrently designing a complex system that is still deeply in development into such an important asset should not be repeated. Then again, all this would be less of an issue if the Navy ended its rigid supercarrier addition and began building smaller carriers in more plentiful numbers, but that’s a whole other story altogether. With all this in mind, Trump is right to knock some sense into the Navy and demand they keep using proven steam technology until EMALS is fully vetted, but actually seeing that happen will be a hard charge indeed.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 4, 2016",Naval Mines Are A Growing Threat Near The Mandeb Strait,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The potential threat to international commerce posed by naval mines remains palpable. This is especially true when it comes to their deployment around known geographical bottlenecks. When those bottlenecks convey a large portion of the world’s daily oil supply, destabilizing any one of them could have massive economic and even life-safety repercussions around the globe. This is why the growing threat of naval mines in the Strait of Mandeb, the narrow body of water that ties the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, is so concerning. This same area has been an anti-ship missile shooting gallery for Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in recent months. These acts have including a series of unsuccessful missile attacks on American surface combatants and a direct hit on a catamaran logistics vessel used by the UAE. A Saudi frigate that was patrolling the area was also struck by a high-speed drone boat packed with explosives. Although missile and drone boat attacks garner big news, a threat just as deadly quietly looms in the form of sea mines that have been persistently deployed by Houthi rebels. These weapons have already struck local ships with devastating effects. On March 11th a Yemeni Coastguard vessel struck one of these mines, killing two and wounding eight of its crew. The strike resulted in Yemeni forces executing a rudimentary anti-mine warfare operation in the area, in which multiple mines were found and disarmed. But more mines can easily be dumped into the water, and those already floating in the waterway can travel great distances via ocean currents. Other barely reported mine strikes around the strait have occurred in recent months. Major General Ahmed Al-Assiri, the spokesman for the Saudi Arabian military, stated the following late last March: “Just a few days ago there was an incident where a fishing boat hit a mine off the Yemeni shores. Seven innocent fishermen were killed in this incident. This signifies the threat of these mines which needs to be addressed.” The Saudi Navy has also been active in minesweeping operations on the southern stretch of the Red Sea. But these anti-mine warfare efforts don’t seem to be sufficient for confronting the threat. Now more mines—which the Yemeni government claims, as with other advanced weapons , are of Iranian origin—are popping up in the area once again. These latest sightings were made near Midi, a Yemeni port city on the Red Sea located just south of the Saudi border. The mines were said to be relatively simple in nature, but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t have catastrophic effects on ships moving through the area, many of which carry huge loads of oil and natural gas. It is not clear at this point how the issue will be dealt with or by who. Sadly, it may take one of these mines to strike a foreign ship or one loaded with volatile cargo for an international response to occur. Two months ago, the US Navy’s Office Of Naval Intelligence released a warning stating the threat of naval mines is growing in the region and it has the potential to drastically disrupt navigation through the strategic waterway. The US Navy has also stated that they would do what it takes to keep the waterway open, but it isn’t clear that any sort of a protracted minesweeping operation is underway. USS Ponce with an MH-53E Sea Dragon embarked., USN The USS Ponce , which is capable of embarking MH-53E Sea Dragon minesweeping helicopters, was moved from its station in the Persian Gulf to close proximity to the Mandeb Strait last fall as part of a response to the anti-ship missile attacks in the region. As of late April, Ponce remains in the general area, although whether it is conducting minesweeping operations near the strait is unknown. The U.S. Navy does maintain a robust anti-mine warfare capability in the Persian Gulf in anticipation of an Iranian mining operation witch could be executed by surprise. The ability for Tehran to order the rapid closing of both the Strait of Hormuz and the Mandeb Strait simultaneously via a sudden mining operations is a fear I highlighted years ago when the Yemeni civil war first kicked off.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Everything You Need To Know About North Korea’s Most Successful Missile Launch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following North Korea’s April 15th military parade , The War Zone pointed out a new potential North Korean capability to watch for. That capability rolled through Kim Il Sung Square in the form of a pair of what appeared to be stretched BM-25 Musudan intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) coated in a black substance and topped with a small reentry vehicle possibly capable of carrying a single nuclear warhead. Many were calling this missile system a version of the long-displayed but never tested KN-08, but in our after-parade analysis report we noted that this was likely incorrect. Instead it seemed that it was an extension of another system—one that had already been successfully tested: “At first glance it almost appears to be a new version of the KN-08, but without its distinctive three-tier layout . Instead it seems that the missile is nearly un-tapered at its second stage joint, and its nose section has been completely remodeled. Upon closer examination it really seems more plausible that it is a lengthened BM-25/HS-10 Musudan IRBM . It is even being hauled around in a Musudan’s TEL. Not just that, but it matches the black and white paint job of Musudan missiles that have been test fired over the last year. Even though its success record remains poor, the Musudan has been successfully test fired, and this new and improved version would be a threatening development for the region. There is also the possibility that this new version could use solid fuel for its upper stage.” The extended Musudan missile The War Zone identified during North Korea’s April 15th parade. , AP This same missile was test fired from Kusong, North Korea, this weekend, flying on a steep parabolic trajectory to an altitude of 1,300 miles, and downrange nearly 500 miles before splashing into the Sea of Japan. By most estimates, if the missile were to take a more shallow, lofted flight profile that maximized range, it could reach out to roughly 2,800 miles. Checkout the launch and all the pictures released form it in this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=n0vhO8k3QjE The test was not just successful but downright impressive, and it is fairly safe to say that it represents the most capable North Korean ballistic missile launch as of yet. Although the usual missile frenzy ensued following the launch, with many of the reports over the weekend, and even some TV pundits, stating that the missile could be capable of hitting America’s lower 48 states, this is wholly inaccurate. But the missile system does pose a threat to Guam—an American territory and one of, if not the Pentagon’s most strategically important operating locations in the entire hemisphere. Guam is the home of the sprawling Andersen AFB, with its constant flow of airpower including a continuous rotation of heavy bombers . The US Navy is also dependent of the island for logistics and forward operations. Department of Defense communications and command and control capabilities are also centered on Guam. The strategic island is protected by a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery that could theoretically fend off a low to medium volume ballistic missile attack, but the system doesn’t offer any sort of impenetrable shield over the island that could repulse large barrages of ballistic missiles, like those that could be fired by say China. So THAAD’s presence on Guam is aimed primarily at one threat—North Korea. Hence the unit’s nickname, the “Musudan Manglers.” So it’s not as if Guam is left without a defense to a North Korean missile strike, and there is still the question of how accurate a North Korean missile could be at its maximum range, not to mention the questionable state of North Korea’s reentry systems and miniaturized warhead development programs. This new missile is being called the Hwasong-12, As stated earlier, it seems to be an updated and extended range version of the BM-25 Musudan, which carries the designation Hwasong-10. Both missiles have little in common with other far shorter-ranged and less complex missiles that have a similar name prefix. Kim Jong Un inspects the Hwasong-12, Youtube Screencap North Korea state media reported in its normal grandiose fashion that the missile was a “new ground-to-ground medium long-range strategic ballistic rocket,” named Hwasong-12. And that it was “capable of carrying a large, heavy nuclear warhead.” They added that the test “verified the homing feature of the warhead under the worst re-entry situation and accurate performance of detonation system.”  North Korean state media also quoted Kim as saying: “The most perfect weapon systems in the world will never become the eternal exclusive property of the US… Strongly warning the US should not disregard or misjudge the reality that its mainland and Pacific operation region are in North Korea’s sighting range for strike.” Youtube Screencap North Korea released a series of pictures and video of the missile’s launch, including those with Kim Jong Un “overseeing” its execution and tooling around the launch facility. One interesting note is that although the missile arrived on the same type of transporter-erector-launcher used by the Musudan, it was actually launched from a small stand. As such, it would appear that, at least for this first test, North Korean testers either didn’t want to risk a TEL, or that the missile is not compatible with the TEL for launches and needs to be dropped off on a stand before being fired. As for the big liquid vs solid fuel question that has become something of a laughable point of hyperbole in the press as of late, the Musudan uses liquid fuel. This means it has to be set in an upright position and fueled before launch. This leaves it vulnerable for a period of time, usually measured in dozens of minutes to a handful of hours, before being sent on its way. There is nothing to indicate this extended version—literally extended in physical length and range—of the Musudan uses any other form of propellant. If anything, it is possible that the second stage could have been converted to a solid fuel system, but that is just a possibility, and is not based on any hard evidence. The flight trajectory of recent North Korean missile tests has also led to some confusion in the press. To test an intermediate-range missile like this, using a steep-parabolic trajectory is useful for keeping the missile within the region surrounding North Korea, while also allowing engineers and scientists to examine the missile’s complete burn capability. Beyond the geopolitical issues with having a missile travel in a lofted “cross-range” flight profile, it may be challenging for North Korea to maintain proper surveillance of and connectivity with the missile as it flies thousands of miles away. This is not the case when a largely vertical trajectory is used. So although sending a missile like this far out into the Pacific would be an intimidating move by North Korea to say the least, Pyongyang’s scientists may not learn much from such a flight, at least directly. Using a steep parabolic flight profile, much of which is over North Korean territory, also makes the missile harder to engage with anti-ballistic missile systems in the region. In fact, such a profile could even be used during a time of war against targets far closer to North Korea than Guam in an attempt to “beat” the types of anti-ballistic missile defenses that will only grow more plentiful in the area going forward. There is also the question of North Korea using its ballistic missiles and nuclear capabilities to deliver an electromagnetic pulse high over an enemy country, like say Japan, as its effects could be far more devastating in the long term than striking a single base or city with a nuclear device in a traditional manner. Even using an EMP attack over South Korea is not out of the question if the regime felt itself cornered during conflict. North Korea remains one of the most “analogue” countries in the world with a large standing army. As such, using such a weapon, even if its effects will spill well into North Korean territory, would likely cause much more harm to South Korea—its people and its warfighting capabilities—than to North Korea. Youtube Screencap As for the Trump administration’s response to the launch, well it was strange to say the least. A White House press release reads: “The President has been briefed on the latest missile test by North Korea. With the missile impacting so close to Russian soil – in fact, closer to Russia than to Japan – the President cannot imagine that Russia is pleased. North Korea has been a flagrant menace for far too long.  South Korea and Japan have been watching this situation closely with us.  The United States maintains our ironclad commitment to stand with our allies in the face of the serious threat posed by North Korea.  Let this latest provocation serve as a call for all nations to implement far stronger sanctions against North Korea.” A White House statement that intends to speak for another country is odd, and it prompted a response today from Putin , who is currently visiting Beijing, and is likely discussing America’s role in the region with Chinese officials: “I want to confirm that we are categorically against the expansion of the club of nuclear powers, including with the Korean peninsula and North Korea… But at the same time, we understand that what we have observed in the world recently, and specifically flagrant violations of international law and incursions into the territory of foreign states, changes in regime, lead to such kinds of arms races… We need to return to dialogue with North Korea and stop scaring it and find ways to resolve these problems peacefully.” Putin along Xi Jinping at China’s Belt and Road Forum. , AP The Russian Ministry of Defense also put out a statement that contradicted the White House, saying the missile landed in the Sea of Japan some 300 miles form the Russian coastline instead of just 60 miles off Russia’s strategic port of Vladivostok as the US military has claimed. The timing of the launch is also interesting when it comes to China, as the Chinese are currently holding a high-profile international economic forum. Having their neighbor and supposed ally firing off ballistic missiles during such an event is clearly an unwanted distraction for Beijing. It also speaks at least anecdotally to the chilling relationship between the two countries, and that it seems by most accounts China is losing control over Pyongyang. The successful launch will also likely spur Japan’s own budding but controversial plans to counter the growing missile threat from North Korea. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made it clear today that the strategic equation is indeed changing rapidly in the region: “It is indeed very clear that the threat posed by North Korea’s missile and nuclear program is now entering into a new stage. That is our recognition.” Finally, and maybe most importantly, the launch brought a reaction from South Korea’s new President. Much has been made about Moon Jae In’s softer stance toward North Korea, and how it could even undermine America’s military efforts in the region. And it is true, candidate Moon had stated he wanted to reach out to the Kim regime, and was even interested in directly negotiating with North Korea at the highest levels, but the reality is that as President, he still has millions of South Koreans to protect. And although pundits declared his election could signal a massive shift in Seoul’s policy towards the North, possibly including kicking America’s THAAD battery out of the country, that was always unlikely to happen. Now that the new President is in office, it seems that the status quo will likely stay largely in place, but with a bit softer dialogue than what the past administration used to describe it. The President’s spokesman responded to the launch stating: “The president said while South Korea remains open to the possibility of dialogue with North Korea, it is only possible when North Korea shows a change in attitude.” South Korea’s new President Moon Jae In., AP That change in attitude is unlikely to occur, and the statement is made just a couple of days after Moon said he would “urgently try to solve the security crisis… If needed, I will fly straight to Washington. I will go to Beijing and Tokyo and, if the conditions are right, to Pyongyang also.” I guess we can only hope that somehow a “change in attitude” by Pyongyang will occur so that he can put his plan to work. Donald Trump has also said he would directly negotiate with Pyongyang , but like Moon, there would have to be a change in North Korea’s behavior for there to be even a possibility of such a diplomatic offensive to occur. In the meantime, we are still waiting for the country’s sixth nuclear test , and considering Kim Jong Un only continues to accelerate his missile programs, that test will likely occur much sooner than later.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 2, 2017",Chief Of Naval Operations Alludes To A New Shadowy Revolution In Naval Warfare,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson is making a big push for more ships, and wants to change the way ships are designed and procured. But that is nothing really new, what is new is a somewhat cryptic statement made by the admiral about some major revolution in naval warfare that seems to go beyond what has been discussed openly by Navy officials in the past. Richardson told reporters the following on Monday: “My sense is that we’re on the dawn of something very substantial in terms of naval warfare. Something as substantial as the transition from sail to steam, as the transition from wood to ironclad, as substantial as the advent of nuclear propulsion in terms of what it means for naval power.” According to Defense News, the Admiral would not go into any detail about this grand revolution. Richardson did continue to press for an immediate increase in shipbuilding to help confront growing threats from China and Russia, stating: “We’re going to be targeting something in the mid-2020s. Exponential types of growth, rather than lineal types of growth, which would achieve this level of power decades beyond the 2020s… This increased naval power will involve more numbers… We are headed now to a fleet that’s about 310 ships, but if you look at the long-term forecast it’s clear that to get beyond that we’re going to have to start building. We’re going to have to build ships, and we’re going to have to look at extending the life of ships, and we’re going to have to look at – in just about every way we can–to increase our inventory of ships in the United States Navy.” AP He also discussed how he would like to change the way ship’s are procured, stating: “I would challenge the assumption that it takes that long to design and build things… The hull and power plant will last ostensibly the life of the ship. But then to design the rest of it, to use the very latest technologies we have now, that’ll be a step forward. But also to step into the future faster, to modernize faster. We’ll be much more modularized, much more compatible. You can iterate your way into the future with faster steps. You’re got part of the ship built to last, and part of the ship that’s built to grow and be modernized.” This modular concept of design is nothing really new. The Littoral Combat Ship was supposed to leverage this concept and has failed miserably at doing so. The Navy has shown little sign of injecting these concepts on a grand scale into its new Arleigh Burke Flight III class destroyers. Concurrently building a new ship around unproven systems that are still being designed and tested has also caused major issues with the Navy’s new Ford class supercarriers, a reality that continues to make major news even as the ship enters sea trials. LCS-1 USS Freedom underway., Lockheed Martin One could think that the Admiral’s puzzling statement is talking about net-centric warfare, which includes remote targeting/cooperative engagement capabilities, distributed lethality and other advanced concepts, but those have been around for some time, and he even mentioned them as well in his comments on Monday, saying: “There’s a new dimension, the power of networking, that allows adaptive combinations to emerge… It’s not all about the platforms.” Air Force Chief of Staff Goldfein has made near identical remarks recently , but there is no reason why he wouldn’t just explain that is what he was talking about when he teased some huge transformation in naval warfare. This is not the first time one of the Pentagon’s head honchos outright teased transformative capabilities that remain outside the public eye. Last year Defense Secretary Ashton Carter dangled a similar statement in front of the press regarding secret air combat capabilities. So what exactly is the Admiral referring to? Is it some new type of technology, or a cocktail of technologies that will be packaged together. It it’s the former, than why not just say so? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Citing how substantially different the newest F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet offerings are from their predecessors among other reasons, Boeing is looking for new names for both of its iconic fighter jet product lines. The latest Super Hornet derivatives have had multiple names over the years, including Advanced Super Hornet, International Roadmap Super Hornet, F/A-18XT, and Block III Super Hornet. The newest iteration of the F-15 has also had a similar smattering of names, along with the unique designations given to the configuration each country buys, such as Saudi Arabia’s F-15SA , Singapore’s F-15SG and Korea’s F-15K etc. Maybe most famously was the still-born stealthy-ish F-15SE, otherwise known as the Silent Eagle. But it’s with the Saudi purchase of the F-15SA that the Eagle got its latest makeover , and Boeing is looking at spring boarding some of its advances into new upgrade configurations, like the F-15 2040C —not the most sexy designation for a jet fighter—as well as selling new-build airframes based on the F-15SA design. The USAF already calls its F-15C/Ds that are slated to receive a series of significant upgrades allowing them to stay in service until 2040 “Golden Eagles.” So that name is taken, that is unless the USAF moves forward with its plan to nix the F-15C/D Eagle fleet and replace the jets with upgraded F-16s.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 6, 2017",US Strikes Convoy Of Fighters Loyal To Assad Near Coalition Outpost In Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain sketchy, but the Pentagon is reporting that US aircraft struck a Shiite militia convoy loyal to the Assad regime in southern Syria. The strikes hit near the town of An Tanf, about 20 miles from the Jordanian-Syrian border in south central Syria near the Jordanian and Iraqi borders. About a dozen heavy vehicles, including heavy armor, moved into territory known to be controlled by the coalition, toward a forward operating base that likely housed US and coalition special operations forces as well as indigenous forces the coalition is training and assisting. The incident occurred near the site of a brazen series of Russian airstrikes a coalition year ago. As the vehicles sped down the highway towards the outpost, coalition jets flew low overhead in a show of force to warn them away. Some reports state that one of the vehicles was a Shilka anti-aircraft artillery system , so this show of force may have come at substantial risk the aircrews who flew it. Once it was clear that tactic didn’t deter the convoy’s progression, the coalition aircraft dropped on at least one of the vehicles, with pinpoint results. It is not clear at this time how many vehicles were destroyed in the action but the remaining vehicles either turned around or were destroyed as well. In a report by Defense News , Jennifer Cafarella, a Syrian civil war expert with the Institute for the Study of War stated: “The stated intent of that pro-regime convoy was to reopen the Damascus-Baghdad highway… I think the pro-regime coalition intended to test U.S. resolve and found it appropriately intact when it comes to force protection.” Iranian-backed Shiite militias, in particular Hezbollah, have fought alongside Assad’s army and Russian special operations teams to keep the Assad regime intact. Israel in particular has kept a close eye on Hezbollah’s activities in Syria, and has consistently struck arms transfers that occur in the country from Iran to the militant group. It is not clear exactly who the militia unit involved in the incident was directly affiliated with, but it is possible Iran will respond to the strike in some fashion. So far there is no official statement out of Tehran. We will keep this page updated as more information comes available. UPDATE: 12:15pm PST- Here is CJTFOIR’s statement on the engagement, which states Russia tried to keep the convoy from proceeding toward the base: UPDATE: 12:42pm PST- The coalition base near An Tanf was also recently the site of a hellish firefight with ISIS. UPDATE: 1:09pm PST- Here’s Congressman Lieu’s take on the strike: From Thehill.com : “We notified the coalition that we were being attacked by the Syrian army and Iranians in this point and the coalition came and destroyed the advancing convoy,” Muzahem al Saloum, from the Maghawir al Thwra group, said.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 26, 2017",Air Force One May Make Historic First Direct Saudi Arabia To Israel Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Donald Trump is set to make his first international trip as President on Friday. A White House besieged by controversy and federal investigations clearly hopes the excursion abroad can redirect the spotlight while also offering up some much needed positive headlines. One of those may very well be the first disclosed direct flight by any aircraft between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Trump’s first stop will be in Saudi Arabia, where he will be welcomed by some serious fanfare according to reports . There he aims to close a gargantuan arms deal , said to total upwards of $300 billion over the coming decade, and a whopping $100 billion in the near term. He will also likely push for a more robust Arab military alliance, something loosely akin to a middle east NATO, to deal with militant groups, terrorism and to counter Iran’s growing conventional military capabilities and influence abroad. Trump with the Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister of Saudi Arabia. , AP This coalition was already established to a large to degree two years ago, primarily to fight Iranian-backed Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen. Still, formalizing the alliance to a larger degree and better centralizing its command and control while also seeing it give priority to pro-American policy aims will likely be Trump’s goal. He will also meet with other Sunni Gulf states to talk energy and trade. But these subjects could be eclipsed by a much larger diplomatic effort which we will get to in a moment. Afterwards, the President is scheduled to fly to Israel. That’s right, at this time there is no stop planned in between. If this is the case, it is a huge deal. There is no such thing as a direct flights between the two countries. Although a handful of clandestine missions may have occurred, especially considering the improving relations between Israel and the Arab world due to their common enemy, Iran, none have been documented. We’re not just talking about official state flights, this includes all commercial traffic as well. Official diplomatic ties between the Kingdom and the Jewish state don’t exist, and flight plans between the two countries are non-existent as well. AIr Force One (VC-25A) remains one of the most iconic symbols of American power. , AP Usually, to make such an itinerary happen, the aircraft has to land in Jordan, sit on the ground for a few minutes and then execute a new flight plan, or at least act like it was going to stop there, before continuing on to Israel and visa-versa. It is a bizarre and sad setup to say the least. But in the past, Presidents have flown directly from other Arab countries to Israel. Amir Tibbon of Herratz writes: There is precedent of an American president flying into Israel directly from an Arab country that doesn’t have official relations with it. Bill Clinton did it in 1994, when he arrived in Israel after a short visit in the Syrian capital Damascus. President Richard Nixon did the same thing during his 1974 trip to the Middle East, which was the first time a sitting American president visited Israel. Israir CEO Uri Sirkis told Haaretz that “Trump is drafting a vision which will become reality and bring India and Thailand four hours closer to Israel.” Sirkis was referring to a normalization package offered by the Gulf States if Israel makes gestures towards the Palestinians. These steps include the opening of Saudi Arabia’s airspace to Israeli flights which would substantially shorten the flight time to the Far East. Sirkis added that such a short flightpath would require the consent of other Arab countries as well, but there is hope.” President Trump hasn’t traveled outside the country, in fact he hasn’t even traveled to the western part of the US, in his first four months in office., AP The normalization package Mr Sirkis references is supposedly an unprecedented offering from the Arab world that could revolutionize the middle east. Under the rumored deal, Arab gulf states would formally recognize and open up some form of direct diplomatic and trade relations with the Israel, and open up their airspace to Israeli air traffic, if the Israel government were to agree to a number of prerequisites. These are rumored to include ending its building of settlements in the West Bank , lifting some trade restrictions on Gaza and reengaging in a new set of peace talks with the Palestinians. As it seems to sit now, Trump would likely be the broker that would deliver this plan to Israel. So if all goes as planned, Trump will be teed up for what amounts to a major potential win, and will leave Riyadh on his way to Tel Aviv aboard Air Force One with the landmark proposal in hand. In Israel he will meet both with Benjamin Netanyahu as well as Mahmoud Abbas, with the Arab proposal likely being the hottest topic of discussion. Under these circumstances, the flight, if it occurs as described and if the rumored plan materializes in Saudi Arabia as expected, will not only be historic on a basic level, but it will also be a sign of a changing middle east, with many people’s hopes for a more peaceful region literally riding on the wings of Air Force One.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of PLAAF Su-30MKK Flanker derivatives executed a lively intercept on a USAF WC-135W Constant Phoenix atmospheric sampling jet high above the East China Sea on Thursday. The WC-135 has been forward-deployed to the region in anticipation of North Korea’s sixth nuclear test. Reportedly , during the intercept one of the jets flew inverted above the WC-135, which serves no purpose but intimidation and can be dangerous, especially if either aircraft loses visual contact with the other. Then again, in most cases there isn’t all that much a lumbering C-135 can do to get out of a super maneuverable Su-30s way. WC-130C Constant Phoenix and Chinese Su-30s., PLAAF US Air Force spokesperson stated the following regarding the incident: “While we are still investigating the incident, initial reports from the U.S. aircrew characterized the intercept as unprofessional. The issue is being addressed with China through appropriate diplomatic and military channels.” Of course these “unprofessional” intercepts are nothing new, but most intercepts occur without a major incident. Yet enough of them don’t that the US Navy actually built an elaborate video pod to capture proof of these events. A year ago, a EP-3E Aeries electronic intelligence gathering aircraft had a particularly close encounter with Chinese J-11s near Hainan Island. That incident led to the pod’s rapid development, but the EP-3, Chinese fighters, hostile intercepts and Hainan Island are key words burned into the military intelligence and foreign policy lexicon of both countries. In 2000, a EP-3 was nearly lost after a Chinese fighter collided with it. The aircraft made a emergency landing on Hainan island with large parts of its spy systems and crypto literature intact. This international flashpoint became known as the Hainan Island Incident, and the public is still learning about the extent of its repercussions. Needless to say, the crisis is not far from American spy aircraft crews’ minds when operating near a potentially hostile countries, and especially when trolling near Chinese territory. Chinese fighters going inverted over a large US surveillance aircraft is not something necessarily new either , and Russia and China both have a particularly spotty track record for making some crazy moves during intercepts off their territory. A Chinese Su-30 and H-6K fly in close proximity. , AP There have been agreements at the highest levels of government between China and the US outlining protocol for these types of encounters, but it seems as if the PLAAF has a remarkably short memory. Still, don’t be fooled, this type of thing just doesn’t continue to happen without consent by senior officials within the Chinese military. What’s most interesting is this incident has come at a time when the US and China are experiencing something of a honeymoon period following Trump and Jinping’s meeting at Mar-a-Lago early last April. Both sides seem to have come to an agreement to work together, at least temporarily, to curb North Korea’s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile ambitions, and China seems to be making good on their end of the agreement. In the meantime, the US Navy has non-coincidentally stopped executing freedom of navigation drills near China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea. Is this aggressive intercept the first sign of cracks in the young Trump-Jinping alliance? We’ll just have to wait and see.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 6, 2019",USAF Research Lab Has Released This Image Of Its Low-Cost Stealthy Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have followed the Air Force Research Lab’s (AFRL) Low Cost Attritable Strike (LCAS) program closely for some time , and now the “bleeding-edge” weapons development arm of the Air Force has released a rendering of what appears to be its vision for concept under the Low Cost Attritable Aicraft Technology (LCAAT) banner, and it looks pretty impressive. Target drone gurus Kratos, who have bet big on the LCAS concept—bringing a relatively inexpensive, optionally reusable unmanned combat air vehicle to the forefront of air warfare technology—has progressed to developing two distinct types of these unique drones. This includes the UTAP-22, which is based on the BQM-167 target drone, and the XQ-222, which is a larger more complex system with a higher degree of low observability (stealth), payload and range. Both of these systems just received their official names earlier this month, with the sleek and quick UTAP-22 being dubbed “Mako” and the more advanced XQ-222 getting the “Valkyrie” moniker. The XQ-222 is the aircraft currently set to move forward into testing under the LCAS program, and the Navy has already began testing the UTAP-22 in the “loyal wingman,” manned-unmanned teaming role. Basic info on the UTAP-22 (left) and XQ-222 (right). Rendering of the QX-222., Kratos Kratos renderings of the XQ-222 look similar to the Air Force Research Laboratory’s image, although the Kratos design appears to be less sleek, with faceted sides, clipped tips on its wings and tail, and features a more pronounced inlet, similar to that of the EADS Barracuda . This configuration could have changed depending on its final design requirements. Multiple XQ-222s are currently under construction at Kratos’s plant in Sacramento and test flying is slated to begin in late 2018. On the other hand, the AFRL could be showing us an entirely new LCAAT concept, and the fact that the system has wheels may be a tell that this is the case as the QX-222 is launched via a rocket from a stand and recovered via parachute like its smaller UTAP-22 cousin. Maybe this is a rendering of an ever larger, longer-ranged and overall more stealthy but still relatively affordable unmanned combat air vehicle—a system that would take the concept closer to the capability of an advanced, fighter-sized Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle. We’ll contact the Air Force Research Lab for more clarification as to what the image depicts, and what stage the craft—or one like it—is in its development. That is if it is indeed something they are pursuing separately from the XQ-222 at all.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 8, 2019",What Do The Russians Have Planned Off Libya’s Coast Next Week?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s increased interest in Libya is nothing new—we have reported on it in detail before —but the possibility of Moscow intervening in that bloody and chaotic civil war with cruise missile strikes is. That is one very plausible reason behind Russia’s issuing of a notice to airman (NOTAM) warning of an impending “rocket test” off the eastern coast of the country next week. The NOTAM has been issued to include a daily 11-hour window from May 24th through the 27th, when the activity could occur. The area effected runs off the shore of Libya from roughly the Egyptian border to 150 miles west, and out to sea about 100 miles. These types of notices for “test launches” and “maritime exercises” have often preceded major strikes on Syria by Russia’s various cruise missile launch platforms, included ships, aircraft and submarines. In particular, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet now has two modern Admiral Grigorovich frigates capable of firing Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=k0GImEfpCZI In past years, similar warning zones have almost always been relegated to the far reaches of the eastern Mediterranean, to the waters off Syria. Even legitimate Russia exercises in the area have used the body of water between Crete and the Syrian-Lebanon coastline. Also, Russia’s only warm water port is located in Tartus , Syria, adjacent to this naval operating area. With all this in mind, this latest warning notice is especially peculiar. Eastern Libya has remained particularly mired in chaos in recent months, and just last week, Libyan National Army troops, under the command of the rogue General Khalifa Haftar , struck deeper into central Benghazi . Haftar’s forces are at odds with the UN backed Libyan government in Tripoli, but he is a favorite of the Kremlin. The Russian Navy even hosted the strongman aboard their only carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , as it traversed the region earlier this year . We described Haftar as such in a recent feature on Russia’s increasing involvement in Libya: “Haftar himself has had a complicated political history. He served as a military officer in Gaddafi’s army before running afoul of the enigmatic leader and ending up in prison. In 1990, he moved to the United States after officials in Washington helped secure his release. Though Haftar styles himself head of Libya’s national armed forces, fighting terrorists on behalf of the country’s central government, he has disputed the GNA’s authority and seems intent on becoming president. His spokespersons have declared taking over Tripoli is key to the group’s supposed counter-terrorism mission, implying that government officials are in league with dangerous Islamist extremists.” Rogue Libyan general Khalifa Haftar, AP It seems very possible that Russia could be moving to actively support the General’s forces in the region, and specifically in the coastal power center of Benghazi now that he has established a steady foothold there. Once again, this could be done via cruise missile attacks on opposition forces bases or even via naval gunfire support. Russia would likely classify such an act as an anti-terror campaign in a similar way as it has done in Syria. Russia has deployed a number of special operations troops to eastern Egypt, which are likely operating in Libya in support of Haftar. These troops could work as a targeting cell for such strikes. Just today, Putin seemed ready to deepen Moscow’s involvement in the conflict, after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. Meanwhile, General Haftar met with Egypt’s Army Chief of Staff today, a totally unprecedented event and a signal that a Egyptian-Russian-FLA alliance could be in the works. Another possibility, albeit a less likely one, is the Russians are demoing weaponry for Egypt, who have ordered a lot of hardware from Moscow since the US turned away from Cairo under the Obama Administration. If Russia does become “kinetically” involved in Libya, it would mark a major change in policy by the Kremlin and would act as another reminder of how Russia is willing to opportunistically fill any geopolitical void left by the US . Although the US has periodically waded back into the Libyan civil war, the actions have largely centered around counter-terror operations, with targeted strikes on particular Islamic extremist groups or individuals operating in the country or even occupying portions of it. But Russia may be looking to accomplish an entirely different set of objectives. It Moscow could prop-up Hafter to where his forces can reliably secure the eastern part of Libya, it could offer Russia another warm water port in the Mediterranean and doing so could result in a persistent Russian military presence on NATO’s southern flank.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2017",“Air Force One” Jet Reemerges With Upgraded Communications For World Trip,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Friday both of the 89th Airlift Wing’s VC-25As, the 747-200s that often fly the President around under the callsign Air Force One, sat side-by-side at Andrews AFB, ready to carry the Trump White House on its first big trip overseas. If you looked especially close, you may have noticed that one of the iconic jets had a slightly different silhouette than the other—a somewhat unusual instance for the pair of aircraft that often appear identical. The change is because VC-25 tail number 29000—it’s sister ship is tail number 28000—just came back from a deep overhaul and depot maintenance period. It is during those intensive servicing stretches that new capabilities and upgrades are often added to the ultra high profile 747s. In 29000’s case, it looks as if these upgrades included a major communications enhancement—one suspiciously similar to an upgrade we have recently seen on another of America’s sensitive flying command posts. Both VC-25As on the roll and Andrews, marking the start of the President’s eight day trip abroad. Also a great comparison of the two jets., AP 29000 now features two bulbous satellite communications (SATCOM) “humps” atop its spine. The USAF two VC-25As were born with far more aerials than commercial 747s due their unique communications requirements , and more have been steadily added over their nearly 30 years of service. But the reemergence of 29000 marks the first time “bubble” style SATCOM installations have flown atop the VC-25A. Of course the VC-25A’s older cousin, the USAF’s E-4B National Airborne Operations Center , has featured a massive satellite communications antenna fairing since it got its “B” designation back in 1979. That rounded structure houses the aircraft steerable super-high-frequency and extremely high frequency satellite communications antennas. The domes recently fitted aboard VC-25 29000 are far smaller, but still immediately noticeable. E-4B NAOC. Beyond’s its large SATCOM “hump,” other smaller SATCOM domes and flat SATCOM fairings spot the spine of the E-4B, USAF America’s E-6B Mercury aircraft , that serve in the multi-function survivable command post role and are capable of remotely ordering the launch of America’s ballistic missiles should the call come, also received a similar outfit as VC-25A 29000 recently. The project was fairly high profile, with the USAF putting out a press release highlighting the Mercury’s new communications enhancements and the testing that was done to clear them for operational use. And the E-6B, like the E-4B, has also already had a big satellite communications dome atop its spine for decades, but just months ago it also received a smaller one—as well as protrusions on its belly—as part of the upgrade. Orion’s GII testbed is thought to have been the main development platform for MR-TCDL.  , Airwolfhound-Flickr Commons These new humps were to house the antennas for the new Multi-Role Tactical Common Data Link (MR-TCDL). The system is a highly versatile high-speed connectivity node that can push all types of data over vast distances. For the E-6B, the MR-TCDL includes two Ku band line-of-sight channels and one Ka satellite communications channel. The line of sight systems, which are mounted on the belly of the jet, are primarily used for connecting with ground communications entry points and to work as relay receivers for communications happening on the earth’s surface below. Upgraded E-6B with MR-TCDL antennas domes seen atop the jet just behind the wing’s trailing edge and on its belly below., DoD MR-TCDL has been fielded aboard the USAF’s shy but invaluable Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) E-11 aircraft. In battlefields like Afghanistan it has allowed troops on the ground to communicate clearly with command elements far away while in mountainous terrain, to relay high-definition video, and to send all sorts of other data from the battlefield to “customers” around the globe in real time. Further testing has also proven that the system can be just as relevant over a disaster zone as it is over a battlefield. Working as a flying wireless router and server of sorts—an MR-TCDL capable aircraft equipped with both the Ka band satellite array and the Ku band line-of-sight antennas can provide communications for ground elements operating where traditional communications infrastructure has been destroyed and satellite telephone circuits are overloaded. Northrop Grumman, the system’s manufacture, describes this capability as such : Re-establishing communications is one of the most critical components not only of disaster relief efforts but also homeland security, irregular warfare and defense operations,” said Claude Hashem, Northrop Grumman vice president and deputy general manager of the company’s Network Communications Systems business. “With this MR-TCDL wireless demonstration, we’ve just validated the ability to restore the use and combination of video teleconferencing and cellular phone capabilities across an extensive array of Internet and communication platforms that can be easily transported and set up with minimal effort. “To demonstrate MR-TCDL’s capabilities, Northrop Grumman created a simulated disaster site with inoperable communications systems along with a command center, other wide area networks and telephone end users. The company then set up a mobile wireless kit that provided video teleconferencing, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), chat and mobile phone capabilities restoring communications to the disaster site via the high-capacity MR-TCDL, a system built by L-3 Communications Systems-West, Salt Lake City. This demonstration was accomplished by MR-TCDL’s unique ability to perform as a true joint aerial layered network by providing real-time networking connectivity at rates greater than 200 megabits per second via ground, airborne and satellite networks. We were able to demonstrate this using many of today’s popular communications platforms, including iPads, iPhones and Skype,” Hashem said. The MR-TCDL system proved it could reach more disadvantaged users with limited or no data access and increase the rate of speed at which data is exchanged between the end users of a transportable ground entry point to restore high-bandwidth communications during disaster relief efforts. An aircraft acting as Air Force One wouldn’t need the ability to work as a communications relay but it could use the “top end” of the same system for independent military-grade high-speed satellite connectivity anywhere in the world, and especially during emergencies. It is possible, if not probable that this is exactly what these new humps are, and they closely mach those mounted on the E-6B. Even C-32As, the 757s used often as Air Force Two and even Air Force One, and to haul around other government heavyweights from time-to-time, have been coming out of depot with a similar communications enhancements, although with just one dome instead of two. C-32A’s new satcom dome (above ‘UNITED’). Other upgrades include a HUD, enhanced vision system and new interior., Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images Interestingly, the President took VC-25A 28000 to Saudi Arabia, even though the upgraded jet, which certainly has many other refreshed features as well as new communications, also flew on the trip. It is customary to take both VC-25As on multi-stop overseas flights, along with an armada of other aircraft like C-32s, C-40s, C-37s, E-4Bs, as well as the shadowy C-20C that is never far from the President when he travels. This list doesn’t even include the dozens C-17 and C-5 transport flights required to preposition and return home the Presidential motorcade and the VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters of HMX-1 that are needed at each stop. And yes, the helicopters are always there, whether they are used or not. As far as communications go, if both jets were flying together, the President and his staff could probably make use of 29000’s enhanced communications during an emergency even if they were flying on 28000. Data-linked information can like be “pushed” from one VC-25A to the other VC-25A nearby and then sent around the globe using either of the aircraft’s SATCOM systems. The Ka band has become increasingly popular for SATCOM purposes for a number of reasons. These include the band’s inherent reliability, its resilience to jamming and bad weather environments, the tiny sized and weight requirements for antenna (roughly one quarter the size required by other popular bands), and its flexibility—being able to support ground, air and sea applications and to carry all sorts of data at very high speeds. Also, the latest Ka band SATCOM satellites, with the military’s Wideband Global SATCOM constellation being the pioneer of sorts, uses directed beams for connectivity, not far less effective wide area coverage, which means data transfer is much more reliable and way faster. It is said that just one WGS satellite has more bandwidth than all the other satellites in the Defense Satellite Communications System combined. That is precisely why Wideband Global SATCOM systems will steadily augment and then replace many of the military’s aging Satellite Communications System Phase III, Milstar, UHF and other communications satellites. The domed installations seen on the VC-25A, C-32A, and E-4B, and the description of the MR-TCDL’s satellite connectivity capabilities in particular, seem remarkably similar to those now being developed in the commercial world for Immersat’s Global Xpress network of satellites . It also uses the Ka band and is optimized for moving vehicle applications. Honeywell’s Jetwave Ka band satcom installation has been approved for 757s, like the C-32A and can use Global Xpress., Honeywell Past Ku band aircraft satellite communications systems were designed to adapt to the limitations of existing satellite data networks that were not intended for quickly moving “customers.” Global Xpress, which has four satellites in orbit, was built from the ground up with aircraft and other moving vehicles in mind, so installations on vehicles can be tailored to the system to get the very most out of it. It is said to deliver ground-like bandwidth and data transfer speeds. Viasat also has similar capabilities with tailored applications for the US military available and in use. It is likely that the Pentagon is using the same hardware architecture to access both military and emerging commercial Ku band satellites. That way it can use commercial satellites for everyday SATCOM communications, and then switch to its network of highly secure Global Wideband SATCOM satellites for classified and sensitive data transfer. It is possible that the DoD even has leased discreet capacity on these new commercial satellites for secure SATCOM connectivity. Ever since the communications frustrations of 9/11, the White House Communications Agency and the Pentagon have worked especially hard to leverage the latest technologies to keep the President and their cabinet in the loop at all times, and especially when POTUS is cocooned at 40,000 feet within the fuselage of Air Force One. The arrival of the latest and greatest data-link technology on the VC-25A fleet shortly after it appeared on another key command and control asset is not a coincidence. Similar Ka band SATCOM domes will surely pop up on other aircraft associated with continuity of government and strategic command and control, such as the E-4B, C-20C, and eventually even C-37s and C-40s that serve other key players in the National Command Authority, the military, and the federal government. In fact, it’s possible the E-4B actually got some sort of similar upgrade before the E-6B. The aircraft has been sporting two line-of-sight data-link antenna protrusions on its belly for about half a decade now. This could be “the bottom half” of MR-TCDL suite that takes advantage of the the E-4’s different satellite links for moving data from below to around the world. Or it could have the full MR-TCDL suite, we just don’t know. Considering the E-4B can be tasked to the Pentagon as well as FEMA, having the ability to provide communications relay duties over a disaster are—manmade or otherwise—would probably be a high priority for these jets. Paired with aerial refueling, they could stay on station for the a couple days following a major catastrophe. Not just that, but they could provide worldwide connectivity for whoever is onboard, or possibly for a command post very nearby, while sitting on the ground. Regardless, a pair of multi-role Ku band SATCOM arrays is a nearly perfect communications tool for Air Force One. It can give its passengers high-speed internet and voice over IP access on a daily basis, while also being able to be used to transfer sensitive information and command and control purposes during a crises. While President Trump’s first trip overseas is historic on many levels, it interesting to know that one of the two VC-25As supporting the mission is connected to the world like a Presidential aircraft has never been before.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 27, 2017","U-2 Flies in Alaska Exercise for First Time, But Not as a Spy Plane","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force routinely uses the annual Northern Edge exercise in Alaska to test out advanced technology and new tactics to go along with those state-of-the-art systems. From newly released photos and video, itâ€™s clear the 2017 iteration of the war game was no different. For Northern Edge 2017, which ran from May 1 to 212, 2017, the 9th Reconnaissance Wing situated at Beale Air Force Base in California sent a U-2S, 130 personnel, and associated equipment to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. This was the first time a Dragon Lady spy plane had ever taken part in the exercise â€“ and in this case the unit had configured the aircraft primarily to act as a powerful communications relay. Going to Northern Edge â€œallows the U-2 to demonstrate new advanced technology that is coming out, such as sensor and communication packages,â€ an Air Force officer identified only as Major Dustin, a member of the 9th Reconnaissance Wingâ€™s 99th Reconnaissance Squadron, told the serviceâ€™s reporters . â€œBy merging test development, operational test and experimental technologies, we are looking at opportunities to advance the U-2 program in both the near term as well as the next 2-5 years,â€ another official, a Major Brian from Detachment 2, 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, added. USAF For the practice sessions, the U-2S was carrying gear that â€œfully integrated the Dragon Lady with 4th and 5th generation aircraft,â€ according to an official news item. The story did not specify what this system was, but pictures and video showed a U-2S with a distinctive white package in the aircraftâ€™s equipment slot underneath the fuselage behind the cockpit, which is commonly known as the â€œ Q-Bay .â€ A yellow-brown antenna was visible sticking out of the modular section. In July 2015, Lockheed Martinâ€™s famous Skunk Works special projects office showed off pictures of a very similar looking setup on a U-2 at their facility in Palmdale California. The Maryland headquartered defense contractor designed and built the first U-2s in the 1950s and has continued to support and improve the aircraft. â€œThis demonstration focused on communications relay capabilities and dynamic weapon retargeting,â€ John Clark, the head of Skunk Works, said at the time. In that instance, the Dragon Lady acted as a gateway for sending information between 4th generation F/A-18 Hornet and 5th generation F-22 Raptor fighter jets. The aircraft used the information to point a surrogate of the firmâ€™s Long Range Anti-Ship Missile at a different target while the weapon was already in flight. A U-2S with a similar communications package at Lockheed’s Palmdale plant in 2015., Lockheed Martin The U-2S that went to Northern Edge came straight from Lockheed’s Skunk Work’s Plant 42, further suggesting this was the same system or an new version thereof. With this sort of data link, the aircraft would have had more than enough opportunities to show off similar capabilities during the exercise. The 2017 event also featured stealthy F-22s and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. While you were sleeping… A USAF Lockheed U-2 departed Palmdale & landed at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska https://t.co/vWVRh8qw16 — CivMilAir âœˆğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ (@CivMilAir) April 30, 2017 One of the biggest potential benefits of the F-35 is its ability to collect huge amounts of information from its on board sensors and send those details along to other American forces in the air and on the ground. If everything works as intended, between its AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, infrared Electro-Optical Targeting System , and AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System for increased situation awareness, the Joint Strike Fighters should have the ability to spot and categorize a variety of potential threats and points of interest. Â With fast-scanning AN/APG-77 AESA, AN/ALR-94 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) system, and data links, the Raptors are powerful information â€œ sponges â€ in their own right. And thatâ€™s not to mention the various other aircraft that took part in the training missions. These included Air Force F-15C Eagles â€“ some of which may have had the AN/APG-63(V)3 AESA , which is arguably one of the best radars available on the market â€“ and E-3 AWACS and U.S. Navy E-2 Hawkeye radar planes. In short, there was a lot of information available to send around.Â The U-2S at Northern Edge 2017., USAF More importantly, without a specialized gateway, the participating aircraft would have had far fewer options to communicate the data among themselves, if it was possible at all. The Joint Strike Fighters can share information with 4th generation fighters like the F-15 and F-16 via the Link 16 network system, but they can’t do so and remain stealthy. The Raptors simply aren’t set up to share information with older aircraft at all. Moving this information around quickly and efficiently gives pilots a better understanding of their surroundings and the ability to make better decisions about how to proceed with their mock missions. It also lets aviators in 4th generation aircraft take advantage of these more advanced sensors, improving their overall combat effectiveness and survivability. Also, BACN creates an “active net” over the battlefield. Without a similar data fusion and relay system operating from on high, aircraft would lose contact with other assets while traveling at low altitudes or over longer distances. Ground and surface units may also have a less complete and constant picture of what is going on around them. With a satellite data link â€“ like the U-2S’ Senior Span/Spur pod on top of the fuselage â€“ a pilot could send the data back to base or to commanders on the ground during actual combat missions giving various units a improved picture of the battlefield, too.Â And able to fly above 70,000 feet and with a unrefueled range of more than 7,000 miles, the U-2 is a perfect choice for this task, which requires the plane to fly regular patterns across an area for extended periods of time. In the past, NASA has teamed up with the Air Force to provide a similar capability during exercises with WB-57F Canberras, an old spy plane-turned-research aircraft, fitted with Northrop Grumman’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN). The BACN system is the Air Force’s only existing method of providing this level of exchange between aircraft and has seen widespread use in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the U.S. Air Force’s three EQ-4B Global Hawks with the BACN package., USAF On top of that, the Air Force already employs the Dragonâ€™s Ladyâ€™s unmanned competitor, Northrop Grummanâ€™s Global Hawk, as a BACN platform. The 380th Air Expeditionary Wing at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates has all three of these EQ-4B Global Hawks. In November 2015, the aircraft completed their 500th mission as part of the aerial campaign against ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Theyâ€™ve been so critical to that fight, in January 2017 the Pentagon approved a request to convert another RQ-4B drone into a fourth flying data center at a total cost of $42.5 million. With a similar and modular package for the U-2, the Air Force could rapidly employ any of the 26 Dragon Ladies in this role. This feature could become another factor in the ongoing debate over whether to completely replace the iconic U-2s with the Global Hawk drones. As of 2016, the Air Force was still considering whether or not to send the Dragon Ladies to the boneyard within three years. We at the War Zone have already written extensively about the various potential issues involved in that plan and the Air Force’s long history of trying to retire these manned spy planes. Itâ€™s very likely that the aircraftâ€™s proponents within the Pentagon and in Congress, as well as Lockheed itself, will point to Northern Edge 2017 as another example of the planeâ€™s continued value to the U.S. military.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Now The U.S. Coast Guard Wants Cruise Missiles On Its Icebreakers Too,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Russia is building literally a new armada of new icebreakers, ice-capable supply ships, a massive arctic “research” submarine and icebreaker surface combatants armed with cruise missiles, the Pentagon is now looking at arming its relatively tiny fleet of future icebreakers with similar weapons as well. The revelation came during a House subcommittee on Homeland Security hearing where Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft was discussing the service’s plans to build three new medium icebreakers, with the first delivery occurring by 2023. A major design study is underway now and the nature of the icebreaker’s capabilities still remain up for debate, but the ability to add heavy weapons is something USCG is now interested in, with the admiral stating: “We need to look differently at what an icebreaker does… We need to reserve space, weight and power if we need to strap a cruise missile package on it… U.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just power projection; it’s a matter of national security… If they remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of influence to over five million square miles of Arctic ice and water.” The Commandant continued: “The advantage you have when you’re building national security cutters and now you’re making these more affordable in the long run, you have a hot production line… Maybe, you know, 10, 12 years from now the world changes, but at least you’re producing these at an affordable price, a predictable price, and on schedule.” USCG Icebreaker Healy, one of just two operational icebreakers in US inventory., USCG Basically the idea is that with a hot icebreaker shipbuilding line, and a shipbuilding industry that knows how to make them, new capabilities can be inserted into designs already in production, or new ships could be built altogether without having to “spin up” icebreaker construction from scratch, which is a costly affair. Right now there are only two active icebreakers at the USCG’s disposal and one is a 40 year old Polar class ship that is running on parts cannibalized from its sister ship. The other is the more modern, but still nearly 20 year old, Healy . And these ships have to be split between the the Arctic and Antarctica. The National Science Foundation also charters an icebreaker , but it is not a military ship. The three icebreakers slated to be built in the near-term are medium icebreakers, capable of breaking through roughly eight feet of ice. Three heavy icebreakers are supposedly going to be built as well, but when or with what funds are anyone’s guess. Heavy icebreakers can smash their way though a whopping 21 feet of ice. Russia’s designs on the Arctic couldn’t be more clear, I have been reporting on it for years, and Moscow continues building up the region with air defenses , deep water ports, airfields and massive outposts . They are also training their forces how to fight in such harsh and austere conditions on an unprecedented level. This stark reality offers a lot reason for the US not only quickly building new icebreakers, but arming those ships with high-end weaponry, including long-range cruise missiles. It would also provide some sort of counterbalance, although limited, against Russia’s new Ice class icebreaking corvettes that are capable of carrying containerized Club-K and Kalibr missiles. Russia’s shallow-draft nuclear-powered icebreaker Taymyr. , Tuomas Romu/wikicommons It is possible that by adding major weaponry to its new icebreakers, including anti-ship and land-attack missiles, as well as potent defenses, the Coast Guard can make a better case as to utility and urgent need for these ships. Then again, doing so will only add to their cost, which would put even more pressure on the Coast Guard’s six new icebreaker goal. Even if the USCG got all the new icebreakers it is asking for and retained Healy for another couple of decades, that would give the force seven hulls in total. By comparison, Russia has roughly 40 icebreakers already in service, with many more on the way. Still, something is better than nothing, and nothing is nearly what the USCG has right now when it comes to its ice breaking capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 4, 2018",US Destroyer Just Made A Near Pass On One Of Beijing’s South China Sea Outposts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The US Navy just executed its first freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) in South China Sea since late last October. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey (DDG-105) made its way inside 12 nautical miles from the Mischief Reef—one of China’s largest man-made island redoubts in the Spratly Island Archipelago. The built-up reef features a runway long enough to operate most anything in the PLAAF’s inventory, and the airfield’s dispersals are being outfitted to house fighters, as well as visiting bombers and maritime patrol aircraft. Additionally, like China’s other bases in the area, Mischief Reef is also being increasingly armed with heavy weaponry. The first US Navy FONOP that targeted China’s dubious territorial claims in the South China Sea occurred in October of 2015 . The last mission happened a year later, in October of 2016. That was under the Obama administration, and some of these operations resulted in some intense encounters. Tensions soared even higher towards the last days of Obama’s second term when the Chinese plucked a submersible research glider from South China Sea waters. That innocuous device was quickly returned, but it set a grim stage for an incoming President that had already spouted some heavy rhetoric towards Beijing during his campaign—including calling out China’s designs on the South China Sea and their man-made island bases under construction there. USS Dewey , USN Surprising to many, and frustrating to some, the Trump administration has been largely silent on the South China Sea issue since taking the White House in January of 2017. Even after meeting extensively face-to-face with China’s President Xi Jinping at Trump’s own resort in Florida, the topic seemed to be all but off limits. The reason why was made fairly clear by Trump himself on numerous occasions—he didn’t want to upset the already tenuous US-Chinese relationship while he was trying to get China to reel-in an increasingly belligerent and more frighteningly armed North Korea. The strategy makes some sense, although it has ruffled the feathers of some hardliners that see China as an untrustworthy strategic partner on pretty much any level, and who continue to classify Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea as akin to a major threat to international commerce, hemispherical stability, and to the general notion of sovereignty in the region overall. Even The Philippines , which just recently seemed to becoming increasingly submissive to Beijing’s will in the South China Sea, is making a new push to fortify its own claims there. This comes as President Trump and The Philippines eccentric new President Rodrigo Duterte seem to be forming a budding relationship. Although there have been signs that China has put pressure on Pyongyang to cease with rampant missile tests and nuclear threats, not much has come of it. And the good will between Trump and Jinping may be showing signs of decay. Just last week a Chinese Su-30 executed a dangerous intercept on a USAF WC-135C atmospheric testing aircraft—an encounter that included the Flanker derivative going inverted atop the lumbering surveillance aircraft. It is very possible that this FONOPS mission was a response to that incident, and is once again, a signal that the relationship between Beijing and Washington may be starting to cool to Obama era temperatures. We’ll have to keep an eye on the situation for further indicators. This latest FONOPS drill also comes as Japan’s largest warship has sailed into the South China Sea and is undergoing international drills with nearby Vietnam and the US. Vietnam sees China’s territorial grabs in the crowded body of water as a major threat. If anything else, sending USS Dewey into China’s claimed territorial waters around Mischief Reef definitely puts the whole South China Sea issue back to the diplomatic forefront for both countries.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 11, 2018","Love Him or Hate Him, Trump Is Right When It Comes to NATO Spending","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Trump on NATO, what a tangled web he wove. During his campaign he questioned the alliance’s relevancy, then said it needed to be revamped to fight terrorism, and all while slamming NATO member countries for not paying “their fair share.” These statements rocked the alliance—one that is more important now than it has been for over 25 years. But just because NATO is strategically imperative, doesn’t mean some member countries, especially the comparatively wealthy ones, should be able to put whatever price tag they want on their inclusion in the alliance. In recent years, the goal has been to get NATO alliance members to spend 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. This standard may not be a perfect way of measuring each country’s contribution, but it does provide a baseline to go off of, and whichever way you view it, some countries clearly need to invest more money into their war-fighting capacity in order to be on par with others members. President Trump said the following during today’s NATO summit in Belgium—the first of which he has attended since becoming Command In Chief: “Members of the alliance must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations… Twenty-three of the 28-member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they are supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States…Two percent is the bare minimum for confronting today’s very real and very vicious threats. If NATO countries made their full and complete contributions, then NATO would be even stronger than it is today, especially from the threat of terrorism.” Trump talking to the UK’s Boris Johnson. Both men are known for their eccentric qualities. , AP Currently, the US spends 3.61% of its GDP on defense, Greece is second at 2.36%, and little Estonia is third at 2.2%. The UK and Poland also exceed the goal, spending 2.17% and 2.01% respectively. But then you get into the countries who are falling behind; most are, and some of them in drastic fashion. France is close to the goal at 1.8%, and Turkey isn’t that far off at 1.69%. Norway is three-quarters of the way there at 1.5%, as are Lithuania, Latvia, and Romania, and Portugal is at 1.4%. From there, things go south real quick. Germany spends just 1.2% of its GDP on defense, as does the Netherlands, Denmark, Albania, Croatia, and Slovakia. Italy spends 1.11%. Canada spends just over half the stated goal at a paltry 1%, as does the Czech Republic and Hungary. Spain spends 0.9%, as does Belgium. Tiny Luxembourg spends just 0.4% of its GDP on its own defense. For those countries that are spending, say, 1.5% of GDP and above, getting to the 2% goal seems attainable without major systemic changes in their spending habits. But when you see relatively affluent countries like Germany and Canada being so far off, it is troubling to say the least. US Army soldiers training in Estonia. , AP The hard part about the 2% of GDP metric is that every country is unique, with their own histories, pressing issues and challenges. And each member is motivated to spend money on defense due to different elements—some of them geographical, some of them sociological and some are economical. For instance, France largely supports its own defense industry. And just going off a static percentage of GDP figure doesn’t tell the whole story as to why a country may be far from the agreed-upon goal. Member countries also contribute to NATO—as in the institution itself, not their own defense capabilities—based an agreed-upon formula that uses Gross National Income as its leading metric. As a result of this formula, the US contributes the most at roughly 22% of NATO’s budget. Germany is next at about 14.5%. France is third at 10.5%, and Britain comes in fourth at 10%. The allies that joined after the fall of the Soviet Union all pay less than 1% of NATO’s operating cost. Although these proportions are significantly different than the percentage of GDP figures, they can also be a bit misleading. NATO’s total budget is $2.3 billion. So the US picks up roughly half a billion dollars of that yearly price tag. Germany shells out $333 million. This is not huge money for any of these major players, and NATO represents a great investment, considering what these countries get in return. A pair of German Tornados sit idle. Germany spends just over half its 2% GDP goal on defense, with its military shrinking drastically in recent years., AP Thing is, that 2% of GDP goal, which was reaffirmed during a NATO summit in 2014, is a goal , not an immediate demand. The idea is that everyone would be able to reach that metric by 2024, not within the first year of the Trump administration. But without some sort of prodding or consequences, it is doubtful that such a goal will be achievable by 2024. There is also the issue of end strength and capability mix. Just having each country spend money on defense in a vacuum is an inefficient way to plan for a common defense under an alliance like NATO. A far more holistic approach cold be introduced to design NATO more along the lines as an integral total force, rather than just a bunch of countries tossing their capabilities into a hat during a time of conflict. To some degree, this is already happening. There are shared assets that NATO provides, and a rapid response force exists. There is also some thought given to having some counties fill capability gaps where other countries may fall short. Even pooling air transport resources is occurring among some NATO members. The US provides a massive amount of “unique” capabilities to the alliance as well. These large scale include aerial refueling and advanced surveillance and communications capabilities, just to name a few. The US even stockpiles munitions and other expendables that NATO members have pulled from in the past—maybe to too large a degree. But by coordinating and planning more carefully, repeated capabilities that NATO already has an abundance of could be eliminated from some member state’s militaries and capability gaps could be filled with those same funds. A Romanian MiG-21 and a USAF F-16D over Romania. The US has had a near-constant presence in eastern Europe over the last two years. Offering to provide poorer NATO allies with better equipment could take the pressure off US forces and give these countries an incentive to spend more on their own defense., AP Even the US could do more by providing surplus weaponry to less fortunate NATO allies, who can then take the money saved on costly procurement and spend it on operations. This would help with enhancing NATO’s military presence in the eastern stretches of Europe, and would mean countries located there could rely less on the US for day-to-day deterrence . In the end it would likely save the US money and enhance NATO’s collecting war fighting ability in the process. The big question is how do you get dozens of NATO member countries to decide on another rubric for required defense spending? Maybe an independent commission could look at each country, their current capabilities, and their own domestic challenges, and collectively decide how much they need to spend. But there would almost certainly be claims of unfairness, corruption, and special interest influence by enacting such a plan. If the NATO nations could agree in advance to abiding by a panel’s decision, maybe it could work. When paired with the broader strategy of melding each country’s defense apparatus to prioritize the needs of NATO as a whole, it could go a long way when it comes to getting the most out of defense expenditures made across the NATO alliance. But it would also mean that each country would have to give up a degree of sovereignty when it comes to deciding its own military force mix. As such, less wealthy countries with smaller militaries would be impacted the most by such a scheme. Trump speaking in Brussels., AP With all this in mind, it may be imperfect, but the 2% of GDP goal does seem like the most effective and simplest way to get member states to contribute more equally to NATO’s common defense. But no matter how one quantifies the issue, the outcome remains the same—many NATO countries need to start spending more on their military capabilities. Although claims of freeloading on America and the other NATO states that are spending more than 2% GDP on defense may sound harsh, there is truth in those claims. That may have been fine in the pre-2014 reality, before the reawakening of the Russian Bear and the rapid expansion of ISIS, but today it isn’t. So what can be done? Well, Trump is doing the most logical thing—making this a major issue and demanding countries prioritize their fiscal commitment to the alliance. Maybe the messenger isn’t to many people’s liking, but the message is relevant. In fact, President Obama was on the same page regarding this issue—although the way he described it may have been less controversial, and he never questioned the alliance’s relevancy like his successor has. There has to be some repercussions for those NATO countries that don’t meet the 2% of GDP requirement, or that don’t come up with a plan to spend more on defense and execute on that plan accordingly. Maybe it’s a carrot-and-stick type thing, where the US and the wealthier NATO nations provide extra support and material to less wealthy countries that do meet the goal, and some form of suspension to those that do not. It may seem harsh, but the alliance is put at risk by those who do not live up to the financial obligations required to support it. With nationalist and inward-looking sentiments growing here in the US and Europe, the idea that some NATO countries subsidize the social programs of other NATO states by taking on more of the burden of collective defense is a talking point that could work to destroy the bedrock of the alliance. You may disagree with it, but many feel that way…and they are making their minds heard at the ballot box. The world is a different place than it was just a few years ago, and an alliance based on fiscal equality–or at least fiscal minimums—will result in a stronger NATO. Maybe you can’t stand Donald Trump, maybe you love him—but either way, he is right to demand that all the countries that benefit from the protection that NATO provides must chose to meet their basic obligations in order to do so. And that includes paying their fair share by funding their own defense adequately.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Russian Fighter Intercepted Then Barrel Rolled Atop A KC-10 Flying Over Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two weeks ago, a KC-10A Extender was flying over Syria when a Russian fighter aircraft, presumably a Flanker derivative (Su-30, Su-34 or Su-35), intercepted it. The fighter then executed a barrel roll over the top of the big aerial tanker. This led to the US classifying the incident with the all too common “unprofessional intercept” moniker. In a fairly rare move, the Russians actually apologized for their fighter pilot’s behavior. General Jeffrey Harrigian, who commands USAF assets in the middle east, told reporters: “We had one incident where there was an intercept they ran that I would categorize as unprofessional, and we called them on it and expressed our concern. They came back, quite frankly, and apologized for that particular intercept.” News of this intercept comes just days after a very similar event occurred over the East China Sea between a Chinese Flanker derivative and a USAF WC-135C Constant Phoenix air sampling aircraft. In that case, the fighter pilot also executed a barrel roll over the top of the lumbering Air Force jet. Intercepts between Russian and US, and allied aircraft are common , especially near strategic borders , but these types of encounters have been either less frequent or less publicized in the convolutes skies over Syria. That’s not to say that there haven’t been persistent encounters between Russia, Syrian and coalition aircraft over Syria. Russian and US fighters have crossed paths numerous times before. Additionally, America’s massive drone presence over the country has drawn unique interest from Russian pilots. F-22s have even tailed Syrian fighters around without their aircrews even knowing they were there. Suffice it to say that the skies over Syria are not a lonely place. An armed up Su-35 at Russia’s airbase in Syria. , AP “We have had to increase the amount of de-confliction work we are doing with the Russians given the tighter airspace that we are now working ourselves through,” General Harrigian added. He is referring to a hotline set up between the coalition’s Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and Russia’s airbase south of Latakia, Syria. The hotline went dead following America’s cruise missile attack on Syria early last April, but is back online now. The hotline is thought to also have connectivity to US commanders in Baghdad. This emergency communications link, which was officially setup along with a common set of protocols after talks direct between US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu nearly a year and a half ago, has been used numerous times to various levels of success. The most recent high-profile use of the hotline occurred on May 18th, when a convoy of Shiite militia fighters were rumbling headlong towards a base where Free Syrian Army forces are trained and equipped by US Special Operations personnel. Coalition aircraft ended up turning the stream of vehicles, which included tanks, into rubble after repeatedly trying to warn them to stop their advance. KC-10 refuels Navy Hornets and Super Hornets. , DoD What remains an unknown is where exactly the intercept of the KC-10 took place. Western Syria is largely left to Russian and Assad’s air power, while over eastern Syria the US-led coalition dominates the skies. Following the Tomahawk missile attack on Assad’s airfield, this separation, which was already well defined , has become even more formal, although it is still technically unofficial. With this in mind, it would be interesting to know where precisely the KC-10 was when the incident occurred. It is highly unlikely a vulnerable asset like a tanker was flying over western Syria. So did Russia’s fighter make an excursion east or was there a pressing reason to bring a tanker farther west, near Russian and Assad’s airspace? We may never know, but considering the apology from Russia, it is more likely the fighter was out of place than the tanker.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 18, 2017",Russian Air Power In Syria Blasts Big ISIS Convoy Heading To Palmyra,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syrian state-run SANA news reports that Russian aircraft attacked a column of 39 armed trucks carrying loads of ISIS fighters out of their increasingly surrounded defacto capital of al Raqqa. The convoy was supposedly on its way to the ancient and contested city of Palmyra when the first strikes hit. Russia claims 120 ISIS fighters were killed in the air raid. Video has been distributed showing a montage of airborne infrared video of the column of vehicles and a couple of weapons strikes. The footage was likely recorded by Russian drones. A longer video has also been posted showing an attack helicopter firing a missile at a vehicle as well as other imagery, including the aftermath of the attack. Whether or not this extra video is authentic or not is not clear at this time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZZSJzxec52U https://youtube.com/watch?v=WeCrUTcPHSs It seems as if the strikes actually took place southwest of Palmyra, in the eastern reaches of Homs District. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the convoy wasn’t trying to make it to Palmyra as various checkpoints are set up along Syria’s desert highways, and different areas along a single road can be controlled by various factions, so round-about methods of travel are not uncommon. Also it seems as if the convoy was headed into mountainous terrain when the Russian aircraft pounced. If this large line of vehicles did indeed originate from al Raqqa, it is a bit surprising that they weren’t identified and attacked by US-led coalition forces. The skies over and around the ISIS stronghold are buzzing with surveillance aircraft, sometimes including coalition assets uniquely suited for detecting large mechanized columns moving on roadways, such as anything with a radar that is capable of ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) functions. It may be that there simply weren’t any of these assets on patrol at the time the convoy moved out. Additionally, even if it was detected, coalition strike aircraft may have been unavailable to attack it. With this in mind, it is possible that even if the US knew about the convoy, it had made its way into Russia’s area of responsibility in western Syria by the time the coalition could attack, and the information was passed along. Then again, aside from the possibility it slipped by coalition sensors, maybe it never actually originated from al Raqqa as claimed. We also have no confirmation outside of the Damascus-Moscow narrative that this convoy was indeed made up of ISIS fighters, but if it wasn’t we probably would have heard by now. We’ll have to wait and see if more information is released as to exactly how this convoy was targeted and what aircraft struck it. Also, we don’t see the whole column destroyed in the video. Maybe it just wasn’t shown or it’s possible that there were limited attack assets available to strike it, and those assets chose to make a series of “bookend” strikes to trap the convoy from proceeding—basically stranding it in mountainous terrain. Once things started exploding, it is likely ISIS fighters abandoned their vehicles anyway. This tactic has been used many times in the past, including on the famous Highway of Death at the end of Operation Desert Storm, and the most recent Highway of Death-like assault made on ISIS as they retreated from Fallujah.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 13, 2017",North Korea Says KN-06 SAM System Ready For Production After Successful Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another weekend, another round of North Korean missile tests. But this time Pyongyang fired off a surface-to-air missile from its shadowy KN-06 air defense system, as well as another ballistic missile. The firing of the KN-06, also known as the Pongae-5, is significant as it demonstrates North Korea’s drive to update its defensive capabilities significantly in addition to its rush to validate its nuclear deterrent. The KN-06 is an interesting system in particular because it represents the pinnacle of North Korea’s anti-air capability—one that could prove troublesome for South Korean and American aircraft during a time of war. The KN-06 is based on the Chinese HQ-9 system, which itself is based on the Russian S-300 air defense system. Although the KN-06 was first unveiled nearly seven years ago, it is thought to still be in testing to some some degree. But just like North Korea’s ballistic missiles, Pyongyang seems to have prioritized its development and validation in recent months, executing multiple test launches. Now, after yesterday’s highly publicized firing, North Korea says the system is ready for mass production and wide-scale deployment. The same was said after another successful launch of Pyongyang’s KN-15 road-mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile just a week and a half ago. Kim Kong Un and his merry band watches the test launch of the KN-06 SAM., North Korea State News North Korean state-ran media quoted Kim, who made one of customary visits to the high-profile test, as stating: “Some defects in the weapon system, discovered last year, were perfectly overcome to stand the test… This weapon system, whose operation capability has been thoroughly verified, should be mass-produced to deploy in all over the country like forests so as to completely spoil the enemy’s wild dream to command the air, boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty.” The system uses what appears to be an indigenous version of the mobile 5N63 “Flap Lid” phased array radar , and likely has capabilities somewhat akin to later versions of the S-300P SAM system. This earlier version of the S-300 series of air defense systems could track and engage four targets at the same time, while later versions could track 12 and engage six. The range of the system’s missiles is uncertain, but something between 60 and 90 miles is likely. The test launch is thought to have occurred form Sondok Air Base near North Korea’s central east coast. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ey8sfh1aJek It is highly improbable that the KN-06 possesses all the capability of more advanced generations of the S-300 system, including their enhanced processing power and updated sensors that drastically increase the number of targets these newer systems can track and engage at one time, not to mention more capable on-board missile electronics that better each missile’s probability of a kill. Still, the KN-06 represents a huge leap over the geriatric SAM systems in North Korea’s inventory (SA-2, SA-3, SA-5 etc). Also, because it is road mobile, and can take advantage of the huge number of hardened bunkers, caverns and other “scoot and hide” installations that dot the North Korean countryside, targeting KN-06 batteries would be far more of a dynamic job compared to North Korea’s SAM systems that are set up at fixed positions. So does this system represent a massive threat bordering on an anti-access capability for Pyongyang? No. But it is the high-end of North Korean air defense capabilities, and in the hands of capable operators using wily tactics, it would be a threat that would need to be actively confronted during a conflict. With this in mind, if North Korea puts the system into large-scale production and deploys it accordingly, it will have to be factored in to allied war plans, with major changes to the electronic warfare and a Wild Weasel/SEAD/DEAD order of battle being made to counter it. The KN-06 also serves as yet another reminder of what some of us have been saying for a long time—do not underestimate the North Koreans. Sure their propaganda is hokey and most their equipment and infrastructure is sorely dated, but that doesn’t mean they are stupid. Just look at what they have accomplished in the last year technologically, a feat that many said was impossible in the recent past. On top of that, dedicated and creative fighters, who are fighting for their own country on their own turf, can make even antiquated weaponry deadly, and the KN-06 is far from ancient to begin with. You can see the KN-06 system, including radar, command vehicle, and TELs. Advance to 1:14:00 if the vide doesn’t advance automatically: https://youtube.com/watch?v=PzPvhrh7gLM The development of the KN-06 also has clear cross-over benefits technologically with North Korea’s ballistic missile programs. There are particular synergies with guidance and especially launch systems between the two very different types of missile concepts. North Korea’s mastering of the “cold launch” system, where compressed gas expels the missile before its own rocket motor ignites in mid-air for climb out, likely came from examination of more modern Russian designed air defense systems and their Chinese clones. As did the missiles’ solid fuel propulsion systems. This knowledge has enabled their submarine ballistic missile program and gave birth to the KN-15, which is really their most credible and capable ballistic missile at this time. The KN-15 which is based on the KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile that has been tested aboard the country’s single Simpo class submarine. The War Zone reported the following last February shortly after the first known successful KN-15 launch: “Cold launching is a hard capability to master, but if perfected it can result in a lighter, longer-ranged missile that can be deployed very quickly, as well as a less weighty TEL. Cold launches also feature a “cleaner” launch sequence with less localized impact, and allows for launches in tighter spaces. On the other hand, if the missile’s fuel and rocket systems are not reliable, a cold launch of a solid-fueled missile can be more dangerous than a liquid-fuel missile that uses the hot launch method. This is because once the missile is ejected during a cold launch, if its motor fails to start as timed it will fall back down on the TEL and explode. Cold launch systems can also have wind limitations as well…” PAC-3 Patriot missile battery outside Japan’s Ministry of Defense in Tokyo. , AP When it comes to North Korea’s ballistic missile program, this weekend was also eventful. Pyongyang followed the KN-06 launch Saturday with a ballistic missile launch on Sunday. The missile was fired from Wonsan on North Korea’s eastern coastline and flew some 260 miles, impacting the water within Japan’s exclusive economic zone where shipping and fishing are especially prevalent. The reaction has been the same as always with critical statements being released by Pacific Command, Tokyo and Seoul. It seems that this time the missile was of the short-range variety but we will have to wait till more data is released to better understand its capabilities and type.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 31, 2017",High Stakes For Today’s Overdue Missile Defense Test Against An ICBM,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon will finally test its Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system against an ICBM today—a high-stakes and delayed test that could have big geopolitical and domestic repercussions. The idea that this is the first time the GMD interceptors have been tested to confront the threat they were designed to counter is a sign of just how rickety America’s “missile shield” really is, and it would be laughable if it weren’t so alarming, considering the tens of billions of dollars and decades of development that have gone into fielding the system. GMD has far from a stellar record—just nine of the 17 tests were deemed successful, and keep in mind that few of these tests, if any, represented anything near a real-world surprise attack scenario. Instead, they are highly “canned” exercises that occur only when all the system’s constellation of sensors, communications nodes and launch assets are perfectly in place and operating nominally. But that hasn’t kept the Pentagon from fielding the system. By the end of December 2017, a total of 44 of these interceptors will be based at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California (four units) and Fort Greely in Alaska (40 units), which is up eight units from 2016. Ground-based Missile Defense installation at Fort Greenly, Alaska. , Google Earth We have talked about how limited America’s GMD capability is and how it is supposed to work , but the realities of the current state of the country’s ability to protect itself from even a low-volume ballistic missile barrage is likely incongruent with the public’s perception of the system. The very idea of a “missile shield” provides a false sense of security that really doesn’t exist. In recent years, this was not such a big deal. But with North Korea marching headlong towards an ICBM capability, the topic has migrated to the top of the American consciousness. People are worried that their city may be on Pyongyang’s target list, and if today’s test fails, America’s missile defense shield—or lack thereof—could blossom onto the A-block cable news shows and the front pages of newspapers and popular news websites. It is unclear how a failure or a success would factor into GMD programs fiscally. Would the scare of a fallible missile shield lead many to demand more spending on the technologies that support the system, or would it lead to a much deeper look into how such a questionable capability has been fielded in the first place? In fact, a successful test—even if it were under laboratory-like conditions—could also lure the populous and law makers into thinking the system works, even though that may not be the case under real-world conditions. This false sense of security could damage the program’s ability to gain additional funding for improving the system to a point that it is actually reliable in a truly operational scenario. One thing is certain: the failure of the GMD system would likely increase pressure on the Trump Administration and the international community to do more to neuter Pyongyang’s accelerating nuclear and missile programs. Japan is already making drastic strides to come to terms with the fact that North Korea could rain down missiles on its territory, with Tokyo procuring its own missile defense and even, potentially, a stand-off long-range strike capability . Countering short- to medium-range ballistic missiles is a much more sorted out affair than doing the same for ICBMs. Sea- and land-based Aegis, and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems are not suited for counter-ICBM defense, so just sticking a bunch of picket ships along America’s west coast or installing a handful of THAAD batteries in the continental US in not a viable option. Putting even more pressure on today’s test, just hours before the exercise would begin, the Government Accountability Office released a report on ballistic missile defense programs that was not exactly glowing. It outlined how even after spending $123 billion on ballistic missile defense, with another $37 billion by 2021, these systems still have myriad of major faults and deficiencies. These programs have systemic issues with concurrent procurement and testing, slipping test schedules, an insular Missile Defense Agency that needs to work to reach out to better define its capabilities and goals, and a questionable ability to work as advertised, with the synopsis stating that “testing revealed that the BMDS level capabilities delivered will not likely provide robust defense as planned.” GAO As for today’s test, which was long delayed, the GAO said: “FTG-15 is designed to be the first GMD test against anIntercontinental Ballistic Missile range target using upgraded avionics in the booster. We have previously reported on the need for GMD to conduct this test so the warfighter can have a better understanding on the interceptor’s capabilities and limitations. According to program documentation, FTG-15 was delayed, in part, due to developmental challenges with the interceptor. Delays in conducting FTG-15 increase the risk to completing the fielding of 44 GBIs by the end of December 2017. According to program documentation, the program recognizes that to complete the deadline, concurrency is warranted, but is taking mitigation steps to reduce the risks of a compressed schedule. As we have previously reported, GMD is relying on high-risk acquisition practices, including concurrent development and fielding to achieve its goal of fielding 44 interceptors by the end of 2017. Delaying FTG-15, increases this risk associated with fielding interceptors within its established time frame because it will reduce the time between the conduct of the test and the subsequent manufacturing and fielding of the GBIs necessary to complete the requirement.” The Bush Administration both greatly accelerated BMD programs and handicapped them by allowing the Missile Defense Agency to work outside of traditional procurement channels. Many of the systemic issues these systems experience today is a result of this mad rush development strategy. The larger question really is this: When will America have a robust defense against ICBM attacks by rogue nations? Right now the system exists in an experimental form, and it’s unclear why such a system would need 44 interceptors that will likely become outdated as the technology progresses. This is especially true considering North Korea still doesn’t posses a single ICBM or a reliable and verified warhead to put atop it. The sticker price alone for fielding even a pocket force of these missiles is bewildering, and considering it cannot counter a barrage by a peer competitor, what’s the point of having 44 GMD interceptors to begin with? The system doesn’t provide any sort of a shield against a ICBM attacks from Russia or even China, and the fact remains that it is far cheaper for a major power to just build more ICBMs than it is for America to build interceptors and the infrastructure needed to make them effective to defend against a peer-state ICBM barrage. But still, Russia in particular will not be happy about any advances in American ICBM defenses as Moscow sees such a capability as a major disruptor to their nuclear deterrent’s credibility, as well as the strategy of mutually assured destruction and the general balance of terror that was staple of the Cold War.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 30, 2017",Test ICBM Was Successfully Intercepted According To Missile Defense Agency,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today’s high stakes launch of a ground-based midcourse defense (GMD) interceptor against an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) target, the first test of its kind, has been deemed a success by the Missile Defense Agency. The missile was launched from Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll, some 4,200 miles away from Vandenberg AFB, where the GMD interceptor was fired off. In a statement released to reporters, the Missile Defense Agency stated: During the test, an ICBM-class target was launched from Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Multiple sensors provided target acquisition and tracking data to the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system. The Sea-Based X-band radar, positioned in the Pacific Ocean, also acquired and tracked the target. The GMD system received the target tracking data and developed a fire control solution to intercept the target. A ground-based interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and its exo-atmospheric kill vehicle intercepted and destroyed the target in a direct collision. “The intercept of a complex, threat-representative ICBM target is an incredible accomplishment for the GMD system and a critical milestone for this program,” said MDA Director Vice Admiral Jim Syring. “The System is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrated that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat. I am incredibly proud of the warfighters who executed this test and who this system everyday.” Initial indications are that the test met its primary objective, but program officials will continue to evaluate the system performance based upon telemetry and other data obtained during the test. GMD interceptor blasts off out of Vandenberg AFB on May 30th, 2017., AP We’ll have to wait and see if any more details are released about the test, and what exactly a “threat-representitive ICBM target” is. ICBMs aren’t a monolithic capability. More advanced models are capable of deploying multiple types of confusing decoys, and can even alter trajectory suddenly in flight. This is where target discrimination and the kill-vehicle’s ability to adapt on the fly comes into play. In fact, the whole GMD system would be taxed far heavier against an advanced threat than a simple one. The test also underlines how the GMD system still relies on some lumbering, one-off assets that are not always deployed—namely the Sea-based X-band radar and possibly the shy armada of other radar ships that participate in these intercepts. Hopefully strides can now be made to make the system less dependent on these impersistent sensors so that it truly can respond to an attack at any given time. Update- 5:45pm PST: Military.com writes: Chris Johnson, a spokesman for MDA, would not confirm that the trajectory of the target in the Tuesday test was given to the intercept team, but said that Vandenberg had a “general launch window.” Although today’s test was a meaningful step in the right direction, as suspected, we are still a ways off from testing this system under real-world conditions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 26, 2018",Stratolaunch’s Massive Mothership Rolls Out Of Its Nest For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the better part of a decade of development, we are getting our first glimpse of Stratolaunch’s massive mothership outside her low-slung hangar at Mojave Air and Space Port. As expected, the size and design of the huge and exotic aircraft is impressive to say the least. At 385 feet wide, it has the longest wingspan of any aircraft in the world—even longer than the record-setting Hughes H-4 Flying Boat, aka the “Spruce Goose.” Loaded fully, it will tip the scales at a whopping 1,300,000 pounds, and is powered by six Pratt & Whitney PW4056 turbofan engines—the same engine that powers many 747-400s—putting out a combined 340,500 pounds of thrust. There is no doubt about it, Stratolaunch has given birth to a truly technologically wondrous machine. Stratolaunch Stratolaunch describes its capabilities as such: Stratolaunch’s reusability and air-launch capabilities enable us to take an airport-style approach to operations for launch services. Stratolaunch will take off from a runway, rather than a logistically vulnerable fixed range, which allows us to avoid hazards such as inclement weather, airborne traffic and heavy marine activity. Stratolaunch’s airborne launch platform significantly reduces the risk of costly delays or cancellations. Stratolaunch Springboarding off of a successful X-Prize win, a consortium including primarily Microsoft co-founder and space visionary Paul Allen and aerospace design legend Burt Rutan set out to revolutionize access to low-earth orbit. They brought on Scaled Composites, the “bleeding edge” aerospace design and manufacturing institution that once belonged to Rutan but is now owned by Northrop Grumman, as well as Elon Musk’s Space-X and ex NASA Administrator Mike Griffen to make the dream take flight. Some partners have come and gone, including Space-X, but Paul Allen especially has held the course, and Stratolaunch is now under “Vulcan” banner that adorns the majority of his companies. Stratolaunch The right side fuselage of the Stratolaunch mothership includes the cockpit, while the left-hand side contains the aircraft’s flight data systems and payload control. The giant jet can carry a single, large second stage and payload, or multiple smaller second stages and payloads, which means it can inject multiple craft into different orbits on a single mission. It can also use runways around the world to do so, which greatly saves on transportation costs, allows for cheaper rockets, and speeds up the launch process significantly. Stratolaunch is eyeing Sierra Nevada’s chronically underestimated Dream Chaser , or a slightly scaled-down version of it, as a versatile launch vehicle in addition to more traditional second-stage rockets. Stratolaunch leverages the mothership and parasite concept, where an aircraft stands in as a traditional rocket’s first stage by hauling a second stage rocket and its payload up to the stratosphere before sending it on its way into orbit. The basic concept is far from new, with the military and the civilian world toying with it for decades. Orbital Sciences and their L1011 named Stargazer, along with their Pegasus rocket, have been actually doing it for years now. What’s different with Stratolaunch is the scale of the mothership and the size of payloads the system will supposedly be capable of putting into orbit. Still, Orbital Sciences has tons of experience in the space, and joined the conglomerate in 2012 after Space-X dropped out. Virgin Galactic’s White Knight II is part of the same Scaled Composites family of mothership designs., D. Miller/Wikicommons You may notice that Stratolaunch looks a lot like White Knight, which was part of the system that won the X-Prize, and White Knight II , the aircraft that carries Virgin Galactic’s Spaceship Two into the sky. That’s because all of them are products of Scaled Composites, and have their roots in Rutan’s designs. They also all use a similar concept for spaceflight, relying on a mothership to do the heaviest lifting before sending a rocket-powered spacecraft on its way towards the heavens. You can read all about the use of motherships to put payloads into orbit here. Stargazer taking off with a Pegasus rocket slung beneath it., NASA There are clearly major military applications for a system like this as well, and the Pentagon is already working on a two-stage to orbit rocket plane capable of delivering smaller payloads, and other highly classified systems that use an aircraft as a first stage could be in development as well. China is also seeking a similar capability, which is likely the driving factor behind their acquiring of the An-225 Mriya design . https://youtube.com/watch?v=3QULQcKqrbU https://youtube.com/watch?v=nbd7TwYVuOA If Stratolaunch proves successful, it is likely the Pentagon will become one of its best customers. Saving money and lowering the risk of launches for reconnaissance and communications payloads is clearly a good thing, but being able to quickly deploy multiple satellites on various orbits could offer a resilience to an enemy’s anti-satellite capabilities . It could also work as a mothership for deploying America’s own anti-satellite systems, like those capable of jamming, blinding or even manipulating and destroying enemy satellites in orbit. Stratolaunch It is even possible that the USAF could actually procure a Stratolaunch system for its own exclusive use, whose mission would go beyond acquiring rapid and cheap access to low-earth orbit. Time sensitive strike is a very big deal these days—being able to strike any target on the globe in a matter of minutes, not hours. Stratolaunch could work as an alert mothership loaded with suborbital missiles that are capable of streaking around the globe and pulverizing time sensitive enemy targets. Buy adapting an off-the-shelf technology, like Stratolaunch, the Pentagon could save billions in development costs and years of research time. Stratolaunch is slated to take its first flight later this year, and Allen and crew think the Stratolaunch system will be fully operational by the end of the decade.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Low Pass By A South African Rooivalk Attack Chopper Is Totally Nuts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The origin story of the South African designed and built Rooivalk (Red Kestrel) attack helicopter is a funky tale in itself. Huge sums of money were spent on developing the helicopter and its utility helicopter cousin, the Oryx , both of which are based on the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. It took 27 years for the Rooivalk to finally become operational in 2011. In the end only 14 Rooivaks were built, with a dozen left flying for the South African Air Force’s 16th Squadron today. But seeing how few exist, it is surprising that South African Air Force aviators push the helicopter to the crazy extremes shown in the video below. Now that is a high-speed and very low pass if there ever was one! Loosely analogous to the Airbus Helicopters Tiger , the Rooivalk packs a potent attack helicopter punch while still being relatively compact and capable of the armed scout mission. The chopper features a 20mm chin-mounted, swiveling cannon with 700 rounds available. It can carry 70mm folding-fin rockets or up to 16 locally built Mokopa anti-tank missiles. It can also sport air-to-air versions of the MBDA Mistral short-range missile for anti-helicopter warfare operations. Max takeoff weight tips the scales at just over 19,000 pounds, which puts it somewhere between the Tiger and the Apache in terms of mass. The Rooivalk was never exported, geopolitical reasons aside, this was largely due to concerns about its supportability and the stability of South Africa’s aerospace industry. Seeing that a similar helicopter was available from Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopter) in the form of the Tiger—along with increasing competition from other helicopters like the Bell AH-1 Cobra, Agusta A129 Mangusta, Boeing AH-64 Apache, Mil Mi-28 Havoc, etc—the Rooivalk had a hard time growing its user base. Also, the fact that European defense manufacturers associated with the Puma would not likely support Rooivalk export models if South Africa’s defense industry couldn’t did not help its cause. In recent years, South African aerospace conglomerate Denel Defense has floated building a “Mk2” version of the Rooivalk. The helicopter would be greatly upgraded with new sensors and weapons, while also leveraging proven enhancements made to existing Roovialks serving with the SAAF. Egypt, Brazil, Poland, Nigeria, and even India have been approached by Denel to see if there was interest in such a concept, although at this point the Rooivalk Mk2 remains a pipe dream.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 9, 2016",The Broken Pentagon: Obama’s Secretary of USAF to Sit on Textron’s Board,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of Air Force Deborah Lee James, who officially retired from the role on January 11th, 2017 , will now sit on the board of directors of one of the Pentagon’s biggest vendors, Textron. Her final parting words to the Air Force were “I will never ever cease being a member of the Air Force family… I will always remain an advocate for Airmen and the Air Force.” Considering that her new job is to help return profits to Textron stockholders, that statement is dubious to say the least. Overall this news is just another reminder of why the Department of Defense is broken and how the system only invites corruption and controversy. This is not to say Deborah Lee James is a bad person; she did a good job as Secretary of Air Force. Her straight talk about major issues was refreshing, and she wasn’t afraid to admit the flying service’s big mistakes . It is also hard to hate on her for doing something that has legal precedent, is personally lucrative, and keeps her in a very powerful position after leaving government. Don’t hate the player, hate the game, as it were. In fact, James’s uniformed counterpart for much of her time as Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, took a similar job with Northrop Grumman just months after “retiring.” And that’s just the problem: this type of “revolving door” between the Defense Department and the businesses it calls on for weapons and other products and services is an acceptable practice in the government’s eyes on virtually all levels. Meanwhile, the fact that a Pentagon big-wig can be pushing to spend billions on a weapon system one day as a government official, and then working for the company that makes that same weapon system the next, is deeply troubling in so many ways. Both James and Welsh are now sitting on boards of some of the largest vendors they called on on behalf of the USAF while in office., AP Let’s just take the USAF’s light attack aircraft fly-off this summer—an exercise that could lead the USAF to buy hundreds of aircraft capable of the mission. The advent of this fly-off came while James was Secretary of Air Force. As of now two of the three aircraft that will partake in this potentially high-stakes competition—the AT-6C Coyote and the Air-Land Scorpion—are products of (you guessed it!) Textron. The company has a huge portfolio, which includes Bell helicopters, Cessna Aircraft, and Beechcraft, not to mention strong divisions that build land and maritime systems, munitions and subsystems of all types. The company also owns multiple service providers, like the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC). Under James, the USAF began exploring the use of contractors in the adversary support role on a far deeper level than in the past—precisely the same types of services ATAC provides. From Textron’s official press release: Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) announced that Deborah Lee James has been elected to the company’s Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2017. James recently retired as the 23rd Secretary of the United States Air Force, a position she had held since 2013. Ms. James has 30 years of homeland and national security experience in the federal government and the private sector. “We are extremely fortunate and honored to welcome the Honorable Deborah James to our Board,” said Textron Chairman and CEO Scott Donnelly. “Deborah’s deep expertise in national security, government procurement, strategic planning, cybersecurity, logistics and innovation, garnered from her leadership positions at the U.S. Air Force and private industry, will greatly benefit Textron,” Donnelly added. As Secretary of the Air Force, Ms. James oversaw the Air Force’s annual budget of more than $139 billion. She led the Air Force in reaching key milestones in the next generation fighter (F-35) program and the refueling aircraft program (KC-46), as well as in launching important modernization programs, including a new combat rescue helicopter, long-range strategic bomber and trainer aircraft. She also ordered the development of a comprehensive cyber campaign plan and directed the overhaul of the Air Force’s logistics organization and processes. Prior to her role as Secretary of the Air Force, James held various executive positions during an 11-year tenure at SAIC, Inc., a provider of services and solutions in the areas of defense, health, energy, infrastructure, ISR and cybersecurity to agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), foreign governments and other customers. She most recently served as Sector President, Technical and Engineering of SAIC’s Government Solutions Group, a position she held from February through December of 2013. I would fill “extremely fortunate” if I were Textron, too! They basically bought the most powerful, relevant, and timely civilian official they could, and now all of James’s knowledge and influence will be working for the them and their shareholders. What’s interesting is that Trump specifically ran on ending this practice, stating : “I will impose a five-year ban on executive officials becoming lobbyists and a lifetime ban on officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government,” he said. “And I’ll tell you what else I’m going to ban — when we have our purchasing agents giving out billions and billions and billions of dollars of contracts to the military and to all of these people where they’re buying these airplanes where you see these tremendous cost overruns — take a look at the F-35 program, take a look — and the people that gave out those contracts, give me a break, we’re going to impose a lifetime ban on people that give these massive contracts out or even small contracts… You want to work for the United States, you work for the United States. You’re not going to go to work for the people that built these planes.” Clearly this is currently not the case, at least for head honchos like James. Recently, there has been much talk about Trump’s own administration granting waivers allowing lobbyists to work in the White House, moves that run contrary to his claims of “draining the swamp.” Trump checking out a Dreamliner cockpit at the Boeing factory in South Carolina. , White House photo I had some hopes that Trump may be able to succeed in one specific place where other Presidents in the past have not—seriously changing the way the Pentagon does business. His selection of retired General James Mattis was also encouraging, but it seems little has been done, or is being done when it comes to instituting new checks on the defense-industrial complex. In fact, what has occurred has been at best comical in its trivialness and and at worst downright misleading. Of course I am referring to Trump’s “intervention” in and “negotiating” better deals on a couple high-profile programs he has interest in. The truth is that his actions have been counter-productive to achieving systemic change, are misleading, and they only muddy the procurement waters even more. Not just that, but the President’s claims about savings gleaned from his unconventional forays into the world of defense procurement are largely false . As I stated in a previous piece: To be honest, I had high hopes that Trump could spur systemic change within the DoD’s procurement process. Those hopes have faded rapidly over the last three months. It seems that he is far more interested in selectively intervening in a few high-profile programs he has interest in so that he can claim fake victories and gloat about them endlessly to the press, and the defense industry is happy to oblige him if it means funding certainty and a strong order book. So there you have it, it’s business as usual when it comes to the defense-industrial complex’s revolving door now five months into the Trump Administration. Deborah Lee James, the same women who sat atop the USAF and its $100+ billion budget just months ago, will now be working as a top agent for what was one of her biggest suppliers. And the wheels of absurdity within the Pentagon’s five walls keep grinding along, unmodified by the changing of the guard.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 9, 2017",The Navy Now Says It Can Get More Service Life Out Of Its Existing Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After pushing to retire and mothball existing ships so that it can field new ones, the Navy now says it can squeeze significantly more life out of the majority of the fleet it already has. This is all in reaction to the controversial goal set by the Trump Administration to grow the Navy’s fleet size from roughly 275 hulls it has in service today to 355 hulls in the future. A similar goal was set by the Obama Administration of 308 hulls. Much has been made about Trump’s dream of a 355 ship Navy, including how his 2018 budget didn’t reflect this policy and how America’s shipbuilding industry would be challenged to meet such a goal. Now the Navy suddenly thinks that the majority of its ships’ planned service lives can be extended at a fairly nominal cost, keeping some of its most costly surface combatants in service for 30 or 35 years, or even longer, instead of just 25 years. New shipbuilding alone isn’t likely to get the Navy to its 355 ship Navy., AP Vice Admiral Tom Moore, who was speaking at an event put on by the Center for Strategic and International studies and the U.S. Naval Institure, stated the following : “We’re taking a pretty close look at what it would take to get them out another five, another 10 years. And the reality is, for a steel hull, if you do the maintenance, you can get its service life out much longer… I think there’s great opportunity to make the investments, a relatively small investment, to keep the ships around longer than we have today. And people will say, well we’ve never really gotten a surface ship past 35 or 40 years, and I will point out all the time that we routinely take aircraft carriers to 50 years. And the reason we do that is because we consistently do all the maintenance you have to do on an aircraft carrier to get it to 50 years. So we know how to do this, and I think what you’ll see is we’re going to take a very serious look at taking the existing service life of the fleet and extending it out five or 10 years. If you do that – and you’ve seen some of the force structure assessments that get us to 355 ships around 2045 if we just keep ships at their current service life and then build new – we can probably accelerate that to get to 355 by about 10 to 15 years faster for a relatively small investment over about a 30-year period. So we’re going to take a very close look at that.” The Admiral was a little hesitant when it came to making the same claim for aluminum hulled ships, in particular the Independence class of Littoral Combat ships that is based on a ferry design and built by Austal in Mobil, Alabama: “I don’t want to presuppose a decision… We don’t have the knowledge base on how that hull performs over along period of time like we do with steel, with steel hulls. What happens over 25 years? Aluminum doesn’t quite have the tensile strength, so you’ll have a little bit more flexibility in the hull. We’ve seen this with some of the cracking in the cruise superstructures… We’ll proceed a little bit more cautiously on extending the service life of aluminum ships than we will steel-hulled ones.” He also added that the decision to move forward with such a plan would have to be made at the very top of the Navy’s power structure. Considering that funding remains relatively tight, such a plan, as well as building ships for longer service life from the get-go, would likely be necessary to make the 355 hull Navy vision a reality. The Navy wants to treat its surface combatants and even its supply ships more like aircraft carriers, with hopes to extend their life towards the super carrier’s 50 year span., AP This is precisely what The War Zone has been saying since Trump’s candidacy became a Presidency—that the Pentagon will have to extended the lives of the equipment it has, and pull some vehicles out of mothballs, in order to even come close to realizing Trump’s vision. This is especially true considering massive sums of extra money earmarked for defense has not materialized as planned. Even if it did, it wouldn’t have been enough to begin with. From a War Zone piece about what to expect from Trump as Command In Chief dated November 11th, 2016: “It’s likely that once Trump gets into office and realizes the costs associated with procuring new military hardware, he will look toward older, and even mothballed weapon systems to help bolster his larger force size goals. Reagan did exactly the same thing after taking office. This means aircraft like the A-10 could be safe from the budgetary axe , while other 4th generation fighters could be upgraded—with some that are currently sitting in the boneyard once again pressed to service. The same can be said for the equipment of every service… A focus on increasing the number of high-end surface combatants is likely, including upgrading and redeploying Ticonderoga class cruisers that have been sidelined for financial reasons.” It is interesting that the Navy, which had put some of its most powerful and in-demand surface combatants into storage under the laughably named “phased modernization plan,” because the service didn’t allocate the money to operate, maintain and upgrade them, is now talking about greatly increasingly its budget for just those things across the majority of the fleet. In addition, the Navy has been quick to give away or sink its sturdy Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates in order to gain Littoral Combat Ships that are far less survivable and have struggled deeply to find their place in the Navy’s surface fleet hierarchy. Meanwhile, foreign allied navies have snapped these ships up and upgraded them with new capabilities, including Mark 41 vertical launch systems, and plan on sailing them for decades to come. Turkey is one of a number of nations that have picked up second-hand Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, upgrading them with the intent of operating them for years to come. , USN Trump’s 2018 budget does begin to support this new strategy to some degree already by dumping more funds into the Navy’s readiness, including increasing maintenance, upgrades and training budgets. But at best, even with the help of extended life cycles, the Navy will be hard pressed to meet the 355 ship goal within 18 years . Many studies have supported this inventory number, but in the end, it is as much about what each ship is capable of and how reliable it is at doing its job than about a raw and somewhat arbitrary hull number. Nonetheless, making better use of the assets the Navy already owns is a good thing, and such a plan should be achievable as long as shipbuilders’ order books are full. Otherwise the dreaded and all-powerful shipbuilding special interests will rear their ugly head and squash such a plan flat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",About That “Blue Thunder” Counter-Terror Chopper That Landed On London Bridge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Britain’s shadowy, top tier counter-terror unit sprung into action during the dastardly van and knife attack on civilians in London on Saturday night. The arrival of a usually very shy unmarked blue and white AS365N3 Dolphin helicopter couldn’t have taken on a higher-profile, as the commando-laden chopper touched down right on London Bridge shortly after the mayhem had ended. Although it is very likely the unit, and the unique helicopters that service it, have been involved in other operations since it began to enter into the public’s view a couple of years ago, it seems that this is the first time their presence at the scene of such an tragedy was made overtly clear. The counter terrorism unit, which by some accounts was organized before the 2012 Olympics, and by other accounts shortly after the 2015 attacks on Paris, is said to be made up of about 70 Special Air Service (SAS) operators and a support staff tailored to their unique mission set. The commandos are thought to be made up of a sub-force of the vaunted 22nd SAS Regiment in particular. Their helicopters are flown by 658 Squadron of the Army Air Corps, based at Credenhill, alongside SAS headquarters. 658 Squadron Dolphin II with SAS commandos onboard landing on London Bridge shortly after Saturday’s attack., AP The unit supposedly has a stovepipe-like command structure that reports directly to the Home Secretary. Small teams from the unit sit alert at a handful of airfields around the country, ready to respond to a terrorist act on short notice, and use the specially outfitted blue and white Dolphin II helicopters at their disposal to rush them to the scene of an unfolding attack. This is where the public’s “Blue Thunder” moniker for the unit comes from. It is based on the 1980s cult classic movie about a secret law enforcement helicopter with the same title and color. Because the public has so little information about the unit, tabloids slapped the nickname on it based on the secretive helicopters that cart the heavily armed operators around. It is unknown at this time if the force has adopted the public’s unique nickname for itself. The Dolphins have special radio communications suites and can provide overwatch as well as rapid transport for SAS commandos. Some of these helicopters, 658 Squadron has five in all, have been seen outfitted with a FLIR ball under the right side of their fuselages. They are also capable of fast-roping operations for rapid tactical insertions even in tight quarters. The helicopters are also likely night-vision compatible, as they may have to make sneak insertions at night in close proximity to the enemy. Last night, London police engaged and killed the three terrorists, which were outfitted with 12 inch knives and fake suicide vests, within eight minutes of being called, leaving the SAS troops with little shooting to do. But at the time, it was thought more attackers were on the run, and the unit was supposedly sent to hunt for any other terrorists the police had not already subdued. The terrorists were outfitted with dummy suicide belts., Gabriele Sciotto via AP If a similar attack were to occur, albeit one where the terrorists are better armed, the SAS operators would likely be the ones to execute a direct action in an attempt to end a rampage. The use of SAS troops against terrorists in domestic situations has a long history in England. The Princes Gate hostage situation , one of the highest profile counter-terrorism operations ever, made the secretive force far more famous than it had been prior. Today, the SAS is featured prominently in television shows, movies and video games. A city like London has other counter-terror forces, including the Metropolitan Police’s SWAT-like Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer (CTSFO) t eams. Some of which now ride around on BMW motorcycles, allowing them to get anywhere fast, even in traffic. And just like other European countries— France for instance —the UK has multiple units from across its police forces and military that can work together during a protracted emergency to provide enough capacity to deal with simultaneous attacks on multiple locations. Still, the “Blue Thunder” quick reaction alert sub-unit of 22 SAS seems to be at the very tip of the Crown’s counter-terror spear. CTSFO with their Sig MCX rifles., AP The unit’s rapid reaction helicopter detachment is likely a product of the changing nature of terrorism. Instead of the hostage taking based terror incidents of the past, where local police can secure a perimeter and get the ball rolling with intelligence gathering and even negotiating with the hostage takers, roving “maximum violence” attacks, like what happened in Mumbai, and in Paris to some extent, require a far more rapid direct action response. In other words, waiting to execute a planned counter-assault is a luxury that simply doesn’t exist anymore under most modern terror scenarios. So having a helicopter on standby that can allow a small squad of heavily-armed and highly-trained operators to respond to the center of the attack as it is unfolding, means that less innocent lives will be lost. Time is literally a matter of life and death. One of five AS365N3 Dolphin II helicopters belonging to 658 Squadron. , Mark Harkin/wikicommons It really becomes a matter of how fast can a force mow down the enemy while presenting as little risk to innocent life as possible. But considering this new brand of terror’s focus on maximum destruction for its own sake, even losing innocent lives to stop an attack that would otherwise result in the loss of a much greater number of innocent lives is a sad reality that counter-terror forces are struggling with. With all this in mind, “Blue Thunder” and the operators it carries, represents truly a “silver bullet” force that has risen from the realities of a new, much more nimble, blunt and decentralized terror threat. And considering the idea is all about getting these operators within engagement range of the bad guys as soon as possible, even the fairly mundane helicopters the unit uses could be the target of enemy fire. A British Army Aviation Gazelle. Large sensor turrets and expanded communications systems have appeared on some of these helicopters in recent years. 658 Squadron flies the Gazelle alongside its Dolphin II helicopters., MOD The UK media has mentioned that “Blue Thunder” helicopters and the SAS counter-terror unit they support can operate with British Army Apache Ah1 Attack Helicopters. This is likely true, but not because the Apache packs a 30mm chain gun and Hellfire missiles, but because its sensor suite is extremely capable of collecting intelligence in urban environments. 658 Squadron also flies Gazelle scout helicopters , which could put their own sensors to use in a similar fashion during a large-scale counter-terror operation. After three terror attacks in just three months, it looks like the UK will up its counter-terror capabilities once again. But hopefully we won’t have see “Blue Thunder” again any time soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Saudi-Qatari Row Puts The U.S. And Its Military In A Bad Place At A Bad Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Led by Saudi Arabia, some of the most powerful states in the middle east, including Egypt, UAE, and Bahrain, have cut ties with Qatar. The fissure, which could have massive geopolitical and military repercussions, seemed sudden, but the reality is that tensions between the Kingdom and Qatar have been building for some time. Still, it really couldn’t have come at a worse time for the US and its operations against extremists in the region. In an official statement , Saudi Arabia said the following about their decision to cut all ties with neighboring Qatar: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken this decisive decision as a result of grave violations being committed by the authorities in Doha over the past years in secret and public aiming at dividing internal Saudi ranks, instigating against the State, infringing on its sovereignty, adopting various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilizing the region including the Muslim Brotherhood Group, Daesh (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda, promoting the ethics and plans of these groups through its media permanently, supporting the activities of Iranian-backed terrorist groups in the governorate of Qatif of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Bahrain, financing, adopting and sheltering extremists who seek to undermine the stability and unity of the homeland at home and abroad, and using the media that seek to fuel the strife internally; and it was clear to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the support and backing from the authorities in Doha for coup Al-Houthi militias even after the announcement of the Coalition to Support the Legitimacy in Yemen. The Kingdom has also taken this decision in solidarity with the Kingdom of Bahrain being subjected to terrorist campaigns and operations supported by the authorities in Doha. So Saudi Arabia is basically claiming Qatar is a troublemaker of the grandest sort. And this is not just some diplomatic warning shot, Qatar, which possess one of the largest natural gas and oil reserves in the world and has the highest per capita income of any country, is being isolated by the Arab world at breakneck speed. Saudi Arabia closed its common land border with Qatar—which is Qatar’s only land border—as well as shuttering its sea and air borders with the country. The UAE and Bahrain have closed their air and sea borders with neighboring Qatar as well, and far away, Egypt closed its airspace to aircraft belonging to the peninsular nation. As a result, Qatar has lost a whopping 82% of its gulf imports as a result of the punishing measures, and the country relies heavily on these imports to survive, especially those that come through Saudi Arabia. The various players involved have also recalled their citizens from Qatar, some on very tight timelines, and have kicked Qatari nationals out of their own territories. Google Maps Accusations that Doha has been sympathetic to or even supportive of some of the world’s most notorious terror groups is nothing new. Qatar has been described as “two faced,” or as having “split personalities” in the past to a large degree. On one hand they host the largest and arguably the most important US military installation in the whole region, and on the other hand Qatari nationals, and even the Qatari government have been accused of being sponsors of terror , and providing a safe haven for the heads of groups that are directly related to terrorism. Even the Taliban has an office in Doha. There has also been a long standing pattern of major financiers of extremist groups living in Qatar and/or running their finances through the tiny gulf state. This all comes after President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, where he called on Arab states to stand against extremism and to root out terrorists and their financing at all costs. The old adage “be careful what you wish for” could ring true in this case, as the US is now thrust in between Doha and Riyadh geopolitically. It wouldn’t be reaching to say that after today’s actions by Saudi Arabia, the US now appears to be less hardline on extremism than The Kingdom itself. Adding gas to the fire is a pending major US arms sale to Qatar for up to 72 advanced F-15s —one of the most powerful fighter jets in the world. The arms export deal would mean many billions of dollars for the US defense industry while also keeping a critical fighter jet manufacturing line open for years to come. But now the sale could also be seen as the US actively arming a government which its own Arab neighbors see as too extreme to even maintain diplomatic relations with. A Qatari Mirage 200-5 seen here fully armed— Qatar’s military is small and comparatively weak compared to other wealthy countries in the region, and they rely on their alliances, especially with the US, for protection, although major investments are now being made to drastically upgrade Qatar’s weaponry and war fighting capacity., USN Above all else, America’s military ties with Qatar are essential to ongoing military operations in the region, including the American-led coalition air wars in Iraq, Syria and in Afghanistan. Al Udeid air base in Qatar not only houses the “brains” of America’s air operations over the middle east—the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC)—but it also hosts key support facilities and throngs of strategic and tactic assets on rotation to the region as well as thousands of US troops. Aviation assets alone include everything from E-3 AWACS, to tactical fighters, B-52 Stratofortress Bombers, to RC-135 Rivet Joint electronic intelligence gathering aircraft, to rows of tankers and airlifters. Nearby As Sayliyah Army Base is also a major logistics point for US military equipment, with massive amounts of material, vehicles and ammunition stored there in reserve status. Basically, Al Udeid air base is the strategic heart of Central Command’s operations throughout the region. Google Earth So what happens now? Clearly the US can’t simply pack up and vacate Al Udeid Air Base overnight and move its operations elsewhere. Doing so would be a monumental undertaking and could take months, or even years to achieve. Additionally, there are few bases in the region suited for supporting so many missions and none with as well developed and as unique an infrastructure as Al Udeid. But how can the Trump Administration preach a hardline policy against extremism to its Arab allies, who seem ready to act based on Washington’s directions, while the US military continues to operate out of a country its neighbors claim is actually supporting the very same forces America’s operations from that country are trying to target and destory? The growing and modern metropolis that is Doha today is totally unrecognizable compared to what it looked like before the 2003 Gulf War. , Erick Irani The War Zone reached out to Combined Joint Task Force Inherent Resolve to ask them what they intended to do now that the Saudis, along with neighboring Bahrain and the UAE, have drawn a line in proverbial sand when it comes to Qatar’s status as a terror supporter in the region. Here is their response: This is a political issue not associated with the Coalition’s mission of militarily defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria. We encourage all forces to remain focused on the counter-ISIS fight and concentrate their efforts on defeating ISIS and not towards other objectives that may cause the Coalition to divert energy and resources away from this mission. The Coalition continues to work in close coordination with partner forces and allies in delivering a lasting defeat to our common enemy, ISIS. Further questions on political issues concerning these questions should be referred there or to the U.S. State Department. Very Respectfully, CJTF-Operation Inherent Resolve Public Affairs Office Press Desk By calling this a “political issue” the Pentagon must see the Saudis’ claims toward Qatar as straight up false or as a matter of dubious equivalency, because it is nearly impossible to argue that those claims are not directly associated with the US-led coalition’s military mission in Qatar. Especially considering that America’s primary goal in the region is to stamp out the same sort of extremism that the Saudi’s allege Qatar supports, even if in a tacit manner. Trump gave a speech on the need to combat extremism to Arab and Muslim leaders in Riyadh., AP This may turn out to be a truer test of where America’s ideals really lie, as well as the Trump Administration’s political will when it comes to the fight against terror, as any. If these allegations are true, the US stands to only erode its moral high ground on the issue if it refuses to act. And how can America expect to ask more for the counter-terror fight from its Arab allies, like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain if it doesn’t live by the same standards it preaches? Also, Qatar depends on its alliance with the US for its own protection to a large degree as it has a small military with limited capabilities, and yet it exists in a very tough neighborhood that is bristling with arms. If the US were to leave, and were to stop selling Qatar weapons, the country would be far more vulnerable to external influences that could degrade the sovereignty it enjoys today, as well as to an outright attack. Considering its oil reserves and wealth, and its strategic location in the Persian Gulf, its vulnerability without America’s support is a very real and tangible thing. Now that its own neighbors could even eventually be considered hostile, the House of Thani is probably coming to terms with this reality now more than ever. The main floor of the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base. , USAF What also remains unclear is how the US-led coalition will operate without being able to host nationals from Saudi Arabia, UAE or Bahrain at Al Udeid, nor use any services provided by those countries. This is not only a diplomatic and command and control nightmare but also potentially a logistical one as well as the US depends on contractors from those states for many support tasks that make its sprawling desert outpost in the country operate on a daily basis. Also, making military and government representatives from those countries leave the base will make coordinating everything from air and ground operations to intelligence sharing much harder than it needs to be. With all this in mind, this move by Saudi Arabia has put the US in a precarious place to say the least, especially coming off of President Trump’s visit to The Kingdom and the message he delivered there directly to Arab and predominantly Muslim countries. And it couldn’t have come a worse time. In just hours, the US-led coalition and the menagerie of indigenous forces it directly supports on the ground in Syria are slated to begin the long awaited assault on ISIS’s stronghold of Al Raqqa. That high-stakes operation will be directed largely in part from America’s sprawling base in Qatar.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Coalition Strikes Pro-Assad Shiite Militias Again Near Key Outpost In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain murky, but multiple reports state that coalition airpower has struck pro-Assad militia forces once again near the coalition-backed rebel outpost at At Tanf, located roughly 20 miles northeast of the Jordanian border. At Tanf is a garrison where U.S. and coalition partners’ special operations forces are training, arming and supporting rebel forces, primarily known as the Free Syrian Army. The skirmish comes just a couple of weeks after a very similar event occurred , in which coalition airpower ended up striking a column of Iranian-backed Shiite militia fighters and their vehicles that would not stop their advance on the base. This time around it seems that those at the garrison and coalition airpower above it were ready and waiting for another impending assault. Here is the official statement about the incident from CENTCOM: SOUTHWEST ASIA — The Coalition destroyed additional pro-Syrian regime forces that advanced inside the well-established de-confliction zone in southern Syria, June 6. Despite previous warnings, pro-regime forces entered the agreed-upon de-confliction zone with a tank, artillery, anti-aircraft weapons, armed technical vehicles and more than 60 soldiers posing a threat to Coalition and partner forces based at the At Tanf Garrison. The Coalition issued several warnings via the de-confliction line prior to destroying two artillery pieces, an anti-aircraft weapon, and damaging a tank. On May 18, the Coalition conducted a strike against pro-Syrian regime forces that had advanced a significant distance into the de-confliction zone threatening the Coalition forces at At Tanf. Coalition forces have been operating in the At Tanf area for many months, training and advising vetted Syrian partner forces engaged in the fight against ISIS. The Coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime or pro-regime forces but remains ready to defend themselves if pro-regime forces refuse to vacate the de-confliction zone. The Coalition calls on all parties in southern Syria to focus their efforts on the defeat of ISIS, which is our common enemy and the greatest threat to regional and worldwide peace and security. At Tanf has been a hot spot in the ever more convoluted Syrian conflict for a year now. Last June, Russian jets bombed the base multiple times during a single sortie even after US forces were demanding the strike stop over the hotline set up between Russian and U.S. military command centers in the region. The base near At Tanf has had its defenses reinforced in recent days , as another attempted assault from Shiite militia forces was expected. An increasingly large group of fighters had been slowly massing north of the base, just outside the deconfliction zone assigned to the US. The base could very well be seen by Iran as a major obstruction to achieving its goal of having a secured land-route that links Tehran with Damascus. In addition to heavier ground defenses, coalition air assets have maintained a constant patrol over the outpost in recent days—an impressive and expensive operation to say the least. Leaflets were also dropped on the militia’s rallying point telling them to vacate the area, and the U.S. tried to get Russia to warn them off as well, although they simply told the Russians they were in the area to fight ISIS. The big question is what would have happened if the column of Iranian-backed troops and armor actually made its way to the forward operating base successfully? Is it Iran’s, or even the Assad regime’s aim to draw the U.S. into a direct conflict? Assad’s command and control capabilities have been described as fragmented, so it is possible the first attack was executed without the approval from the regime nor its Russian partners, but for that to happen a second time is highly unlikely. After the May 18th attack we wrote the following: “Iranian-backed Shiite militias, in particular Hezbollah, have fought alongside Assad’s army and Russian special operations teams to keep the Assad regime intact. Israel in particular has kept a close eye on Hezbollah’s activities in Syria, and has consistently struck arms transfers that occur in the country from Iran to the militant group. It is not clear exactly who the militia unit involved in the incident was directly affiliated with, but it is possible Iran will respond to the strike in some fashion. So far there is no official statement out of Tehran.” Today’s attempted assault could very well have been that response.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 22, 2016",Russia Challenges U.S. Tankers To Compete In Its Annual “Tank Biathlon”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s holds its so called “Tank Biathlon” every August, and it is always entertaining to watch. Competitors from around Russia’s international sphere of influence send their best armor crews to join in these games where they run through rough terrain courses and execute live fire drills. There is even usually at least one “tank ballet” to behold . But now Russian tankers want their NATO counterparts—which they could face off against during a real conflict—to join in the tournament. Last year’s winning team—from Russia unsurprisingly—threw down the gauntlet for their western tanker brethren this week, wanting to break the tradition of NATO tank crews not participating in the uniquely Russian mechanized Olympics of sorts: “Unfortunately, tank crews from the EU and U.S. are avoiding taking part in tournaments like this one. It’s time for a face-off with you, guys. Instead of pointing guns at each other, let’s compete with each other on training grounds. Do come. We’ll be waiting for you.” Colonel Vyacheslav Zhaplov’s winning team from Russia’s Vologorad Region. Although the U.S. and their NATO partners do indeed have less garish tank competitions of sorts, hats, or should I say helmets off to Russia’s champion team and their challenge. In fact, this is not the first time Russia has invited the U.S. to the Tank Biathlon, they did so formally in 2013, but that was before the invasion of Crimea and the massive geopolitical shift that occurred following it. https://youtube.com/watch?v=m0BGaJ-TgvU Even more so than in 2013, it’s extremely unlikely the U.S. or any of its NATO allies, maybe aside from Turkey, would actually deploy high-end weapon systems on Russian soil, nor invite a symbolic struggle of combat prowess with what is becoming an increasingly bitter foe. Still the idea is actually a noble one. AP If the U.S. were formally invited by the Kremlin, and if any technological and safety concerns could be assuaged to some degree—maybe by taking a heavily downgraded export version of the M1 Abrams to the competition—the US should send its best Abrams crews to compete. There is real value in doing so. If anything else, military-to-military ties can stop conflicts from evolving, or even keep them from happening in the first place all together. Fostering these ties has to start somewhere, and while there had been some Russian-US military cooperation during the two decades that followed the end of the Cold War, even those limited overtures are now a distant memory in what has become a new Cold War of sorts. Even if US crews are preordained to lose, participating in the event can be framed as a gesture of good will, and who cares how Moscow would spin it really? The whole event is clearly superfluous to begin with, but the potential for a tiny spark of good natured competition and socialization among US and Russian forces isn’t. AP There will be some that would say the U.S. or its NATO partners should have nothing to do with Russia’s military considering its actions in Syria and Ukraine. That is a fair argument, but disengagement never seems to solve anything, and a little good natured competition between tanker crews from opposing nations is as good a reminder of what’s at stake in a major conflict in Europe as any other. There is plenty of precedent for this sort of thing as well. For instance, the U.S. has invited China to its RIMPAC exercises multiple times, even during tense times between the two countries and other allies attending. With that in mind, I say let the games begin!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 26, 2018",US Navy Looking At Bringing Retired Carrier USS Kitty Hawk Out Of Mothballs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the US Navy struggles to figure out how it can reach its new goal of a 355 ship fleet—up from 275 ships today—as quickly as possible, it has been looking towards extending the life of the ships it already has in service. Now the service is also examining the possibility of selectively pulling ships out of mothballs, refurbishing them, and sending them back to the fleet. One ship in particular may have a better shot than others at sailing the high seas once again—the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)—America’s last operational conventionally fueled supercarrier. The head of the Navy’s Sea Systems Command, Vice Admiral Thomas Moore, stated that while most ships in the inactive fleet are in too sorry a state to be worth reviving, the USS Kitty Hawk may not be: “Of the carriers that are in inactive force, probably Kitty Hawk is the one that you could think about. But we studied that when we decommissioned Enterprise, and the carriers are pretty old.” USN Certainly pulling a carrier directly back into service would go a long way to bridging America’s “carrier gap” and would make President’s Trump’s demand for a 12 supercarrier fleet much more obtainable. Currently the Navy has 10 operational supercarriers, and with the USS Gerald Ford’s (CVN-78) entry into service date murky at best , that number may not increase for years to come. USN via USNI Even just the possibility of Kitty Hawk returning to the fleet is likely music to the ears of those in Mayport, Florida , who have been begging the US Navy to return a supercarrier to the naval station there. The facility was never upgraded to support nuclear propulsion, so after the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) was retired in 2007, it has been without a resident supercarrier, which hurt the local economy and also has strategic implications as well. The Kitty Hawk would be an ideal candidate to call the base home without the need for major infrastructure investments. USN Some of the other ships that would seem to be likely candidates for revival will probably be passed over—specifically the first five Ticonderoga class cruisers that sit quiet on the Delaware River. These ships didn’t feature Mark 41 vertical launch systems, instead being equipped with twin-arm Mark 26 missile launchers and their associated magazines. But still, many have regarded their rickety reserve status a huge waste of latent surface warfare potential. Moore thinks otherwise, and probably for good reason. The ships are vastly outdated compared to their active counterparts, and would take serious money to get them even close to their fleet counterparts standard. Not just that, but they have been cannibalized for spare parts in recent years. Moore says: “Most of those ships, from a combat systems perspective, are pretty obsolete…We probably wouldn’t bring them back and they’ve kind of been spare-parts lockers the last couple of years.” The sorry state of the USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) at naval yards in Philadelphia. , Bigbird78/wikicommons Regenerating old ships is all about balancing the cost of bringing them back into service based on what mission sets they could provide, how degraded a capability compared to their modern counterparts is acceptable, and how long they could remain in service once the money has been invested in them. Aside from the Kitty Hawk, the best candidates for regeneration are the ships that could take on lower-end tasks, and thus not require the huge amount of technological investment as their more advanced cousins require. Primarily this includes the Navy’s mothballed logistical ships and especially its Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates. The tough Oliver Hazard Perry class ships were retired too soon by many accounts —a symptom of their fiscal neglect more than anything else—and were ripe for a major upgrade like many of the second-hand models operated by allied Navies around the globe have received . Some of these enhancements include the installation of Mark 41 vertical launch systems and upgrades to the ship’s sensors and combat systems. Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate USS Thatch patrols the Persian Gulf in 2009., USN “We’ll go look at the FFGs, see if there is utility there… We’ll look at the combat logistics force, see if there’s utility there… So, there is limited opportunity in the inactive fleet but we’ll look at it ship-by-ship.” It is very likely President Trump would support such a plan, in fact we predicted exactly this type of asset regeneration program would occur under his administration. Trump also has a personal history with being very comfortable with operating aging but upgraded vehicles. He even hinted at the possibility of bringing back the Iowa class battleship during his campaign, although that is extremely unlikely to ever happen regardless of the political will involved.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The core of the southern Filipino city of Marawi was seized by Maute and Abu Sayyaf militants , which are directly affiliated with the Islamic State, on May 23th. Since then, Philippines armed forces have performed a a rolling counter-assault on the area in an attempt to dislodge the extremists. The Philippine Air Force’s go-to weapon system for the battle? The OV-10 Bronco. The mission has proven to be extremely difficult as the fighters clearly had been planning and preparing the area for the battle for some time before executing their blitz. Stores of supplies and ammunition are said to be scattered around the city center, and tunnels are allowing the militants to disappear and reappear in a nearly magic-like manner. The use of human shields is also widespread and Filipino Marines and special operations soldiers who are trying to go door-to-door to retake the city have suffered heavy casualties. A PAF OV-10M Bronco., PAF It is thought that at least 138 militants and 58 Filipino troops have died in the fighting so far. That is in addition to at least 21 civilians deaths—likely the actual number is far higher. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced as a result of the siege and the region has been placed under martial law over fears that the insurrection could morph and expand to a point that containing it could prove impossible https://youtube.com/watch?v=cz-pOZAGAps Because of the dense urban area the militants seized and the very limited stockpiles of precision guided munitions in the PAF’s arsenal—not to mention laser designation devices used to target them—the country’s handful (as in eight airframes) of sparingly upgraded OV-10M Broncos have put their ability to make close-range and precise dumb bombing runs to work on targets in the city. Videos of the Broncos pulling off eye-watering attacks over the city have hit the web, and it’s clear that as the situation has become more dire, the rugged old close air support aircraft have only stepped up their sorties. A Bronco released a general purpose bomb on a target in Marawi. , NOEL CELIS/AFP/Getty Images This isn’t the first time the Bronco has tried to buck ISIS. A pair of highly upgraded OV-10s were sent to Iraq to hunt Islamic State fighters alongside special operations forces as an experiment. The results were stunning. The Broncos and their highly trained Navy pilots were turned into flying “man hunters,” slinging laser-guided rockets through windows and door openings like a sniper fires their bullets. The aircraft proved to be ridiculously reliable, easy to deploy near the front lines and vicious when it came to devouring the enemy under the most challenging combat conditions. The Broncos are antiques, but still very effective fighting machines. Here a Filipino Bronco pilot showing off the aircraft’s cockpit in 2004. , JAY DIRECTO/AFP/Getty Images Although the PAF OV-10s don’t have anywhere near the sensor or communications suites of those sent to Iraq, they still can deliver precise fire and even drop GBU-12 laser-guided bombs if they are available and a third party is designating the target with a laser. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zhzWjx6OPjo In addition to the OV-10s, pretty much all of the assets available to the Philippine Air Force are participating in the impromptu air campaign. AW109Es equipped with gun and rocket pods on their stub wings have been seen making attack runs and providing overhead surveillance. Even the country’s new FA-50PH light fighters have flown attack missions against Islamic State positions in Marawi. Dropping unguided weapons among your own populous and troops is an especially high risk enterprise regardless of how accurate the aircraft is that drops them, and there have been friendly fire incidents. On May 31st, ten soldiers were killed and seven wounded in what is thought to have been an errant friendly-fire airstrike. Still, the Philippine Air Force needs to stay engaged in order to break the siege according to Armed Forces of the Philippines Spokesman General Restituto Padilla: “Our troops clearly need to judiciously use force because of a stiffer kind of resistance from the inner enclaves of the city… We feel the pain, we feel the hurt of every member or every citizen or every resident of Marawi. But let us remember that we did not start this… It was the armed group, the Maute Daesh/ISIS-inspired group, that entered your city and wreaked havoc on it.” Other assets involved with the air war over Marawi include AW109Es, U.S. Navy P-3Cs, and SF260s, but the heaviest hitting is being done by the Broncos. , AP The US has also joined the operation, with videos and pictures emerging of P-3C Orions flying low over the city. The Orions would be using their electro-optical payloads, which include infrared and color video capabilities, for providing overwatch, surveillance and for generating new targeting information. Filipino General Restituto Padilla has stated “We don’t have adequate surveillance equipment, so we asked the U.S. military for assistance. It’s noncombat assistance.” The vast majority of the Philippine Air Force, whose inventory is filled with logistical aircraft and aging counter-insurgency platforms, is antiquated and rudimentary by today’s standards. Most all its aircraft lack modern electro-optical sensors, which can be a huge advantage for supporting military operations in urban terrain (MOUT). So even just one P-3C’s presence over the battlefield gives Philippine forces a massive upgrade in situational awareness. Dense urban terrain has made routing the militants a huge challenge. , AP Still, America’s involvement with the three week long conflict surprised the country’s firebrand President Rodrigo Duterte, stating that he “never approached America” for help. And that he was “not aware of that until they arrived.” Although there has been mention that there are no US “boots on the ground” in the area, this is likely untrue as there are multiple reports that US special operations forces, who historically have very close ties with their Filipino counterparts , are in fact on the ground in Marawi working in some capacity. One part of their mission is likely to operate the RQ-20 Puma drones that have been seen buzzing around over the city. A PAF Bronco dropping a pair of 500lb Mk82 general purpose bombs over Marawi., AP We’ll keep you up to date as to how the battle against IS militants in Marawi unfolds. In the meantime, you can be assured that the OV-10 will be bringing the fight to the extremists from on high, proving once again just how valuable and effective this old but still effective asset can be, and why light attack capabilities are more relevant today than ever. Update- 9:45am PST: Just as we suspected, US special operators are helping out with the fight via providing RQ-20 aerial surveillance support- Also, the rumor is that the Philippines is slated to receive six A-29 Super Tucanos, which would replace the Bronco. The tender has been an on and off affair for years, but now it seems the Tucano is favored to win or has won over the AT-6 Coyote. Still, there has been no formal announcement of the winner, so it is possible that procurement of a Bronco replacement could be pushed off once again.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Now That The F-35A Is Also Having Oxygen Issues A Solution Is More Likely,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35 is getting slammed hard once again, this time due to the sudden grounding of 55 of the stealth jets based at Luke AFB following a series of in-flight life support issues. These issues included bouts of hypoxia and other incidents that made it hard for pilots to breathe. The truth of the matter is that the F-35—still a relatively new weapons system that remains deep in testing regardless of how the USAF portrays its status—is the least flagrant offender when it comes to operational aircraft that manifest these anomalies. But the fact that the prized jet is now impacted by these issues means there is a far better likelihood that other older aircraft that have been plagued by similar problems for years will finally be fixed. Other key fast-jet platforms that have been in service for decades and are considered known commodities, including many of the Navy’s Hornet series of fighters, are rife with issues related to the their environmental control systems, and most notably, their onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS) . Maybe most concerning, the Navy’s T-45 Goshawk jet trainer, first introduced over 25 years ago, suddenly fell victim to these issues early last April. The aircraft is an essential tool used to produce a steady steam of new pilots for the Navy and Marine Corps. After i nstructor pilots refused to fly , the Goshawk fleet has been largely grounded, with instructors only cleared to fly around below a miserable 5,000 feet. The T-45 is the workhorse of USN and USMC flight training., USN During a June 12th House Armed Services Committee hearing, the T-45’s woes came up and Navy officials said that they were looking at long-term options to move forward with pilot production without the T-45C, including pushing some training—including carrier qualifications—off to fleet readiness squadrons (FRS). These units serve primarily to train naval aviators in their assigned fleet aircraft to the point that they are ready to head to a operational squadron. But considering that there is already a serious strike-fighter jet shortage, and upwards of roughly 70 percent of legacy Hornets are not ready for flight at any given time, this is not a solution that is easy for the Navy to swallow. Such a plan also introduces much higher risk and general inefficiency into the Navy and Marine Corps pilot training pipeline, as pilots would be assigned a front-line aircraft before their performance around the aircraft carrier could be observed. Also, pushing intermediate training into the FRS is a much more expensive endeavor than executing similar training in a jet trainer, like the T-45. This could also result in shockwaves being sent throughout other aspects of the Navy’s flight training infrastructure. Navy officials even mentioned to the HASC that they are looking at approaching the USAF to see if they could take over some of the fast jet training for the Navy and the USMC until the T-45’s issues can be remedied. They also noted that they have not informed the USAF of their intentions as of yet. Additionally, no formal plans or schedules for flight testing to work on fixes for the T-45 have been delivered to Congress, something that was expected to have been provided some days ago. It also isn’t clear as to how big of impact this issue could have on the fleet if it continues for months. The T-45 is the only trainer in US inventory capable of operating from an aircraft carrier., USN The Hornet community has been experiencing an increasing number of near deadly environmental controls related “incidents” for years now, and the Navy, which has said they are doing all they can since the issues became headlines, really hasn’t seem to be following through as claimed. Weapon System Officer in the Hornet and Radar Intercept Officer in the Tomcat, Commander Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka, wrote the following in a guest commentary for The War Zone last April: According to testimony from Navy leaders to Congress this week, “Since May 1, 2010, all models of the F-18 show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes.” The Navy has investigated 382 cases of physiological episodes induced from the F/A-18 system. Investigators have determined failures occur in two main categories: breathing contaminated air and loss of cabin pressurization. According to the Navy, 130 incidents involved some form of oxygen contamination while 114 involved a failure of the jet’s system that maintains cabin pressure… Today’s fleet naval aviators appear to be getting a good old fashioned run around as no current solution for repairing OBOGS currently exists. Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker admits that the oxygen issues are “the number one safety priority.” But he also admits there is “no smoking gun” they can find to solve the problem. With a problem that has been going on for greater than seven years and shows no signs of slowing down, one would think there was at least some concerted effort to indicate what is causing the problem with OBOGS. Hornets and Super Hornets make up the entirety of the Navy’s strike fighter capabilities. , USN Now the problem is getting worse not better, and spreading to other fleets like some sort of high-tech infectious disease. It’s a bizarre situation to say the least, but it is also becoming a dire one. The F-35A’s environmental systems issues, which are centered around five separate incidents, occurring between May 2nd to June 8th, where hypoxia or oxygen deprivation were present, now appear to be more extreme than originally thought. The incidents came to the public’s attention late last week when the grounding of all of Luke AFB’s 55 strong F-35A fleet was suddenly announced. The grounding was supposed to be lifted Monday but it was extended indefinitely instead, putting the key training base out of F-35 flying action. In all five events, the F-35A’s backup liquid oxygen system worked as planned and the pilots were able to land safely. USAF Now Lockheed and the F-35 program overall are facing the potential reality that this problem could lead to a much wider grounding. There have been roughly 220 F-35s produced, and the idea that the problem is just contained to one base or batch of aircraft would contradict the nature of the issues the Hornet and Goshawk fleets have experienced. With the F-35 program riding high on a series of recent high-profile deployments overseas , and the first forward basing of American F-35Bs in Japan , not to mention the jet’s upcoming and long-awaited visit to the Paris Airshow, having to ground the entire fleet would be a major setback and a public relations nightmare. A similar situation occurred after the F-35 experienced a catastrophic engine fire in 2014 . This ended up being widely considered a low-point for the program overall. Even worse, it would push the chronically delayed testing and development program back even more , and add to a development budget that is already in need of yet another extra infusion of cash . It would also put into question the reliability of the aircraft, even after 95,000 hours have been flown across the fleet over the last ten years, and especially for foreign buyers, many of which will have no other fighter aircraft type in their air force once their F-35s are delivered. Although this situation looks bleak, some serious good could come out of the F-35’s latest issue. Now that the prized jet for which the Air Force has bet so heavily on has also fallen victim to similar oxygen deprivation anomalies as those found in the T-45 and the Hornet, the Air Force is being pulled into the OBOGS mystery muck. Also, Lockheed’s largest weapons program—the largest ever by any weapons manufacturer actually—is being put at risk with this issue. As a result, the resources of both the Navy and the Air Force, as well as both Boeing and Lockheed Martin, can be focused at actually solving this issue, or at least putting in place robust engineering changes so that OBOGS can be sidelined altogether until a fix to the system can be fully realized. International operators of similar aircraft or aircraft that use a similar OBOGS system, should also be engaged in the investigation whether they are experiencing these issues or not. If anything else, their operational data may be crucial in finding a solution for the problem. USAF This massive cross-service, cross-platform, cross-manufacturer, cross-government combined initiative could get OBOGS fixed once and for all, and in doing so it will likely save lives. Up until now, after hundreds of incidents, the Defense Department has gotten incredibly lucky by not losing crews as a result of its fighter aircraft environment system woes. It is only a matter of time before that statistic changes for the worse. In the end, whether a solution means going back to liquid oxygen or totally replacing the OBOGS systems already fitted in various types of jet aircraft, there is a far better chance of a solution now that the F-35 program is put at risk by the issue than there was before.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 25, 2019",Peek Around Inside The Navy’s Stealth Destroyer By Watching This Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a controversial beast to say the least. From the class’s depressingly stripped down capabilities to its ammoless deck guns and tiny production run of just three ships, the glitz of their futuristic exteriors doesn’t match the commitment the Navy has to their success. Still, the Zumwalt class has enjoyed a lot of fanfare in the press, and we have seen some still images of her interior spaces, but not a lot of quality video showing the inside of the ship exists, until now. Nobody can deny that the Zumwalt’s design isn’t fresh and its less glamorous bits are really its most impressive features, like the ship’s ability to generate huge amounts of electricity and its total ship computing environment. But beyond all of this, it’s still a ship with sailors living and working aboard for long periods of time. This little video offers us landlubbers a tour of some of her interior spaces and gives us an idea of what it’s like to serve aboard the futuristic vessel. What is not shown in the video, and has yet to be in any public form, is the ship’s most impressive interior space of all—its war room like “Mission Center.” Looking more like a multi-story Combined Air Operations Center , or something out of a NORAD command bunker than a ship’s combat information center, this cavernous space will serve as the ship’s nerve center. It will pull in information from all of the vessel’s sensors, as well as from those around the battlespace and high above orbiting the earth in space, into one “common picture.” From this massive rush of streaming and fused information, commanders will be able to direct the ship’s weapons systems and sensors. They will also be able to track and avoid the enemy and their own sensor capabilities. The ship can even be steered from the Mission Center and its engineering systems controlled. You can read all about this fascinating feature in one of my past features linked here . The Zumwalt class and the Independence class, the Navy’s most futuristic looking surface combatants without a doubt., USN Like Picard’s Enterprise, Common Display Stations are scattered all throughout the ship. Depending on your access level, you can control any part of the ship from them. Considering the Zumwalt’s highly reduced crew of around 140—less than half the size of the crews found on smaller Arleigh Burke class destroyers—the high level of automation and improved man-machine interfaces are necessary technological improvements. Still, a smaller crew means that sailors have to wear multiple hats, and fire fighting and damage control could be a major challenge if the ship were struck by enemy fire. Overall the USS Zumwalt looks like an awesome ship to serve on, and if the Navy were smart, she would represent what’s to come in the near future, and not just a downgraded, downsized experiment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",Unmasking The Bullet-Shaped Mystery Aircraft After It Reemerges At Victorville,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone was the first to bring you a story about a highly exotic aircraft photographed at Southern California Logistics Airport near Victorville last April. Going off of just low-grade cell phone image, there was much speculation about what the aircraft was and who it belonged to. Was it a testbed for an alternate fuel like hydrogen? Was it prototype for an EADS/Airbus VoltAir electric airplane ? Was it some crazy new super-efficient private plane? Some thought it couldn’t fly at all, and that it was a film prop. Now we not only know that it is very much a real aircraft—one that is cloaked in secrecy—but also who it belongs to, and what its purpose may be. First off, the aircraft’s registry states that it belongs to a company called Otto Aviation Group LLC, based in Yorba Linda, California. Not much information is readily available about the company, but it is affiliated with a number of patents, including ones showing almost the identical design of the aircraft above, as well as many of its components . A document from the Southern California Logistic Airport dated April of 2017 details the execution of a lease agreement for an 11,000-square-foot facility to house a small prototype aircraft program that will also be tested at the airport. If successful, it could bring as many as 150 jobs to the site for FAA certification, and many more for production. The tenant named is Otto Aviation Group LLC. The company appears to be affiliated with Applied Physicist William M. Otto, who was also a key player at a firm called Otto Labs . Mr. Otto was previously the chief scientist for the B-1’s avionics system development program, and held many other positions at North American-Rockwell. According to one academic honor society website , “Otto has retired from active participation in Otto Laboratories Inc., and assumed the presidency of Otto Aviation, managing the design and production of extremely low-drag aircraft.” US Patent 9,446,835 B2 The Vice President of Otto Labs, Ed Cababa, is also affiliated with Otto Aviation Group LLC. Cababa has a background working with Honda in vehicle handling and testing. A tax certificate lists both Otto and Cababa as owners of Otto Aviation Group LLC and that they “manufacture composite parts for a prototype aircraft.” The registration also provides us with a designation for this mystery plane—the Celera 500L. It is the only aircraft registered by the company with the FAA. The War Zone contacted the Otto Aviation Group by phone and they said they could not comment on the aircraft in any way. This new high resolution image shows the rear of the airframe, which is the perfect companion photo to the lower resolution, front aspect image that we posted last April . We can now clearly see the five bladed, variable pitch, “pusher” propeller that will provide thrust. The airframe also features what appears to be all-moving vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and long, slender wings that are likely optimized for laminar flow . The Bell X-1 like teardrop fuselage design, which includes a cockpit windscreen seamlessly blended into the fuselage, gives the aircraft a large internal volume and high aerodynamic efficiency. It’s safe to say that efficiency is what this aircraft is primarily about. Even the prop size looks small in relation to the overall aircraft, which would point to the possibility that it makes very good use out of the thrust it has on hand. The big question is what type of powerplant does this aircraft leverage? The design’s large internal volume could be indicative of a new fuel source, or even that it could be battery powered—or at least that it may feature one of these new propulsion technologies at some point in the future. On the other hand, the FAA registration states the aircraft’s engine as reciprocating, so it is possible that it could have a totally mundane powerplant—at least for now. We do get an peek inside the engine bay in the photo above, so maybe our engineer commenters will be able to make some guesses as to what is going on in there. It’s worth noting that some of the most prominent aerospace engine manufacturers have a heavy presence at Victorville, although we can’t draw a direct connection between them and this aircraft at this time. It all comes down to the question of what is the aircraft? Who is the Otto Aviation team who built it? What are they trying to achieve? We are getting a clearer picture that at least one major goal is to prove the aerodynamic merits of the aircraft’s exotic design. And we know that a production aircraft based on this design is part of Otto Aviation’s plans. But will this design be paired with a new propulsion technology that can take advantage of its aerodynamic efficiency as part of a grander play to revolutionize aviation? We’ll just have to wait and see.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 23, 2020",USAF Or NATO Should Snap Up The RAF’s Retiring R1 Sentinel Radar Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Air Force is being forced to give up one of its most powerful surveillance assets—its fleet of five Sentinel R1 ground targeting radar planes—due to competing budgetary priorities and yet another round of governmental cost saving measures. The R1 fleet has “been on borrowed time” fiscally for most its relatively short service life, but the final decision to axe the planes once and for all seems to have finally occurred, and they will be phased by the end of the decade. Although this is a major blow to UK Ministry of Defense’s portfolio of capabilities, it is an outstanding opportunity for the Unites States Air Force and the US military as a total force. These aircraft provide unique intelligence by keeping track of moving vehicles and taking highly detailed synthetic aperture radar “pictures” or “maps” of the battlefield. They can do this at standoff ranges and over huge swathes of the earth’s surface. They have secondary over-water maritime surveillance and low and slow flying target tracking capabilities as well. Their data can be used in real time to inform and reposition ground forces, or to order attacks on enemy columns , or to divert tactical reconnaissance aircraft, such a MQ-9 drones or MC-12s , to take a closer look at a certain area using their electro-optical or tactical GMTI radar systems . The Sentinel’s “imagery” can also be used for planning future strikes, for bomb damage assessment and for keeping track of the enemy’s pattern of life around key areas. In essence, it gives its war fighting “team” an unfair advantage over the enemy, and it can even do so through bad weather and smoke when optical and infrared sensors are left all but useless. Sentinel R1, Raytheon Originally known as the Airborne Standoff Radar (ASTOR), the Sentinel R1 fleet is not being retired because it is old or inefficient. Far from it in fact. The Global Express business jet-based radar aircraft were introduced into service less than a decade ago, in 2008, and the type’s first flight occurred just four years earlier. Compared to the USAF’s fleet of rickety old E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar (JSTARS) aircraft, which are built around secondhand 707 airframes that were far from new when they were introduced into service starting some 25 years ago, the R1s are toddlers. E-8C JSTARS is a very capable sensor system flying on a very old and expensive to operate aircraft., USAF Today the average age of the 16 strong E-8C fleet is just shy of 50 years. The aircraft are unreliable and notoriously expensive to operate. The mix of a very high-tech sensor system and a tired platform to lug it aloft is not a good one, especially considering the high demand for JSTARS capabilities around the globe today. The R1s provide very similar—and in some cases superior—capabilities as the E-8 but in a far more efficient package, and are totally interoperable with existing US and NATO systems. In fact, the R1s are very similar to designs that are intended to replace the E-8 JSTARS fleet under a competitive tender that is ongoing now. The fight for the $6.9 billion, 17 aircraft deal is fierce, with Boeing’s 737 going up against the Northrop Grumman and L3’s Gulfstream G550 and Lockheed and Raytheon’s Bombardier Global 6000. Each team has their own significant merits, as do the platforms they have chosen to host their radars, but whichever plane manufacturer wins, they could see more follow-on orders for other special mission aircraft. The contract is expected to be awarded this fall, with initial operating capability set for 2024. The new system’s fully operational date is slated to be sometime in 2028. Boeing’s JSTARS replacement offering based on the 737-700., Boeing It will take many years to fully field the JSTARS replacement, and in the meantime the E-8C fleet is having a hard time getting into the air while demand for their unique capabilities is only increasing. During a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing, Pentagon officials made it clear that there is a serious Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) deficit—precisely the primary capability the JSTARS and the Sentinel R1 provides—in theaters around the globe where the US is engaged militarily. This is part of a greater ongoing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform deficit in the US military. As of now only 30 percent of ISR tasking requests can be met. With all this in mind, taking on the RAF’s young Sentinel fleet as the RAF retires them would provide enhanced capabilities in the near term that are especially suited for operating at high sortie rates from relatively austere locations around the globe. Not just that, but the R1’s AESA radar could potentially be upgraded to provide enhanced surveillance over water and littoral regions and even possibly execute electronic attacks on enemy emitters at standoff ranges. Sentinel R1, MoD/Crown Copyright The Sentinel/ASTOR system also includes specialized communications and command and control infrastructure, including eight transportable ground stations—two Operational Level Ground Stations (OLGS) and six mobile Tactical Ground Stations (TGS). Much of the Sentinel’s synthetic aperture radar imagery and GMTI tracking can be exploited by operators in these ground stations via data-link, which is somewhat different than the JSTARS concept, but is more like the systems being fielded for the JSTARS recapitalization initiative. All this infrastructure exists and would be basically thrown away with the retirement of the R1s. The R1’s networking concept., Public Domain Overall, the USAF could not only immediately augment its existing fleet of tired E-8s by acquiring the Sentinels, but it could also lower the initial tender for the E-8 replacement by a number of aircraft, and thus save billions. The Global Express is also already in the USAF’s inventory in the form of the E-11 Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) , so commonality and training within the service already exists. Also, these E-11s are deployed to the same places R1s would be, which could be beneficial when it comes to logistically supporting these jets in the field. E-11 BACN. Some have different configurations, including large satcom domes on their spine and sensor canoes on their belly, making them closely resemble the R-1., USAF It may also be possible for the Department of Defense to work out a crew and cost sharing deal with the Ministry of Defense, whereby a certain number of R1 taskings can be dedicated to the UK’s strategic needs. This way the cost is shared by both parties based on usage, and as a result, MoD doesn’t have to say goodby totally to its strategic GMTI and SAR capability. It also means that the MoD will not have to bare the cost of the infrastructure that goes along with operating the R1s. Since the two allies work together on foreign campaigns more than not, such a deal would be a win-win for both parties and the concept does have precedent. Although the loss of the R1 fleet may be a sad pill to swallow for the Royal Air Force, and the MoD as a whole, it represents a real opportunity for the US that could be aggressively explored in the near term. Sadly, the powers that be within the Pentagon and in the US defense industry will likely fight any sort of second hand acquisition of the Sentinel fleet because it will, even if to a relatively small degree, put in jeopardy the scope of lucrative E-8 JSTARS replacement contract. With careers being bet on this procurement initiative both inside the DoD and in the ranks of its biggest vendors, the retired R1s, which are needed today and can fit right into the USAF’s inventory and order of battle, will likely be passed over. We can only hope this won’t be the case as America’s warfighters can seriously benefit from having these aircraft overhead in hotspots around the globe. An R-1 takes off from Mojave Air And Space Port. , Alan Radecki /wikicommons Alternatively, NATO could acquire these aircraft for the alliance’s collective use under a similar scheme as their E-3 AWACS fleet, but they are already receiving GMTI and SAR capability via their five aircraft, Global Hawk-based “Alliance Ground Surveillance” initiative. But NATO will likely want more capacity and in a more flexible manner than the unmanned Global Hawks can provide. Instead of buying more Global Hawk derivatives, they could diversify their capabilities and likely save large sums of money by taking on the R1 fleet. Such a transfer of capability would also make losing the aircraft more palatable for the UK. But where exactly the funding for operating and maintaining the Sentinels will come from is unclear. The Trump Administration could tell the alliance pitch in to adopt the fleet, as making demands of NATO partners has been part of the White House’s core foreign policy agenda, but it could take time for making such an arrangement a reality. Like any weapon system, the longer the R1s sit in limbo the more expensive it will be to return them to service. Either way, these aircraft need a home. Hopefully the US will step in—either with money or leadership—and see that they find one that is beneficial to the US and its allies.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Destroyer USS Fitzgerald Badly Damaged After Collision With Merchant Vessel (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USS Fitzgerald, a U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer, collided with the shipping vessel ACX Crystal about 55 miles south of Yokosuka, Japan at 2:30AM local time. The Fitzgerald is badly damaged, with the starboard side of the ship’s forward superstructure, right below its bridge and SPY-1 phased array radars, punched completely in. The ship is not moving under its own power and has been taking on water. It is unclear at this time if lives were lost or serious injuries occurred asa result on the mishap but that is likely to be the case. The US Navy has requested support from the Japanese Coast Guard to assist the stricken ship. The condition of the Philippine flagged merchant vessel remains unknown at this time. The Fitzgerald is forward-based in Japan and has been very active in region as of late, participating in large-scale exercises with two US aircraft carriers, a Japanese helicopter carrier and an array of other surface combatants near North Korean waters earlier in the month. UPDATE- 4:00pm PST: Here is the latest statement from the 7th Fleet: USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) was involved in a collision with a merchant vessel at approximately 2:30 a.m. local time, June 17, while operating about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan. The Japanese Coast Guard is on scene and providing assistance at the request of the U.S. Navy. Japan Coast Guard cutters IZUNAMI and KANO are on station, as well as a helicopter. The USS Fitzgerald is under her own power, although her propulsion is limited. The USS Fitzgerald suffered damage on her starboard side above and below the waterline. The collision resulted in some flooding. The ship’s crew is responding to the casualty. The full extent of damage is being determined. The extent of number of personnel injuries is being determined. Currently working with the Japanese Coast Guard to conduct a medevac via helicopter for one Sailor. The USS Dewey (DDG 105), medical assistance and two Navy tugs are being dispatched as quickly as practicable to provide assistance. Naval aircraft are also being readied. In imagery popping up on social media, the ship looks to be sitting low in the water and some reports say that at least three spaces have been flooded. There is also damage below the waterline. UPDATE- 6:55pm PST: Seven sailors remain unaccounted for and the commanding officer of the destroyer, Commander Bryce Benson, was one of two people taken from the stricken vessel by helicopter to a nearby hospital. Both patients are in stable condition. The official statement from the 7th Fleet reads: As of this time, there have been two patients requiring medical evacuation. One was Cmdr. Bryce Benson, Fitzgerald’s commanding officer, who was transferred to U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka and is reportedly in stable condition. A second MEDEVAC is in progress. Other injured are being assessed. There are seven Sailors unaccounted for; the ship and the Japanese Coast Guard continues to search for them. Although Fitzgerald is under her own power, USS Dewey (DDG 105) got underway this morning as well as several U.S. Navy aircraft, and will join Japanese Coast Guard and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopters, ships and aircraft to render whatever assistance may be required. “U.S. and Japanese support from the Navy, Maritime Self Defense Force and Coast Guard are in the area to ensure that the Sailors on USS Fitzgerald have the resources they need to stabilize their ship. As more information is learned, we will be sure to share to it with the Fitzgerald families and when appropriate the public. Thank you for your well wishes and messages of concern. All of our thoughts and prayers are with the Fitzgerald crew and their families,” said Adm. John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations. “Right now we are focused on two things: the safety of the ship and the well-being of the Sailors,” said Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. “We thank our Japanese partners for their assistance.” Here are high-resolution photo showing the damage to the ACX Crystal and the Fitzgerald: AP AP AP AP AP AP UPDATE-2am PST: The latest from 7th Fleet headquarters gives us a better idea of the damage done to the ship, but it also may foreshadow what’s to come once the ship is in port and recovery teams are able to access the flooded spaces: Shortly after the collision the U.S. made a request for support from the Japanese Coast Guard, which first arrived on scene and continues to be lead for finding the seven missing Sailors. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force ships JS Ohnami, JS Hamagiri, and JS Enshu have joined the JCG ships Izanami and Kano and USS Dewey (DDG 105). A U.S. P-8 Poseidon aircraft is working in concert with two JMSDF Helicopters and a JMSDF P-3 Orion aircraft to search the area. Names of the missing Sailors are being withheld until the families have been notified. The collision effected Fitzgerald’s forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room, which damage control teams quickly began dewatering. While those efforts helped stabilize the flooding, it remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side in Yokosuka in order to methodically continue the search for the missing. Once the ship arrives in Yokosuka, divers will inspect the damage and develop a plan for repairs and inspection of the spaces. As of this time, there have been three patients requiring medical evacuation. One was Cmdr. Bryce Benson, Fitzgerald’s commanding officer, who was transferred to U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka by a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) helicopter. All three Sailors are awake and will remain under observation at the hospital until further notice. Two additional personnel have been medevac’d from Fitzgerald to USNH-Yokosuka by Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 12 (HSC-12) for lacerations and bruises. Other injured are being assessed aboard the ship. Although the statement notes the damage above the waterline, it is likely there are hull fissures below the waterline as well, and the ACX Crystal’s bulbous bow could have acted as a battering ram of sorts to areas of the ship we cannot see. There have also been statements posted on various sites from Navy personnel noting how close the ship came to sinking. As for how this could have happened, I will just leave this link to right of way rules on the high seas for you to examine. The Fitzgerald being struck in an almost t-fashion amidship on her starboard side may offer some insight into the dynamics of the crash. Still, so many factors can come into play in a major mishap like this and almost always it is not just one mistake or failure that causes such a catastrophic incident, but a chain of them. This vessel tracking site also offers a short history of the ship’s speed via a graph, and it shows a period where the ship went from around 14 knots to zero suddenly. We cannot vouch for the accuracy of this satellite tracking data but it is interesting to examine regardless.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 19, 2017",USN F/A-18E Super Hornet Shoots Down Syrian Su-22 Fitter Attack Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Major events are unfolding on battlefield Syria today—ones that could also have major strategic impact on the conflict and the region. Details remain sketchy, but according to a Pentagon release and other reports, a US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Air Force Su-22 Fitter attack jet near Ja’Din. The town is located south of the strategic dam at Al Tabqa and west of the Islamic State’s defacto capital of Al Raqqa. At around 4:30 local time, pro Assad forces mounted a offensive on Ja’Din that is currently held by US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). SDF fighters took casualties during the onslaught, leading to their retreat. Coalition aircraft conducted a show of force—a maneuver which usually includes flying very low at transonic speeds over the enemy while popping decoy flares—in an attempt to stop the attack. It worked and the aircraft were not called on to directly engage pro-Assad forces on the ground. As it has become all too customary, the US-led coalition used its “deconfliction” hotline with Russia in an attempt to stop the assault on the area altogether. Then, just over two hours after the ground assault began, a Syria Air Force Su-22 attack aircraft showed up over the area and began dropping bombs of SDF forces located South of Al Tabqa. A USN Super Hornet shot the swing-wing jet out of the sky “in accordance with the rules of engagement and in collective self defense of coalition partnered forces.” A SyAF Su-22 Fitter., AP The statement issued by CJTFOIR notes that Ja’Din is two kilometers north of the deconfliction line set up primarily by the Russians and the Assad regime, and is clearly marked as an SDF area. It also goes on with the usual boilerplate statements about the need to focus on destroying ISIS and the threat is poses to the world. Centcom Release Here is a bad translation of the official statement from the Syrian government on the incident: The oldest flight is called (International Alliance) Thursday afternoon to target one of the fighter aircraft in the Rusafa area of the southern countryside tenderness during the implementation of a combat mission against the terrorist organization Daesh in the region led to the crash and the loss of the pilot. This blatant aggression confirms beyond doubt the truth in support of terrorism, the American position, which aims to try to influence the Syrian Arab Army’s ability only force players with allies exercising their legitimate right to fight terrorism throughout the home area especially since this attack comes at a time that achieves the Syrian Arab army and its allies clear progress in the fight against the terrorist organization Daesh who defeated in the Syrian desert on more than one direction. Also it confirms that exists between the United States and the organization of coordination Daesh terrorist, and exposes the malicious intentions of the United States of America in the management of terrorism and investing in it to achieve its objectives in passing the project US Zionist in the region. The General Command of the Army and the armed forces as it warns of the serious repercussions of this blatant assault on the fight against terrorism, efforts to confirm that such attacks will not be deterred from its determination and its determination to continue the war against organizational Daesh and Front victory terrorists and groups associated with them and restore security and stability to all the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. The Super Hornet involved in the engagement is likely one of dozens operating from the USS George H.W. Bush in the Mediterranean. This would be the first air-to-air kill for the type. It would also be the first time a US fighter aircraft has shot down a manned foreign aircraft for many years, but it is not the first air-to-air engagement between pro-Assad flying forces and US airpower. Just last week a USAF F-15E shot down an armed drone of Iranian origin near coalition forces located close to the southern Syrian town of At Tanf. Super Hornets on a mission over Syria., DoD The downing of a SyAF jet by a coalition fighter signifies a reality that The War Zone has predicted for some time to be nearly inevitable if the diplomatic situation remains as is —that as the common threat from ISIS diminishes, disparate forces and factions with unique agendas in both Syria and Iraq will likely turn their battle hardened forces on one another in a greater power struggle for both countries’ futures. The so called “race to Raqqa” is just a sign of this, and the fact that Syrian troops, Iranian-backed Shiite militias, Turkish fighters and Russian special operators have been largely blocked from being able to participate the city’s liberation has drastically heightened tensions. Now we will have to wait and see how Russia reacts to this shoot-down. Moscow has taken greater custody of Assad’s airpower and military capabilities following the US cruise missile strike on Shayrat Airfield last April. This engagement could result in enhanced Russian fighter patrols over eastern Syria, and as a result, the skies over the area could become far more volatile than they are today. The fact is the US has gone through great lengths to not have an incident like today’s aerial engagement occur, even after bombings , strange aerial encounters and menacing from pro-Assad airpower . Don’t be surprised if the US and its coalition activate a large no-fly zone over the eastern portion of Syria in an attempt to abate a more chaotic situation should Russia try to counter today’s events with their own airpower capabilities. But doing so also all but invites a standoff between Russian and US fighter aircraft. Above all else, this shoot down will just make things more complicated for coalition air power trying to support the final assault on Al Raqqa. The need for more caution and air defense assets over the area means less aircraft will be available to focus on dismantling the Islamic State in Syria once and for all. We will update this story with more information as it comes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Iran Launched An Unprecedented Ballistic Missile Attack On Syrian City,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a day full of troubling firsts over battlefield Syria, which has included a US Navy fighter shooting down a Syrian attack jet, Iran has waded into the Syrian conflict in an entirely new and very concerning matter—by launching a ballistic missile bombardment on the long-contested city of Deir Ez-Zor in eastern Syria. The missiles were said to have been a retaliatory measure in response to an affiliate of the Islamic State’s attack on Iran’s parliament eleven days ago. The missiles, which are said to be about four in number, were fired by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps from western Iran. They supposedly struck extremist bases in and around the embattled city. Over the last couple of years, Deir Ez-Zor has been heavily bombarded by US and pro-Assad forces, including high altitude bombardment by Russian bombers—some of which flew from an airfield in western Iran for a period of time. It has also been the scene of highly controversial incidents where bombs landed on the wrong forces. Today’s strike could also be part of an emerging offensive by pro-Assad forces, one in which Iranian-backed Shiite militias are heavily involved, to take Deir Ez-Zor once and for all. Iran has long wanted a reliable land-route that links its country, through Iraq, and into western Syria. Taking Deir Ez-Zor could be a huge part of making that wish a reality. The city also has robust energy reserves and sits on the banks of the strategic Euphrates River. Dier Ez-Zor is roughly 300 miles from the Iranian border. As such, depending on how far away from Iran’s border with Iraq the missiles were fired, such a strike would require a short to medium-range ballistic missile. There have been reports that the weapons used were Shahab-3 ballistic missiles, but we will have to wait for confirmation on exactly which weapons were employed in the attack. Video supposedly showing the Iranian missile launch. We cannot confirm the authenticity of these video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=S__YbAeXLx8 The biggest part of this story is not the tactical outcome Iran was seeking by launching these weapons at a terrorist base or bases, but by the wider implications of Iran actually using their ballistic missiles operationally. According to Haaretz , this is the first time Iran has used such a capability since 1988, during the bloody Iran-Iraq war, and Iran’s maturing ballistic missile program is maybe the top security issue in the region today outside of fighting the Islamic State. Israel has traditionally been most concerned with the threat posed by Iran’s ballistic missiles, and they have developed a highly complex defensive system to counter them. But now, Sunni Arab gulf states largely view Shiite Iran as a far bigger threat than Israel, and have been rushing to procure and deploy their own missile defenses at great cost. At the same time, the Trump administration has left the Iranian nuclear agreement it had touted as one of “the worst deals of all time” in place, but is now enacting extra sanctions as a response to Tehran’s ongoing ballistic missile tests. Keep in mind, all this has occurred while Iran’s “ballistic missile genie” so to speak has remained in its metaphorical lamp. Now that the IRGC has shown that it is willing to use these missiles operationally, the whole strategic equation changes. Regardless of the after-action analysis, what missiles were used, and what their reliability and accuracy was, Tehran’s missile threat is now a very real and tangible thing. Expect US policy to change accordingly and the arsenals of US-allied states in the region to do so as well. If anything else, this attack was possibly the best advertisement for high-end theatre ballistic missile defense capabilities one can imagine. Previous launch of a Shahab-3: https://youtube.com/watch?v=F9d1BDeA5-I Advanced Iranian fighting capabilities seem to be showing up in Syria at an alarming level just in the past few weeks. During an aborted attack on a coalition-backed Syrian rebel base in At Tanf earlier in the month by pro-Assad Shiite militias, an armed Iranian drone roughly the size of a MQ-1 Predator appeared. This was a first, and the aircraft was subsequently shot down by a USAF F-15E . Now with ballistic missiles being used, it is another sign that Iran is willing to inject much more advanced weaponry into the Syrian conflict. It is also worth addressing what exactly Iran got out of this strike. Ballistic missiles of this nature lack extreme accuracy and are only good against area targets, such as military outposts and compounds. It seems these types of targets are what Iran went after with their barrage. But their use of these missiles is likely more of a product of the strangely dissected airspace over Syria than anything else. Also, the targets near Deir Ez-Zor were likely just on the edge of the aging Iranian Air Force’s tactical fighter range capabilities, although we have mused about the possibility of Iranian air power entering the Syrian conflict before. Russian aircraft could have struck the targets, but revenge isn’t so sweet or politically attractive when it is exacted by an ally. Iran’s use of ballistic missiles accomplished two clear objectives. First it offered at least some sign that Iran was exacting vengeance for the rare terror attack on their parliament. This is a much needed event for Iran’s ruling elite, and it will play well for domestic consumption. So the attack is largely a hollow political gesture more than a tactical one. Second, it showed the world Iran’s missiles are not just an experiment or a propaganda tool, but that they are very real capability to be reckoned with, and Tehran is now apparently wiling to use them. Update-1:10am PST: As more imagery has been released of the Iranian missile launch, it appears that at least one of the types used was a solid-fueled Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missile . The relatively new (unveiled in 2016) missile is supposed to have a range of 435 miles and can carry a sub-munition warhead ideal for area strikes on lightly armored material and personnel. It is also supposed to be highly accurate as far as Iranian ballistic missiles go. It’s nose-section mounted control fins could potentially provide the missile with enhanced precision and greater survivability with ability to maneuver dynamically during the missile’s terminal phase of flight. These capabilities, along with the fact that it is a relatively new design, would have made the Zulfiqar an ideal missile choice for yesterday’s strikes. The missiles were supposedly fired from the western Iranian city of Kermanshah, which would have meant they traveled 400 miles to Deir ez-Zor. This would have been near the very outward reaches of their claimed operational range. We have yet to receive an official description from the U.S. or other regional powers as to what type of missiles are thought to have been used in the attack. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HOOy6npQlp8 Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Shockwaves Sent Through Tattered US-Russian Relationship After US Downs Syrian Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday’s engagement between a US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet and an Syrian Su-22 Fitter attack jet has sent the already stalling US-Russian relationship into a nose dive. As we expected, Moscow’s response to the incident has been intense and the likelihood that other encounters in the air and on the ground turn deadly between US backed coalition and pro-Assad forces has only increased. A swirl of Russian statements on the event hit news wires this morning, with Moscow making it clear that any coalition aircraft flying east of the Euphrates river will be closely watched and targeted by Russian forces, with the Russian MoD stating: “In the areas of combat missions of Russian air fleet in Syrian skies, any airborne objects, including aircraft and unmanned vehicles of the [US-led] international coalition, located to the west of the Euphrates River, will be tracked by Russian ground and air defense forces as air targets.” Syrian Su-22 Fitter pilot at Shayrat Air Base the day after the US struck it with 59 Tomahawks. , AP The Russian MoD has also said that it is halting even the lowly cooperation it had with the US. This was being facilitated by the Memorandum on Prevention of Incidents and Ensuring Air Safety In Syria agreement that led to the creation of a sometimes effective but ultimately necessary hotline between Russian commanders in western Syria and US-led coalition commanders in Qatar. This so called “deconfliction phone” allowed either side to hale the other during emergencies—like when one force is attacking the other seemingly by accident—and to smooth over potential operational hurdles before or after significant issues arise. Russia claims the phone was never used before the Super Hornet fired on the Su-22, stating: “The command of the coalition forces did not use the existing communication channel between the air commands of Al Udeid Airbase and the Khmeimim Airbase to prevent incidents in Syrian airspace.” The US has a different account, stating that it did indeed attempt to use the deconfliction channel before clearing the Super Hornet to fire. Now, as part of Russia’s response to Sunday’s air-to-air engagement, Russia says they are no longer going to answer the deconfliction phone if it rings: “As of June 19 this year, the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation has ended its interaction with the US side under a memorandum for preventing incidents and providing for safe flights during operations in Syria and demands that the US command carry out a careful investigation and report about its results and the measures taken.” After the U.S. cruise missile attack on Syria’s Shayrat air base in April, Moscow said they were shuttering the hotline operation, but it came back into existence some time after. It is not clear if they will stick to their word this time, although their intent to stop the patchy cooperation is being more clearly stated this time than last. AIM-120 AMRAAMs being rolled on the flight-deck for loading aboard US Navy fighter aircraft operating over Syria., ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/Getty Images Still, the Kremlin is viewing the shoot-down, at least publicly, as an act of blatant aggression by the US and its coalition partners and is demanding a full investigation into to incident, including why the deconfliction phone was not used first before the order was given to blow the Su-22 out of the sky. And the rhetoric doesn’t stop there, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the downing of the Su-22 was like “helping the terrorists that the U.S. is fighting against,” and added “what is this, if not an act of aggression?” The official MoD statement on the incident also has some harsh words, stating in part : “Syrian air force aircraft destroying American Aviation in Syrian airspace, cynical violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic. Repeated Hostilities Aviation USA under the guise of “fighting terrorism” against the legitimate armed forces United Nations Member States, are a flagrant violation of international law and in fact military aggression towards the Syrian Arab Republic.” Although the exact parameters of the engagement remain unclear, CBS reports that two missiles were fired from the rear-aspect of the Su-22, with one missing the aircraft and the other detonating at its rear, blowing off the jet’s tail and sending it into the ground. Neither Russia nor the US has put out any information as to the fate of the Su-22’s pilot, although some sources with contacts in Syria say he has been captured alive. As for the U.S. response to Russia’s tough talk, the Pentagon is drawing a hardline with Captain Jeff Davis stating: “We do not seek conflict with any party in Syria other than ISIS, but we will not hesitate to defend ourselves or our partners if threatened.” Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford seemed to blow off Russia’s blustering: “I’m confident that we are still communicating between our operations center and the Russia federation operations center and I’m also confident that our forces have the capability to take care of themselves.” But the reality of the situation is likely far more complicated. There is talk that Russia will begin patrolling east with its best fighter aircraft in the region, and that the way the coalition does business has also had to adapt significantly in recent hours. This has included repositioning aircraft and bolstering defensive air capabilities over the country. Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart said the following while speaking for Central Command (CENTCOM): “As a result of recent encounters involving pro-Syrian Regime and Russian forces, we have taken prudent measures to re-position aircraft over Syria so as to continue targeting ISIS forces while ensuring the safety of our aircrew given known threats in the battlespace.” All this makes it harder for the coalition to go after ISIS with the resources available, and has occurred at a critical time in the coalition’s campaign to rout ISIS from the region. The final assault on the Islamic State’s capital of Al Raqqa just began officially last week, and air power is critical in leveraging the most dramatic impact that American special operators on the ground fighting alongside indigenous rebel forces can provide. Super Hornets roar off the deck. Closest aircraft is configured in the “Five Wet” tanker configuration., ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/Getty Images The biggest risk is to US aircraft operating near pro-Assad forces operating in Syria’s central and southern regions, and especially to US drones that may venture west into airspace that is defended by some of Russia’s most capable air defense systems not to mention a small contingent of Russian fighters based near Latakia. Traditionally, these have been Su-35s. Russia could begin flying air patrols out into eastern Syria as a challenge to coalition forces, but that level of recklessness may be a step too far for the Kremlin considering that it is already deeply involved in the conflict. If the jet that the US Navy shot down had been Russian things would be different. But even then, after a Russian Su-24 was shot down by Turkey a year and a half ago , killing one of its aircrew, tensions drastically increased between the two countries, but the bad blood was fairly short-lived in retrospect. If Russia tests the US and its coalition, more assets will likely be needed to fight the air war over Syria, and a deeper deployment of F-22s —an aerial weapon system Russia cannot compete with over Syrian territory and that can act as a deconfliction referee of sorts —is possible if not probable. Even the deployment of F-15Cs to provide dedicated defensive counter-air support for strike and support aircraft operating over eastern Syria would take the burden off multi-role fighters that are already heavily tasked fighting the anti-ISIS campaigns over Iraq and Syria. The presence of these aircraft over coalition-controlled Syrian territory would also act as a deterrent of sorts to any Syrian or Russian aircraft that seek to meddle in coalition operations Armed-up Su-35S stationed at Russia’s airbase south of Latakia Syria. The Su-35S is Russia’s most capable operation fighter. , AP Maybe one last thing to consider is that this shoot-down, and the mess that has followed, could have been avoided if the US neutered Assad’s air power in full instead of executing a token cruise missile attack on Shayrat air base alone last April. That attack was largely ineffective and counterproductive, and didn’t even put the base—one of the SyAF’s primary Su-22 operating installations—out of commission once and for all. In fact, it didn’t even destroy all the aircraft based there. Su-22s were flying sorties from the installation’s intact runway just hours after the much-touted strikes occurred. Assad still has his air force doing his bidding, and now that same air force is under the protective umbrella of the Russian military. So now if you want to take out Assad’s aerial war fighting capabilities, you have to attack Russia in the process. With this in mind, don’t expect Assad’s air force to stop being a menace anytime soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",US Downs Second Armed Iranian Drone As Tehran Warns Of More Missile Strikes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday’s barrage of ballistic missiles on Islamic State affiliated targets in Deir ez-Zor Syria has reverberated throughout the region and the world. As we stated shortly after the strike, Tehran’s unprecedented use of ballistic missiles was based on multiple factors, and sending a message to the US, Arab gulf states and Israel was clearly one of them. Now Iran is saying more ballistic strikes could come at any time. Iran used some of its most modern missiles in the operation. Six solid-fuel Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles were fired at Syria. Accounts vary, but some sources state the attack failed in a tactical sense, with only one missile hitting its intended target. Iran claims 360 militants died in the strikes, while Israeli sources say three of the missiles didn’t even make it to Syria at all. Iran’s FARS news agency quotes a IRGC statement, which declares: “The Takfiri terrorists’ command center, concentration points and logistical centers used for assembling cars for suicide attacks in Deir Ezzur region in Eastern Syria came under attack by the IRGC moments ago in a move to punish the terrorists for the twin attacks on the Iranian parliament and the holy shrine of the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, on June 7… A number of mid-range ground-to-ground missiles fired from the IRGC Aerospace Force bases in Kermanshah and Kurdistan provinces targeted the Takfiri terrorists in this operation and struck them with lethal and crushing blows… A large number of Takfiri terrorists have been killed and their equipment, systems and weapons have been destroyed.” Iran has subsequently warned of follow-on strikes as well, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) General Ramazon Sharif saying “If they carry out a specific action to violate our security, definitely there will be more launches, with intensified strength.” At the same time, a formal statement from the IRGC more “colorfully” conveys a similar warning: “The IRGC warns the Takfiri terrorists and their regional and trans-regional supporters that they would be engulfed by its revolutionary wrath and flames of the fire of its revenge in case they repeat any such devilish and dirty move in future.” Regardless of if the missiles destroyed anything of substance or not, as a strategic act, the missile barrage worked on multiple levels. This includes supplying a domestically consumable revenge action for the terror attacks on Iran’s parliament earlier in the month, and to stoke fear in Iran’s Sunni-Arab gulf state foes, not to mention its archenemies, Israel and the US. The IRGC General made these intentions clear, stating: “the Saudis and Americans are especially receivers of this message… Obviously and clearly, some reactionary countries of the region, especially Saudi Arabia, had announced that they are trying to bring insecurity into Iran.” The tension between the Saudis and the Iranians have only grown in recent hours as a bizarre incident involving the two foes has unfolded in the Marjan offshore oilfields in the Persian Gulf. The sensitive Saudi Arabian energy site was supposedly infiltrated by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commandos—at least according to Saudi Arabia. Three boats were detected by Saudi maritime security forces entering the vicinity of the oil fields and were fired upon on Friday night after they would not stop. One of the boats was intercepted but the other two got away. Onboard the captured vessel were three men that Saudi Arabia claims are elite Iranian commandos with the mission of attacking the oilfields in a clandestine “terror” operation. The Saudis say the boat was also laden with weaponry used for such an operation. Iran says the Saudis opened fire without warning on Iranian fishing vessels operating peacefully in the area, killing one man onboard. Iran does acknowledge the possibility that they may have drifted unknowingly into Saudi waters but says they were never warned or had a chance to be redirected away from the area. Iran says they are investigating the incident. Then just today, yet another Iranian Shahed-129 armed drone was shot down as it advanced toward the coalition-backed rebel outpost of At Tanf, near the southern Syrian border. Just as before , a USAF F-15E blasted the drone out of the sky. The base has been the focus of repeated assaults in the last month, with waves of Iranian-backed Shiite militia fighters advancing down the highway that leads to the base, before air power sends them scattering or kills them and destroys their vehicles. The shoot down comes just a day after a US Navy Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22, sending diplomatic shockwaves around the globe. It is also the third US air-to-air kill over Syria in just a week. Clearly, the skies over the embattled country are becoming far more hostile than they had been over the past six years of the conflict. US combat aircraft have been repositioned due to the increased tensions with Russia following the shoot-down, and the Australian Air Force has ceased operations over Syria due to similar concerns. In a semi-related report, a Pakistani JF-17 fighter also shot down an Iranian Shahed-129 drone today near Balochistan, nearly 30 miles from Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. It is unclear what the drone was doing there, although the area is a known hornets nest of extremism, but it was the first kill for the primarily Chinese-built light fighter. The presence of an Iranian drone over the largely autonomous region of Pakistan is yet another sign that Iran has entered a new, and far more advanced phase of its expeditionary drone operations. The base at At Tanf, which is frequented by coalition special operations units, has received a major defensive upgrade in recent days, with the HiMARS guided rocke t artillery system being deployed there from its previous base in northern Jordan. This weapon is ideally suited for laying waste to an advancing force charging down a bottleneck like a highway. HiMARS can reach out over 50 miles with its M30/31 GPS guided artillery rockets which can pack area sub munitions or a unitary warheads. The presence of the system near At Tanf also puts any enemy camps or forward operating bases at risk within a 50 plus mile circle. HIMARS has been one of the technological stars of the anti-ISIS fight, having proved its value time and time again in Northern Iraq. All this points to a collision course between Iran and the US and its regional allies. A tit-for-tat exchange between say Saudi Arabia and Iran could rapidly turn into a full blown conflict in the Persian Gulf. The Trump administration has chosen to take a hard line with Tehran, and new sanctions placed on the country as a result of its ongoing missile development programs will be highly unwelcome considering the country is just pulling out of the economic turmoil it was in as a result of the pre-nuclear deal multi-national sanction regime it lived under for years. In addition, now that Iran has proven itself willing to employ its elaborate and well hidden arsenal of ballistic missiles, the hair trigger the region is already on has gotten even lighter. Complicating things even further is Iran’s drive to explore new strategic relationships with very powerful allies. Just this week, Iran is exercising with the Chinese Navy in and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz. These are no small-time drills either, China dispatched a pair of surface combatants, a logistical ship and air assets to Iranian waters for the exercise. The drills stand as yet another message to the US and its allies in the region, one that underlines Iran’s changing role in the world and its ability to form troubling new military alliances.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 1, 2017",Lockheed Unveils New Super Versatile Special Operations C-130 Variant,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The C-130’s legacy as the do everything air hauler is well cemented into the annals of aviation and military history. But over 60 years after it first flew, the iconic design just keeps getting better. Today it’s all about multirole platforms, where one aircraft can execute many different missions. For much of its life, the USAF has fielded tricked-out special operations variants of the mighty Hercules, and in recent years, bolt-on systems have given the most mild-mannered Hercules incredible new capabilities—from surveillance to close air support. Now Lockheed is rolling all the modular versatility it can into a single exportable special operations configured Hercules model, dubbed the C-130J-SOF. The idea behind the new variant is to build in many of the special operations qualities that have been honed over decades of primarily American spec ops C-130 operations and production, into a single design that can be exported to friendly air arms around the globe. These include not only elements of special operations tanker, transport, and combat search and rescue Hercules, but also some aspects of the AC-130 gunship and the USMC’s “Harvest Hawk” modular kit that turns their KC-130Js into missile slinging and sensor wielding light air support and reconnaissance aircraft. Lockheed says the C-130J-SOF alone can execute airdrop, resupply, combat search and rescue and infiltration and exfiltration missions. In addition, it can act as a tanker for other aircraft in the air and on the ground, and also execute psychological and humanitarian relief operations. The new variant can also work as an airborne sensor platform, providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of many types. Being able to work as a tactical airborne command post is also a given. The icing on the cake though is the C-130J-SOF’s ability to turn into an airborne death machine by strapping on a 30mm to its rear-paratrooper door, as well as Hellfire and other missiles to its wing pylons. So basically it can be converted into a gunship for armed overwatch, armed reconnaissance and close air support missions. In the past, separate aircraft were required to do many of these missions, and although third party roll-on, roll-off and bolt-on systems exist for turning a C-130 into everything from an electronic warfare and communications relay platform to a refueling aircraft, they weren’t all integrated by the OEM into such a tight and comprehensive package. Also, by buying such a versatile machine from the manufacturer, systems and weapons integration costs that would have crushed smaller air force’s budgets can be avoided. This is really the “Leatherman multitool” of combat aircraft if there ever were one. The C-130J-SOF will likely have a wide array of extra options, like the latest in defensive countermeasures, satellite and line-of-sight communications, as well as specialized sensors, like multiple forward looking infrared (FLIR) systems and terrain following radar. Also a night vision compatible cockpit, and additional armor will likely be fitted, not to mention enhanced power generation capabilities needed to run all the aircraft’s extra electricity-hungry subsystems. Lockheed expects to produce between 100 and 200 of these variants for allied countries around the globe, with a price starting at about $80 million—roughly ten million more than the C-130J’s “base model” price tag. That is a lot of highly relevant capability and versatility that can be had for the price of a single modern strike fighter. Lockheed told reporters the aircraft could be delivered in as soon as 36 months. At its core, the aircraft will be able to accomplish mundane transport duties and bring hose and drogue aerial refueling capability to countries that don’t have it in their weapons portfolio today, as well as all its other capabilities. For wealthier nations that are F-35 customers or are potential F-35 customers in the future, the C-130J-SOF could be the perfect pairing with the stealth fighter. Forward operations from austere locations is becoming a key tenet of America’s stealth fighter playbook, and those operations will depend on the “fat cow” like forward-arming and refueling point capabilities of special ops C-130s or Marine KC-130s. F-35B refuels via KC-130 in Japan. , USMC By purchasing F-35s along with a handful of C-130J-SOFs, a country can drastically increase their tactical unpredictability, and in some cases the survivability of some of their most expensive air combat assets. Above all else, they can extend the reach of their new stealth fighters. The F-35Bs in particular is very well suited for this type of mission set and could also use the Hercules as an aerial tanker. But either F-35 version can operate with this new Hercules derivative jointly for special operations and pilot recovery missions. For countries in the Middle East and Asia, the ability to convert the aircraft into a precision fire and surveillance support platform makes it a very attractive tool for confronting everything from border security issues, to anti-terrorism operations, to keeping enemy swarming small boats at bay. Even NATO countries are looking for just this type of solution, but cannot justify buying highly expensive and purpose-built AC-130 gunships. France in particular seems to be in the market for such a weapon system. The C-130J-SOF joins the new civilian model of the C-130J—the LM-100J—as new C-130 offerings drawing big attention at this year’s Paris Air Show. Long live the mighty Hercules.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though there are few details at present, a U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk drone has crashed into the Inyo National Forest in California. The accident appears to have touched off a forest fire in the process and local and federal authorities are reportedly already on the scene . Officials at Edwards Air Force Base in California confirmed to local news outlets that the large high altitude, long endurance unmanned aircraft crashed during a routine transit from Beale Air Force Base more than 350 miles to the northwest. Inyo National Forest is roughly 200 miles north of Edwards, not in a straight line from Beale. Though there are no information on the circumstances of the mishap so far, this might mean aircraft was following an elongated flight path over less populated areas or had lost contact with its ground control station and flew off course. As yet, there are no reports of any injuries or fatalities on the ground. Beale Air Force base is home to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, which operates both RQ-4s and manned U-2 spy planes . It also hosts the U.S. Air Force Reserve’s 13th Reconnaissance Squadron, a unit that flies Global Hawks that is technically part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve’s 926th Wing at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. There is no indication yet what unit was controlling the drone at the time of the crash. With a wingspan of more than 130 feet, roughly the same as a 737 airliner, the RQ-4 is the the Air Force’s largest drone. The Air Force has more than 30 RQ-4 surveillance drones, as well as three EQ-4s fitted with Northrop Grumman’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), which acts as a communications hub and relay allowing various other types of aircraft to talk to each other and share information. However, all of the EQ-4 aircraft are assigned to the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing based at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and would not have been involved in this incident. USAF Late last fall, a TU-2S Dragon Lady that also belonged to Beale, AFB crashed in central California , killing one of its pilots. The cause of the crash was found to be pilot error . The Global Hawk leverages a semi-autonomous control concept, whereby there is no pilot—remote or otherwise—”flying” the aircraft. Instead, controllers direct the aircraft and its sensors via a desktop-like point and click interface.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After eight months of terrible horrors and incredible bravery, the end game is upon ISIS in Mosul. As Iraqi security forces tighten the noose around Old Town—the last few districts they have not brought under their control—the final remnants of the terror group’s dastardly operation within the sprawling Iraqi metropolis is self destructing, both literally and figuratively. There has been no greater symbol of the Islamic State’s presence in Mosul than the Great Mosque of al Nuri. It is here where the Islamic State’s villain supreme, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, defiantly declared his Caliphate in 2014 after blitzing across western Syria and much of Iraq. It was the terror kingpin’s most high profile, and one of his only public appearances, and it was the beginning of a living hell for Mosul, the region, and beyond. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi declaring himself the leader of an Islamic Caliphate at the al Nuri Mosque in Mosul and calling on muslims around the globe to join his dark sect., AP Since then the dark flag of the Islamic State has flown high atop the ancient Mosque’s iconic leaning minaret—a symbol of oppression and control for all to see. That is until yesterday. Iraqi security forces have long seen the Mosque’s Minaret as a beacon of hope—a goal just on the horizon that once reached would mean the final liberation of Mosul as a whole. Where it all started is where it would also end so to speak. But as Iraqi counter-terror forces, both haggard and hardened from months of brutal close quarter fighting throughout the city, finally approached within just 50 yards of the mosque, Islamic State fighters detonated explosives that transformed the ancient structures into a cloud of smoke and rubble. The al Nuri Mosque wasn’t always such a ominous icon, it has stood as a beloved staple of the ancient city’s skyline for a whopping 800 years. The big learning minaret is locally known as the Hunchback, or “Al-Hadba.” Times of Israel describes the ancient structure as such: The “Hadba” was completed in 1172 and had distinctive ornamental bands of brickwork wrapping around its cylindrical shaft. It started listing centuries ago and has long been considered an endangered monument. The minaret, with its unmistakeable shape, was the symbol of the city and featured in many local shops signs and advertisements. It gave its name to countless restaurants, companies and sports clubs. When IS imposed its tyrannic brand of sharia, or Islamic law, in the early stages of its “caliphate,” it destroyed several key heritage sites in Mosul, including the main museum and shrines to Jonah and Seth. It reportedly rigged the “Hadba,” which it sees as the subject of a cult that transgresses its own regressive and ultra-conservative brand of Islam, but had been prevented from blowing it up by the local population. The learning minaret of the Great Mosque of al Nuri has been a beacon of hope that represents an end game for Iraqi security forces. Each step they got closer to it, the closer they were to ending the Islamic State’s hold on Mosul once and for all. , AP In June of 2014 the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization had started work with the local government to stabilize and save the tilting minaret. Just a few days later, Mosul was sacked in a surprise offensive by swarming Islamic State fighters. It really isn’t that surprising that Islamic State fighters destroyed the site—pulling off one last miserable deed against the culture and people of Mosul—they have done the same to countless antiquities and historic sites across the territory it has controlled. When it comes to this site though, it seems more of a case of “if we can’t have it nobody can.” In the end many thought the chances of saving the mosque were slim at best. Lieutenant General Abdulwahab al-Saadi of Iraq’s elite counter-terrorism forces gives his insight as to how the loss of the mosque was probably inevitable: “The mosque has some symbolism for the terrorist gangs, being the mosque where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gave his first sermon… Perhaps they won’t want to leave this place that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took to the security forces and maybe they’ll send a message accusing Iraqi units of of destroying them.” 800 years of history and and a beloved historic landmark gone with a click of detonator and the twitch of an evil hand. Below is a map showing all that is left for Iraqi forces, many of which have done an outstanding job under horrific conditions, to take back until Mosul can be declared liberated. Keep in mind that the entire east side of the city, which was liberated first, is not shown in this map. The end to this dark note in Iraq’s history could come any day now. Although the liberation of Mosul would mean that ISIS would no longer hold any major population centers in Iraq, and its claim as a quasi theocratic-governmental entity in country would be shredded, the terror group is still highly active with cells throughout Iraq. Combined Joint Task Force Inherent Resolve’s official statement on the Mosque’s sad fate. , CJTFOIR Still, Iraqi security forces, with the help of its US-led coalition partners , as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shiite militias, and other factions both internal and external, have accomplished something fairly amazing in Mosul. Above all else, they have finally proven that they can and will stand and fight against a common foe. Now when that common foe no longer poses and existential threat to the country, that is where the future of Iraq becomes more murky and and geninunly concerning.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 25, 2017",Navy’s New SM-3 Block IIA Ballistic Missile Interceptor Fails In Live Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The much anticipated SM-3 Block IIA interceptor has failed during a test engagement over the Pacific. This was the fourth flight of the SM-3 Block IIA, and the second intercept attempt, the first occurring last February and was deemed a success. The failure comes as the Missile Defense Agency has been riding high following a very high profile and successful ICBM intercept test by their ground-based missile defense interceptor. A statement from the MDA reads: “The U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Japan Ministry of Defense conducted a development flight test today of a new Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile off the coast of Hawaii. A planned intercept was not achieved. The SM-3 Block IIA is being developed cooperatively by the U.S. and Japan to defeat medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. This is a new, developmental interceptor that is not yet fielded by either country. At approximately 7:20 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time, June 21 (1:20 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, June 22), a medium-range ballistic target missile was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Kauai, Hawaii. The USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) detected and tracked the target missile with its onboard AN/SPY-1 radar using the Aegis Baseline 9.C2 weapon system. Upon acquiring and tracking the target, the ship launched an SM-3 Block IIA guided missile, but the missile did not intercept the target. Program officials will conduct an extensive analysis of the test data. Until that review is complete, no additional details will be available.” The SM-3 Block IIA features a variety of upgrades over the Block II version including a larger, more maneuverable exoatmospheric kill vehicle with longer endurance and an upgraded infrared targeting system with enhanced target discrimination abilities (being able to pinpoint the warhead among debris and decoys). Physically speaking, the SM-3 Block IIA is really new missile, with a thicker diameter along its entire mold-line compared to its predecessors. This allows it to carry more fuel, thus offering higher fly-out speeds and more range. When combined, these capabilities should give the SM-3 Block IIA a wider significantly engagement envelope and a better probability of kill against the targets its fired at. Raytheon The missile was primarily designed to take on up to intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) threats, but it could possibly be used against ICBMs under certain conditions sometime in the future. Still, testing so far has been against far shorter-ranged ballistic missiles. Another big element of the SM-3 Block IIA is that it is a cooperative program between Japan and the US. The idea behind this risk sharing arrangement is that once operational, the missile will equip Japan’s Aegis BMD capable destroyers and possibly Aegis ashore installations in Japan itself. This is in addition to being provided to the US Aegis BMD capable surface combatants and Aegis Ashore batteries in Eastern Europe. MDA Still, even after years of testing and the operational deployment of multiple types of missile interceptors on the ground and at sea, a ballistic missile defense “shield” so to speak remains elusive . Not only are the missiles’ reliability questionable, but so is the globally distributed infrastructure of sensors and data links that supports them. Additionally, it is widely known that there is a shortage of actual interceptors, with Navy surface combatants having to swap inventories at sea to fill empty vertical launch cells when leaving and arriving on station. Even Ground Based Interceptors are just a few dozen in number, and multiple salvos of multiple missiles will be fired at a real target in an operational engagement. That, and the fact that many of the missiles are down for upgrades, servicing or other modifications at any given time, gives a picture more of ballistic defense screen as much as anything else. This may be adequate for now, but as states like North Korea and Iran continue to develop and bolster their missile arsenals, more missile defense capacity will be needed, not less. So far the Navy’s hit-to-kill interceptor record stands at 27 kills out of 35 attempts since the program began back in 2000. This number is largely misleading though because many of these intercepts occurred under tight, laboratory like conditions, not ones that representative of an operational use. List does not include today’s failed launch. , MDA Still, Aegis-based BMD remains among the more promising and relevant BMD solutions around, and today’s failure will be deeply analyzed and changes will be made to the next SM-3 Block IIA iteration to try and correct any errors and improve the system overall. Maybe above all else, the SM-3 Block IIA’s larger rocket section is most exciting as it “maxes out” the Mark 41 vertical launch system’s cell dimensions and could be paired with other payloads and warheads. Some of which may feature entirely different concepts—such as using it as a base for a long-range prompt strike application or to carry an interceptor capable of swatting down hypersonic weapons blazing through the earth’s upper atmosphere. MDA Considering how ballistic missile threats are becoming a much more tangible reality and making headlines regularly these days, the Trump Administrations 2018 defense budget does not include drastic increases in ballistic missile defense spending. This is something that has rattled many lawmakers on Capitol Hill and was the focus of numerous armed services committee members questions over the last two weeks. Increasing foreign demand for these types of defensive systems and cooperative development may help some when it comes to accelerating ballistic missile defense development, more resources from the US Federal Government will be needed as well. The bottomline is that hit-to-kill ballistic missile defense still has a ways to go to prove itself as truly reliable, and it will take more time and money to get to such a point. And while other systems and concepts, some of them quite exotic , may show promise, the highly deployable Aegis-based layered BMD concept is probably the best investment the Missile Defense Agency can make at this time.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A tornado ripped through Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, home of Strategic Command, last Friday during heavy weather, which resulted in two of America’s four E-4B National Airborne Operations Centers being damaged. According to sources at Global Strike Command, both of the highly modified 747-200s were pulled into hangars on the base in advance of the storm, although their tails were left sticking out as the hangars were not designed to accommodate an entire 747 (most aren’t). When the F1 tornado struck, its gusts pounded on their tails, turning them into giant levers of sorts, shifting the 747s inside. The level of damage is being evaluated by the USAF and a team from Boeing and we don’t know yet how bad it is, although it likely isn’t superficial considering the circumstances. E-4B taking off at Offutt AFB., USAF The other two E-4Bs were not at Offutt AFB, also their their home base, at the time. One was on duty somewhere while another was undergoing deep maintenance at Boeing’s depot in San Antonio, Texas. So one of the aircraft is still available to perform the NAOC mission. The E-4Bs have gone through a series of upgrades in recent years, extending their life and utility for the USAF. The aircraft are not only called upon to fly the National Command Authorities aloft during a major crisis , but they are also made available to FEMA during natural disasters to work as a central command post and communications relay platform. The E-4Bs also are used to fly the Secretary of Defense and their staff, as well as press, on overseas trips and to shadow Air Force One when the President is overseas. According to our contacts at Global Strike Command, the E-4B’s mission is not impacted at the moment as one aircraft is still available. The Navy’s 16 E-6B Mercury aircraft are also capable of many of the same critical functions as the E-4B, albeit without the accommodations for a large NCA staff. E-4B partially inside a hangar at Offutt AFB., USAF If the aircraft are very badly damaged it is uncertain if the USAF will repair them due to their old age and increasingly expensive operating cost—which was said to be a whopping $163,485 per hour in 2013 —only second to the similar VC-25A, often referred to by its callsign when the President is onboard—Air Force One. Also, the USAF is now looking to replace these aircraft, with a program spooling up to do just that—a story we will post soon here on The War Zone. Other aircraft at the base suffered damage as well, including eight of the USAF precious RC-135 fleet. Six out of the eight RC-135s affected have been returned to flight status already, but one of them is said to be badly damaged. There was also seven to ten million dollars in damage done to the base and its surrounding infrastructure. The news comes at the end of a terrible week for USAF equipment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 26, 2017","F-16D Belonging To The USAF Thunderbirds Crashes In Dayton, Ohio (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain scarce but a USAF Thunderbirds F-16 has been involved with a mishap while on location in Dayton, Ohio. The aircraft involved was supposedly one of the team’s Block 52 F-16Ds which are used for media flights, camera ships, and as spares/stand-ins for the team’s six-ship demonstration. Supposedly the aircraft had landed and a gust of wind affected it in some way, leaving it turned over off the airport’s movement areas. The weather was supposedly very poor at the time of the incident with local  CBS affiliate WHIO stating there was “heavy rain in the area at that time. Rainfall rates in the vicinity exceeding two inches per hour.” Strong winds were also said to be present at the time of the crash. There seems to have been a pilot and someone else onboard at the time of the crash, and reports are conflicting at this time as to their condition and whether or not they are trapped inside the aircraft or not. There is no reports of any deaths at this time thankfully. The crash comes just over a year after another Thunderbird F-16C crashed just before landing in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and less than two days after another F-16 crashed during takeoff from Ellington Field in Texas. Both incidents saw the pilot safely eject, and the case of the Ellington Field incident, the Block 52 F-16C remained almost totally intact sitting off the runway. The jet was fully armed at the time for the air sovereignty mission and the airport had to be evacuated due to concerns over the weaponry. On Tuesday there was also the crash of yet another USAF asset, this one being a RQ-4 Global Hawk drone that was on its way from Edwards AFB to Beale AFB. UPDATE: 11am PST- As you can see in this screencap from WHIO’s livestream , the jet is totally upside down and laying on its spine. WHIO Livestream Screencap Reports are that at least one of the crew is unpinned and heading to the hospital, possibly the second as well. Waiting for confirmation, fingers crossed. UPDATE: 11:30am PST- They are cutting away the canopy to get the pilot out according to an on-site source. At this time it seems as if they are in fair condition and working with responders to exit the stricken jet. UPDATE: 11:43am PST- Dayton Daily News has reported that the second occupant has been removed from the F-16. This is great news. Awaiting updates on their conditions. Thunderbirds say this was a familiarization flight, so no guests onboard. Here is a close up of the scene. Looks like the aircraft flipped over relatively cleanly, the engine appears to not have ingested any major debris and the wing nor the tail stopped it from going fully upside down.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Pentagon May Replace Its Doomsday Planes And “Air Force Two” With One New Type,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is setting its sights on replacing its aging fleet of four E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) aircraft once and for all, as well as its fleet of six C-32As that commonly carry the Vice President around under the callsign “Air Force Two,” as well as other high-level officials and diplomats. In President Trump’s new budget, six million dollars is set aside to start a program office for the new Air Force Two replacement project, with its primary task to begin studying what airframe could fulfill the mission as well as possibly others. A similar program is also in place to examine how the E-4B’s mission and the E-6B Mercury’s mission can be consolidated into a single aircraft, and using one common platform to replace all three aircraft seems not just possible, but probable. C-32A., USAF With commonality in mind, procuring a single type of jet to replace both the E-4B and the C-32A aircraft will likely mean a larger aircraft for the C-32 community and a smaller aircraft for the E-4B community. In the past, even larger aircraft than the 747 have been pitched to take on the E-4B’s mission, but today, as electronics and communications systems have shrunk drastically in size and weight, a smaller aircraft can and should be used. Although they largely fill disparate roles, both the E-4B and the C-32A are key components within the U.S. Government’s continuity of government and executive command and control capabilities. As such, they would carry some common systems, including certain communications arrays and control interfaces, as well as enhanced power generation and defensive countermeasures suites. Both aircraft would also be hardened against electromagnetic pulses that are created by the detonation of nuclear warheads. Clearly, by using one aircraft for both missions, huge sums of money can be saved in development costs, not to mention procurement costs down the road. The E-4Bs date back to the mid 1970s, and the airframes are based on the 747-200—the second iteration of the first generation of the iconic jumbo jet that, along with its 747-100 predecessor, have largely disappeared from the skies due to their high operating costs and maintenance demands. The C-32As are far fresher airframes, being procured in the later 1990s and early 2000s, and are receiving a mid-life update now, which includes a new interior, upgraded communications , and enhanced cockpit features like a heads-up display and enhanced vision system. But still, these aircraft are considered middle aged, and have had their share of high-profile breakdowns in recent years. E-4B taking off from Offutt AFB., USAF The initiative to begin studying how to pare down the E-4B NAOC and E-6B Mercury’s mission sets into a single airframe, dubbed the Survivable Airborne Operations Center, will likely lead to the E-4B replacement aircraft also replacing the E-6B down the road.  Doing so makes sense as so much of both aircraft’s capabilities overlap with one another. As of now, the E-4B mission focuses on being ready to take the National Command Authorities, primarily the President and the Secretary of Defense, aloft during a major military crisis, and allowing them to control America’s military forces, and especially its nuclear triad from on high. The jet also serves as a rapidly deployable command post and communications relay system for FEMA as well as working as the Defense Secretary’s chariot when traveling abroad. The E-6B fleet can, to a lesser degree, also accommodate the National Command Authorities and help during a national disaster, although it is primarily tasked with the Looking Glass and Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) missions, both of which involve the release of America’s nuclear arsenal. The E-4B is capable of some of these functions as well, so you can see why having two systems really is far from ideal. Recently upgraded E-6B. The type were among the last 707s off the production line. , USAF Tasking and fleet management is also an issue, as the E-4Bs are limited in number with just four in inventory. One of which is usually in depot maintenance, and another sitting alert. So that leaves two airframes to spare for other missions like hauling the Defense Secretary overseas. And considering these aircraft also need a lot of regular care, sometimes the two extra aircraft aren’t available for operations at all. The E-6Bs are newer airframes than the E-4Bs, being fielded in the early 1990s. They were the last Boeing 707 derivatives delivered, so while newer, it’s not exactly as if the jets were state-of-the-art when they entered service. Still, there is considerable life left in the Navy’s 16 jet strong E-6B fleet, so it is likely that the DoD will move to replace the E-4B fleet, which are among the very most expensive aircraft in the Pentagon’s inventory to operate, first. Then this same aircraft configuration will slowly replace the E-6Bs probably the late 2020s through the 2030s as the Navy has stated that the type is cleared to fly that long if it continues to receive upgrades. E-4B refueling from a KC-135R tanker., USAF In essence, what we are talking about here is likely one airframe type that will replace three separate aircraft—the C-32A, E-4B and eventually the E-6B. So what will that airframe be? At this time, it seems like a derivative of the KC-46 Pegasus seems most likely. The aircraft size sits directly between the C-32, E-6B and the E-4B, and it will already be in the Pentagon’s inventory in large numbers. Additionally, the KC-46 is already militarized and features much of the same hardened infrastructure that a E-4B, E-6B and C-32A replacement would need to accomplish their missions. The fact that the 767 is an older design compared to say the 787 may trouble some, but there would be a lot of development risk in militarizing the 787, and especially in adapting it to a critical role like those that pertain to continuity of government, command and control and nuclear weapons release missions. In other words, converting the 787, with its new sub-systems and construction materials, over to a “doomsday plane” would take a lot of time and money. KC-46 undergoing testing in the massive anechoic chamber at Edwards AFB. Much more goes into militarizing a commercial aircraft than most would think. , USAF At first glance, the new stretched 737MAX 10 could also possibly be a lower-cost contender, although it is highly doubtful that the USAF and the other powers involved would step down in size from the 757, especially when it comes to the the C-32A and E-4B replacements. According to Defenseone.com , the USAF’s budget request for the C-32A replacement program pretty much defines a KC-46 derivative over a smaller aircraft like one from the 737 family, stating: “The C-32A recap aircraft would be a more robust aircraft that would mitigate many capability gaps that exist when the current C-32A aircraft serve as a backup to VC-25A… The C-32A replacement aircraft would have increased range, passenger capacity, enhanced senior leader communications and a private work space.” Another option would be the 777, although that would be a much larger aircraft than the C-32A and the E-6B. Additionally, the 777 is not in the USAF’s inventory, and has never been militarized before. Its ability to operate from shorter fields may also be an issue and It would also require a whole new Pentagon logistics chain. This is counter-intuitive to the USAF’s goal of pairing down its types in service, not the other way around. It is worth noting that the timeline for fielding a E-4B replacement could be sped up following the damage done to two E-4B’s at Offutt AFB when a tornado touched down there on June 16th, 2017. Boeing and the USAF are examining the aircraft to ascertain their level of damage, but if it is deemed that those aircraft are too expensive to repair, especially considering their age, the search for a replacement could be drastically accelerated. There is also the case to be made, depending on the damage, that those storm stricken jets could be used as spare parts donors to help prop up the readiness and reduce the cost of operating the remaining two E-4Bs as well as the aging VC-25 fleet—all of which are based on the 747-200 platform. E-4B sitting alert., USAF The missions the C-32A, E-4B and E-6B provide are all critical, and although it may be sad seeing these unique aircraft go—especially the hump-backed E-4B—it makes total sense to use a common replacement platform for all three. In a pinch, a consolidated fleet of “E-46s” capable of the NAOC, TACAMO, Looking Glass, FEMA emergency support, and Secretary of Defense transport missions could even stand in to transport other high-ranking officials, including the Vice President in a pinch. But with a new fleet of “VC-46s” that likely wouldn’t be necessary. A small fleet of VC-46s could also take the operational load off the primary aircraft that provide the Presidential airlift “Air Force One” mission today, once again the two VC-25As that are supposedly approaching the end of their service lives. Even with the USAF ordering new 747-8i based aircraft for this mission, the President could use the smaller VC-46, which would still be quite larger than the existing C-32A, when traveling domestically. Currently the President only uses the C-32A when operating out of airports that cannot support 747s or when a VC-25A is not available, which is rare. We have gone in depth about this and other issues surround the highly publicized Air Force One replacement program before, but suffice it to say, a widebody replacement for the C-32A could allow the White House to change the way the President travels, and likely save money in the process.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The wreckage of Thunderbird #8, a Block 52 F-16D that served as the advance jet for the team, was hauled away before the Dayton International Air Show opened its gates on Saturday. Video of the jet atop a flatbed trailer shows just how bad the damage to the aircraft is. The entire front cockpit section has been detached and half the tail surface has been sheered off among other damage. Details remain somewhat limited about what caused the crash, but we do know that shortly after touching down in a squall that hit Dayton International Airport, the F-16D piloted by first year team member and former A-10 pilot Captain Erik Gonsalves, with team crew chief Staff Seargent Kenneth Cordova in the back, flipped completely upside down, pinning both in aircraft’s cockpit. It took hours to remove the men, with fire crews having to saw into the jet to get them out. The front cockpit was totally detached from the rear cockpit., Facebook Screencap Thankfully both men made it out alive, and Cordova has already been released from the hospital, although Gonsalves was still being cared for as of yesterday. The Thunderbirds display at the air show was subsequently cancelled. Although nobody was hurt, the USAF lost two of its most capable F-16s last week, both Block 52 variants, one belonging to the Thunderbirds and the other belonging to the 125th Fighter Squadron, an Air National Guard unit out of Tulsa, Oklahoma. That jet crashed at Ellington Field, in Texas during takeoff. The pilot ejected safely and the armed jet skidded off the runway. The F-16 was in Houston as part of a NORAD air sovereignty alert detachment. Seeing as a large portion of America’s F-16 inventory is now slated to serve well into the middle part of the century, continuous losses of the cream of the Viper fleet are troubling to say the least. Overall, the week was a terrible one for USAF equipment, as it also included the loss of a RQ-4 Global Hawk and two of the USAF’s prized E-4B National Airborne Operations Center aircraft were damaged in a tornado that touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. The rest of the Dayton International Air Show, which included a Super Hornet demo and a heritage flight with the USAF’s newest jet, the F-35A, went off without issue. We will stay on the story and let you know more about the cause of the crash as the investigation unfolds.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just hours after new, albeit somewhat fragmented threats from the Trump Administration warning of more strikes on the Assad regime hit headlines, the embattled Syrian strongman himself popped up at the one place in Syria where his safety is virtually guaranteed—Russia’s Hmeimim air base south of the port city of Latakia. Assad visited his Russian backers’ outpost—which Moscow has an indefinite lease on—checking out different vehicles and technologies on display, and reviewing Russia’s air operations over his tattered country. He was joined by Russia’s Army Chief of Staff, General Valery Gerasimov for the tour. We have a fascinating gallery to share from the surprise VIP visit.

The type was supposedly passed over for T-15 Armata series, which makes its presence in Syria strange. Then again, Russia has exported a few of the AFVs and the country’s involvement in Syria has been a Russia arms showcase as much as anything else. Maybe Moscow intends to use the vehicle to fight against Syrian rebels and thus give it the badge of “combat tested” in the hopes of more export sales.

Even if the US went after regime targets, such as the palaces and hideouts used by Assad and his henchmen, in a full-on air campaign, America nor its allies will strike a Russian installation as doing so would pretty much be an invite to World War III. Not just that but Russia has said they now protect Assad’s western airspace, and his regime and military capability, with their own advanced air defense capabilities—which include S-300, S-400, and Pantsir-S1 ground-based air defense systems, as well as fighters. They have also said that they are going to rebuild Syria’s own dated air defenses with modern ones. As such, attacking Assad in a meaningful way will be far tougher and much more geopolitically perilous than befor e 59 Tomahawks were launched at Shayrat airfield in early April. Also in regards to the White House’s recent warning to Assad over further gas attacks, that threat was prompted via intelligence that said there were suspicious activities around a known nerve gas related hangar at the very same base the US supposedly struck “decisively” in April with roughly $80 million worth of missiles. This is just further proof that the largely token missile barrage did next to nothing to neuter Assad’s gas capabilities yet alone his military caabilities, and proves once again just how pointless and ineffective that whole largely made for TV operation really was. And now Assad knows to hide himself and his best gear under Russia’s umbrella should tensions escalate and another punitive US airstrike appear immanent.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Senators Are Finally Funding A Design Study For A New Light Aircraft Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes a sizable downstroke in what could turn into a program to finally build a smaller and less expensive aircraft carrier complement to America’s increasingly expensive supercarriers. The provision includes $30M to come up with preliminary designs and cost options for such a ship, which then can be used to quantify the concept and how it would fit into the Navy’s overall strategy. The newest supercarrier design, the Ford class, cost upwards of $12B per ship. Meanwhile the Trump Administration has mandated a 12 supercarrier force. Since the early retirement of the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), the Navy has struggled to meet tasking demands with the ten supercarriers it has in its inventory, and the USS Gerald R. Ford’s date of entry into operational service is a question mark due to technological issues and delays. With all these things in mind, the call for smaller, cheaper and more flexible aircraft carriers to add extra capacity to the Navy’s carrier force have grown louder in recent months. USS Gerald R. Ford next to the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. Notice the platform extensions on either side of the Ford’s fantail. The ugly structures  serve two purposes. First they increase the internal volume off the hangar deck, and second they provide extra area for new defensive gear, such as lasers, that could be installed over the ship’s 50 year lifespan., USN This has been one of the key ideas I have talked about and pushed for over the years (like here and here ), and it is a controversial topic to say the least. But clearly I am not alone when it comes to identifying a need to field smaller carriers and a more nimble aircraft carrier force than the Navy’s rigid, all supercarrier-based strategy that exists today. Most recently, I put this among the top of the list of things the Navy could do to revolutionize its war fighting capabilities in the piece Seven Revolutionary Hardware Changes The Navy Should Make In The Trump Era, stating : “The supercarrier still has its place in America’s arsenal, but naval aviation and naval warfare have changed since its genesis during the early decades of the Cold War. Since then, the supercarrier has become grossly expensive to construct, with the first of the new Ford class supercarrier costing roughly $13 billion, without research and development included. The second carrier in the class, the USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), is slated to cost roughly $11.5 billion . At the same time, the carrier air wing has shrunk from nearly 90 aircraft during the 1980s down to around 65. In addition, precision guided munitions have allowed one strike fighter to reliably take out multiple targets on a single mission, instead of an entire air wing going after a single strategic target or small set of targets in a single alpha strike in single day. With all this in mind, the Navy’s demand to build ever larger aircraft carriers is counter productive and may be unsustainable in the long term. Nuclear supercarriers are also extremely costly to operate, and their availability is based around a highly rigid and complex timetable. The recent carrier gap has proven just how little elasticity there is in America’s all supercarrier force. A mix of supercarriers and smaller carriers in the 65,000 ton class would allow for a more flexible overall aircraft carrier force , with greater strike capacity being able to be deployed on short notice….Under such a plan, supercarriers can also have their schedules better adjusted for concentrating on deployments and projecting power abroad, instead of executing more menial tasks like training new Naval Aviators or keeping up fleet aircrews’ carrier qualifications. The smaller carriers could be made available for these tasks, and would expand America’s ability to rapidly deploy naval power as need be along a far less rigid schedule.” That roughly 65,000 ton displacement size seems to be a consistent “sweet spot” for a newer smaller aircraft carrier class, sometimes referred to as the “CVL,” with multiple studies identifying it as the right compromise between capability and cost. A ship that size would offer a Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration like its bigger supercarrier brothers, but with two or three catapults instead of four. Size-wise, the notional design would be akin to something between the size of the USS Kitty Hawk on the high end the USS Midway on the lower end. Size comparison—the USS Constellation , the USS Coral Sea and the USS Tarawa tied up at North Island. , USN Sitting right in between those two iconic ships in terms of displacement, and a fresh, high-tech design that is readily available today, is the Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class , which displace roughly 70,000 tons. As we have discussed before , the basic ship design can be adapted to accommodate a CATOBAR operations concept. The US could license the design, saving billions in development costs while lowering risk, and achieving commonality with the centerpiece of its closest ally’s navy. Even forward deploying a carrier to the UK could become an affordable option. Rendering of the Queen Elizabeth class in CATOBAR configuration., BAE Systems Setting perfect logic aside, if the Navy really ends up getting a new smaller carrier class, they will likely demand a custom design of their own. And there is nothing to say that the ship will end up being in the 65,000 ton displacement range. The Navy could just bypass a new design altogether and optimize the existing America class amphibious assault ship design for their needs—removing existing spaces for land vehicles, command and control areas used for amphibious operations, and compartments for embarked Marines, and adding more hangar space, weapons storage areas and jet fuel reserves in their place. Going the America class route would require the Navy purchase the F-35B to be flown from these ships. The short-takeoff and vertical landing capable F-35B offers sizably less range and striking power than its CATOBAR capable F-35C brethren, but the convenience and economy of buying an all “off the shelf” smaller carrier solution, may trump these concerns. USN As we discussed before, the USMC has already studied loading the decks of their America class amphibs with nearly two dozen F-35Bs in the “Lightning Carrier” configuration. But with the aforementioned modifications to the ship’s design, such a concept could be more easily supported. Still, generating very high-tempo sustained sortie rates using a short-takeoff and vertical landing aircraft is not ideal compared to what can be achieved with a CATOBAR configured carrier, and the Navy will likely resist opening the door to STOVL F-35B operations as it could endanger their CATOBAR tradition and the more capable, albeit also more complex and expensive carriers that go along with it. Each America class ship has a unit cost of roughly $3.5B, and the billions in development costs for the new class have already been sunk. That means the Navy could buy roughly three modified America class carriers for the price of one Ford class supercarrier. But once again, it will have to outfit them with two squadrons of expensive F-35Bs to make the concept work. It may be possible for designers to drastically modify the America class design to include a pair of catapults and an angled deck for CATOBAR operations, but depending on how much money this would save instead of just designing an all new CATOBAR carrier from scratch, such an endeavor may not be worthwhile. Other aspects of the ship, such as its powerplant, would also have to upgraded in order to overcome the increased mass as a result of such a major design modification. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FhnUv5Axbuo Although the idea of the Navy building smaller carriers to complement their supercarrier force has been floating around for a long time, the timing may finally be right for such an initiative to blossom into a real program. The Trump Administration wants a 355 ship Navy , and replacing a couple of the planned Ford class ships with two or even three smaller carriers would help achieve this goal. Not just that, but the Navy is all about “distributing its fires” these days, and a hugely expensive supercarrier densely packed with a large portion of the Navy’s air armada doesn’t fit snugly into that strategy. Beyond being key in assessing how much different levels of the smaller carrier concept will cost to build as well as what capability each design will bring to the table, this study will likely attempt to answer the question of what form of propulsion should be used to power such a concept. A conventional fueled carrier would be far less costly to procure and result in a more flexible force that can execute surge operations without long lead times as compared to a nuclear powered design. But even with the winds blowing in the right direction for such a concept to take hold, the bigger question is will the Navy ever really buy into the idea of a conventionally fueled CATOBAR aircraft carrier? They hold onto their high-end nuclear weapon systems with a death grip—see their absolute unwillingness to field an advanced diesel-electric submarine as one glaringly stupid example. The massive Nimitz class USS Ronald Reagan during sea trials. Many are asking if the supercarrier has gotten too big, too expensive, too inflexible  and is too vulnerable for the Navy to continue to plow all its carrier funds into. , USN Then again, the Royal Navy is now providing something of a proof of concept for a smaller carrier design—one that runs on conventional fuel—for the Navy to evaluate. Considering the USMC is slated to operate its F-35Bs aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth , and that the US Navy and Royal Navy have incredibly tight ties, the Pentagon’s sea-going arm is going to get a close look at what a carrier roughly situated in size between the Ford class and the America class can accomplish. Not just in terms of what its air wing can do, but also in terms of operating such a ship with a crew that is just a fraction of the size of the ones found on a US Navy nuclear powered supercarrier. If the Navy brass likes what it sees it could finally get onboard with the smaller, conventionally powered aircraft carrier concept, even at the expense of slowing the rate at which the service buys new nuclear supercarriers. Now we’ll have to wait and see if this element within the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the 2018 NDAA makes it into law. If it does, we may be approaching a whole new and exciting phase in American carrier-borne naval aviation.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you read The War Zone regularly you are fully aware of our fascination with the legendary C-130 Hercules. The aircraft can be transformed to satisfy seemingly any logical application , and Lockheed continues to roll out new and highly relevant variants some 60 years after the first “Herky Bird” flew. Even the more exotic C-130 derivatives that were never built seem like totally logical evolutions of the C-130 concept in retrospect. But one capability that is anything but new for the super-versatile aerial hauler is operating from rough and austere airstrips. USAF Combat Controllers can deploy to pretty much anywhere with the space available to land a C-130. Once on station, they act as both an advance party to prep the field and as guides to call in the aircraft. When teamed with the hardy Hercules , their combined talents can make big things happen in the middle of nowhere. Case in point, this training exercise featured in the video below, where a USAF C-130J lands on what appears to be dry lakebed with the help of their Air Force Special Operations facilitators. The rugged nature of the C-130J is readily apparent when the entire aircraft becomes engulfed in a storm of blowing dust that is stirred up by its props laboring in reverse configuration. It is a spectacular piece of footage capturing the abilities of an equally spectacular aircraft. Operations like these are underway right now in places like eastern Syria and other clandestine locales, and they often occur under the darkness of night. The ability to deliver vehicles and supplies cargo to austere forward operating locations , and to be able to support the personnel stationed there in a sustained manner independent of vulnerable land routes, is a capability that is as relevant today as ever. With C-130 transportable precision artillery weapons like HiMARS, small and isolated units can pack a big precision punch and can support friendly forces via showering the enemy with precision fires from dozens of miles away without the need of aircraft overhead. Above all else, being able to access contested territory via tactical airlift on a grand scale is a capability that remains largely unique to the US armed forces, and the C-130 is an indispensable component of that prized capability.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 24, 2016",New Flight Ops Video From China’s Carrier Features Loaded Up J-15 Fighters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s aircraft carrier, the rebuilt Kuznetsov class Liaoning , and its battle group are prowling their way towards Southeast Asia ahead of a much anticipated inaugural and very high-profile visit to Hong Kong. The carrier’s port call, which will be yet another major symbol of China’s rapidly increasingly military and geopolitical might in the region, is part of the 20th anniversary celebration of the country’s reclaiming of the territory from the British Crown. The armada passed through the Taiwan Strait over the weekend, an operation that causes anxieties to soar in Taipei. Fighters and maritime patrol aircraft scrambled from the island to closely monitor the flotilla’s transit, and there have been no subsequent reports of any unexpected incidents occurring. Liaoning put up an aerial presence of its own sometime during its voyage south from its home in Qingdao. It left the port city on June 25th. A new video has been published containing a montage of footage showing the carrier and its battle group flexing its operational muscle during drills. The video includes some interesting clips, such as in-cockpit footage of J-15 fighter operations and Landing Signal Officers waving jets onto the boat. Even video of the ship’s arresting gear systems in action is featured, along with footage of the ship launching and recovering its contingent of aircraft, with armed J-15s fighters being the highlight. The big Su-33 clones are seen carrying a pair of PL-12 medium-range air-to-air missiles, along with a pair PL-8 short-range air-to-air missiles. This is also a common PLAAF loadout . Maybe most interestingly, some J-15s are sporting YJ-83K “Eagle Strike” anti-ship missiles under their wings. This is a semi-official Chinese website with great high-resolution photos of the drills shown in the video. The air-to-air weapons appear to be inert captive training rounds, not live missiles. The YJ-83Ks are also likely of the same flavor, although the red bands are interesting, as internationally red/orange bands usually means the weapon is live. The Chinese are also very aware of the fact any imagery they release will be poured over by foreign intelligence services, so maybe it is just a way to confuse analysts. Training to operate from the ship with loadouts that represent the two core mission sets of the air wing’s fighter cadre—air defense and naval strike—makes total sense. Much debate has occurred in military aviation circles about just what type of loadouts these big navalized Flanker derivatives can lug off the deck with a little help from a ski jump. It’s not worth re-litigating this issue here, but multiple factors go into keeping these jets within their operating envelopes during launch. These include how much fuel they are carrying, the wind speed over the deck, as well as their external payload configuration. What we see here is likely representative of J-15 combat operations while maintaining a relevant fuel load, give or take a couple air-to-air missiles. These configurations are also roughly similar in weight to the loadouts we saw on Russian Su-33s operating off the coast of Syria aboard the Kuznetsov late last year. Youtube Screencap The Liaoning’s visit to Hong Kong has become a e-ticket attraction for Hong Kong residents, with throngs of Hongkongers lining up, and some camping out in line to be able to get a ticket to tour the ship and three of her escorts. Reports state that just 2,000 tickets were going to be given out to the general public for the carrier’s historic visit, with another 1,600 being distributed to special persons and organizations. It is the first time the Liaoning has been opened up to large-scale public tours, or really any public access of any type. The Liaoning’s battle group is slated to be in Hong Kong from Friday to Tuesday. The visit also comes as China has been on quite the roll when it comes to very high-profile events related to the country’s ongoing naval buildup. The People’s Liberation Army Navy launched its biggest and most powerful modern surface combatant, the Type 055 Destroyer, last week and its first indigenously-built aircraft late last April . The weekends festivities are sure to make international headlines, especially in countries in the region who are deeply concerned with China’s increasingly potent military might. In addition to the Liaoning, and many other examples of Chinese military hardware, the PLAAF’s most prized aircraft, the stealth J-20 , is also rumored to make an appearance in Hong Kong this weekend for the celebration.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Rockets’ Red Glare: North Korea Awes With Massive Missile Capability Leap,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Astonishing, impressive, borderline unbelievable. These are just a few terms to describe what North Korea has achieved when it comes to its ballistic missile capabilities over the last 15 months. Yesterday’s launch was the secretive country’s most successful, and introduced the world to yet another missile design—the Hwasong-14. The missile has been around for some time as we have mentioned it over the years, although it has never been officially tested. And this particular version came in a new and highly impressive configuration, which includes a re-contoured second (or possibly even third ) stage and delivery vehicle, that looks about as legitimate of a long-range nuclear delivery system as we have seen yet from the country. The liquid-fueled rocket was rolled out on one of North Korea’s largest transporter-erector-launchers—which itself is of Chinese origin —and placed vertically on a launch stand. At around 9:40AM local time, with the young tyrant Kim Jong Un gazing over the launch site, the missile climbed into the air over northwestern North Korea for the first time. The HS-14 is by far the largest road-mobile missile North Korea has ever tested., AP During its steep flight into space and back down into the Sea of Japan, the missile traveled over 580 miles for 39 minutes, and reached an altitude of a whopping 1,740 miles. For comparison purposes, the International Space Station orbits the earth at an altitude of roughly 250 miles. Here is a translated copy of North Korean state media’s official statement on the launch: The test shattered North Korea’s last test launch of a long-range missile, which occurred in April . That was the first known launch of a Hwasong-12, which flew to then a seemingly incredible altitude of 1,300 miles and downrange nearly 500 miles. In retrospect, that was just an opening act for the Hwasong-14’s far more concerning flight profile. AP For yesterday’s launch, North Korea used a highly parabolic trajectory as it has done as of late for other missile tests, something we accurately postulated on when the behavior first appeared. By most accounts at this time, the missile’s range if it were to have flown a shallower, range-optimized launch profile would be somewhere between 4,000 miles and 5,000 miles. This would put the missile either just inside the top-end of the intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) category, or more optimistically at the bottom of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) category. Either way, the missile’s test displays a tremendous technological breakthrough for North Korea and a massive leap in the county’s threat profile for the US. For the first time, North Korea has proven that it has the capability to reach Alaska with a ballistic missile nuclear delivery system. With further development, or if the longer-range estimates prove true, the Hwasong-14 could reach Hawaii and even possibly the northern edge of the lower 48 states. There is no denying that the existence of this flight test missile changes the strategic equation between the US and North Korea. It will also result in further truncated estimates as to when North Korea will possess a reliable ballistic missile nuclear weapons delivery system that can put the western seaboard of the US under threat. For the Trump Administration, who talks regularly about taking a hard line on the North Korean issue, and has come out time and again stating that the era of “strategic patience” in regards to North Korea is over, this latest launch is akin to calling the White House’s bluff. In many ways it is more provocative than another nuclear test, which could still come at any time . So the big question now is what will Trump and his national security team do now that the stakes have been raised by Pyongyang? North Korea State Media There have been small signs that North Korea is willing to negotiate, and specifically halt missile and nuclear tests if the terms of an agreement that includes an end to US-South Korean military exercises could be reached, with North Korean ambassador Kye Chun Yong telling an Indian TV news network: “Under certain circumstances, we are willing to talk in terms of the freezing of nuclear testing and missile testing… If our demands is met, we can negotiate in terms of the moratorium of such programs as weapons testing.” This is just one of multiple overtures that have surfaced in recent weeks, but taking them seriously is a tough proposition as North Korea often plays a shell-game of sort with statements from its international officials. Most the times these propositions are not representative of the country’s true intentions. On the other hand, ignoring them entirely would be foolish. By all accounts, Kim Jong Un is set of developing his nuclear and missile arsenals. As such, expectations of what a possible “deal” between the US and North Korea that forestalls what appears to be a march towards conflict of some sort must be realistic. And that means it likely won’t be attractive politically to the current US administration. We described what a realistic deal would look like late last April: A much more realistic deal would include Kim freezing his nuclear weapons and delivery systems programs, as well as limiting the number and types of operational ballistic missiles in his arsenal. At the same time, North Korea would garner certain assurances and benefits from the US, South Korea, and the world community as a whole. This could include a non-aggression pact and a deal to deliver tightly prescribed food stuffs and energy supplies in return for cooperation. The removal of some US military capabilities in South Korea would also likely be part of such a deal. Most importantly, this could include axing the deployment of America’s THAAD anti-ballistic missile system to the Peninsula—a move that would make China very happy as well. Other moves to scale back the alert posture on both sides along the DMZ may be also possible, but the main thing is to create a jumping off point from the current march to war, and then work on that progress to further the situation in a positive manner. Yes, this means North Korea would be able to keep their pocket arsenal of nuclear weapons, but they could not test them, expand their arsenal, nor could they continue development of a reliable delivery system to work in conjunction with it. This keeps the US mainland outside of North Korea’s reach. This may seem less than optimal, but such a framework would be a reflection of reality of where we are at today with the situation. And better this than a reality where Kim has achieved a reliable long-range missile capability that threatens the US mainland, not to mention throngs of shorter-range missiles that have South Korea, Japan, and other US allies in their crosshairs . The deal would also keep his arsenal from becoming one stocked with hundreds of nuclear warheads , rather than a couple dozen, and would keep North Korea’s nuclear designs and components from being exported for hard currency to other rogue actors around the globe. Above all else, it is also better than a war where many thousands die, the world economy shatters and unpredictable geopolitical consequences plague American foreign policy in the region for decades to come. Whatever Trump considers as real options regarding dealing with the threat from North Korea, it is possible now that one of them will be exercised in the not so distant future. China, who Trump hoped would rein in their North Korean friends that depend on them for virtually everything, showed signs of doing so after Trump’s Mar-a-Lago summit with China’s President Xi Jinping. But those efforts seemed to have dematerialized in recent weeks according to multiple indicators. Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago., AP South China Sea freedom of navigation drills by the US Navy against China’s man-made islands have resumed, and sanctions on Chinese financial institutions that do business with North Korea have been enacted . Trump has also warned China that he will go his own way now that they have appeared to have failed when it comes to getting the Kim regime under control. Overall it looks like the short-lived bromance between the two world leaders is waning. Maybe most telling, China has recently joined with Russia of all countries to urge restraint when it comes to the North Korean crisis and for the US to sign up along with North Korea to their “deescalation plan.” The cosponsored plan would see North Korea suspend its ballistic missile tests and the US and South Korea stop all large-scale military exercises, after which it is hoped that some sort of deescalation talks would begin. The deal also demands the US military’s end its THAAD missile defense system deployment to South Korea. China, and Russia to a lesser degree, have long despised the presence of the system on the Korean Peninsula for fears that it could counter their nuclear deterrents and spy on their own ballistic missile tests. AP All this is likely to come to some sort of a head at next week’s G20 summit in Hamberg, Germany. The gathering of international leaders will also be the first highly anticipated, and in some cases highly maligned, meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. North Korea should come up during that encounter, and who knows, maybe the Chinese-Russian sponsored deal will give Trump the diplomatic out he needs at this time when it comes to his promises of “dealing with” the Kim regime. One thing is certain, now that North Korea has demonstrated that it can reach out a touch the US, calls for military action will grow thunderous in Washington. But being in a reactionary position to Pyongyang’s provocations is exactly where the young ruler and his cadre of henchman want the White House to be. And as we have stated countless times, and as key US military leaders also now profess , a conflict on the Korean Peninsula, regardless of the North’s nuclear arsenal, will involve destruction and death on a level we have not seen for many decades. As such, their remains no good military option for the North Korean predicament or for neutralizing their increasingly ominous arsenal of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",N. Korea Posts On-Board Film Of Missile Flight As US Says It Spied On Launch Site,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the July 4th holiday, the US government is reacting on all levels to North Korea’s successful long-range ballistic missile test. This has included ‘kinetic’ acts such as the laughably knee-jerk launching of US and South Korean short-range ballistic missiles, as well as officials giving a number of statements and answering questions on the matter. At the same time, North Korea has released footage of the test, including on-board video that hints at just how developed this new missile system is. One of the most interesting statements that came out of today’s avalanche of media coverage on the provocative North Korean launch was from Jennifer Griffin, who reports that “the US watched the North Koreans prepare for this launch in advance. They saw the missile being fueled w/ liquid fuel.” We have already reported that the HS-14 is a liquid-fueled missile, but that’s not what’s important here. The fact that the US had eyes on the launch site is an interesting revelation, although it may not be as surprising as it sounds. The War Zone has discussed all the various US aerial surveillance assets that are put to work over the Korean Peninsula on any given day. But which asset would have been able to garner this level of detail in short order can be narrowed down to a likely few. The U-2 Dragon Lady or the RQ-4 Global Hawk may have been able to use their long-range electro-optical/multi-spectral sensor suites to peer roughly 50 miles, deep into North Korea, at the never before used launch site located just south of Kunsong, near the Panghyon aircraft plant. Synthetic aperture radar that flies aboard both aircraft could also have been used to capture snap shots of the scene, and maybe fueling trucks would have been able to have been identified under certain conditions. The U-2 has long operated out of Osan Air Base in South Korea and the RQ-4 flies out of Yokota Air Base in Japan., USAF On the other hand, if the site was actively being watched in a much more intimate manner, one aircraft in particular could have provided streaming video of the scene without being detected by North Korean radars—that aircraft being the RQ-170 Sentinel . This type of mission is precisely what RQ-170 was built to accomplish—to penetrate into hostile airspace day or night, and persist overhead key locations, spying on life below and recording patterns of movements and fine details—like being able to distinguish a fuel truck from any other type of vehicle—from on high. The RQ-170 has supposedly been active over the Korean Peninsula and in the Pacific Theatre for years now, and closely monitoring North Korea’s high-profile and high-stakes missile launches would be well worth the risk of flying such a mission. With this in mind, Kim himself could have been in the Sentinel’s optical crosshairs while watching his latest rocket fantasy turn into reality. Kim Jong-un just casually strolling around while the Hwasong-14 ICBM is erected is quite something. (Wouldn't want a VIP that close.) pic.twitter.com/a3FDIenZYU — Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) July 5, 2017 It is possible that satellites could have provided this information, but they are not well suited to do so as they only capture a “snapshot” in time, and fly along predictable routes. Another aircraft, one that is officially undisclosed, such as the high-flying and stealthy ‘RQ-180’ , a multi-role strategic platform, may have been able to accomplish such a feat as well, but from what we know historically, the Sentinel would probably be a better choice for the mission. Deploying an aircraft like the RQ-170 to closely monitor a launch site preparing for an immanent new missile test would also allow for the US to coordinate the deployment of strategic surveillance assets. This way they can be looking at the right place at the right time in a combined effort to gain intelligence from the launch. This includes a huge array of sensors, from satellites to missile defense radars, and especially USAF RC-135S Cobra Ball missile tracking aircraft that are forward deployed to Japan. Regardless of the asset that was surveying the site as the launch process unfolded, the fact that the missile was found well before its launch, and at an entirely new and seemingly austere launch location, is an indication of just how well surveilled North Korea is at any given time by the US and its allies. It also underlines the inherent vulnerability of liquid fueled missiles to preemptive attack. In this case, the HS-14 could have beed blown up while still on its platform. While the US was spying on the Kim regime’s long-range ballistic missile launch, the North Koreans themselves were conducting some fairly high-fidelity surveillance of their prized missile. The country just posted video of the launch, and it includes on-board camera angles that show a fairly mature system in flight. The video shows not just the first stage cleanly separating from the second stage, but also the missile’s nose cone being ejected as pointed out by defense analyst Joseph Dempsey. Nosecone ejection also visible in #NorthKorea Hwasong-14 ICBM stage separation footage. pic.twitter.com/cGMnujpLcF — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) July 5, 2017 Once drag and air friction is no longer an issue, the separation of the nose cone—also referred to commonly as the nose cap—exposes the warhead reentry vehicle and will allow it to travel on its way back down to earth when it is separated from the final stage. You can see some rough renderings of what such a system looks like here and here . The fact that we see this occur in the video is an indication of the advanced state of missile design as a nuclear warhead delivery system. Yonhap has a chart showing the new Hwasong-14 flying to a range of up to 8,000 km, which would allow for a strike on @PacificCommand/HI. pic.twitter.com/zlFhDoZAK8 — Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) July 4, 2017 The fact that on-board video was relayed from the missile to the North Koreans on the ground, likely along with telemetry, is also interesting. It would seem that jamming these signals would be a prudent non-kinetic, anti-proliferation tactic by the US and its allies. Then again, just how prone the line-of-sight transmissions North Korea uses for these purposes are to standoff jamming and electronic attacks is another question entirely. Finally, by almost all accounts, the Hwasong-14 would have a range in excess of 8,000km if fired on a down-range performance optimized flight profile. The US State Department has now referred to it officially as an intercontinental ballistic missile after the Department of Defense first classified it as an intermediate range ballistic missile shortly after its launch. The State Department’s statement reads: “The United States strongly condemns North Korea’s launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world. Global action is required to stop a global threat. Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime. All nations should publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons. We intend to bring North Korea’s provocative action before the UN Security Council and enact stronger measures to hold the DPRK accountable. The United States seeks only the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the end of threatening actions by North Korea. As we, along with others, have made clear, we will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. The President and his national security team are continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our allies and partners.” So officially it would seem that the age of North Korea possessing a long-range nuclear weapons delivery system has arrived.

There are few better places on this planet to capture interesting candid shots than at summits like this week’s G20 in Hamburg, Germany. Awkward diplomatic encounters, strange personality traits, eye-rolls and so much else from the most powerful people in the world are on display and often caught on camera—the perfect fodder for a hungry press and for TV pundits who are looking to draw conclusions anywhere they feasibly can. But once in a while what is being discussed is actually pretty conclusive based on hand gestures alone, and when Vlad and Angela talk ballistic missiles, they do much of it with their hands. One may think this animated display is a product of cross-lingual conversations, but that isn’t so. Putin is fluent in German, Merkel is fluent in Russian, and both can also speak English. So the language barrier is not a factor, but visual aids surely help when talking about the flight path of rockets. It is very likely the two world leaders, who have held a historically close but also at time tenuous relationship, are discussing North Korea’s latest and most impressive missile test. As we have discussed in detail , the missile, now classified as an ICBM , flew a very steep parabolic arc to keep it from flying far downrange and to prove its theoretical range capability. It seems Putin is trying to make this clear to Merkel with both his words and his hands.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",This Is What a 700-Round Burst Out of a M249 SAW Does to a Suppressor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Suppressors are hot items these days, both in the military and the civilian world. But they can also get very hot during extended firing periods, and can even self destruct before the barrels they are attached to do the same. The guys over at West Coast Armory put a little video together to show what a machine gun and a lot of ammo, 700 rounds of 5.56X45 to be exact, can do to one of these sounds suppressing weapon accouterments. The results are impressive, and although the suppressor basically disintegrated, failing around 350 rounds, it gave a good fight before doing so. Suppressors have long been popular among special operations units. With their own budgets and streamlined procurement processes, many examples of suppressors have become widespread throughout the special operations community. But over the last decade, the use of suppressors has spread to general infantry units in a limited fashion as well, and the results have been positive. Now the USMC wants to try “suppressing” an entire battalion —from its assault rifles to its 50 cals. Major General John Love told Military.com the following about the initiative: “What we’ve found so far is it revolutionizes the way we fight… It used to be a squad would be dispersed out over maybe 100 yards, so the squad leader couldn’t really communicate with the members at the far end because of all the noise of the weapons. Now they can actually just communicate, and be able to command and control and effectively direct those fires.” Suppressors also help hide muzzle flash, and for smaller units, they can assist in concealing soldiers’ presence and location even during sporadic firefights. They can also help with accuracy via less audible distraction and perceived recoil. On the downside, they add weight and bulk to weapons at their long end, and can malfunction and even melt during heavy sustained fire, as shown in the video above. An initiative to ease restriction on civilian access to suppressors is also underway via a bill dubbed the “Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act,” or SHARE Act . Currently, in most cases a civilian can buy a suppressor but it requires a $200 tax stamp and has a multiple months-long waiting period for the ATF to review an application. Only after all that has been approved and processed can the civilian obtain their suppressor. The SHARE Act would largely eliminate that process and allow for suppressors to be bought “over the counter” so to speak. If the SHARE Act were to become law, it would result in a rapid expansion of the suppressor industry, and the rapid development of new suppressor technologies could be leveraged by the military. Detractors of the bill say it would be a major win for criminals and make mass shootings even more deadly.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 16, 2017",Check Out These Sizzling Photos From Two Of Europe’s Premier Air Combat Drills,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Our good friend and the big cheese over the Centre Of Aviation Photography , Rich Cooper, visited two of Europe’s premier air combat drills in recent weeks, and as usual, he has some incredible photos to show for it. Tactical Weapons Meet: Florennes, Belgium The decades old exercise ran from June 5th through the 16th, and brought together six countries for a series of air combat sorties. Aircraft that took part in the drills were home based Belgian F-16s, Hellenic Air Force F-4E Phantoms, Polish Air Force Mig-29s, Italian and Spanish EF2000s, French Air Force Mirage 2000s, Belgian A-109s, and Royal Air Force Hawk aggressors. Belgian Alpha Jet and SF260 trainers also took part, as well as an assortment of transport aircraft. Some comments from Rich: “When No.1 Squadron ’Stingers’ announced they would open their doors to celebrate their 100th anniversary during their hosting of the Tactical Weapons Meet you knew it was going to be good opportunity for some great photos. As well as the home team, with all of their vapor-pulling aplomb, the promise of Greek F-4s and Polish MiG-29s was enough to draw hordes of aviation enthusiasts from all over Europe. There was a lot of competition for places by the fence line, with rows of step ladders threatening to wreak havoc. But it wasn’t too bad in the end. People got there three to four hours before the opening to ensure a space at the front, but you could duck and dive in-between. In fact, it was actually pretty relaxing not to stress about it and just enjoy it all, take it all in, and soak up the air power. The low-passes and touch and goes were such a welcome treat. Oh and did I mention there were Phantoms?!” Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper NATO Tiger Meet: Landiviseau, France There are few international air combat exercises as colorful or steeped in history as the annual NATO Tiger Meet. Every year since 1961, aircraft from around NATO flock to a “Tiger Squadron” host base, with some of the aircraft wearing extremely elaborate paint jobs—always tiger striped or tiger influenced—that are applied just for the exercise. This year’s gathering occurred at the same time as the Tactical Weapons Meet, from June 5th to June 16th, and during that time, F-16, F/A-18, EF2000, JAS-39, and Rafale fighter crews participated in a spate of aerial warfare scenarios. These included large force employment (LFE) missions where allied aircraft have to take on other aircraft acting as “red air” aggressors in order to strike their targets in simulated enemy airspace. Often times these missions will include dozens of aircraft airborne at one time and each side will have to execute a complex “game plan” to achieve common goals. Airborne early warning and control aircraft, tankers, as well as adversary jamming aircraft will often partake in these missions as well. Simulated ground based threats can also be a factor. Some comments from Rich: “Some nations had left by the time the second week of the exercise came around, but it was still pretty impressive to have that much of a concentration of European airpower at one place at one time, especially when there were other exercises taking place in Europe at the time. I heard that some of the missions were so complex that they started the briefing process one to two days in advance! I remember standing in the middle of the flight line as jet after jet started and just thinking ‘this is awesome.’ The Rafales in particular sound like dinosaurs screaming and howling their way to life as they spin up. A big part of aviation that I love is the interaction of man and machine together. I mean before those pilots and crews came out, the aircraft are just lumps of metal, incapable of anything. But as soon as a human pushes a few buttons and taps a few screens, it’s one of the most incredible inventions on the planet. During the start and launch phase, it’s also fascinating to me to see the different ways in which various nations operate. The different start procedures, the different protocol and crew interaction. It’s definitely something I try to capture in my images. If you worked hard you could get some great images. Most chose to shoot solely by the runway mid-point for take-off but it was not a great position due to long grass and a lot of heat haze, not mention everyone would get very similar images. I mean to have a dozen Rafales in front of you on a flight line is just golden. You could work with the light or against it and, if you put in the leg work, you could really exploit that. The interaction between the crews and the enthusiast fraternity is always special at Tiger Meet, and this was certainly the case at Landivisiau. Still, the exercise seemed a bit smaller than usual, maybe because the Germans and the Spanish left after week one, but it was still a fantastic concentration of European fast jet airpower. And how sexy are Rafales? What a jet! To see that Landivisiau flight line full of those purposeful curves, both on hunkered down Armee de l’Air and standing-poud Marine Nationale versions, it was very impressive. I am not a massive fan of special schemes, so I went out there to shoot as many ‘operational-looking’ images as I could. A special scheme immediately dates an image, and sometimes that works, but it wasn’t my focus for this shoot. But then again, who can complain about a white tiger striped Rafale right?!” Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper Rich Cooper A huge thanks to Rich Cooper for sharing his great shots and his recollections with us.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 3, 2016",The Navy’s Gargantuan New Sea Base Is On Its Way To The Middle East,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The highly modified Alaska class oil tanker, now dubbed Expeditionary Mobile Base USNS Lewis B. “Chesty” Puller , left Norfolk on June 10th and is on its way to the Middle East with no return date in sight. The deployment marks a new age in America’s ability to be able to project persistent naval power abroad, and is the first time a purpose-built sea base has been fielded by the Pentagon. The vessel is also a cousin to the Navy’s Expeditionary Transfer Dock , which is based on the same core design but works as a massive ship-to-shore logistical conduit. Both classes of these purpose-built ships, as well as a shadowy second-hand transport vessel that is being modified into a special operations mothership, are part of the Department of Defense’s long, but somewhat obscure history of sea basing. Most notably, sea bases hastily adapted from barges and logistical vessels worked as special operations platforms in Vietnam. During the Tanker Wars of the 1980s— under operation Prime Chance and Earnest Will—leased barges worked to support special operations detachments, mine sweeping operations, and interdiction efforts. They even acted as forward staging bases for MH-6 and AH-6 Little Birds , and later on OH-58D Kiowa Warriors , as well as other helicopters. USS Harnett County (AGP-821) in South Vietnamese waters., USN The barge Hercules crane prepares to lift a Mark III patrol boat into the water for a patrol. The patrol boats worked in pairs to monitor small small boat activity in the Persian Gulf. A 160th SOAR Black Hawk also sits idle on the deck., USN The War Zone did a full profile on the Puller last November, when the ship was still in testing and undergoing upgrades. But suffice it to say that it is a multi-role platform, capable of deploying and sustaining pretty much any helicopter in the DoD inventory from its large flight deck and hangar space. This includes the mighty MH-53E Sea Dragon mine countermeasures helicopter. In fact, the Puller can operate four Sea Dragons at once, and deploy any of the sleds or other devices they pull behind them during mine hunting operations. The Puller is also capable of deploying small boats and unmanned craft, as well as bunkering larger boats that are part of anti-mine warfare and special operations. The ships cavernous “mission deck” has immense room for storage of vessels and outsized cargo, and can receive all types of bulky upgrades in the future. Mine sweeping will likely be the ship’s primary role in Middle East, but the Puller can also take on other missions, like taking part in amphibious assaults and supporting special operations, sea control, interdiction and disaster relief missions, as well as counter-piracy duties, to name a few. Even supporting attack helicopters for low-intensity kinetic operations, including those against small boat swarms, are possible. In fact, the whole idea behind this class of ship is that it can be adapted to pretty much anything commanders imaginations’ can come up with. The Puller, and eventually its sister ship the USNS Hershel Williams, will have decades to prove their multi-role potential in various locales abroad, such as the South China Sea , but for now, the Puller is likely to set up shop in the heart of the Persian Gulf. Nine months ago, the USS Ponce , a 46 year old Austin class Amphibious Transport Dock that was modified to be a temporary forward staging base, had left its station in the Persian Gulf after over four years there working primarily as a counter-mine warfare platform. USS Ponce operating in the Persian Gulf with a MH-53E Sea Dragon aboard., USN Ponce moved into the Gulf of Aden area of operations following a spate of anti-ship weapons attacks on US, Saudi and UAE vessels . It stayed in the general area around the Horn of Africa well into the Spring , although she may be back in Persian Gulf at this time. Regardless, the Ponce is slated for decommissioning in Norfolk this October. If the Puller does indeed take up station in Persian Gulf—it could also stay near the Horn of Africa until the Ponce heads home—its presence will not go unnoticed. The shear size of the vessel alone, displacing 78,000 tons and having a length of 764 feet, makes it impossible to miss. The ship represents a massive upgrade in size alone over the Ponce, which displaces a comparatively paltry 16,500 tons and has a length of 570 feet. The height of the ship, and its unique “platform” layout also differentiates it significantly from tankers and warships that regularly transit the region. The Lewis B. Puller is one massive vessel., USN Unlike the Ponce , which packs two Phalanx close-in weapon systems, a pair of 25mm Bushmaster chain guns and a semi-experimental laser for self defense against aerial threats and small boats, the Puller does not have any robust self defense capabilities at all. Nor does the ship even have electronic warfare systems or countermeasures to defend itself from an attack non-kinetically. This puts into question the massive ship’s vulnerability, especially since non-state actors are increasingly fielding anti-ship weapons. In addition, the Persian Gulf is basically a super anti-ship missile engagement zone, with Iran’s coastline and its naval forces bristling with all types of these missile systems. The massive flight deck on the Puller . , USN It is possible that the Navy could eventually deploy containerized or vehicle-mounted weapon systems onboard the Puller. In fact this is becoming an increasingly common trend, with the ability to field modular point air defenses , deck gun-like capability , cruise missiles and even guided artillery rockets and ballistic missiles from virtually anywhere, including a ship’s deck. The Puller certainly has plenty space for these systems and since they require no permanent integration into the ship’s core systems, they are easy to swap out and upgrade depending on the mission and threat profile. In fact, the Navy and USMC have improvised this type of setup before, rolling out a M1161 Growler light vehicles with heavy machine guns on the stern of the USS Carter Hall during a transit through the Bosphorus and into the Black Sea. The Egyptians are putting their US made Avenger point air defense systems to use aboard their new Mistral amphibious assault ships: Regardless of the questionable decision not to arm the Puller, its presence in the region will be a major upgrade in capabilities for the 5th Fleet and will officially usher in a new era of sea basing for the US Navy.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This awesome shot, showing a A-10C Warthog bristling with a diverse array of weaponry, and its belly a sooted and greasy mess from continued firing of its GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon, is a reminder of just how relevant this aircraft still is today. And if the USAF had its way years ago , it wouldn’t have had the chance to prove that it can be among the most deadly platforms when it comes to tearing apart Islamic State fighters and their material in Iraq and Syria, and it has been very busy doing just that. Seen under its wings from right to left are a pair of AIM-9M Sidewinders, a AN/AAQ-28 LITENING targeting pod, a 500lb GBU-12 laser guided bomb, a 500lb GBU-54 Laser JDAM , a 2,000lb GBU-31 JDAM, a AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, a LAU-131 2.75 inch rocket pod with seven rockets (or laser guided rockets ), and another GBU-12 to round out the load-out. Of course, there’s also the big drum of ammunition we can’t see that holds 1,174 rounds of coke bottle-sized PGU-14 armored piercing incendiary or PGU-13 explosive incendiary ammunition. For ripping up the Islamic State, the PGU-13 is the flavor of choice . The inclusion of the 2,000lb JDAM in this load-out is somewhat rare, but we have seen it before in the Iraq and Syria area of operations. Overall, this mix of weapons is a reminder of how versatile the Warthog is, as it gives the jet the flexibility to take out everything from moving heavy armor, such as tanks, to large strategic structures, such as multi-story buildings, to small groups of combatants or even a single ISIS member riding a moped. Additionally, it can attack targets in any weather as the JDAMs don’t require laser designation to hit fixed targets. But even then, the A-10 can usually get down below the muck in most instances and bring its rockets, Avenger cannon and Mavericks to bear on the enemy—a feat jet fighters have a much harder time accomplishing. Another similar loadout with a 2,000lb JDAM., USAF The nearly orphaned A-10 fleet has been only second to the F-15E fleet when it comes to releasing the most weapons on ISIS from on high. Military.com’s report from June states: “Here are the figures for the 10 types of U.S. aircraft flying combat sorties: F-15E Strike Eagle, 14,995 weapons released; A-10 Thunderbolt II, 13,856; B-1 Lancer, 9,195; F/A-18 Super Hornets, 8,920; F-16 Fighting Falcon, 7,679; B-52 Stratofortress, 5,041; MQ-1 Predator drone, 2,274; MQ-9 Reaper, 2,188; AV-8B, 1,650; and F-22, 1,535. Broken down by aircraft type, fighter and attack planes dropped a total of 48,635 weapons, or 72 percent of the total; bombers released 14,236, or 21 percent; and drones dropped 4,462, or 7 percent, according to the statistics.” It is also worth noting that each 100 rounds fired from the A-10’s cannon is considered a weapons release. These numbers don’t tell the whole story, such as how many aircraft of each type have been deployed on average to the region over the course of the operation, or how many hours each type has flown over the enemy territory and so on, but the metric is still highly significant and telling. The fact that the A-10 also does the job cheaper than any other manned tactical aircraft on that list is important to note, as is the fact that it can engage the enemy under conditions other platforms simply cannot. It’s true, putting a weapon on a set of coordinates can be done by many platforms, and that is a good thing. But for close air support and counter insurgency operations, the A-10 has a much wider envelope to play in when it comes to what it can attack and under what conditions than other fixed-wing platforms. And that dirty warthog in the picture above is a testament to the fact that sometimes a hard-hitting cannon attached to an aircraft that can fly low and comparatively slow is the most surgical, and sometimes the only tool for a given job. Another image showing an A-10 with a similar loadout., USAF The USAF’s latest and totally ludicrous war to kill the A-10, which started following sequestration, seems to have been largely won, as the type is now slated to stay in the Air Force’s inventory till 2030. Still, the USAF’s attempts to undermine the A-10 community’s future capacity to wage war continues . At this point in time, it looks like the hog will prevail in this battle as well, but don’t expect the USAF stop its A-10 abuse. But considering the flying service has tried to kill the jet time and time again , starting not long after it acquired the type decades ago, the Warthog’s track record of surviving on battlefield Capitol Hill is even better than over actual war zones. The A-10’s plight has also been helped uncannily over and over by the course of world events. Just when the USAF brass says they can get by without the aircraft and that it is not needed for battles of the future, it proves itself as invaluable in combat. The A-10 also excels at littoral warfare, such as smoking formations of fast swarming boats., USAF The A-10 is truly a “blue collar” plane. One that works tirelessly for its very survival and in doing so it wreaks absolute destruction on America’s enemies. That’s precisely why the most beautiful A-10 is one that is filthy and banged up from constant attacks on the bad guys. In essence, a begrimed and grungy Warthog means the enemy is dying, our allies on the ground are living, and the A-10 is proving its worth so that it can live to fight another day.

There were some awesome sights and sounds to behold during France’s Bastille Day celebration, and the President of the United States Donald Trump was there alongside French President Emmanuel Macron for much of them, including this great display showcasing one of France’s most popular exports, Daft Punk. A composite group made up of various French military bands put on the spectacle, belting out the Robots’ signature single “Get Lucky” as the highlight of a broader medley. It was a jovial and creative moment, although an untraditional one, for such a parade, and the band’s energy and the song’s up-beat pop groove was not lost on the crowd or the French President. President Trump on the other hand sat expressionless with a stern look on his face. Maybe he isn’t a Daft Punk fan, or was confused why such a pop song would be played by a military band during the Bastille Day parade. Either way, it was an odd comparative movement for cameras who cut back to the two world leaders repeatedly. But forget the politicians, these guys and gals in uniform did a great job with their rendition of the mega hit. The flyover for the parade was also pretty spectacular.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The high-speed aluminum catamaran which once served the US Navy and most recently the United Arab Emirates, HSV-2 Swift , was attacked last October near the Mandeb Strait by a anti-ship missile. The deadly explosion and the fire that ensued did horrific damage to the vessel’s forward half. Following the attack, it seemed as if Swift was a burned out hulk at best, but she may get a second lease on life of some kind, or at the very least she will be stripped of usable parts before being broken up. The ship was originally brought to the nearby port of Assab in Eritrea after the attack, where it had remained for months. Then it suddenly appeared in Eleusis, Greece just days ago. The zombie ship of sorts was towed through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, into the Mediterranean before arriving at its current and somewhat peculiar resting place. Clearly, a ship as ominous looking as the HSV-2 in its current state would draw some attention. Photos of the vessel moored in the harbor of the Greek city began hitting social media earlier in the week.

The company operates similarly exotic vessels that like Swift are built by the Australian ferry company Incat . The company describes its fleet and its mission on its website as such: “With a fleet of 11 ships, Seajets has the largest network of highspeed ships in the Aegean interconnecting 17 ports with 140 connections, promising you comfort and safety on board. With a total capacity of over 8.500 passengers and 1.450 vehicles Seajets is your ultimate link to the Cyclades and Crete.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35 made worldwide headlines last year by making its first appearance at the UK’s Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), but this year US airpower was showcased in a different but still very impressive manner. Air show goers at RAF Fairford got a special surprise Sunday in the form of America’s most prized aerial weapon system—the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber . The B-2A executed a special set of flybys flanked by a pair of USAF F-15C Eagles. The F-15Cs are based at RAF Lakenheath. Even in videos that are emerging on the net, seeing the two iconic combat jet types flying together is a downright impressive display of America’s aerial prowess. Being there to see it in person must have been quite special. https://youtube.com/watch?v=r5udONJvFTU As for those who will decry the massive cost of flying a B-2 from Whiteman, Missouri to the UK just for a couple of air show flybys, forget about it. This is a global power training mission with one main difference—countless people got to appreciate it—including America’s enemies. All the same components go into this operation as any other global power mission, including extensive planning, hitting a precise time over target, working with other USAF aircraft and air traffic controllers, tanking and so on. Not just that, but RAF Fairford is one of only two forward operating bases for the B-2 community, so B-2 crews need to get familiarized with flying to and from it. Beyond the B-2’s powerful flyover, the USAF had an especially large presence at this year’s RIAT, with the F-22, CV-22, and the USAF Thunderbirds performing. A parade of local USAFE air power was also featured which included F-15C/Es, F-16Cs, a KC-135 and a C-130. Outside of the USAF displays and the usual UK aerial flare, which included the world famous Red Arrows and the Typhoon demo, probably the most anticipated flying performances were Ukraine’s Su-27 solo display and France’s outstanding “Ramex Delta” twin Mirage 2000 routine.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 10, 2017",Indian Navy MiG-29Ks Make Low Approaches To USS Nimitz During “Malabar” Drills,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The “Malabar 2017” international naval exercise off of India concludes today, and this year’s iteration was like no other in the quarter century history of the multinational drills. At the center of the large force training event were no less than three aircraft carriers from three navies— USS Nimitz from the US, INS Vikramaditya from India, and the JS Izumo from Japan. The three carriers in formation that acted as the centerpiece of Malabar 2017., USN In total, 17 ships from the three countries took part in the exercise, which began ten days ago and runs through today. The Bay of Bengal is where most the activity took place. According to a US Navy press release, areas of training included: “Events planned during the at-sea portions include liaison officer professional exchanges and embarks; a photo exercise; submarine familiarization; high-value unit defense; air defense exercises; medical evacuation drills; surface warfare exercises; communications exercises; search and rescue exercises; helicopter cross-deck evolutions; underway replenishments; gunnery exercises; VBSS exercises; and anti-submarine warfare.” Other cross-training events also occurred ashore: “While ashore in Chennai, training will include subject matter expert and professional exchanges on carrier strike group operations, maritime patrol and reconnaissance operations, surface and anti-submarine warfare, medical operations, damage control, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), helicopter operations, and visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) operations.” USN During naval maneuvers, India’s still relatively new MiG-29Ks made low approaches to the USS Nimitz— likely a first for the type. These aircraft cannot takeoff from the Nimitz because they cannot use the Nimitz’s catapults. Instead they require a ski-jump and specialized holdback blocks to get airborne. So cross-decking was not an option. India’s MiG-29K force (read all about the type’s decades long development here ) remains controversial as the aircraft is reported to be ill suited for persistent use under harsh carrier conditions, with ongoing major engine , flight controls, and airframe issues. The type has a miserable availability rate, with India Today reporting: “Serviceability of the warplanes was low, ranging from 15.93 per cent to 37.63 per cent and that of MiG-29KUB ranging from 21.30 per cent to 47.14 per cent. Serviceability refers to the total number aircraft available for operation at a time from the overall capacity… the service life of the aircraft is 6000 hours or 25 years (whichever is earlier) and with issues facing the MiG-29K/KUB, the operational life of the aircraft already delivered would be reduced.” India ordered 45 sea-going Fulcrums from Russia back in the 2000s, with the type slated to serve aboard not just the INS Vikramaditya —a Kiev class “aviation cruiser” converted by Russia into its current Kuznetsov class like configuration—an endeavor that was a boondoggle in itself —but also the country’s first indigenously built carrier that is slated to come online in the early 2020s. Because of the ski-jump configuration of both ships, India has very limited options as to which aircraft it could procure for these vessels. Su-33 or MiG-29 derivatives from Russia were really the only feasible options at the time, and still are to some degree without incurring major development costs. Russia has had its own issues operating both types from its sole carrier just last winter, dumping multiple aircraft — including Russia’s version of the MiG-29K—into the sea before returning home. USN So basically, the Indian Navy is stuck with the MiG-29K, for better or for worse. Although, with the US and India becoming closer and facing a common threat from Beijing, it is interesting to think how the F-35B could make use of a ship like the Vikramaditya. But India is still not cleared to purchase the 5th generation fighter, although under President Trump, that could possibly change. Training with the Indian Navy allows US Navy aircrews deployed aboard the Nimitz to get a first hand account of what Russia’s latest multi-role naval fighter is capable of—and an opportunity to record its electronic signatures. Likewise, the Indian Navy got to see how America puts its advanced carrier air wing to use, and the advantages of catapults up close. Indian Navy and US Navy fighters fly over the INS Vikramaditya. , USN The Indian Navy will build their third carrier in Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration, and is working with the US Navy to field the electromagnetic launch system (EMALS) on this future design. A new type of fighter will be needed for these ships, which could see a US designed aircraft, like the Super Hornet or even the F-35C, flying from their decks in the later part of the next decade. J apan’s Izumo does not operate fixed-wing aircraft, it is a helicopter carrier. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t highly relevant to coalition operations in the region. The ship is loaded with SH-60J/K anti-submarine warfare helicopters. So its primary mission is anti-submarine warfare and to provide screening against sub-surface threats for a coalition battle group. It does this using its own assets and by coordinating an anti-submarine warfare “game plan” with other assets in the flotilla and ashore. Izumo with SH-60s embarked., USN The anti-submarine threat is among the most concerning factors when it comes to operating large naval forces in Asian seas, especially if those forces were to stand off against China’s own increasingly capable naval armada. Beyond the tactical highlights from the exercise, the strategic subtext to Malabar 2017 was the growing naval threat posed by China and how coalitions will be needed to deter, or even face that threat in the future. Both India and Japan have severe territorial disputes with China, and the US has its own issues with Beijing’s extra-territorial ambitions. Relations between China and India in particular have taken an especially nasty turn as of late. There is an escalating standoff between New Delhi and Beijing over the mountainous Sikkim region , one that could boil over and lead to a wider conflict. Meanwhile, the Japan-China schism has only grown in recent days over territorial claims in the East China Sea, as China sent ships from its ever more ominous “coast guard” into Japanese waters in multiple locations , some for the first time. Malabar focuses not only on working to operate with allied navies, but also to build interpersonal bonds between military personnel., USN China clearly had a close eye on Malabar 2017, and it is very likely real Chinese submarines were prowling the area, collecting intelligence and testing the players’ capabilities, while also possibly giving Malabar participants something to hunt and track. The increasingly close military cooperation between India, Japan and the US is highly troubling to Beijing, and it is very likely that Australia will be added to Malabar exercises next year. In fact, a request from Canberra to join in the war games has been pending for three years now. Under past leadership, India had been hesitant to expand the Malabar invite list, but under the current circumstances this looks like it could change. The Malabar 2017 surface fleet seen during PHOTOEX. , USN Seeing how China is also steadily expanding its reach west, with its new naval master base in Djibouti being a huge part of its naval strategy, the Indian Ocean will become a far more active area for PLAN vessels in the future. This is a reality India will have to adapt to whether it likes it or not. With all this in mind, Malabar 2018 is likely to set the bar even higher when it comes to its size, scope and the number of countries represented.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 5, 2017",Russia’s Largest Nuclear Powered Sub And Warship Have Set Sail To The Baltic Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Early last April, we were among the first to report that Russia intended to send the world’s largest submarine, the Typhoon class Dmitry Donskoy, and their largest surface combatant, the nuclear powered Kirov class battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy , to the relatively tight and tense confines of the Baltic Sea. Now both ships have officially set sail from their home port of Severomorsk on their unprecedented voyage. The ships are part of a massive flotilla of Russian naval power that will take part in a parade on September 30th at the far eastern reach of the Baltic Sea in St. Petersburg. The two ships represent some of the most destructive vessels the world has ever seen, and sailing them into Northern Europe’s most strategic waterway will raise eyebrows, especially among NATO member countries that call the Baltic home. Just getting the vessels in and out of the enclosed Baltic Sea will be a sensitive operation, as we wrote in April: “The Baltic Sea is usually the playground of smaller attack submarines, namely of the diesel electric variety , not of huge ballistic missile carrying “boomers.” The body of water is very much a littoral environment, with an average depth of around 180 feet, which is hardly the environment for a Typhoon class submarine that displaces 48,000 tonnes while submerged and was built to literally find a place in the deep and remote ocean to hide for long periods of time. According to The Barents Observer even transiting into the region will be a tight squeeze for the Dmitry Donskoy : “For those who want to see, but can’t go to St. Petersburg, the vessel will have to sail at surface under the Great Belt bridge where vessels with a maximum draught of 15 meters can sail. According to Swedish Maritime Administration, the waters under the Öresund bridge or the Flint channel are too shallow. The draught of a Typhoon submarine is 12 meters.” But even if the huge submarine doesn’t have a tactical purpose in the Baltic Sea, its appearance there will send a very big reminder to the region and beyond of the heavy-hitting naval capabilities the Russian Navy retains. A Kirov class battlecruiser is also not especially well-suited for operating in such a environment, but its abilities do pose a threat to the region. The ship was built to tear apart American carrier battle groups in the open ocean, but their missiles can be used against other targets as well, and  its long-range air defenses pose a credible challenge. But the fact is Russian long-range air defense assets , ballistic missiles, and even possibly land-based cruise missiles are already present in Kaliningrad , so although the Pyotr Velikiy does bring some new capabilities to the table in the region, Russia already has plenty of ways to turn on a no-fly-zone at a flick of a switch, and bombard NATO countries from nearly the inside-out if they actually wanted to do so. Not to mention the fact that a huge battlecruiser in a closed body of water is a big fat target itself. Maybe above all else, the fact that multiple nuclear reactors (both vessels run on nuclear power) of Soviet vintage will be plodding through the region is likely to draw the most ire from Moscow’s European neighbors.” Denmark’s Great Belt bridge. , Henrik Sendelbach/Wikicommons According to a release from the Russian Ministry of Defense, the parade will include “10 ships and 28 aircraft and helicopters” from the Northern Fleet. The Baltic Fleet forces will likely add many more ships to that roster, as well as aircraft from units based in the region, including in Russia’s Baltic Sea enclave of Kaliningrad. Based on this info, this should be one hell of a naval parade. The imposing Dmitry Donskoy, whose class inspired the beloved Cold War classic The Hunt for Red October , is the last of her kind. The other five giant Typhoon class boats have been scrapped or are decommissioned (and largely rotting) and are about to be meet a similar fate. Different rumors have popped up in recent years as to the Donskoy’s future. Today it serves as a test ship for Russian Navy ballistic missiles, and by some accounts there are no plans to retire her from that mission anytime soon. But other sources say the iconic submarine’s days are numbered. Maybe we will find out about what he Russian Navy has in store for the unique submarine after its adventure into the Baltic Sea concludes. The Kirov class nuclear battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy on the other hand has a long life ahead of it. It has received some upgrades in recent years and its sister ship, the Admiral Nakhimov , is undergoing a deep refit that includes installing a host of new weaponry and sensors. Once the Admiral Nakhimov is returned to the fleet, Pyotr Velikiy will go through the same refit process, giving both ships a common configuration around the middle of the next decade. Russia’s Northern Fleet armada sailing into the Baltic Sea, regardless of if it is for a parade or not, will draw huge press coverage in Europe, but their voyage around Scandinavia will also be closely monitored by local militaries. We’ll keep an eye on their progress and report back on the status of their voyage soon.

The Type 52D destroyer Hefei , the Type 054A guided missile frigate Yuncheng, and the supply ship Luoma Lake are known to be enroute to the Baltic Sea now. Until China’s massive Type 055 destroyer is operational, the Type 052D remains the most capable surface combatant in the PLAN’s inventory, and the Type 054A is the most advanced frigate in China’s naval arsenal as well. The trio was intercepted by the Royal Navy’s Type 23 Duke Class frigate HMS Richmond (F239) as they passed through the English Channel . Once the ships made their way into the North Sea, the Royal Netherlands Navy began trailing them.

Now it appears that another three PLAN ships are likely to venture into the Black Sea—another tense body of water where NATO vessels have had a strong presence recently. It is unclear if the Chinese destroyer, frigate and replenishment ship that have dropped anchor in Istanbul will also conduct drills with Russia’s naval forces if they do indeed travel north, but it is possible, if not probable. If the ships enter into the Black Sea, it will be the first time that China has fielded ships in both European bodies of water, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, simultaneously. It would also be a major bolstering of Russia’s already formidable Black Sea Fleet. The message China will be sending to NATO members and other countries that ring the enclosed body of water will also be dubious at best, and threatening at worst.

This is precisely the same time window in which Russian naval assets and aircraft will be amassing for a large scale naval parade in St. Petersburg. In addition, Russia will also begin large-scale ground exercises along the Finnish border during this same time period. This much Russian-aligned naval power in the Baltic Sea at one time is unheard of, at least in the post Cold War era, and nuclear ballistic missile submarines—even ones used for primarily for testing purposes like the Dmitry Donskoy — don’t call on the Baltic Sea, then or now. With this in mind, NATO will be extremely interested in watching the Russians and the Chinese operate together, not to mention the need to monitor all the unique Russian assets being brought into the region. Considering the parade is being paired with exercises in multiple domains, the whole area will be on high alert, and the compact nature of the airspace and waterways in the area could lead to some tense encounters.

During the same period of time, NATO alert aircraft intercepted the Russian defense minister’s plane, only to have Su-27s show up and put themselves between the F-16s and the VIP military transport. Russia’s practice of buzzing NATO ships and chasing reconnaissance aircraft operating in the area is also well documented. In other words, expect not only tense times, but also the unexpected on, over, and near the Baltic Sea in the weeks to come. China’s naval presence in Northern Europe alongside its Russian allies is also yet another sign of Beijing’s transformation from a regional military power to an international one. Exercises with Russian naval forces are nothing new for the Chinese, in fact the Russian Navy joined the PLAN for joint “island seizing drills” in the South China Sea just last year. The exercise drew concern from the US and many in the region considering China’s highly disputed and numerous territorial claims. The PLAN’s deployments to the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean, and possibly the Black Sea are bolstered by China’s first major overseas naval facility that has just become operational in Djibouti . The facility will work as a strategic artery to assist in long-range and more persistent deployments to the Indian Ocean, the Middle East and deep into the western hemisphere.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s electromagnetic (EM) railgun continues its development, with the Office of Naval Research publishing a video yesterday showing BAE Systems’ version firing off test shots in rapid succession with the help of the gun’s elaborate autoloading system. The video was filmed at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division with the gun setup on a test gantry. We have seen this setup before , but the fact that the program is moving to mechanized rapid fire tests is a positive indication that the promising technology is indeed progressing toward an operational capability. Also, the video is another reminder of how cool this thing looks—a definite departure from deck guns of the past. Railguns use a burst of electrical current to propel a projectile along a series of energized magnets to very high speeds, well over mach six. The system uses no traditional chemical charges, such as gunpowder. The Navy envisions future railguns as being able to sling rounds over 100 miles, not just a ground or sea targets, but also at aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. You can read more about the railgun in this previous post . USN Following a detailed report on the Railgun’s progress from the Congressional Research Service, the Navy appears set to start equipping its surface combatants with the weapon in an operational form within the next decade. Not only will the weapon open up new tactical possibilities, but two of its greatest features are cost-exchange ratio and magazine depth. Both of these factors have more to do with the railgun’s use as a defensive weapon than as an offensive one. The CRS report states: “Two key limitations that Navy surface ships currently have in defending themselves against ASCMs and ASBMs are limited depth of magazine and unfavorable cost exchange ratios. Limited depth of magazine refers to the fact that Navy surface ships can use surface-to-air missiles(SAMs) and their Close-in Weapon System (CIWS) Gatling guns to shoot down only a certain number of enemy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and anti-ship missiles before running out ofSAMs and CIWS ammunition—a situation (sometimes called “going Winchester”), that can require a ship to withdraw from battle, spend time traveling to a safe reloading location (which can be hundreds of miles away), and then spend more time traveling back to the battle area. Unfavorable cost exchange ratios refer to the fact that a SAM used to shoot down a UAV or anti ship missile can cost the Navy more (perhaps much more) to procure than it cost the adversary to build or acquire the UAV or anti-ship missile. In the FY2018 defense budget, procurement costs for Navy SAMs range from about $976,000 per missile to several million dollars per missile, depending on the type. In combat scenarios against an adversary with a limited number of UAVs and anti-ship missiles, an unfavorable cost exchange ratio can be acceptable because it saves the lives of Navy sailors and prevents very expensive damage to Navy ships. But in combat scenarios (or an ongoing military capabilities competition) against a country such as China that has many UAVs and anti ship missiles and a capacity for building or acquiring many more, an unfavorable cost exchange ratio can become a very expensive—and potentially unaffordable—approach to defending Navy surface ships against UAVs and anti-ship missiles, particularly in a context of constraints on U.S.defense spending and competing demands for finite U.S. defense funds.SSLs, EMRG, and HVP offer a potential for dramatically improving depth of magazine and the cost exchange ratio: Depth of magazine: SSLs are electrically powered, drawing their power fromthe ship’s overall electrical supply, and can be fired over and over, indefinitely, aslong as the SSL continues to work and the ship has fuel to generate electricity.The EMRG’s projectile and the HVP (which are one and the same—see nextsection) can be stored by the hundreds in a Navy surface ship’s weaponmagazine. Cost exchange ratio: An SSL can be fired for a marginal cost of less than one dollar per shot (which is the cost of the fuel needed to generate the electricity used in the shot), while the EMRG’s projectile/HVP has an estimated unit procurement cost of about $25,000″ The use of the railgun for defensive purposes is likely the realm in which it will be tested first, and being able to fire multiple shots in relatively quick succession will be a key aspect of this capability. USN Both BAE Systems and General Atomics are now working on evaluating what barrel configurations will be best for achieving a five shots per minute minimum goal. The aim is for BAE to deliver its prototype Railgun to the Navy sometime in 2018, while General Atomics is eyeing tests against cruise missile-like targets in 2018 at Utah’s Dugway Proving Grounds. BAE’s version is still planned to be setup on one of the Navy’s Spearhead class fast logistics ships for tests, although exactly when those tests will take place is unclear. USN At the same time, the spike-like Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP), the Railgun’s primary ammunition, is also finding extreme interest from other “big gun” programs that use gunpowder instead of massive surges of electromagnetic energy for propellant. Migrating the HVP to more traditional fire support systems, like the M777 Howitzer and the Navy’s Mark 45 5 inch gun, will open up new tactical possibilities for these weapons, and it would do so likely in a much smaller developmental timeline than fielding the railgun as the inaugural platform for the munition. USN Whether the HVP is propelled using gunpowder or electricity, fielding it operationally could lead to entirely new missions for existing gun systems and the advent of entirely new gun systems altogether. It isn’t that hard to imagine Marines setting up a firebase with their usual Howitzers and a turreted gun system that is tied into mobile counter-battery and air defense radar systems. Both guns can use the same HVP ammunition, but the turreted gun would be capable of blasting everything from drones to incoming ballistic missiles and artillery out of the sky. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KqvtP5lms8o Getting HVP on the menu of multiple gun systems will also lower the unit cost of each projectile, and will lead to faster evolution and growth for the munition and their applications overall.
