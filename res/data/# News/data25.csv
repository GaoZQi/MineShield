There is so much quality content being put out with the advent of streaming services, in addition to premium cable channels and a few highlights on basic cable, that it can be hard to know what series is worth investing your time into. But there was one show in development that I was particularly excited for—Amazon Video’s Jack Ryan . Based on the characters from Tom Clancy’s brilliant books that inspired movies like Hunt For The Red October and Clear and Present Danger , Tom Clancy’s J ack Ryan seemed like one of the most logical high-end television reboots and one that could have immense staying power and versatility. With the right team of writers, it could also help us better reflect on the complex geopolitical realities of our increasingly chaotic world. And above all that, I’m just always down for a good spy thriller. With all this in mind, I fired up the Amazon Video app on my television and dove into the eight-episode first season run of Jack Ryan . After the final episode’s credits rolled I was left flabbergasted, but for all the wrong reasons. First off, let’s talk about the new Jack Ryan played by John Krasinski. Yes, Jim Halpert from The Office is now flexing his acting muscles as a CIA analyst turned action hero. The role has been held by four other players in the past: Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, and Chris Pine. Every single one of these actors brought something different to the role, with the first two becoming legends in my mind and the others being far less memorable. Still, I really enjoyed every Jack Ryan movie aside from Shadow Recruit , which was lackluster and tried too hard to emulate the success of the Bourne Identity series of films. Krasinski is a good actor who has a proven likable quality that spans both male and female audiences. We all know he can do comedy, but he can also do action, as proven in 13 Hours, a film I think was grossly underrated. In addition, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan premiered following what has been widely viewed as a total directing, producing, acting, and box office success for Krasinski in the form of the horror film A Quiet Place . So to call him a rising star with proven talent would be a big understatement. So what does the long-hyped new show do with Krasinski’s unique mix of talents? Nothing . Amazon First off, they weigh him down with an overplayed and dour arch of an ex-Marine with PTSD. I am all for getting the horrors of this affliction out to the masses, but Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan does it with the finesse of a .50 caliber machine gun, not a sniper’s rifle. Instead of playing on Krasinski’s every-guy chops and ability to be subtly humorous—which are perfect attributes for the Jack Ryan role—he is assigned a surprisingly wooden character with all around low-quality material to work with. Still, at times Krasinski’s personality shines through the bullethole riddled script, and that’s not necessarily a good thing because it reminds us of what could have been. And that theme runs through nearly every tangent of Jack Ryan season one. The entire show is derivative, uncreative, and mish-mashed, all while trying—but failing drastically—to exist on some higher narrative plane. Instead of a brilliant Jack Ryan whose analyst mind is his greatest weapon and fish-out-of-water set pieces, we get a soldier first Jack Ryan with the analyst thing goofily tagged on. The entire endeavor is far more brawn than brain and is packed full of writing choices that are so tropey that at some points you are left wondering if this thing was once written as a parody. The places the show goes and what it does are totally familiar. Not just in terms of what we have seen in many past spy and action films, but also in what we have seen in very recent and laughably similar television—namely in a far superior show, Showtime’s Homeland . How on earth the writer’s room moved forward with these scripts without realizing major parts of them have already aired recently on a competing and well-established show is beyond me. It is jarring at times and wondering how exactly it happened totally takes you out of the story and especially the action sequences. Even Wendell Pierce, who plays another (now) deeply troubled figure, James Greer—previously a jovial fan-favorite character who was famously played by James Earl Jones in earlier Jack Ryan films—seemed as lost in the script as his charter was lost in life. Pierce’s dialogue is full of snappy retorts and one-liners that seem strangely out of place and, at times, downright forced. Once again, the poor writing really casts a long shadow here, and frankly, it is below Pierce’s talents. Even the origin stories of the major players are foolishly rushed. For instance, Jack goes from a mild-mannered economic analyst to taking on hardened terrorists in hand-to-hand combat in the first episode’s runtime. When Jack says his famous “I’m just an analyst” line, instead of being a pleading protest it becomes something of a wink to the audience as to just how stupid all this is. Amazon The different plot streams that are supposedly interconnected—think Syriana , Babel , etc—are also so clumsily derived that they are nearly falling away from each other. The one with the drone pilot is so weak, played the hell out, and cheesy that it should have never made the final cut. Another mistake was made by not giving this show a great intro, but the fact that there is next to no intro at all is jarring and odd in itself. Although this sounds like a nitpick, it really speaks to the production’s other strange choices and sets a cheap tone for the show as a first impression. What’s most puzzling of all is that clearly, the opportunity here was to infuse a new style and really distinct narrative into the Jack Ryan universe that isn’t restricted by a movie’s runtime. Considering all the competition, a smarter spy thriller that was more grounded in tradecraft, geopolitics, current events, and most important, reality, than straight-up thrills—something even Homeland has increasingly struggled with—would have been truly exciting. This way, major action elements would really have stakes and could be handled with a realistic panache. Such a concept could have taken Jack Rya n to the next level and would have allowed it to compete in terms of quality in an increasingly crowded space. Instead, we get an uncannily unoriginal and imitative series that seems to go out of its way not to use its talented players to anywhere near their inherent potential. What a huge, blatant, and downright puzzling missed opportunity. Amazon With all this said, I do actually think the show can be salvaged. It already has been renewed, so even with these issues, Amazon is doubling down by spending big bucks on another season, which is really quite remarkable considering how anemic season one was. The entire production needs to be retooled, and the writer’s room, in particular, needs a thorough flushing. What comes next should be a team with a cohesive and unique vision, one that will use the over-the-top action hero stuff very wisely and sparingly. That team should also bring in advisors who have worked for The Agency and let their real experience help drive the narrative. It doesn’t have to be hyperrealistic , at times it can even be humorous, but in its current state, it has zero credibility in the realism department, which strays from Tom Clancy’s original vision. And give the Middle Eastern-centric plots a break. There are plenty of other very interesting enemies to go after these days and not all bad guys have dark complextions and pray toward Mecca a few times a day. Above all else, allow the actors to play on the strengths and not wallow in their weaknesses. Also, why not look at a series/procedural format with some long-lead elements woven in that can be addressed in multi-episode arcs? Mix it up a little. This form of television is due for a high-end renaissance of sorts and Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan may be a perfect vehicle to make that happen. I don’t think you will find any bigger cheerleader for a television adaptation of Tom Clancy’s work than me, but Jack Ryan, in season one form, should serve as the guide of exactly how not to execute such a mission.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",Confessions Of A U.S. Marine F/A-18 Hornet Maintainer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have heard so much lately about poor readiness across America’s air arms , but the USMC, in particular, has left some of its most essential aircraft communities in especially dire straits . The service’s worked over F/A-18 Hornet fleet is one of them. Over the last ten years, it has become all too common to see Marine tactical air squadrons with rows of planes sitting in pieces on the apron, their key components having been cannibalized to help healthier jets limp back into the air. Maintainers have even had to scrounge through the boneyard and even museums looking for impossible to find parts. And all of this negatively impacts a unit’s ability to stay current on critical skills, not to mention morale and personnel retention. But through it all, some of the hardest working people anywhere have powered on and pulled endless metaphorical rabbits out of hats to keep their jets flying and their pilots as ready for combat as they possibly can. These are the maintenance people, the unsung heroes that may never even get to fly in the very jets that they spend countless hours and years of their lives servicing at home and in faraway lands. USMC One of these talented Marines agreed to talk with The War Zone about their past experiences in the thick of the USMC’s aviation readiness meltdown, and about what it takes to keep beaten-down F/A-18 Hornets in the air. The Marine, who wanted no fanfare or congratulations for this article, requested to remain anonymous and gave a frank, honest and selfless account of his experiences. Quite frankly, his words are a testament to all of the ‘little guys’ who do the less glamorous but absolutely necessary jobs in America’s military machine. Like so many young enlisted personnel, he just wanted to serve his country, but he never thought he would end up tearing apart broken $30M strike fighters and putting them back together again as an occupation. Keeping the USMC’s rickety Hornet fleet flying From when I first started working on hornets to when I wrapped up my enlistment I saw the readiness and availability worsen and worsen. The F/A-18 is obviously an older platform so stuff would break with pretty decent frequency. The pilot would write up the discrepancy and we would begin to troubleshoot the issue. But a lot of times we would be hamstrung because there would only be one set of test equipment on the entire base that was needed and we would have to ask to borrow it from another squadron. If the other squadron needed it or was using it we were shit out of luck. There would be instances when we would be given a deadline to return the test equipment without even having fully completed the troubleshooting process because the unit we borrowed it from needed it back. USMC Getting parts was another nightmare. There were many times where we would order parts and they would take almost a week to get or we would get multiple defective parts. I remember in Guam we had an OBOGS (onboard oxygen generation system) generator go bad and turned in the part to be repaired by the MALS (Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron) unit supporting us. We got the same part back twice and it was still not functioning correctly. On the third try, it finally worked properly. Something like that should not be occurring. I also remember a time where we had a rash of canopies delaminating and going bad but we weren’t able to get replacements in a timely fashion because there was only one available in the entire Marine Corps and it was all the way in Japan. So we cannibalized a canopy from one jet that was down waiting for parts to another jet. After the second jet was down we moved the canopy to a third jet. Our MMCO (Maintenance Materiel Control Officer) was constantly having to swing deals with base supply or other squadrons to get us the parts we needed. Most maintenance shops keep extra consumable items on hand just in case we need them for something unexpected or if supply didn’t have any available, so we would have to barter consumables with other squadrons to get what we needed. At certain flight hour intervals we had inspections that required us to remove, inspect, and if acceptable re-install certain parts, but in order to do that we needed to replace certain consumables like o-rings, crush gaskets, etc., and everything we needed came in a kit that we had to order. On many occasions, the Marine Corps didn’t have enough kits on hand to adequately replace what was needed. USN There were also shortages of certain explosives that we needed to replace due to their upcoming expiration dates. The ejection seat in the F/A-18 is made by Martin-Baker and there were more than a handful of times when we needed a part and there were zero in inventory so we would have to ask our on-site Martin-Baker engineer if he had extras on hand. Lucky for us he did every time. We also had a few ECS issues that required Boeing to send out technical representatives to assist us (and it took almost 2 weeks to solve the issue even with their help). So you can see what we were dealing with here. These issues were Marine Corps-wide not just localized to VMFA-232. We were given chicken crap and expected to make chicken salad or turn water into wine. Some jobs can take a few minutes while others can take days. Most of the time we were able to meet our flight schedule but whenever we would ratchet up the flight schedule and conduct robust ops tempo that’s when jets would break left and right. When I first found out the Navy had Super Hornets and we were stuck with these old birds I was bit envious I’m not gonna lie. Even though I was just an E-3 I felt the Marine Corps was just being short-sighted and narrow-minded by blindly placing their faith in the readiness of the F-35. Readying the Hornet for its next mission It usually depends on the flight schedule, but the vast majority of the time there is a great urgency to get turnaround inspections on F/A-18s done. For egress specifically we inspect the canopy and the ejection seat for any damage or downing discrepancies, and if it’s an older jet that uses LOX (liquid oxygen) then we refill the LOX bottle. Ordnance is usually running around loading new chaff and flare buckets in the jet or uploading/downloading munitions for the next event. The plane captains refuel the jets, service the oil, and inspect the aircraft overall to ensure its readiness to fly again. And avionics loads whatever necessary navigational data that the jet requires for its next event. USN If we can swing it without downing the jet we try to troubleshoot any issues so that the aircraft can go from PMC (partially mission capable) to FMC (fully mission capable). Maintenance control is very hesitant to let us conduct maintenance on a jet that is in an up status for fear of us possibly downing the jet unless it is absolutely necessary and unavoidable. The Hornet’s bugs Unsurprisingly the ECS (environmental control system) presented the most problems on the F/A-18. It’s a very finicky and somewhat complicated system that seems to have a mind of its own. In my experience, it seemed that the ECS operated well in drier climates. Whereas in humid climates, like Guam or Key West, the humidity wreaked havoc on the ECS and gave our shop personnel many frustrating discrepancies to troubleshoot. To be more specific, most of the symptoms that persisted overall were “low/no air flow” to the cockpit—warm weak air flowing to the cockpit instead of the usual cool air to keep the pilot comfortable— “av air hot”—avionics not getting the cool air required in order to keep them from overheating while being used during flight—”OBOGS degrade”—which meant either a component for the OBOGS system is failing/failed or the pilot is not receiving enough purified oxygen, which can also lead to a very dangerous physiological event for the pilot. Last but certainly not least is the loss/fluctuation of cabin pressurization. This can be very elusive to successfully troubleshoot at times because the cabin pressure system may act up during flight by not scheduling properly (pressurize or depressurize at the proper time/altitude) and sometimes we could not duplicate the issue on the ground. This would lead us to swapping out parts until the issue stopped rearing its ugly head. USN To be honest, there were many times when the pilot or pilots would write up ECS gripes that they experienced in flight and we simply couldn’t replicate the issue on the ground while doing our testing and troubleshooting. But thankfully we were able to rectify the issue more often than not. Sometimes the issues that persisted were the result of aircraft wiring being damaged or faulty and we would troubleshoot for hours, days, and sometimes weeks all because our electricians were reluctant to admit it was their wiring that was creating issues. It still irks me how many man hours and parts were wasted on the reluctance of our electricians to admit it was their system that needed troubleshooting, but I also cannot go without saying that there were plenty of instances where they did give us assistance as well. It was a love-hate relationship…..mostly hate (haha). I can’t say that there is a way to “fix” these persistent issues. To me, the problem is that these jets are just too worn out and old that it’s more like plugging 11 leaks with ten fingers. There was also a strange and baffling phenomenon that would occur, we would fix a jet and it would come back from a flight with no issues. Then after not flying for 24, 36, or 48 hours, it would have some sort of issue after starting up and getting ready to go out for a flight. Somehow the jet would just break while sitting on the flight line while not even being operated. Getting the show on the road In order to get our jets ready for deployment, the MAG (Marine Air Group) focuses their support on us to give priority over other F/A-18 squadrons on base. Anything from parts, testing equipment, ground support equipment, or, if a shop is lacking enough experienced maintainers or an unforeseen event prevents a Marine from deploying at the last minute, even personnel are pumped into the squadron. There is a lot of pressure on us as mechanics to get our jets all ready to go for the trans-pacific flight, but every single time we deployed we were able to get all of our aircraft ready and out the door when they were supposed to. USMC When our birds would embark on their journey there would be two small groups of maintainers that facilitate the trip. One group would be “lead” and go ahead of the aircraft while the other group would be “trail” and they would follow behind the aircraft. Both groups of maintainers would usually fly in KC-130s (but I believe there was an instance of a C-17 being used as well) with a spare engine, tools, test equipment, and sometimes spare parts. The job of lead was to land ahead of the jets as they hopped from location to location and recover them. If there were any downing discrepancies that required maintenance “lead” would try to troubleshoot and identify the problem, but they were usually not able to fix it because they had to keep pace with the flyable aircraft. The job of “trail” was to pick up where “lead” left off and fix any of the issues. Contributor If the maintainers are lacking in the necessary items to fix whatever the issue was, a KC-130 is sent to that location with whatever was needed. The U.S. Air Force always provided tanker support to gas up our birds in flight as well. So as you can see there’s quite a bit of support that goes in getting an F/A-18 squadron across the pond. Traveling with the flying circus Going on the road is a juxtaposition of working hard to support a robust flight schedule and having fun. It’s always exciting for me to get to see new locations or different bases. Going to RAAF Tindal especially comes to mind. Our assigned living area was in these underground cold war era bunkers that had these huge thick blast doors at the entrance. While there, I was able to drive with some friends from other shops in VMFA-232 to Nitmiluk National Park, Australia and hike to Katherine Gorge, then go swimming in Edith Falls. That was quite an adventure to be able to experience the beautiful geography. USMC It was also really cool to interact with the RAAF and see how they operate. They have an awesome chow hall at RAAF Tindal (I was a little jealous to be honest). Another awesome place we were fortunate to go to (twice actually) is beautiful Key West Florida. Our squadron was sent to NAS Key West for some training with VFC-111, so naturally, we took advantage of the opportunity. While there our squadron enjoyed the good food (gotta have key lime pie in Key West!), had some drinks, and almost everyone went fishing. My shop and I were able to go saltwater fishing on one of our free weekends. The fishing trip didn’t turn out the way we expected. Half of the group got sick—myself included—and the rest that were able to continue fishing weren’t able to catch anything worth keeping. But despite all that I don’t regret it. Contributor While we do get to have fun there is a lot work that is involved. We usually work 12 hour shifts and due to the ops tempo there is a large maintenance load because our old birds have a hard time keeping up. Especially if the climate is humid like it is in Florida, then the ECS tends to act up and the means more work than usual for us as egress mechanics. Heading to Fallon for Topgun First off I hate to disappoint, but there were no Maverick, Ice-Man, Jester, or Viper sightings. And sadly there weren’t any towers being “buzzed.” At first it was a little hectic adapting to the ops tempo and basically trying to form a cohesive group of maintainers from multiple navy squadrons, but we were all able to assimilate and get the hang of things rather nicely after the first few days or so. A sailor walks past the lineup of Topgun class aircraft at NAS Fallon., Tyler Rogoway It was awesome to see the enormous effort and support that goes into a Topgun class. I never would’ve even guessed the amount of personnel, equipment, or aircraft that went into it would be that enormous. The Topgun class was comprised of legacy and Super Hornets and surprisingly the Red Devil’s F/A-18Cs held up pretty well as far as being in an up status throughout the three-month-long event. It was also very interesting to see famed VFC-13 and its diverse aircraft with their awesome paint jobs up close and personal. Two different Air Force units showed up with F-16s and F-22s to “fight” against the class for certain portions of training as well. The UMSC’s aircraft maintenance woes as a whole I haven’t ever really spoke with the helo guys (Navy or Marine) about how their situation was as far as maintenance ops and demand so I can’t really give an answer to that. But as far as the Harrier and Prowler guys went, it seemed that their situations were more dire than ours. They had a much harder time keeping their aircraft in an FMC or even PMC status than we did. At MCAS Iwakuni we were in a hangar next door to a Harrier and a Prowler squadron and they always had most of their aircraft down for maintenance. They seemed to have had the same difficulty getting parts through the supply system in a timely manner that we did. Because of the enormous workload, both units where 12 on 12 off the whole time they were there next to us. I seem to recall one those squadrons working Christmas Eve as all. No matter what the situation, someone always has it worse. An AV-8B+ undergoes an engine change. Every time the jet’s moster Pegasus engine is removed the aiframe has to be split in two., USMC The new plan to infuse Navy Hornets into the USMC’s inventory Even though the legacy F/A-18 is a pain to work on I still think the platform is pretty awesome. It saddens me to see the state of decay that the Marine Hornet fleet has fallen into. Not only is it sad but it’s also detrimental to our nations security and ability to respond and counter threats. This danger also extends to the pilots that fly them. How can Marine aviators do their job with a clear focus and sound mind if they have something like worrying about the quality of their aircraft in the back of their mind? Their job has enough risks and hazards without it compounded by the poor state of the platform they are flying. The infusion of the Navy’s legacy Hornets is something that is sorely needed and will be a greatly welcomed addition. Anything that can help alleviate the horrendous and unacceptable readiness rates will be greatly welcomed resource I’m sure. But this is also a too little too late, band-aid solution to an obviously much larger issue. The damage is already done to the Marine Air Wings and I really don’t think this will stem the tide until the final retirement of the legacy F/A-18s probably in the 2030s. USN I know it’s easy to Monday morning quarterback the poor decision making of the Marine brass but the fact of the matter is that they failed the Marine Corps and should’ve procured Super Hornets to provide a bridge of transition to the F-35. Had they chose to do so the infrastructure was/is there via the U.S. Navy to provide support for any needs that would arise including training and logistics. The Hornet’s spate of critical onboard oxygen generation system woes Like many others, I myself am rather perplexed as to the root cause of these dangerous events. The ECS (environmental control system) has redundancies that are supposed to prevent these dangerous re-occurring episodes. Speaking from personal experience I do know that if the aircraft’s electrical system is faulty or begins to operate incorrectly, all of the many sensors, valves, and components that rely on electrical signals or voltage could be impacted, and if that process is compromised then the ECS will act faulty, even if the components that make up the system are not failing. DoD A compromised or faulty electrical system can also burn out and cause the ECS components to fail, therefore exacerbating the issue. The root of the problem may also stem from manufacturing defects or even from the suppliers that sell parts to the assembling manufacturer. I hope that the comprehensive review and investigation being conducted can produce a permanent solution to this dangerous and persistent problem. A call to serve with the USMC Ever since I was a young boy, about five or six years old, I was always fascinated with all things military and aircraft related. That coupled with the fact that I loved to read led me to crack open any book I could get my hands on regarding those topics. The things that consistently stood out to me were the tenacity, determination, and toughness of the Marine Corps throughout our nation’s history (I am not in any shape or form trying to minimize the other key contributions of the other branches). USMC I also grew up having many family friends that were Marine veterans and they gave me plenty of insight into the traditions and high demands that are required of Marines. After hearing all their stories of the pros and cons of enlisting in the Marine Corps it solidified my determination that I wanted to be a part of that family. I wanted to enlist as early as possible so I spoke to a Marine recruiter and found out the earliest I could do that was 17 years old with the signature of a consenting parent. Despite being extremely apprehensive about me enlisting at an early age my mother agreed and as soon I turned 17 off to the recruiting office we went. A few months after graduating high school I shipped off to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego at 18 years old. The winding road to the flight line After completing boot camp (13 weeks long) and Marine Combat Training (four weeks long) I was sent to NAS Pensacola, Home to NATTC which is a giant hub for naval aviation training, to begin training as an Air Traffic Controller. Before class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every MOS (military occupational specialty) had PT in the morning which always involved a lot of running and a lot of pull-ups. After PT we would go to the chow hall to eat rather quickly. After breakfast each MOS lines up in separate formations outside the barracks (except for ATC we lined up outside the chow hall), the platoon leaders of each MOS take accountability after a few minutes of standing by in order to ensure no one is UA (unauthorized absence), and then marches to class. Most of the MOS classes are held in classrooms inside this large two-story building called “The Mega Building” which is close to the chow hall,  but the ATC school building was the furthest away from the chow hall at about a quarter of a mile. At about roughly a third of the way through the ATC course I failed my third test and washed out. That course is pretty rigorous and the attrition rate is high. Before our first test we had a class of 14 after the first test we had six. USMC Being faced with failing air traffic control school was quite a gut punch to say the east, but instead of feeling sorry for myself I decided to take it in stride and have a positive attitude instead of negative one. Due to the needs of the Marine Corps, I was re-classified as an egress mechanic, and I had no say in the selection of my newly assigned MOS. The egress course is broken up in to “A” and “C’ schools. “A” school is about two months long. My instructors did a great job conveying and communicating the course material in order for me to thoroughly understand it. “A” school is an introductory course to the general theory of operations for the ECS, emergency escape systems, proper safety and precautions regarding aircraft maintenance, explosive handling, corrosion control, how to navigate/utilize technical publications and proper use of ground support equipment such as an A/M26U-4 (NAN) nitrogen servicing cart, which we use for testing certain components on the ejection seat, and a TMU-27/M LOX servicing cart which is used to fill/refill the LOX bottle located in the aircraft. Prior to this training, I had zero experience doing anything mechanical so to me this we quite a shock to my system having to learn all these various types of tools and equipment. Early on I had a hard time adjusting but after taking some lumps I began to get the hang of it. After being lectured on each topic we would be tested through a written exam and then had to complete the maintenance tasks we were lectured on without the instructors’ assistance. It wasn’t pretty but I passed all my tests. USMC Upon graduation from “A” school, I received my orders and headed to “C” school at NAS Oceana in Virginia to be trained on the F/A-18C platform. I didn’t get to pick my platform or where I went to “C” school, I just had to go where the needs of the Marine Corps required me to. “C”  School is four weeks long and there I learned about the ECS, egress systems, and technical publications specific to the F/A-18C. Becoming a ‘Red Devil’ of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 A short time before graduating “C” school I was given three choices of where I prefer to get stationed: east coast, west coast, or overseas. And we have to list them from most desired to least desired. Most of the time the Marine Corps doesn’t care where you want to go they just send you where you’re needed. I would say that MCAS Miramar is the most desirable location based off the proximity to San Diego and the beautiful weather. As far as each individual unit’s reputation goes, I was fortunate enough to get my location of preference on the west coast and be assigned to VMFA-232 Red Devils based out of MCAS Miramar. Checking into a new squadron was a little overwhelming at first. I was assisted by NCOs (non-commissioned officers) with the whole checking in process and they made sure I was able to get all the things I needed to get done in order to process into a Marine squadron. After finishing up checking in, which takes about two to four weeks, I was placed on night crew. USMC Night crew is where most of the maintenance gets done because there is usually little to no flying unless there is a scheduled exercise or event. So for a brand new maintainer it’s the perfect training environment. Being on nights is not very fun, a work day is usually 13 plus hours long, a lot more work is expected out of night shift, and if you live in the barracks like I did your sleep is constantly interrupted by fixed wing and rotary aircraft all day. NCOs in the shop are responsible for training junior Marines so I shadowed my NCOs and basically became a sponge for learning as much as could about my job. This included how to communicate with other shops, communicate what was going on to maintenance control, and even how to brief the officers on what was going on that pertained to our shop at the maintenance meetings each day. USMC I also had to learn how to play politics and navigate many different egos throughout the maintenance department in order to get things done.  When it comes to teamwork, certain shops were easier to work and communicate with than others and that played a role in how quickly or slowly certain things got accomplished. But overall it is a rather stressful and interesting dynamic that one has to navigate on a daily basis. Going from Red Devils to Black Knights Checking out of one unit and into a new one was pretty easy for me as far as the official Marine Corps process because I was literally going across the hangar to VMFA-314, but the difficult part was leaving my friends behind. Thankfully 314 was very warm in their welcoming me to the squadron. VMFA-232 was deploying to the Middle East very soon and I was going to separate in a few months so I had to leave. As far as squadron culture goes I would say there is quite a difference between the two units. At VMFA-232 there was more pride in our squadron’s rich history and reputation. Our leadership constantly reminded us that we were the Marine Corps first, oldest, and most highly decorated fighter squadron so we were held to higher standard than other units on the flight line. But all that came at a cost. The camaraderie wasn’t as strong at 232 as it was at 314. USN People seemed to get along better with each other and watch each other’s backs at 314. While there wasn’t a huge emphasis on history at 314, there was more teamwork that was evident. There wasn’t any animosity between shops like there was at 232. There was also a period of very poor leadership at 232 that revealed certain so-called “leadership” was more concerned about career advancement instead of being concerned about being a leader and although I had a brief stint at 314 I never encountered that there. Losing a superior and a friend Many pilots act like primadonnas, Major Sareen was not like that at all. Major Taj Sareen was the embodiment of a true hero and selfless leader. Even to the very end, he put others above himself. My first time meeting him was when we had duty together and to my surprise, he knew who I was and which shop I was in—which to put it in context, showed me the type of person he was. To know anything about me, some lowly Lance Corporal who just checked-in to the unit, really meant something. Most officers, to be honest, didn’t really care about any E-3s. Later in the day while on duty together we were talking and he asked me if I liked fast cars. Of course I did, I was a 19-year-old guy, so I said yes. To my shock, he offered to let me take his Ferrari for a spin! I told him I appreciated the offer but I respectfully declined—to this day I regret not taking him up on the offer. To my knowledge, before the crash, he was encountering issues with the inertial navigation system (INS) and that paired with low clouds/overcast conditions led to his awareness being compromised as far as what the aircraft was actually doing. To put into context the piloting skills that Major Sareen possessed were was nothing short of exceptional. He was a Hornet instructor and logged over 1,500 hours flying in F/A-18s. No matter how busy Major Sareen was he always took time to talk to everyone and was always genuine. He didn’t care what rank you were, what shop you worked in, even if you were junior enlisted he treated you with respect and dignity. He was a rare officer and it was an extreme honor and privilege to know him.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 4, 2019",This Futuristic ‘Lego-Like’ Vehicle Could Be Anything From Scout To Light Artillery,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid a surge in interest around the world in lightweight combat vehicles , including in the United States and Russia , Israeli firm Carmor has unveiled a new modular design it says will be able to fulfill a wide variety of different roles. The engineers behind the project say that the Mantis vehicle family, which will be available in 4×4 and 6×6 configurations, is like a Lego kit and could serve as anything from reconnaissance and fast attack vehicles to command and control platforms and even self-propelled artillery pieces . The prototype Mantis will make its debut public appearance at the biennial Eurosatory defense and security trade fair in Paris, which begins on June 10, 2018. Since May 2018 , Carmor has been releasing images and details about the vehicles to hype up the design. It appears to be the company’s first new offering in more than three years. “The development of the Mantis Family answers the global demand for lightweight vehicles with improved capabilities in the field,” Carmor CEO Eitan Zait said earlier in June 2018, according to Defence Blog . “These new vehicles provide a range of solutions and capabilities together with a unique ergonomic design that do not exist in any other lightweight armored vehicle.” The initial 4×4 version that Carmor has a general shape reminiscent of suped-up all-terrain vehicles with a futuristic looking body on top, but is substantially bigger. From what we know so far, the Mantis appears to be sized somewhere in between large ATVs and militarized commercial pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles . A rear-facing profile of the 4×4 Mantis prototype., Carmor The firm says that this monocoque armored shell is the centerpiece of the vehicle’s new, proprietary chassis. The composite armor reportedly gives the vehicle a high degree of protection relative to its weight and bulk, but so far there is little information on what type of threats it is supposed to stop. It has a special “floating floor” shape to deflect the blast from mines and roadside bombs, too. Carmor says its armored body is also air-tight and features an air-purification system, giving it the ability to protect the crew against chemical or biological attacks. The design also buries the 360-horsepower Cummins V6 turbo-charged diesel – a significantly more powerful engine that one often finds in vehicles of this type – deep inside the body, shielding it from enemy fire and lowering the vehicle’s thermal signature. There is no word yet on how fast the 4×4 model can go, but the Israeli manufacturer says the complete vehicles will be no more than 10 tons and potentially as light as 3 tons, depending on their configuration. It’s not clear if those specifications extend to the proposed future 6×6 model, which would likely be a much larger vehicle overall. Concept art of the planned 6×6 Mantis variant., Carmor There was also a deliberate, aesthetic element to the development process. The resulting design that looks like it could be at home in a science fiction movie or television show about a dystopian near-future and that was apparently by design. Mantis “was also a way of proving, while we were at it, that armored vehicles don’t have to be ugly by bringing in the world of aviation with a driver’s position that resembles a cockpit on the one hand and sports cars on the other, thanks to a silhouette with a lot of mass sloping downwards in the front,” Amos Boaz, the vehicle’s chief designer, told Israel’s Ynet News in May 2018. “One of the earliest things we had in mind when we started to plan the vehicle out was to create an element of surprise with a unique design that’s different from the rest of the clunky, squared armored vehicles.” Carmor’s previous products have had a much more conventional look to them. Previously known as Hatehof, the company has been armoring trucks for the Israeli military and other customers since before the country officially came into existence. One of its best-known designs, the Wolf , is a heavily modified Ford F-550-series truck with a very angular armored body kit and other improvements. An Israel Defense Forces Wolf armored personnel carrier., MathKnight via Wikimedia But the design concept doesn’t make the Mantis any less flexible a vehicle. The 4×4 family will be available in three main configurations, a “pickup truck” type with an armored cabin for a crew of three, a crew-cab version with space for five people inside, and a large, “open buggy” with the ability to carry up to eight individuals. In the latter case, “open” refers to the available space inside the vehicle and personnel will still be seated inside an armored shell. And despite Carmor’s insistence on referring to the Mantis as a buggy, it is really not in the same class as those type of lightweight vehicles . The 6×6 type will have space for as many as 13 personnel, including the driver, which could allow it to function as a small armored personnel carrier, armored ambulance, or command vehicle. Concept art of these vehicles shows a raised rear body section that could make it easier for personnel to move around inside, too. The company has only shown the 4×4 pickup configuration so far, fitted with a remotely-operated, retractable mount at the rear. The debut example has a remote weapon station armed with a .50 caliber M2 machine gun in this position, but it is almost certain that this could accept different types of weapons or even other equipment, such as an electro-optical and infrared camera turret or other sensor packages. Gili Hacohen, who oversaw the development of the Mantis, told Ynet in May 2018 that the goal was for the vehicle to easily reconfigurable “just like Lego.” Mantis’ retracting weapon mount., Carmor The folding mount would allow the vehicle to move around in as discreet a configuration as possible. The crew could then look over terrain or other obstacles while remaining largely concealed, allowing them to better perform reconnaissance and surveillance missions. With a guided anti-tank missile in that position, the vehicle could engage in shoot-and-scoot attacks on larger armored vehicles from behind cover, too. It is very possible that the chassis, especially in the 6×6 configuration, may even be robust to carry some sort of small, mobile artillery piece. One of the most obvious options would be Israeli firm Elbit’s Spear Mk 2 120mm mortar . This weapon has an advanced recoil system that makes it a practical option to fit on the back of various light trucks. There is also computer-aided targeting equipment available that significantly improves its accuracy and reduces the time it takes for a crew to engage a target after receiving a request for support. An Elbit Spear Mk 2 mortar on the back of a Plasan Sandcat light armored vehicle., Joseph Trevithick Various other similar weapon systems are available on the open market, including Spain’s EXPAL Integrated Mortar System, or EIMOS , and the American Hawkeye 105mm low-recoil howitzer. U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria have received the former weapon in a vehicle-mounted configuration, giving them an important mobile fire-support system in their fight against ISIS terrorists. That collapsible mounting arrangement might make the Mantis suitable for transport inside various fixed-wing cargo aircraft, reducing the time and effort it might take to get the vehicle ready to go and not necessarily requiring troops to reassemble anything at the destination. U.S. special operations forces, in particular, have long been interested in acquiring a lightweight vehicle that can fit inside various planes and helicopters , but drive straight off in a combat ready configuration. Even with the mount retracted, the vehicle would almost certainly be too tall to fit inside even large transport helicopters, though. The diversity in potential mission sets, as well as the ability to rapidly customize the design to meet a customer’s particular requirements, could make Mantis broadly appealing to both military and other security forces – the prototype has a light brick more commonly associated with police tactical and riot control vehicles. The common family of vehicles could also reduce operating and maintenance costs for any organization looking to acquire a fleet of various types with various weapons and other mission systems. A front shot of the Mantis prototype showing the light brick above the driver’s position., Carmor As noted, one immediate customer could be U.S. special operations forces, who are in the market for new and advanced lightweight vehicles. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army are also investigating similar platforms to improve mobility during expeditionary and airborne operations where it might be difficult to effectively operate larger, traditional military vehicles. At the same time, Mantis is entering an increasingly jam-packed market. Another Israeli firm, Plasan, recently unveiled the Yagu , a much smaller vehicle that offers an especially lightweight option with an advanced composite armor package. General Dynamics has just expanded their line of Flyer lightweight combat vehicles with a multi-purpose pickup type, as well. This is to say nothing of new developments elsewhere in the world . Carmor’s vehicle is still smaller than many “light” tactical trucks, such as the ubiquitous Humvee and it is miniature compared to more common mine-resistant vehicles, such as the U.S. military’s new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle . With at least some ability to withstand bomb blasts, it could be a much more mobile alternative to these vehicles or those in similar weight classes. Carmor’s offering is clearly aiming to set itself apart based on its ability to perform so many different missions using a large number of common components. It will definitely be interesting to see what additional configurations the company pitches publicly and how any initial customers end up employing the vehicles operationally.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 22, 2019",New B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Scheduled To Make Its First Flight In Late 2021,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which Northrop Grumman has been developing in extreme secrecy , is set to make its first flight on or about Dec. 3, 2021. The service had already previously revealed that the bombers would undergo their initial testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California and that it will base the first operational examples at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota in the mid-2020s. Air Force Magazine was first to announce the date on Twitter, citing U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Stephen Wilson, who was speaking at an event that the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute was hosting in Washington, D.C., on July 24, 2019. Wilson says he has a countdown feature on his wristwatch that says there are around 863 days left before the first flight, which gives the December 2021 date. “Don’t hold me to it,” Wilson added with regards to the exact date, according to Air Force Magazine . His caveat is not surprising given that it is hardly uncommon for program schedules to slip, especially in the case of complex, advanced systems, such as stealth aircraft. Still, we do now know that the Air Force has a target date. This comes just days after Acting Secretary of the Air Force Matthew Donovan visited Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Design and Development Headquarters in Florida to get an update on the program on July 19, 2019 . Donovan took over from Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who resigned in May. “We look forward to receiving the B-21 on time and incorporating it into our future force,” Donovan said in an official statement after meeting with the B-21 team “The B-21 will be a significant component of our Air Force as we continue to modernize to meet the National Defense Strategy and is a game-changing capability to win the high-end fight.” Donovan’s Florida trip also included a visit to the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV) Processing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. The Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) is in charge of B-21 program, as well as the equally secretive X-37B miniature space shuttle effort, and RCO’s director Randy Walden accompanied Donovan on his visit. The X-37B, another top-secret program that the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office manages., USAF Beyond the revelation of the date of the B-21’s first flight, Donovan did not have much additional information to offer about the program’s progress. In April 2019, U.S. Air Force General Arnold Bunch had told Congress that the next major milestone for the Raider was a first flight, though he declined to say when that might occur. At the time, Bunch was a Lieutenant General serving as the military deputy to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition at the Pentagon. He has since become the head of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). “We’re still in our acquisition thresholds and baselines, and [the B-21] is executing the way we want,” Bunch had told lawmakers. “We got past [a] critical design review [ in November 2018 ].” The B-21 had passed its preliminary design review in 2017. The basic requirements for the bomber, including that it will have an optionally manned capability and will be able to employ nuclear weapons the moment it enters service, had been firmed up years before then. Still, a first flight in 2021 further reinforces The War Zone ‘s previous assessment s that the Air Force is looking a very aggressive testing timetable given that the service expects the bombers to reach initial operational capability in mid-2020s. Beyond announcing that tests will occur at Edwards, there is also evidence that the service has already at least begun forming the actual test force to support that phase of the bomber’s development. Earlier in July, the Air Force had also acknowledged that it was building the prototype B-21. “We’re closely monitoring the build of the additional test aircraft and associated software to support the first flight,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein had said at an earlier Mitchell Institute event. It is very possible, if not likely, that earlier pre-production test articles and risk reduction prototypes have already flown . Northrop Grumman’s RQ-180 stealth reconnaissance drone may have also had a dual purpose in supporting these efforts. A purported patch for the B-21 Combined Test Force that Air Force may have already established. , eBay/deannaandgordon In March 2019 , former Secretary Wilson had also announced that Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, which presently hosts the 28th Bomb Wing, would be the first base to receive operational Raiders. The 28th presently flies B-1B Bone bombers, which are not nuclear-capable. Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, which is home to the 7th Bomb Wing, the service’s other B-1 unit, as well as Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, which hosts the B-2 Spirit stealth bombers of the 509th and 131st Bomb Wings, are next in line to get Raiders after Ellsworth. “These three bomber bases are well suited for the B-21,” then-Secretary Wilson said in a statement at the time. “We expect the first B-21 Raider to be delivered beginning in the mid-2020s, with subsequent deliveries phased across all three bases.” In his comments at the Mitchell Institute on July 24, 2019, Vice Chief of Staff Wilson noted that the Air Force was still finalizing its future bomber plans, too. The Air Force wants at least 100 B-21s, but “the general consensus is, we don’t have enough long-range strike capacity,” the general explained. The Air Force has indicated that it will replace both the B-1s and B-2s with the new B-21s, a plan The War Zone has previously examined in-depth, but it could extend the service life of the two existing bombers to help provide additional capacity until sufficient numbers of Raiders are available. Wilson also said that the Air Force might look to expand its fleet of older B-52 Stratofortresses by regenerating bombers from storage in the bone yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, something it has only done twice before in order to replace losses due to accidents. Whatever courses of action the Air Force decides to proceed with could also run up against bilateral arms control agreements between the United States and Russia, another issue that The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. A B-52 carries a prototype AGM-183A hypersonic missile under its wing during a test in June 2019. The Air Force plans to fly these bombers through at least into the 2050s and is expecting them to receive major upgrades , including to their radars and engines ., USAF “We continue to look at what that force will be for the future across the bomber force, what mix it will be,” Wilson told the gathering in Washington, D.C. But whatever that mix looks like in the end, the B-21 will be at the center of the Air Force’s bomber force for decades to come and many people will surely now be setting their clocks to make sure they don’t miss the Raider’s first flight.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The small and secretive airbase that sits on the southeastern edge of Yucca Dry Lake, deep inside the Nevada Test and Training Range’s (NTTR) Area Six has drawn a lot of interest over the better part of a decade. For those who keep tabs on the physical developments out at Area 51 and across the sprawling NTTR , the installation has become a regular location to pull up on satellite imagery providers like Google Earth. So far, photos of this shadowy facility have been limited entirely to those taken from space. That is until now. The photo in question came to my attention via the fantastic Dreamlandresort.com website—a must-read, long-running, and very down-to-earth trove of information about Area 51 and its surroundings for those who are just venturing into the intriguing subject. Forum user “Gabriel” came upon the picture and linked it for others to see. Its origin is anything but secret. The company who installs many of the so-called “tension-membrane” clamshell hangars and structures that dot military bases across the U.S. and beyond had posted it prominently on their website , among photos of other projects. It is unclear how long the picture had been on the company’s site, but it just took the right person with a familiarity of the base’s unique layout to point it out. From what we have been able to gather over the years , the base is used as a test site for modifications, sensor development, and unique payload integration work aboard medium-sized drones like the MQ-9 Reaper , and possibly smaller ones, as well. Reapers have been seen fairly routinely in satellite imagery. There are other far less remote sites that deal with similar tasks, but this installation, buried deep within the restricted airspace and terrain of the NTTR, provides a place to flight test more exotic and classified modifications, sensor systems, and payloads away from prying eyes. Google Earth Google Earth Roughly six to a dozen aircraft are thought to be based there, along with a light manned aircraft that provides chase duties for test flights. The facility, which sports a 5,000-foot long by 75-foot wide runway, doesn’t serve a single military branch, it provides support across the DoD, federal agencies, and for the CIA’s expansive drone fleet. Lockheed Martin, in particular, seems to have a deep connection to the site, which was drastically expanded from a fenced-off helicopter pad and hangar into what it is today beginning in late 2004. In other words, it was born during the height of the Global War On Terror and the ballooning of the U.S. government’s drone fleet.

You can see the Nuclear Device Assembly Facility at the bottom of the photo. You can read more about this fascinating structure and the surrounding area in this past article of ours. , Google Earth The old airstrip on nearby Yucca Dry Lake seems to be largely disused today. This is probably at least due in part to the newer and far more pristine strip being installed so nearby. The last known project to use Yucca Airstrip on the dry lakebed was Lockheed Skunk Works’ P-175 Polecat flying wing drone, which flew around the same time as when the new facility was being constructed. This hangar facility with access to Yucca Airstrip on the dry lakebed was likely used for the testing of the P-175 Polecat. This image was from early 2005, when the new facility to the east was still under construction., Google Earth Building contractors putting photos of their work done at military sites , even somewhat sensitive ones , before they become operational is not all that uncommon, but doing so with a base that is this secretive is somewhat unique. Although the photo doesn’t show us anything revolutionary, it does give us a far better sense of place and scale of the little airbase and its infrastructure, which is dominated by a clamshell hangar that has four smaller buildings of a similar design connected to it. Those are likely workshop and administrative spaces to support various programs. One or some of them could also be used to support maintenance of the aircraft stored inside the main bay. Also prominently shown are the two large open-air shelters that can house multiple drones before and after flight operations. Full image from Sprung.com’s website., Sprung.com Although we can’t say for certain what has been developed there in the past or what is being developed there now, there are certainly exotic capabilities that have emerged for this specific class of drones. These include everything from all-seeing and downright revolutionary wide-area aerial surveillance (WAAS) systems to Hellfire missiles that deploy sword-like blades to slide a particular target to death without killing many others in the process. MQ-9 equipped with Gorgan Stare WAAS system in Afghanistan. , DoD Today, directed energy payloads are being eyed to revolutionize what a drone like the MQ-9 can do. New micro-munitions will also give even smaller drones the ability to strike targets with pinpoint precision and give larger ones far deeper magazine depth. There are also indications that a number of even more sci-fi-like and shadowy capabilities equip some of America’s drones, you can read about that here . So, yeah, this base is likely quite significant and focused on bringing ‘bleeding-edge’ capabilities to certain facets of America’s drone forces, the heart of which is based just 25 miles to the south at Creech AFB.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",North Korea’s New Ballistic Missile Submarine Is A Refurbished Antique (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has offered the first glimpse of its “new” diesel-electric ballistic missile submarine, or SSB. However, rather than a successor to the country’s first SSB, the lone example of the Gorae class , official state media showed premier Kim Jong Un inspecting what appears to be a significantly modified 1950s-era Romeo class attack sub. North Korean state media first began to publish pictures from Kim’s visit to the Sinpo Shipyard, the country’s hub for submarine production. Government censors blurred out the rear portion of the sail of the boat in question in one image, strongly suggesting that this is where one or more tubes for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) are located. North Korea has already developed a solid-fuel SLBM that could potentially carry a nuclear warhead, known within the country as the Pukkuksong-1 and to the U.S. Intelligence Community as the KN-11. The country has also demonstrated a land-based derivative, the Pukkuksong-2 or KN-15, and is reportedly in the process of developing a new SLBM, known as the Pukkuksong-3 . “The submarine [was] built under the meticulous guidance and special attention of Supreme Leader of the Party, state, and armed forces Kim Jong Un [and] will perform its duty in the operational waters of the East Sea of Korea [Sea of Japan] and its operational deployment is near at hand,” a item from the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) read. “He [Kim] stressed the need to steadily and reliably increase the national defense capability by directing big efforts to the development of the naval weapons and equipment such as [the] submarine. … he elaborated on the immediate duty of and strategic tasks facing the field of national defense science and submarine industry to carry out the plan.” The use of the word “strategic” make very clear that the North Koreans envision a nuclear mission for this submarine and other future SSBs. This would make sense given the parallel development of the nuclear-capable Pukkuksong series of missiles. Pukkuksong-1 has an estimated range of around 745 miles, while Pukkuksong-2 may be able to strike targets at least 1,240 miles away, putting all of South Korea and Japan well within range of a submarine armed with either of those weapons, even from areas very close to North Korea’s territorial waters. The submarine Kim inspected appears to be a heavily modified Romeo class design with a substantially larger sail. Not only is the sail it longer, but it is also significantly wider. Kim Jong Un, in gray in the foreground, talks to other North Korean officials while inspecting a modified Romeo-class submarine. This picture shows the significantly larger sail, along with the censor’s blurring, which strongly indicates that this is a ballistic missile submarine., North Korean State TV capture KCNA KCNA The Soviet Union first introduced the Romeo class attack submarine, an evolution of immediate post-World War II designs based on late-war Nazi U-boats, in the 1950s. It subsequently shared the design with Communist China, who began producing local variants known as the Type 033. In the 1970s, the North Korean subsequently received a number of Chinese-built Type 033s, as well as kits to construct their own examples. A standard North Korean Romeo class submarine., KCNA At its peak, North Korea’s Romeo fleet had around 20 boats in total, though it is unclear how many of these remain serviceable now. It is not clear whether this new-ish SSB is a conversion of one of the remaining active Romeos or if Sinpo rehabilitated a previously inactive hull and then modified it for its new mission. The new sail with SLBM launch tubes, rather than placing those tubes in the main hull, also harkens back to early Soviet SSB and nuclear-powered SSBN designs, such as the Golf class and Hotel class . Otherwise, it seems to retain many of the Romeo ‘s other design features, including the twin-screw propulsion arrangement and angular forward hull. This is all somewhat curious given the existence of the more modern Gorae class design , also known within the U.S. Intelligence Community as the Sinpo-B , which has a general hullform that appears to taken design cues from the North Korea’s smaller midget submarines, such as the Sang-O class and Yono class . The lone Gorae successfully demonstrated its ability to launch a Pukkuksong-1 missile in 2016 after a number of earlier tests . That same year, satellite imagery of the Sinpo Shipyard showed what appeared to be an entirely new submarine under construction , which subsequently became known as the Sinpo-C . Reports later indicated that this boat would be a successor to the Gorae and might have a submerged displacement of around 2,000 tons and a beam of between 23 and 36 feet. Gorae , which experts believe has just one launch tube in its sail, has an estimated submerged displacement of 1,650 tons and a beam of just a little over 21 feet. A grainy photo of Kim Jong Un, at left, watching personnel load a Pukkuksong-1 missile onto the Gorae ahead of the successful launch in 2016., North Korean State Television The basic Romeo class design is slightly smaller than the projections for the Sinpo-C and also has a completely different hullfrom from the Gorae . This raises the question of whether or not the submarine Kim recently inspected is actually the Sinpo-C or if North Korea is still working separately on an entirely new design, which would be a relatively complex and costly endeavor. Converting older Romeos to SSBs could offer a potentially lower-cost and lower-risk avenue for Pyongyang to expand its ballistic missile submarine capabilities. It would also likely be easier for North Korea, which is under heavy international sanctions, to source parts for these older submarines. Those same sanctions may have limited North Korean shipbuilders’ ability to acquire more modern technological components and other materials necessary for new submarine designs, though the country does have extensive sanctions-busting networks in place. Still, while the thoroughly dated base design will significantly hamper the ability of these SSBs to remain undetected, it would still offer additional ways for North Korea to distribute its nuclear arsenal and provide a limited second-strike capability . Even a relatively loud diesel-electric submarine would require potential opponents, such as South Korea and the United States, to devote significant anti-submarine resources to constantly track its position and monitor its status, too. This Romeo SSB could also offer a way around North Korea’s self-imposed moratorium on the test of long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, as the regime in Pyongyang does not understand this to cover SLBMs. Depending on how close the submarine actually is to getting launched and putting to sea, even for tests, the boat could be a useful tool for pressuring the United States and South Korea in the course of future negotiations over sanctions and other issues. KCNA In May 2019, North Korea conducted multiple tests of a new short-range ballistic missile using two different kinds of transporter-erector-launchers, another move that did not technically violate the country’s stated moratorium, but was still clearly aimed at sending a message to its opponents. The North Koreans are almost certainly planning some sort of response to upcoming U.S.-South Korean military exercises , which the regime in Pyongyang says violates the spirit of declarations it has signed with Seoul and Washington in 2018. The emergence of the submarine may also be an expression of North Korea’s frustration with the lack of further substantive negotiations with the United States, which were supposed to get something of a jumpstart following Trump’s historic visit to the country last June. Despite this, the two nations continue to be something of a diplomatic deadlock . The country’s foreign ministry has already publicly speculated that it might terminate the self-imposed testing moratorium in response to this lack of subsequent progress. The demonstration of a “new” SLBM capability would certainly be a very visible statement in this regard. Regardless, the appearance of the Romeo SSB makes it clear that North Korea continues to make significant investments in SLBM capabilities , in general, as well as in submarine and solid-fuel rocket technology to support those developments. North Korea’s submarine programs have long had significant implications for the security situation in the region, and beyond, and the appearance of this new boat only reinforces that this is an area that deserves close attention. UPDATE: 7:30pm EST— CNN has reported, citing an anonymous U.S. official, that the United States has been aware of the submarine in question for over a year. However, this does not necessarily rule out that North Korea is still working on a separate, new-build ballistic missile submarine in addition to the modified Romeo .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has disputed that one of its military aircraft violated South Korea’s national airspace over a small grouping of islets in the Sea of Japan, as well as reports that South Korean fighter jets fired approximately 360 20mm cannon shells in a series of warning shots during the altercation. The incident occurred during a joint Russian-Chinese aerial patrol involving two Tu-95MS Bear bombers and an A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft from Russia’s military flying together with a pair of China’s H-6K bombers . The confrontation occurred on July 23, 2019 , local time, as the Russian and Chinese aircraft flew into the South Korean Air Defense Identification Zone, or KADIZ , prompting the South Korean Air Force to scramble F-15K Slam Eagle and KF-16C/D Viper fighter jets, also sometimes referred to as F-16Ks, to intercept them. The incident turned more serious when the A-50 reportedly flew over actual airspace South Korea claims above the set of islets , which it refers to as Dokdo. Japan also claims these as its national territory, calling them collectively Takeshima, and registered its own complaint that the Mainstay had violated Japanese national airspace. “The Air Force instantly deployed multiple jets, including F-15Ks and F-16Ks, and sent warning messages to it in accordance with operation manuals,” an unnamed officer from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Yonhap News Agency . “But the plane [the A-50] did not respond, so one of our aircraft fired some 10 rounds of flares and 80 warning shots.” The F-15K and the F-16K each carry a single M61A1 20mm Vulcan cannon , a six-barrel Gatling gun that fires up to 6,000 rounds per minute. A total of 80 warning shots would equate to just under a one-second-long burst from one gun. The A-50 left, but returned again to the airspace above the islets relatively soon thereafter, prompting South Korean jets to fire another 10 flares and 280 warning shots, according to South Korean officials. South Korea says this is the first time a foreign aircraft has ever violated its national airspace since the end of the Korean War. Officials in Seoul made formal complaints to both the Russian and Chinese ambassadors to South Korea over the flights around Dokdo/Takeshima and in the KADIZ. Japan’s Ministry of Defense subsequently released pictures of the A-50, seen at the top of this story, as well as the other Russian and Chinese aircraft, from its own intercepts. In addition, it provided a map that also asserted that the Mainstay had flown within the territorial limits around the islets. Japanese officials also lodged a separate complaint about the South Korean jets flying in airspace over what they claim as their national territory.

They did confirm that South Korean jets had deployed flares, but that the Bears had ignored them since they were flying in international airspace. “It is not the first time that South Korean pilots have unsuccessfully tried to disrupt the Russian aviation’s maneuvers over the neutral waters of the Sea of Japan, citing a self-imposed ‘air defense identification zone,'” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement on July 23, 2019. “However, these zones are not envisioned by the international rules and, therefore, are not recognized by Russia, which has been repeatedly communicated to the South Korean side through various channels.” “No warning shots were fired by South Korea’s fighter jets,” the statement continued. “If the Russian pilots felt a security threat, the response would follow quickly.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Телеканал ""Звезда"" (@zvezdanews) What is curious about the Russian response is that neither the South Koreas nor the Japanese says it was the Tu-95s that flew into their national airspace in the Sea of Japan. The Kremlin has made no statement about the A-50, which is at the center of allegations. China, which was not involved in the altercation according to any of the parties, has said it had no additional information about the incident. South Korea, as well as Japanese, intercepts of Russian and Chinese aircraft are a regular occurrence in the Sea of Japan, as well as the East China Sea, where there are various territorial disputes. The annual totals for these intercepts have risen and fallen in recent years , but appear to be on the rise again now. In January 2019, Japan said it had intercepted a record number of Chinese intelligence and surveillance aircraft in these regions between April and December 2018. In 2016, Japanese authorities had said that the Japan Air Self Defense Force had carried out a record number of intercepts , though the frequency of these sorties decreased the following year . This new incident comes as China, in particular, is stepping up its routine aerial and naval activity in Northeast Asia , as well as in the more hotly disputed South China Sea , demonstrating an increasing ability to project power beyond the mainland. In recent years, Russia has also increased its own routine, long-distance aerial patrols in the Pacific Region, including off the coast of the United States. At the same time, military-to-military ties between Russia and China have been steadily growing . Beyond the disputed incident over the islets in the Sea of Japan, this mission reflected the first time Russian and Chinese bombers had flown a joint long-range aerial patrol. This increased Russian-Chinese cooperation is an important development for both South Korea and Japan. Its impact has already been felt with regards to how Moscow and Beijing have been expanding their ties with North Korea. But the incident over Dokdo/Takeshima islets shows that the ramifications extend well beyond the geopolitics of the Korean Peninsula. While neither Russia nor China make claim to those islets, China, in particular, has other ongoing territorial disputes with both South Korea and Japan . The Kremlin and Japanese authorities also remain locked in a disagreement over the Kuril Islands , which has prevented the two countries from ever signing a formal World War II peace deal. So, while it is unclear why Russia might have violated the airspace over Dokdo/Takeshima in this instance, it, along with China, certainly have reasons for wanting to assert their respective authorities in the region. They have also routinely demonstrated their desire to challenge South Korean and Japanese claims, as well as the ability of their premier ally, the United States, to respond to these sorts of provocations. The U.S. Department of Defense has since expressed its support for both of its allies and their responses to the airspace violations. South Korea’s reported decision to fire actual warning shots at the A-50 is an unprecedented show of force, by any standards . It would certainly seem to reflect how serious Seoul feels about the evolving geopolitical situation in the region. By every indication, Russia and Chinese aerial patrols, including joint long-range missions, will continue to be a routine occurrence near disputed areas and may even increase. It remains to be seen whether South Korea’s assertive response, in this case, will also increasingly become the norm. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 15, 2019",Divisions With U.S. Emerge As U.K. Proposes European Force To Protect Tankers From Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three days after Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, seized the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz , U.K. authorities have announced plans to safeguard the country’s commercial shipping interests in the region, including establishing a new European-led maritime task force.  At the same time, the U.K. government has pointedly said that its policies will be separate from those of its U.S. counterparts , exposing a notable rift between the two allies on how to respond to escalating tensions in the region. U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt outlined the U.K. government’s immediate response plan to the Stena Impero ‘s capture in a statement to the country’s parliament on July 22, 2019. The IRGC boarded and took control of the tanker, which U.K.-based Northern Marine Management operates and that Swedish shipping company Stena A.B. owns, as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz on July 19, 2019 . Iran claims that the ship was “violating international maritime rules,” but has yet to specify what rules the ship was in breach of or provide any evidence to substantiate this assertion. For weeks, Iranian officials had threatened to seize a British ship in a tit-for-tat retaliatory act over U.K. authorities continuing to impound the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 over sanctions violations. “I … urge Iran to release the Stena Impero and her crew and observe the rules that safeguard commercial shipping that benefit Iran as much as any other country,” Hunt said in his statement to Parliament. “Iran has tried to present this as a tit-for-tat incident following the Government of Gibraltar’s action on 4 July to enforce E.U. [European Union] sanctions by preventing the Iranian chartered tanker Grace 1 from supplying oil to Syria, but there is simply no comparison between Iran’s illegal seizure of a vessel inside a recognized shipping lane where the Stena Impero had every right to be and the enforcement of E.U. sanctions against a tanker that had freely navigated into the waters of a British overseas territory.” Though the ship is British-flagged, there are no British nationals among Stena Impero ‘s 23-member crew, which includes a mix of Indians, Filipinos, Russians, and Latvians. India, at least, has begun separate negotiations to secure the release and repatriation of its citizens from the British-flagged ship, as well as from the Riah , another tanker Iran recently seized over allegations of fuel smuggling. After his opening summary of the situation, which he called a “hostile act,” Hunt then formally announced that the U.K. Department for Transport had advised all British-flagged ships to avoid Iranian waters and the Strait of Hormuz, something that had been previously reported . He also asked that any British-flagged ships that insisted on making the transit alert U.K. authorities of their decision “to enable us to offer the best protection we can.” There are already fears that this may have farther reaching impacts on international trade, especially the price of oil, if operators and owners in other countries follow suit and begin avoiding sailing through the region. Despite the advisories, HMS Duncan , one of the U.K. Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers , which are some of the service’s largest and most capable surface combatants, is rushing to the region to relieve the smaller Type 23 frigate HMS Monstrose and will be on call to escort any British ships in the area. The United Kingdom had also previously announced this swap-out. Montrose has already escorted a number of ships safely through the Strait of Hormuz, but was reportedly an hour away from Stena Impero when the IRGC captured her. HMS Duncan ., Brian Burnell via Wikimedia Lastly and most importantly, Hunt said that the United Kingdom was working to create a European maritime protection mission to further protect shipping in the region and that HMS Duncan would eventually join that multi-national force. It is not clear if the U.K. government’s plan is for this to be a European Union-led mission, given that the United Kingdom is separately working to extricate itself from that political and economic bloc as part of a process commonly known as Brexit . “We will now seek to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to support safe passage of both crew and cargo in this vital region,” Hunt said . “The new force will be focused on free navigation, bearing in mind that one-fifth of the world’s oil, a quarter of its liquefied natural gas, and trade worth half a trillion dollars pass through the Strait of Hormuz every year.” Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt arrives at No. 10 Downing Street to attend a meeting on July 22, 2019, that Prime Minister Teresa May had called to discuss the situation regarding the Stena Impero ., Press Association via AP Images Hunt said that he had spoken with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, earlier in the day, and that he had discussed how the U.K. government’s proposed European maritime force might complement U.S. military-led efforts in the region. On July 19, 2019, U.S. Central Command had announced the beginning of Operation Sentinel , a proposed multi-national effort with many of the same general objectives as the plan Hunt has now announced. “The responsibility … falls to the United Kingdom to take care of their ships,” Pompeo had said on Fox and Friends earlier on July 22, 2019, though it’s unclear if this came before or after his call with Hunt. “The United States has a responsibility to do our part, but the world’s got a big role in this too – to keep these sea lanes open.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo., Department of State Some had criticized Pompeo for not appearing to offer sufficient support for one of America’s longest-standing allies. But whether or not his comments were a snub to the British government, it is hard not to see Hunt’s subsequent statement as a very and public rebuttal of U.S. policy toward Iran. Hunt made clear that the proposed European maritime mission would be separate from the U.S-led Operation Sentinel. “It will not be part of the US maximum pressure policy on Iran, because we remain committed to preserving the Iran nuclear agreement,” he added. The United States pulled out of the multi-national deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018. Since then, the United Kingdom, along with France and Germany, have struggled to keep the deal alive, going so far as to create a financial mechanism to help work around U.S. sanctions against Iran. Iranian authorities have still accused the European powers of failing to adhere to the agreement and recently began enriching uranium above the limits outlined in the JCPOA. So far, this seems to be a calculated and reversible decision aimed at forcing additional concessions from the European trio. At the same time, the United States has placed increasingly painful sanctions on Iran, particularly on its oil exports, as part of the aforementioned “ maximum pressure ” campaign. Since May 2019, tensions between the United States and Iran have been steadily escalating after the U.S. government announced that it had still nebulous intelligence that pointed to increased risks of attacks from Iran and its regional proxies on American interests across the Middle East. In June 2019, the situation reached a boiling point when the U.S. military almost launched strikes against Iran after the IRGC shot down a U.S. Navy drone flying over the Gulf of Oman. There have also been reports that the United States is stepping up covert and clandestine actions against Iran, including cyber-attacks . These activities may have now taken a blow since Iran announced on July 22, 2019, that it had broken up a spy ring that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had formed in the country. A total of 17 Iranian nationals were sentenced to death or long prison sentences as a result. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZPikaApJ7ro Trump and Pompeo have both denied the Iranian claims, but the regime in Tehran has insinuated that they had been able to uncover the spies by exploiting compromised communications software the CIA had distributed to its contacts. However, Yahoo News had first reported on this security breach among the CIA’s contacts in Iran, citing numerous anonymous sources, in November 2018. This was also how China reportedly busted up a CIA spy network, which had led to dozens of executions in that country. At the same time, the increasingly aggressive U.S. policy toward Iran, and concerns that it might explode into a broader regional conflict, only appears to be deepening a divide between U.K. authorities and President Donald Trump’s Administration that has been growing for years. This has been due to a number of issues, including Trump’s persistent criticism of America’s European allies, saying they are not contributing their fair share to the NATO alliance. Recently, Kim Darroch, the U.K. Ambassador to the United States resigned after a leak of diplomatic cables in which he was highly critical of the Trump Administration, saying the President himself was “inept,” “clumsy,”  and “incompetent.” After the IRGC seized Stena Impero , U.K. authorities reportedly asked if Trump could avoid making any inflammatory statements or threats toward Iran that could upset their negotiations to get the tanker released. The United Kingdom has also worked hard to separate the matter of Grace 1 and Stena Imperso from both the issues surrounding the JCPOA and the U.S. maximum pressure campaign. There are unconfirmed reports that the United Kingdom detained Grace 1 on intelligence from the United States, though the U.K. government says it is in violation of E.U. sanctions targeted at Syria. Foreign Secretary Hunt has said the United Kingdom could release the Iranian tanker if Iran can provide firm evidence that it was headed to a different country as the regime in Tehran claims. There is also a claim that the United Kingdom rejected offers of U.S. military support to guard British ships in the Strait of Hormuz to avoid getting wrapped up in U.S.-Iran tensions. It remains to be seen how the United Kingdom’s latest statements might impact the ongoing negotiations over the fate of both tankers. Though it clear that the U.K. government’s position is that Iran has illegally detained Stena Impero and her crew, Iranian authorities have to be cognizant of the fact that the United Kingdom has very publicly broken ranks with the United States over the issue of “maximum pressure” and about maritime policing in and around the Strait of Hormuz. U.S. officials must also be aware of the significance of this rift over how to tackle Iran, which is certainly not a benign actor in the region, becoming so public. American allies actively working in opposition to the maximum pressure campaign can only undermine whatever effects it might have in curbing Iran’s malign behavior. How the United States and the United Kingdom go from here may not only determine how the two countries do or don’t cooperate with regards to Iran, but also how their long-standing “special relationship” might evolve going forward, in general.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",What’s The Deal With Army Helicopters Flying A Secret New Mission Over The Capital?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has been quietly conducting a new classified operation involving at least 10 UH-60 Black Hawks in and around Washington, D.C., for months. This mission came to light after the service asked Congress to shift $1.55 million in funds from one part of its budget to another in order to support the operations and maintenance of the helicopters. Bloomberg was first to report on this “emerging classified flight mission” after obtaining an Army reprogramming request. The $1.55 million for this operation is part of a broader request to funnel approximately $2.5 billion in total from various parts of the service’s budget to other areas that it feels are of greater importance. By law, all the branches of the U.S. military have to ask permission to reallocate funds that Congress has already approved for other purposes. “Soldiers from assault helicopter company and aviation maintenance units will be supporting the mission with 10 UH-60s and maintenance capabilities for four months,” the request says, according to Bloomberg . “Without additional funding, the Army will not be able to perform this classified mission.” The document does not identify any units specifically or offer any details about the classified operation itself. Wayne Hall, an Army spokesperson, declined to offer any additional specifics to Bloomberg , but did say that the mission had begun early in the 2019 Fiscal Year, which started on Oct. 1, 2018, and had an “undetermined” end date. However, the $1.55 million would also pay for the construction of a new “Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility,” or SCIF, at Davison Army Airfield , which is part of Fort Belvoir in Virginia. SCIF is a term used to refer to offices or other structures built to exacting government standards so that the occupants can handle and discuss classified information inside without being heard of having that data seen or otherwise intercepted. You can read more about SCIF requirements and how they work in this past War Zone piece . Davison Army Airfield at Fort Belvoir in Virginia., Google Earth The SCIF, together with the mention of the Black Hawks, strongly points to the unit in question being the Army’s relatively obscure 12th Aviation Battalion, which is based at Davison. This unit flies a mix of UH-72 Lakota light utility helicopters and UH-60s, including a handful of modified and luxurious VIP-configured “Gold Top” Black Hawks. The 12th is part of what is known today as The Army Aviation Brigade , or TAAB, which also includes a fixed-wing VIP aviation detachment and ground support elements, including air traffic controllers, to manage operations at Davison or other locations, as necessary. The battalion’s primary day-to-day job is providing helicopter airlift support in the greater Washington, D.C. area, which the U.S. government refers to as the National Capital Region (NCR). This can include shuttling senior officials from the Army and other branches of the U.S. military around, as well as members of Congress and visiting foreign dignitaries, depending on the exact mission at hand. The 12th is one of a number of U.S. military aviation units , which you can read about in more detail here , which conduct these types of missions in and around the nation’s capital. On top of that, the 12th has a far less well-known mission as part of the U.S. government’s extensive “ continuity of government ” planning to keep running in the event of a major disaster, widespread enemy attack, or other crises. In such a scenario, the battalion would help fly top lawmakers and other senior U.S. government officials to secure sites, including Camp David , Mount Weather , and Raven Rock . You can read more about the U.S. continuity of government planning in this past feature at The War Zone . The 12th is also responsible for providing airlift for the Army’s unique 911th Engineer Company (Technical Rescue), the service’s premier urban search and rescue unit. The 911th would be critical to helping extract important officials from damaged or collapsed buildings in any contingency. Previously known as the Military District of Washington (MDW) Engineer Company, the unit notably had a chance to demonstrate its capabilities while supporting the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon. They’re also the only unit tasked to provide this kind of support at the White House . Members of the 911th Engineer Company signal a UH-60 Black Hawk from the 12th Aviation Battalion during sling load training at Davison Army Airfield in July 2019., US Army What’s curious in this case is that Army spokesperson Hall confirmed that the mission that the reprogramming request is referencing is new and has, at most, been ongoing for almost 10 months. This might mean that the Army has expanded its role in the continuity of government plan, or that that planning itself has evolved in some way, but it could also reflect the service taking on an entirely new mission. Since 9/11 and the establishment of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) in 2002, the U.S. military has also taken on greater domestic roles in general. At the same time, as The War Zone has explored on multiple occasions , the extent of the U.S. military’s activities in the Washington, D.C. area, as well domestically within the United States, in general, can be difficult to assess. These missions can involve some of the most secretive special operations units , as well as personnel from other federal , state, and local government agencies. This world of domestic military operations, and even training exercises , can be so nebulous that even Congress has found itself unsure as to the scope of this activity in the past. In 2014, lawmakers said that they would withhold funding for U.S. Special Operations Command’s top unit in the National Capital Region – referred to variously as SOCOM-National Capital Region (SOCOM-NCR), the Joint Interagency Task Force-National Capital Region (JIATF-NCR), or simply the Interagency Task Force – until they got a clear report describing its roles and missions. Still, there have been developments that may offer some clues as to what kinds of expanded or new missions the 12th, or even a new Army helicopter unit in the NCR, might be tasked with now. In 2016, SOCOM also became the lead entity within the U.S. military if there is a need to neutralize a hostile weapon of mass destruction (WMD), either abroad or the United States, taking over this mission from U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). SOCOM subsequently established a Counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction-Fusion Center (CWMD-FC), which The War Zone was first to report , at an unspecified location within the NCR. US Army Special Forces soldiers wearing gas masks during a training exercise., US Army Then there’s also SOCOM’s own theater command aligned with NORTHCOM, Special Operations Command North (SOCNORTH), to handle special operations, including counter-terrorism activities, across North America. Just days before the revelation of the Army’s new classified domestic mission in Washington, D.C., a contracting announcement indicated that SOCNORTH’s dedicated Crisis Response Team (CRT) is also in the process of improving its capabilities. The CRT is based much further west at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, which is also where NORTHCOM’s headquarters is located. The CRT recently received six modified Chevy Suburban communications vehicles from the White House Military Office (WHMO) and is in the process of reconfiguring them to better support their operations, according to a recent contracting announcement. These vehicles are very likely ex-command and control and communications vehicles, also known as Roadrunners, that commonly accompany the Presidential motorcade, something The War Zone has previously covered in depth . A Chevy Suburban Roadrunner., Paul Carter The White House Communications Agency, part of the WHMO, recently obtained new Ford Super Duty-based vehicles with a much more powerful communications and data-sharing suite, that The War Zone was the first to report on in detail. This likely freed up some of the Roadrunners to go to other agencies that were interested in them, such as SOCNORTH. The White House Communications Agency’s new communications vehicles are modified Ford Super Duties, similar to the one seen in this picture. The White House versions notably feature a large satellite communications dome on top., The Armor Group These civilian style vehicles could be ideal for more discreet operations, including in urban areas within the United States, though there’s no mistaking that they have a specialized purpose given the array of antennas on top. SOCNORTH’s CRT plans to convert the vehicles to use a new suite of military radios and satellite communications systems, but this will still require distinctive antenna arrays. NORTHCOM, as a whole, has a major counter-terrorism focus. The command runs a major counter-terrorism exercise each year called Vital Archer , which includes participants from other U.S. government agencies, as well as foreign emergency management and security services. The Army’s new secret mission might also involve providing aviation support, including surveillance of particular targets or critical sites, to other domestic agencies engaged in domestic counter-terrorism missions. The service’s Black Hawks could also be assisting in some way with NORTHCOM’s other standing mission sets, including counter-narcotics and guarding America’s borders , though it’s not clear why this would necessarily be limited to the NCR. Of course, even though the Army’s new classified D.C. area mission may not have a clear endpoint, it may still be a shorter-term mission in response to intelligence regarding a more specific potential threat or another similar near-term requirement. In the past few years, there has been a seeming uptick in U.S. military units, as well as federal law enforcement tactical teams , training or otherwise operating in urban areas within the United States , or at least an increase in people taking notice of these activities . In the Washington, D.C. area, this has coincided with a reported increase in noise complaints about government helicopters and other aircraft flying over residential areas. News of a new Army aviation mission in the capital region could spur new criticism from residents in this regard. But whether or not the Army is now engaged in a new, secretive long-term mission or has gotten new orders in response to more immediate concerns, we know the service’s aviation elements in and around the nation’s capital have expanded the scope of their critical duties, at least for the moment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 1, 2019",Letter From The Editor About An Exciting New Phase For The War Zone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I want to talk a bit about what I have been working on over the past few months, but especially the last couple of weeks. I needed to take the time to execute a plan I have come up with that should take what we do here to the next level. In just three years, this site has become more than I ever imagined it would be. That is thanks to all of you , our readers, more than anyone else. Now it is time for this place to evolve in hugely positive ways. These changes won’t appear drastic. Hopefully, you will only notice them in passing, but they will have a major impact on how we operate internally and on the future of TWZ. The reality is that just two people make up the content-side of The War Zone. Joe and myself. It’s always fun when new defense industry, defense department, and media contacts ask about our operation. I always get the same response when I tell them we are a team of two—they had no idea the site wasn’t far larger personnel-wise than it actually is. Usually, their reaction is anything from sort of stunned to nearly alarmed! I truly believe in the lean and mean concept of operations and we have always been the little fighter that could punch way, way above their weight class. In fact, I see our size as an advantage, not a disadvantage, in many ways. But the fact of the matter is that there is so much more that we could be doing. There is just only so much capacity two guys, no matter how passionate they are or how extreme their work ethic is, can provide. On top of that, we are known for breaking news analysis, huge features, and daily content that is unrelated to news events. In addition, we cover air, sea, land, space, some cyber, and roll it all up with a heavy dose of geopolitics. We also do major history pieces and even do humor and pop culture from time-to-time. It is an astonishing amount of ground to cover and to remain up to speed on for two dudes. Simply put, there is nowhere like this on the internet and there is a good reason for that, producing this site is a full-on lifestyle, not a job. I don’t intend to change that in any way. Even on the worst day around here, I can say I truly love what I do and feel absolutely blessed to have the opportunity, freedom, and support to do it. Even with these factors and limitations in mind, I want to press down harder on the pedal to get us to a point where we are not capped by our need for sleep or the burnout factor, which let’s face it, both of us are far beyond at this point anyway. Wanting something and realizing it are two very different things. To be totally honest with all of you, I have had a hard time figuring out a way to expand while also keeping the quality and consistency what so many have come to expect—or more like demand—from us. On top of this, my goal was to try and build a model that is really scalable and efficient. This is precisely where my focus has been. The problem is, this place just isn’t the best fit for most traditional reporters with a narrow beat or someone who cranks out 700 words blogs for some tech site. Few have the breadth of knowledge on tap to write about all these topics and navigate the intricacies of how we handle each one of them. So, I began to look for people from very unique backgrounds, of different levels of expertise, and with an emphasis on non-traditional experience. Above all else, any candidate would have to be really passionate about conveying great stories and valuable information on our platform. On top of all this, I also wanted to introduce a small number of entirely new segments to our feed that really don’t exist anywhere else. Some of these will more directly address the awesome trends I have noticed in our commenting section and especially in our awesome “Bunker Talk” open discussion forum —a concept that continues to amaze me with each passing week. I had my doubts, but after working with a select handful of potential new contributors, challenging them with absurdly tough assignments, and seeing if they could stand the scrutiny of me incessantly red-teaming every word of their work, I have been downright impressed by the result. You have only seen glimpses of this over the last month or so, but there is much more to come, as you will see very soon. Keep in mind, not one word gets published on this site without my approval. This is no bullshit. There has never been a single post that went up without a full look from me and all my notes being integrated into it prior publishing. Not one. Every single article goes through the content wringer before it goes up. Anything I can think of that needs to be inserted, nuanced, changed, removed, reworded, or any extra research that needs to be done, gets done before publishing. And you know what? Joe reads every single one of my pieces and shoots me any notes he has, as well. I am not finicky about bylines or credit, but rest assured, every new contribution will have everything in it I would add or subtract. This is the only way the quality and rolling narrative of the site will stay intact. I was worried that this would not be achievable, but by selecting the right people to do the job, those that get what this site is all about and were avid readers before joining the team, it is. In fact, what I am seeing is that these unique voices have the potential to greatly benefit the site in exciting new ways. And so far, the ones that I have moved forward, each and every one of them has one trait in common—they really do love a challenge and look to enhance their skills at any chance they get. So yes, The War Zone is expanding and bringing a small group of new talent to bear to the immense swathe of topics we cover. As these select contributors get up to speed on all the crazy ins and outs of what we do and how we do it, I will have more time to get back to my own work. But it was absolutely key that I take advantage of the dog days of summer to drill down and see if all this can work—to get a system in place that I was comfortable with and to empower and guide our new contributors so that they can send increasingly polished finished product for me to look at. But once again, I can’t stress enough, I am right there in the development of these pieces, as well. That doesn’t mean I should get all the credit, far from it, our new teammates have worked ridiculously hard on the stories they are producing, but just remember you are getting the same highly refined content that you have come to expect from us, no less. With that in mind, if you want to complain about something in the weeks to come, do it to me. Also, these new contributors are not primarily here to do the bread and butter work. I am expecting them to be feature writers first. They are people that can take us to brand new places and do deep investigative work to break ground on tough topics and stories. Beyond a few new bylines that will be popping up in the days to come, I am looking at leveraging new capabilities to enhance what we do, as well. In some cases, these may be relatively groundbreaking to the defense journalism world. More on this soon. In addition, thanks to our highly-supportive owners, we have been given access to new resources that will help with really dialing in TWZ when it comes to user experience. A ton of work has gone on behind the scenes over the last six months to catch us up to where we had to be at the very minimum, now we are going to further optimize the site in multiple ways. So keep an eye out for that, as well. Like I mentioned early on, it is my hope that none of this will be drastically apparent to even our most seasoned readers and our commenting crew. But all this is laying the groundwork for a really bright future for the little backwater channel of the internet we call home. So, as always, let me know what you like and don’t like. And give our new writers a chance to get settled in, although I don’t think they are going to need it. You have already met a couple of them, and some may be far more familiar than you ever imagined. But suffice it to say, next week should be a fun one at TWZ as we have a couple of huge things coming from these new additions. It’s also worth mention toning the stark reality that there will be growing pains. Maybe not every contributor or new segment will work out in the end, so keep that in mind as we move forward. The nature of the site has always been experimental, so none of that should be too surprising. This is all happening as we continue to provide the same awesome coverage you have come to expect from us. And yes, another “Confessions Of” super feature should be posted soon, and it is sure to be a reader favorite. Finally, I want to thank everyone who reads The War Zone , including those who send me awesome tips and introductions, who share our posts and interact with us on social media, who convey their awesome stories directly to us, who grab a shirt or two when we do special runs with Blipshift (just wait for the offering on August 1st!), and especially to our commenting crew who makes every day so much fun around here. With all that said, it’s time to phase out the A model and upgrade to the C model!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 23, 2019",Iran Has Followed Through With Its Threat To Capture A British Tanker In The Middle East (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, says that it has seized the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz . This follows threats to retaliate over U.K. authorities seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar earlier this month. It is also the latest in a string of incidents involving Iran in the region, including the U.S. military downing an Iranian drone in the Strait and the IRGC’s admission that it had seized a Panama-flagged tanker on suspicion of fuel smuggling, both of which occurred just yesterday. Ship spotters using online tracking software first came to suspect Iranian forces had captured Stena Impero after it abruptly changed its course earlier on July 19, 2019, and began sailing toward Iran’s Qeshm Island. The tanker’s stated destination had been Al Jubail in Saudi Arabia. The IRGC subsequently announced that it had taken control of the ship. Northern Marine Management, a U.K.-based subsidiary of Swedish Company Stena AB, which owns the ship, also confirmed that the Iranians had seized the tanker and its 23 crew members after approaching it with small boats and a helicopter. The IRGC has said that it detained Stena Impero “for breaching international maritime law “ as it transited the Strait of Hormuz, but has not provided any further explanation so far for this justification or evidence of the ship’s purportedly illicit behavior. Iran has been threatened to seize a British tanker or otherwise engage in some form of tit-for-tat retaliation against the United Kingdom over the Grace 1 , which has been impounded in Gibraltar since July 4, 2019, over sanctions violations. Iran denies that Grace 1 was heading to Syria as the United Kingdom alleges, which would violate European Union sanctions, but Iranian authorities have not offered any evidence of an alternative destination. On July 19, 2019, British officials had extended the detention of Grace 1 for another 30 days, which drew criticism from Iran, which claimed the decision contravened promises from U.K. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt to release the tanker. However, Hunt had publicly stated that this would only be possible if Iran could provide verifiable assurances that the ship’s final destination was not Syria. On July 10, 2019, IRGC fast boats had harassed the British-flagged tanker British Heritage in the Strait of Hormuz, but were warned off by the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose , which was escorting it at the time. It is unclear whether Stena Impero had an escort at the time of this incident, but this would appear to have not been the case. The Royal Navy had announced recently that it was sending the Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan to the Middle East to take the place of the Montrose in a routine swap-out . So far, the British Ministry of Defense publicly says that it is seeking more information about the circumstances surrounding the IRGC’s detention of Stena Impero . There are unconfirmed reports that the U.K. government has convened a so-called Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms meeting, or COBRA , something that occurs to bring top officials together to discuss responses to major national crises. Tensions in the region have been steadily rising between Iran and various countries, especially the United States , for months now , in general. On July 19, 2019, the IRGC admitted that it had detained another tanker, the Panama-flagged Riah , on July 14, 2019. This came after the Iranian Foreign Ministry claimed that Iranian forces had towed this ship into the country’s territorial waters after it experienced a technical fault and issued a distress call. The circumstances surrounding that incident remain murky . Later that same day, the United States also announced that U.S. Marines on board the U.S. Navy’s Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer had brought down an Iranian drone with a vehicle-mounted anti-drone electronic warfare system while sailing through the Strait of Hormuz. Subsequent reports indicated that a number of Iranian aircraft and boats had also harassed the Boxer and other ships in its convoy as they transited the area. Iran has denied losing a drone and has since released footage from what appears to be a fixed-wing Mohajer series drone, judging by the landing skids visible in the video clips, flying over the ships. Details in the footage align with pictures the U.S. Navy has released itself and also adds weight to the United States’ assertion that the unmanned aircraft, as well as Iranian helicopters, had flown relatively close to the ship during the incident. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 3:20pm EST— There is the possibility that Iran may be in the process of seizing a second tanker, the U.K.-owned, but Liberian-flagged Mesdar . So far, there does not appear to be an official confirmation from the IRGC that it has detained another ship. A White House spokesperson also told the BBC that the U.S. government was aware of the still-developing situation. “The U.S. will continue to work with our allies and partners to defend our security and interests against Iran’s malign behavior,” they added in their statement. UPDATE: 3:25pm EST— U.S. President Donald Trump has told reporters that he has heard reports that a second tanker might have been seized, but does not confirm or deny that this is the case. He also did not say how the United States might respond to the incident. UPDATE: 3:30pm EST— CNN is now reporting, citing anonymous U.S. defense officials, that the IRGC has also seized Mesdar . UPDATE: 4:05pm EST— According to CNN , citing unnamed U.S. defense officials, at least one unspecified U.S. military aircraft is providing armed overwatch for a U.S. cargo ship passing through the Strait of Hormuz. There had also been an indication that Iranian forces might have seized a third tanker, but the behavior of LR2 Posiedon does not match that of either Stena Impero or Mesdar during their captures. In addition, The Telegraph newspaper in the United Kingdom is reporting that there are no British nationals on board Stena Impero . It is not clear whether or not this is the case with Mesdar , but the multi-national makeups of their crews could turn the situation into a broader international incident. Russian nationals, for instance, are among Stena Impero ‘s crew. UPDATE: 4:15pm EST— Mesdar ‘s transponder has reportedly come back on and indicates that the ship is moving away from Iran. The Iranians now deny that they had detained it and claim they had simply stopped it to inform its crew of environmental and maritime regulations in the area. Iran has now also claimed that it detained Stena Impero had left the designated shipping lane, turned off its transponder, and refused to respond to Iranian warnings. This would directly conflict with the publicly available tracking information from the ship’s transponder that show it slowing, stopping, and then turning toward Iran. In the meantime, it appeared that HMS Montrose , or one of the Sandown class minehunters the Royal Navy has in the region, arrived on the Strait of Hormuz. possibly to begin a patrol to try to prevent and further seizures from occurring. However, the ship then abruptly turned around and began heading in the opposite direction. UPDATE: 5:50pm EST— U.K. Foreign Minister has warned that Iran will face unspecified consequences if it does not release the Stena Impero , but has said his country is not considering military options at this time. He added that Iran would be the “biggest loser” if it decided to restrict freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. Department of Defense has also now issued a statement saying that unarmed, rather than armed aircraft are monitoring the situation. Separately, there have been unconfirmed reports that Iran may be planning to begin routinely boarding and inspecting foreign oil tankers ostensibly to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. This could make it difficult for ships to avoid seizure in the future, as failing to stop for such a check could also give Iranian authorities a pretext to detain a ship. UPDATE: 8:50pm EST— In light of today’s events, the United Kingdom has issued an advisory warning all U.K. shipping to avoid the Strait of Hormuz for an “interim period.” U.S. Central Command has also issued a statement regarding Operation Sentinel , a new multi-national effort to “ensure freedom of navigation in light of recent events in the Arabian Gulf region,” which has been in the works for some time already. The full statement is as follows: “U.S. Central Command is developing a multinational maritime effort, Operation Sentinel, to increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in the Middle East to ensure freedom of navigation in light of recent events in the Arabian Gulf region. The goal of Operation Sentinel is to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (BAM) and the Gulf of Oman. This maritime security framework will enable nations to provide escort to their flagged vessels while taking advantage of the cooperation of participating nations for coordination and enhanced maritime domain awareness and surveillance. While the United States has committed to supporting this initiative, contributions and leadership from regional and international partners will be required to succeed. U.S. officials continue to coordinate with allies and partners in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East on the details and capabilities required for Operation Sentinel to enable freedom of navigation in the region and protect vital shipping lanes.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 9, 2019","Marines Winding Down Weapon Systems Officer Position, F/A-18Ds To Fly With Pilot Only","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In our exclusive report on the integration of single-seat F/A-18C models into traditionally two-seat F/A-18D ‘all-weather’ Marine strike-fighter squadrons, and vice-versa, The War Zone has learned that the Marines are in the process of winding-down the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) position entirely. Once existing WSOs filter out of the Hornet community, the remaining missionized (not trainers) F/A-18Ds will be operated by just a pilot. Captain Christopher Harrison, a Communications Strategy Officer for Marine Corps’ headquarters in the Pentagon, replied to The War Zone’s follow-up question regarding the fate of Hornet WSOs as such: “The Marine Corps is no longer accessing WSOs. However, all WSOs currently in service and training will be utilized in F/A-18Ds until the platform is deactivated or there are no more WSOs in the fleet, whichever comes first. Further, we do not expect the Marine Corps to man F/A-18Ds with two pilots (i.e. a pilot replacing the WSOs spot) once we reach a point where there are no longer WSOs in the Fleet. A pilot can fly and execute all missions in an F/A-18D without a WSO in the backseat (i.e. keeping the seat empty). Having a WSO simply adds increase proficiency in certain mission skills, such as FAC(A) [Foward Air Control-Airborne].” VMFA(AW)-224 ‘Bengals’ Hornet seen during overseas operations. , USMC The writing was on the wall for the WSO job in the USMC’s tactical aircraft community ever since the service decided to move to an all F-35B and F-35C fighter force. But a series of factors, including the Navy largely retiring its Legacy Hornet fleet in favor of buying new Super Hornets and the USMC not prioritizing retiring the Hornet or the Harrier as new F-35s are delivered, seems to have impacted the timeline of the WSO’s demise and the unique identity of the Marine all-weather strike fighter squadrons they work for. Once the last WSO leaves the fleet, it will mark the end of a long heritage of Marine fighter and attack aircraft that leveraged the two-crew concept of operations for the service’s most challenging tactical air missions. This includes decades of operations of F-4 Phantoms with Radar Intercept Officers and A-6 Intruders with Bombardier Navigators onboard. Just earlier this year, the Marines also said goodbye to their only other multi-crew tactical jet that was in service, the EA-6B Prowler. That aircraft has no direct replacement within the USMC. The Legacy Hornet still has at least a decade of service left in it with the USMC. 84 of the jets are going to be updated with powerful Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, along with other smaller upgrades, that will give them a whole new level of capability as they venture into the twilight of their flying careers. Ed Darack via Getty Images Still, it’s bittersweet to see the end of the Marine all-weather tactical jet squadron and the two-person crew concept that gave those units enhanced abilities over their single-seat counterparts. At least if any of the fully missionized F/A-18Ds are still floating around in units that will primarily fly the single-seat C model, another pilot could jump in the back if a bit more situational awareness is needed for certain missions. But that isn’t the same as having a specialist WSO onboard who has focused their entire fast-jet career on mastering all the tactical tasks aside from flying. The WSO position will still be going strong in the U.S. Navy for decades to come as its F/A-18Fs make up a substantial portion of the fleet and there is no end in sight for the USAF’s WSOs which man a more diverse set of platforms.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2020",Marine Anti-Drone Buggies On USS Boxer Knocked Down “Threatening” Iranian Drone (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon says that personnel on the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer knocked down an Iranian drone that came within a “threatening range” as the ship sailed through the volatile Strait of Hormuz . Subsequent reports said that a U.S. Marine Corps all-terrain vehicle with an anti-drone detection and jamming system sitting on the ship’s flight deck brought down the unmanned aircraft with an electronic warfare attack. President Donald Trump was first to announce that Boxer had taken defensive action in the Strait of Hormuz during a press conference at the White House on July 18, 2019. The Pentagon subsequently released a statement regarding the incident. The amphibious assault ship, which is carrying elements of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, was sailing in a convoy at the time that also included a Harpers Ferry class dock landing ship, an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, and the expeditionary sea base USS Lewis B. Puller , a highly specialized vessel the War Zone has profiled in-depth in the past. A Henry J. Kaiser class underway replenishment oiler was also present for at least a portion of the voyage. The first-in-class USS Harpers Ferry was likely the dock landing ship that was sailing with Boxer as that ship is presently assigned to the Boxer Amphibious Ready Group . Puller , one of the Navy’s main anti-mine warfare platforms, which is capable of supporting MH-53E Sea Dragon mine-sweeping helicopters, is permanently deployed to the Middle East region. “The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone, which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down, and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship’s crew,” Trump said. “The drone was immediately destroyed.” The Pentagon’s complete statement, from chief spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman, was as follows: “At approximately 10 a.m. local time, the amphibious ship USS Boxer was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz. A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached boxer and closed within a threatening range. The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew.” So far, Iran does not appear to have confirmed or denied the incident. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters that he had “no information” to offer. Neither Trump nor the Pentagon has, so far, identified the drone in question. Iran operates a wide array of different fixed-wing unmanned aircraft of different sizes. Iran has armed some of these designs, but we do not know if the drone in this case appeared to be carrying any external weapons or was a kinetic weapon itself. Even without external weapons, the drone could have presented a real threat to the Boxer and personnel on board, either by acting as a loitering munition or otherwise harassing or interfering with the ship’s operations, especially the launch and recovery of any aircraft or helicopters from its flight deck. A mass drone attack , to say nothing of one from an actual swarm of unmanned aircraft networked together, could overwhelm the defenses on even the most heavily defended ship and wreak havoc. CNN initially reported that personnel used a “soft-kill” electronic warfare attack rather than a missile, such as the ship’s RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM), or a gun system, such as the Phalanx Close-in Weapon System (CIWS). Fox News then subsequently reported that the system in question was the Marine Corps’ new Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System ( LMADIS ). Pictures the Navy has released of the Boxer making the transit in the Strait of Hormuz already showed a specially configured 4×4 Polaris MRZR associated with LMADIS on the ship’s forward flight deck. The LMADIS buggy parked on Boxer ‘s forward flight deck., USMC LMADIS, which you can read about in more detail in this past widely circulated War Zone piece , consists of a pair of MRZRs, both of which are equipped with the RADA RPS-42 hemispheric air surveillance active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar system. One them also has a CM202 sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras. The CM202 offers an additional means of positively identifying potential threats that the RPS-42s detect. If it becomes clear that the target is hostile, Marines can then use a Modi jammer to disrupt the drone’s links to its ground control station, potentially causing it to crash. The Marine’s specifically developed LMADIS to respond to the ever-growing threat of small unmanned aircraft . In January 2019, USS Kearsarge , another Wasp class ship, deployed the same system as it passed through the Suez Canal. An LMADIS buggy during an exercise., USMC If the electronic attack doesn’t deter or destroy the unmanned aircraft down, Marines can switch to a kinetic option, such as the FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense system, or MANPADS. In recent years, the U.S. military has been upgrading the Stinger specifically to make it more capable against small drones. In a maritime scenario, the aforementioned point defense systems on Navy ships could also engage the drone. Iran using drones to harass U.S. ships, as well as aircraft , in the Persian Gulf is hardly new and it has largely taken the place of the much riskier practice of doing so with small, manned boats. In 2016, Iranian forces notably flew very close to the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her associated strike group. The Iranians regularly release video from these flights, especially of major warships, such as carriers, for propaganda purposes. But Boxer ‘s transit through the Strait of Hormuz comes at a time of particularly high tensions between the United States and Iran. In June 2019, things took a particularly worrying turn when Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down a Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) drone flying over the Gulf of Oman. The United States almost retaliated by striking targets in Iran . In addition, there have been a number of attacks and other incidents linked to Iran involving commercial oil tankers in the region in recent months. Earlier on July 18, 2019, the IRGC had announced that Iran had detained the Panama-flagged tanker Riah over alleged fuel smuggling. So, it’s also not surprising that, beyond the LMADIS, the pictures the Navy released also highlighted other components of the layered force protection capabilities the ship can employs while passing through these kinds of high-risk areas. One shows a Navy MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter armed with Hellfire missiles and a 50 caliber machine gun escorting an Iranian Navy Bell 212 helicopter away from the Boxer . Another offers a good look at a Marine AH-1Z Zulu Cobra attack helicopter carrying, among other weapons, an AIM-9M Sidewinder air-to-air missile, which it could use to engage other helicopters, low-flying aircraft, or small drones. A US Navy MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter from Boxer , at right, flies alongside an Iranian Navy Bell 212 helicopter in the Strait of Hormuz., USMC The AH-1Z was also carrying AGM-114 Hellfire missiles as well as a pod full of laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) 70mm rockets, all of which these helicopters could employ against swarms of small boats that might threaten the Boxer . This is in addition to the helicopter’s 20mm cannon. Other pictures showed Marines on the ship’s deck with small arms providing very close-in defenses. An AH-1Z assigned to the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit conducts a patrol during Boxer ‘s transit through the Strait of Hormuz., USMC In recent years, the Marines have also taken to strapping HMMWV and Growler light tactical vehicles , as well as LAV-25 light armored vehicles, to the decks of amphibious ships during sensitive transits to provide extra force protection with their turreted machine guns and automatic cannons. Putting TOW anti-tank guided missile launchers, which can also just provide added situational awareness thanks to their electro-optical and infrared sighting systems, up on the deck has also become increasingly common. When it comes to LMADIS, the system represents a stepping stone toward a more robust array of short-range air defense options that the Navy and Marines, as well as the U.S. Army and Air Force, are working on now, including various directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-power microwave beams. But, as one can see from the Boxer’s encounter with the Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, this capability to defeat lower-end threats is already extremely valuable. UPDATE: 8:45pm EST— The Wall Street Journal had a reporter on board the USS Boxer during the transit. That paper has now reported that there were a number of other instances where U.S. and Iranian forces came relatively close to each other in the Strait of Hormuz beyond the drone shootdown and the MH-60R escorting the Iranian Navy’s Bell 212 away from the ship. The Navy convoy passed a number of Iranian fast boats along the way, but there does not appear to have been direct altercations with them. An unspecified larger Iranian warship also sailed within 500 feet of Boxer . Lastly, an IRGC Y-12 twin-engine turboprop , an aircraft the organization’s air arm uses for surveillance missions, flew near the Boxer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Here’s What We Know About The Missing Tanker Iran Now Says It Has Seized,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, says it seized an unnamed foreign tanker in the Strait of Hormuz last weekend for allegedly being involved in an operation to smuggle fuel oil out of the country. The IRGC subsequently released video footage that confirms the ship in question is the Panama-flagged Riah , which turned off its transponder and effectively went missing on Saturday. This also follows Iran’s harassment of a British oil tanker, British Heritage , as it passed through the Strait last week and comes amid growing tensions between Iran and the international community , in general. On July 18, 2019, the IRGC released an official statement regarding the seizure. The organization says that its naval arm seized the tanker on July 14, 2019, that there were 12 foreign crew members aboard at the time, and that it was carrying one million liters – just over 264,000 gallons – of fuel. The ship was south of the Iranian island of Larak in the Strait of Hormuz, which links to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, when IRGC personnel seized it. The IRGC alleges that small civilian ships, commonly known in the region as dhows , had brought fuel illicitly to the ship and that the crew intended to leave the region and conduct further ship-to-ship transfers to then offload its fuel for shipment on to unspecified destinations. It is possible that the tanker was actually involved in illicit activity, but Iran has yet to present any hard evidence of this. The Iranian government heavily subsidizes gasoline, in particular, which has created a significant incentive for individuals to buy it at low prices in Iran and then smuggle it elsewhere to then sell it at a profit. This has created an odd situation where Iran, which routinely experiences shortages of gasoline due to limited domestic refining capacity and international sanctions, has to further contend with smugglers shipping what is available out of the country. The IRGC did not initially name the tanker it seized over the weekend, but it did say that it had a total capacity of two million liters, though it was only carrying one million liters at the time. Even before the IRGC released video footage showing the tanker, ship spotters noted that this would match up well with the estimated capacity of the 223-foot long Riah . This helps explain some of the mystery surrounding what had happened to that ship, but it also raises new questions, including about whether smuggling allegations. This Panama-flagged tanker had been sailing in the Persian Gulf of July 13, 2019, before online ship tracking software showed it slow down and come to a stop in the Strait of Hormuz. It subsequently switched off its transponder. Three days earlier, at trio IRGC boats had harassed the British-flagged tanker British Heritage in the Strait of Hormuz, so there was immediate speculation that the Iranians had captured Riah . The incident surrounding the British tanker appeared to be in retaliation for U.K. authorities seizing the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar over sanctions violations on July 4, 2019. Where things started to get confusing was when Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on July 16, 2019 , that Iran had towed an unnamed foreign oil tanker into Iranian waters after that ship had experienced a technical problem and issued a distress call. “A foreign oil tanker encountered problem in the Persian Gulf due to technical failure, and the Iranian forces, in accordance with the international regulations, rushed to help it after receiving a mayday distress call, and pulled it toward the Iranian waters with tugboat to carry out the necessary repairs,” Mousavi explained. This official statement came two days after the IRGC now says that it detained Riah over the smuggling allegations. Also on July 16, 2019, an anonymous United Arab Emirates official told The Washington Post that Riah had not issued a distress call. Who exactly owns Riah is also murky. Publicly available information says Prime Tankers, LLC in Dubai is the operator. However, the same UAE official who told The Post that the tanker had not issued a distress call also denied that Emirati companies owned or operated the ship or that there were any Emirati nationals among its crew. It is worth noting that six tankers were victims of attacks off the coast of the UAE in two separate incidents, one in May and another in June , but only one of those ships was actually flagged in the UAE. The U.S. government has alleged that Iran or its regional proxies were responsible for both sets of attacks, but officials in the UAE have downplayed this . Earlier this month, the UAE also announced that it was drawing down its forces in Yemen and would shift its focus away from fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that country and instead concentrate on operations against the Al Qaeda and ISIS franchises there. Curiously, the U.K. government says that it is working to get more information about the Riah and Iran’s conflicting claims, according to the BBC . This could point to a British owner or operator or that U.K. nationals are among the ship’s crew. If any of that is true, it could indicate that the IRGC may have targeted the tanker in order to follow through on its threats of tit-for-tat retaliation over the continued detention of Grace 1 in Gibraltar. On July 13, 2019, U.K. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt had also revealed that British authorities could be willing to release the Iranian tanker if authorities in Iran could provide assurances that the ship was not heading to Syria. Officials in Gibraltar say that they seized Grace 1 because it was heading to a Syrian port, which would violate European Union sanctions. Iran has denied this , but has also declined to provide any evidence that the ship was actually sailing to another destination. The detention of Riah also comes as tensions between Iran and the international community are steadily growing, in general. Beyond the matter of Grace 1 , Iranian authorities have been increasingly critical of the United Kingdom, as well as France and Germany, accusing them of failing to abide by the terms of the controversial agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Iran now says it is enriching uranium above the limits outlined in that deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), leading the United States and others to assert that Iran is putting itself closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon. The United States pulled out of the JCPOA in 2018. There remains no clear evidence that Iran is looking to build nuclear weapons. Iranian authorities also appear to be taking deliberate, easily reversible steps on enrichment in an attempt to push the remaining parties to the JCPOA, which also includes Russia and China, to offer new concessions, including sanctions relief . The Riah ‘s seizure, whether it turns out to be legitimately over smuggling or not, as also follows months of escalating concerns about the safety of commercial shipping passing through the Strait of Hormuz and tensions between the United States and Iran have grown since May. The situation came to head in June, when the IRGC shot down a U.S. Navy drone flying over the Gulf of Oman, which in turn almost resulted in American strikes on targets in Iran. “The United States strongly condemns the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy’s continued harassment of vessels and interference with safe passage in and around the Strait of Hormuz,” the U.S. State Department said in response to the IRGC’s announcement that it had seized Riah . “Iran must cease this illicit activity and release the reportedly seized crew and vessel immediately.” The Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer has also just sailed into the Persian Gulf, but, according to the U.S. military, this is unrelated to the situation surrounding Riah specifically. The U.S. government is already in the process of crafting a new international coalition that will step up patrols in the region to monitor for nefarious Iranian activity and guard commercial shipping, but this plan is still very much a work in progress by all accounts. “We’re engaging now with a number of countries to see if we can put together a coalition that would ensure freedom of navigation both in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford told reporters on July 10, 2019 . “So I think probably over the next couple of weeks we’ll identify which nations have the political will to support that initiative and then we’ll work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities that’ll support that.” Separately, the United States is also continuing to bolster its own forces in the region, including a recently reported buildup in at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, which CNN was first to report on July 17, 2019. Since May 2019, there has been a steady stream of additional U.S. combat aircraft, including F-22 stealth fighters and B-52 bombers , U.S. Navy ships , and other American forces , into the region. The U.S. government is otherwise continuing with its policy of “maximum pressure,” which includes a steadily expanding sanctions regime against Iranian entities and those linked to the country. On July 18, 2019, the United States hit four Iraqis , including two leaders of Iranian-backed militias, with sanctions over human rights violations. With regards to the case of the Riah specifically, it will be very interesting to see how that situation develops now that Iran has admitted to having detained the tanker and what impact that might have on overall regional tensions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 11, 2019",U.S. F-35s Won’t Hit 80 Percent Mission Capable Goal Amid Spare Parts Supply Problems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mark Esper, the nominee to become the next U.S. Secretary of Defense, has told Congress that F-35 Joint Strike Fighter fleets across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy fleets will not reach an 80 percent mission capable rate goal by the end of the present fiscal year. Esper said that the main reasons for this were difficulties in sourcing spare parts and distributing them to units in a timely manner. His revelations come as the Pentagon moves ahead with efforts to find alternate suppliers for certain components for the stealthy fighters to fill the gaps left by the Turkish government, and the country’s defense contractors by extension, getting kicked out of the F-35 program over its purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems . This is a process that will cost the U.S. military between $500 and $600 million and the Pentagon is already raiding budgets specifically set aside for spare parts to help pay for it. “Transparency (canopy) supply shortages continue to be the main obstacle to achieving this [readiness target],” Esper said in a written response to a question from the Senate Armed Services Committee, according to Breaking Defense . “We are seeking additional sources to fix unserviceable canopies.” A good view of the canopy on a US Air Force F-35A in the open position., USAF The Senate Armed Services Committee held a nomination hearing for Esper on July 16, 2019. The United States has been without a formal Secretary of Defense since James Mattis resigned in December 2018 . Then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan subsequently became Acting Secretary of Defense and looked set to become Secretary of Defense until controversial details regarding his personal life emerged publicly in June 2019, after which he withdrew from the confirmation process. In September 2018, Mattis had issued a memorandum demanding that the Air Force, Marines, and Navy do their utmost to get the mission-capable rates of their Joint Strike Fighter fleets up to at least 80 percent by the end of the next fiscal year. He also asked the Air Force to work on getting its F-16 Viper fighter jets and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to this same readiness level. The Navy received the same instructions with regards to its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and that service, along with the Marine Corps, got the same marching orders for its F/A-18 Hornets, too. Fiscal Year 2019 ends on Sept. 30, 2019. The Air Force has already acknowledged that the F-22 will also not meet Mattis’ readiness goal by that time, though its F-16s will, according to Breaking Defense . In April 2019, the Navy said it was getting close to the target with its Super Hornets. The status of the legacy Hornet fleets, which have also suffered from very low availability in recent years, is unclear. In 2018, the Navy decided to transfer 136 F/A-18s , which the service was already planning to divest, to the Marine Corps to help that service improve the readiness rates of its Hornet units . Esper’s admission that the F-35s will not reach the 80 percent mission capable rate by the end of September is not necessarily surprising, nor is the assertion that spare parts issues are the key factors. Official data made public earlier this year showed that Air Force, Marine, and Navy Joint Strike Fighter fleets continued to struggle with dismally low availability rates as recently as the end of last year. A set of graphs showing average availability rates for all three F-35 variants across the Air Force, Marines, and Navy between May and November 2018., GAO Between May and November 2018, just the lack of spares and problems with getting available parts to units in need left F-35s across the U.S. military unable to fly at all 30 percent of the time on average, according to a report the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released in April 2019 . That same report also specifically noted the canopy problem that Esper highlighted in his response to the Senate Armed Services Committee. A chart showing the average time for depot-level repair of an F-35 part as of November 2018 versus the objective turnaround timeframe of 60 to 90 days., GAO “DOD found that the special coating on the F-35 canopy that enables the aircraft to maintain its stealth failed more frequently than expected, and that the manufacturer could not produce enough canopies to meet demands,” GAO’s review of F-35 “supply chain challenges” explained. “To address these challenges, the program is looking for additional manufacturing sources for the canopy and is considering design changes.” More damningly, GAO’s analysts concluded that, given the state of the Joint Strike Fighter supply chain at the time, that U.S. military’s F-35 fleets would never be able to get above a 70 percent mission-capable rate even under the best of circumstances, as outlined in the chart below. Lockheed Martin has since told Breaking Defense that it is working to mitigate the canopy supply chain and design issues. GAO “Newer F-35 aircraft are averaging greater than 60 percent mission capable rates, with some operational squadrons consistently at or above 70 percent,” Lockheed Martin continued in its statement to Breaking Defense . “We’re taking aggressive action across the full F-35 enterprise to achieve the 80 percent mission capable rate target as soon as possible.” But the Pentagon’s main F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) may already be looking at new hurdles in meeting these readiness targets as a result of Turkey getting ejected from the program, which became the formal U.S. government position on July 17, 2019. The United States and other F-35 operators have concerns that Turkish forces flying the stealthy fighters and also operating the Russian S-400 air defense system could expose sensitive details about the jets’ signatures and other capabilities. “Turkey’s decision to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems renders its continued involvement with the F-35 impossible,” the White House said in a statement . “The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities.” Unfortunately, Turkish defense contractors have been responsible for producing more than 900 components used in the construction of new F-35s. Suppliers in Turkey are the sole providers of around 400 of those items , including the jet’s wide-area cockpit display. In June 2019, the Pentagon revealed that it was already working on a “disciplined and graceful wind down” of Turkish contracts related to the Joint Strike Fighter by the end of next year. In a press briefing on July 17, 2019 , Ellen Lord, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions and Sustainment, said that, as a result, companies in Turkey were set to lose approximately $9 billion in deals across the lifespan of the F-35. The first F-35A Joint Strike Fighter for Turkey on display at a rollout ceremony in June 2018., Anadolu Agency While the United States has already been working on finding alternate sources for these parts, it won’t be cheap. Lord said in her briefing that it will take between $500 and 600 million to complete the process. The Pentagon is treating the need to find new vendors for certain parts as an added “nonrecurring engineering cost” on top of what it is already budgeting to spend on buying additional Joint Strike Fighters, she added. It’s not clear if this includes $206 million in funds that the Pentagon has asked Congress for permission to shift into Navy budget accounts for the procurement of short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B and carrier-based F-35C variants, specifically to cover the costs of finding new suppliers. That same request, dated May 2019, but which only emerged earlier this month, also indicated that the Pentagon was planning to ask for another $155 million for the same reasons. What was more notable about this request was that the money would come out of other parts of the budget set aside for the purchase of F-35 spare parts. The Pentagon argued that it had cut costs and ended up with a surplus of funds in this account. Between what was already known about the F-35’s supply chain difficulties, together with Esper’s latest comments about spare parts being central to the Joint Strike Fighter’s continued readiness woes, it is hard to feel that Pentagon would have been well served by still using those excess funds for their intended purpose. At the same time, it’s certainly true that mitigating the loss of Turkey and Turkish defense contractors from the F-35 program is also a very pressing concern. It remains to be seen just how much of an impact on the readiness of Air Force, Marine, and Navy F-35s this decision will have in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 14, 2018",Northrop Grumman’s Optionally Manned Firebird Aircraft Has Its First Official Customers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up segment about a program that we have been tracking very closely over the last few years—Northrop Grumman’s potentially game-changing Firebird optionally manned medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) surveillance aircraft—we have new information regarding who will be operating the aircraft in the not so distant future. Although Firebird already has orders from U.S. government agencies that can’t be disclosed, it now has its first customers that can be. Those customers are Grand Sky and Tenax Aerospace. According to Northrop Grumman, Grand Sky, which has a primary operating location at Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota, is the country’s first unmanned aerial vehicle testing and training center. The facility is co-located with vast swathes of airspace that can be used for unmanned flights and has already been approved for beyond-line-of-sight (where satellite data-links provide connectivity) operations of unmanned aircraft. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawks, another Northrop Grumman product, are also based in Grand Forks. Grand Sky currently offers unmanned aircraft training, research and development, and support services, so it isn’t too hard to imagine how the ultra-flexible and low-cost Firebird fits perfectly into that portfolio. Thomas Swoyer Jr., President of Grand Sky, stated the following in an official Northrop Grumman press release: “We are excited to bring Firebird to Grand Sky and to utilize its long-endurance and variable payload capabilities for commercial customers. Our goal is to support energy infrastructure monitoring and humanitarian and disaster relief operations by leveraging Firebird’s range, altitude and endurance… We see the incredible efficiencies to be gained in the market with technology like Firebird, enabling affordable data gathering on a scale not previously available to the commercial market space.” The other customer is one that Northrop Grumman had discussed being deep in discussions with before regarding Firebird— Tenax Aerospace . The idea is that Firebird won’t only disrupt the surveillance aircraft market by being optionally manned and featuring extreme ease of converting the craft from manned to unmanned mode, and vice-versa, but that its low acquisition and operating cost will allow it to also break the mold when it comes to who can afford such a capability and when. Buying Firebird’s services turnkey as needed from a company that owns and operates the aircraft themselves, Tenax Aerospace in this case, or sharing them among a number of government or non-government entities, or even buying payload time on flights that are already planned, are just some of the ways the system can potentially break down the door when it comes to a much larger potential customer base accessing this level of surveillance capabilities. Tenax Aerospace’s Chairman, Tom Foley, stated the following in Northrop Grumman’s release: “Firebird allows Tenax Aerospace to bring industry-leading adaptability and flexibility in data collection at an extremely affordable price point to meet the needs of our sophisticated U.S. government and global security customers… Firebird provides a unique flexibility and responsiveness that we feel is essential for the critical missions we support today and in the future.” With two new customers now officially under its belt, both of which will help lay a foundation for future growth and exposure of Firebird to potential users and purchasers, the aircraft is set to make its air show debut at the Royal International Air Tattoo that kicks off on July 19th at RAF Fairford in England. The aircraft was flown over to the U.K. aboard a 747 freighter—an example of its designed-in ability to be easily disassembled and reassembled for international transport. Special shipping fixtures were fabricated for this inaugural shipment that will likely inform the design of future air-transport support systems for production Firebirds. The aircraft can also self deploy, but considering it is made to loiter at lower speeds, international trips may be better made by airlifting the aircraft into a region. Firebird during a test flight. , Northrop Grumman This all comes as Firebird has just successfully closed out its primary flight testing program. The Firebird team now looks to execute individual demonstrations for customers at various locations over the rest of the year and will work to further develop the system as needed based on the demands and input of those potential customers. The aircraft’s payload-carrying capability is totally modular in nature and it already has the ability to lug aloft a diverse menu of roughly two dozen sensors, communications systems, and electronic intelligence gathering payloads. Furthermore, it has been tested carrying five separate payloads internally simultaneously and the aircraft has three external hardpoints that could also be leveraged in the future. Northrop Grumman is targeting a huge array of users for Firebird, from militaries to law enforcement and border agencies to environmental and wildlife monitoring groups to the commercial sector. With this in mind, the program is openly inviting companies that may have applicable payloads to integrate them with the aircraft. As for performance, according to the Firebird team, the aircraft has proven to be even more efficient during flight testing than what its designers had originally modeled and it will be able to fly its 30-hour endurance or more at typical weights and configurations. Keep in mind, it is doing this using an avgas-sipping piston engine derivative that is common in the general aviation community. We’ll see if any other potential Firebird customers publicly show interest or even get announced as purchases at RIAT. Yet it is becoming clearer as time goes on that the success of Firebird may not be gauged by how many operators purchase it, but more so about how many entities consume the products it creates and the services it provides. We will keep you up to date as Firebird continues its rise on the international aerospace stage.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 15, 2019",Spanish Connection Emerges In Case Of Mysterious Qatari Missile Seized In Italy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Qatar has all but said that the French-made Matra Super 530F air-to-air missile that Italian authorities recently recovered was among those it sold to Spain 25 years ago. Police in Italy seized the missile, which was inside its specially-built container marked as being part of a sale to Qatar, during raids on Monday targeting individuals allegedly tied to far-right extremist groups. On July 16, 2019, Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lolwah Alkhater told Al Jazeera that the country’s authorities had immediately started their own investigation after the Italians found the missile and had been coordinating with their counterparts in Italy. Officials in Qatar quickly determined that the country had sold the missile decades ago, according to Alkhater. Italian police had conducted a number of raids on July 15, 2019, as part of a broader investigation into Italian neo-fascist groups who had been involved in sending individuals, as well as other aid, to fight against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. “The authorities in Qatar have immediately started an investigation alongside the respective Italian authorities and the authorities of another friendly nation to which the Matra missile was sold 25 years ago,” Alkhater told Al Jazeera . “The captured Matra Super 530 missile was sold by Qatar in the year 1994 in a deal that included 40 Matra Super 530 missiles to a friendly nation that wishes not to be named at this point of the investigation.” While Alkhater says that this “friendly nation” does not wish to be named, she has all but identified them with the other details she provided. In 1980, Qatar had purchased 14 Mirage F1 fighter jets from France, along with a compliment of Super 530F air-to-air missiles to go with them. A Qatari Air Force Mirage F1 prepares for a mission during Operation Desert Storm in 1991., DOD In 1994, Qatar sold the remaining 13 jets to Spain as part of a three-way deal that also included France. The Qatari Air Force sold spare parts for the aircraft and the remaining Super 530F missiles to Spain as part of the deal, as well. There were approximately 40 Super 530Fs in the package, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s international arms trade database . In 2013, Spain retired the last of its F1s, many of which had gone through a deep upgrade program starting in 1996 to bring them up to the more modern F1M standard. The ex-Qatari Mirages were not upgraded and had been among the first to leave service years earlier. Private “red air” aggressor provider Draken International has since purchased the remaining F1Ms and you can read more about these aircraft and their future lives in this past War Zone story . A Spanish Air Force Mirage F1., via Wikimedia Matra had introduced the Super 530F in 1979 specifically for the Mirage F1 and Spain would have had no use for these missiles after retiring those aircraft. What has happened to them since then is not entirely clear, though Spanish authorities say they demilitarized them and sold them as scrap. Italian officials have indicated that the weapon they recovered is live. “The 40 missiles acquired from Qatar were demilitarized in their entirety by the Spanish Air Force,” Spain’s Ministry of Defense said in a statement, according to Defensa.com . “[It is] the responsibility of the Italian authorities to determine, in view of the evidence, the true origin of the missile.” Still, one would imagine that authorities in Qatar and Spain have the serial numbers of all of the missiles included in the 1994 sale to check against. There has been speculation that Qatar might be covering up that it had been the one that lost the Super 530F, but this possibility seems particularly remote given that the Qatari Foreign Ministry has gone on the record to publicly link this missile to that 25-year-old deal. “Qatar is working very closely now with the pertinent parties including Italy to unveil the facts and it is very concerned as to how a missile sold 25 years ago ended up in the hands of a third non-state party,” Alkhater had added in her statement to Al Jazeera , suggesting that the country was coordinating with Spain on this issue, as well. In the midst of the demilitarization process, one of the missiles might have found its way onto the black market and then made its way through criminal networks to Italy, where authorities then found it during their recent raids. It is also unclear whether any Super 530Fs may have gone back to France as part of the 1994 arrangement, which would be another potential vector for the illicit sale. The reasons why the individuals in Italy, who have ties to far-right neo-fascist groups in that country, acquired the missile in the first place and what they might have planned to do with it remain unclear. There have been reports that Italian authorities had intercepted phone calls about a possible sale of the weapon for approximately 470,000 Euros – or just over $529,100 at the current rate of exchange – to “a foreign government official.” As The War Zone previously noted , the number of Air Force’s currently flying the Mirage F1, the aircraft Matra specifically designed the Super 530F for, is steadily dwindling. Libya and Iran, which both continue to operate small fleets of these fighter jets, remain high on the list of government parties that might have been interested in acquiring this missile. Libya’s U.N.-backed internationally-recognized Government of National Accord has been struggling to acquire additional weapons and other military equipment as it finds itself in an increasingly serious armed conflict rogue general Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army. Iran could also be interested in reverse-engineering the missile and building local derivatives, including versions for other platforms and roles, such as surface-to-air variants . Otherwise, the intelligence value of the missile, a 40-year old design that was widely exported, can only be diminished, as well. That said, there may still have been some market for the missile’s more sensitive components, including its radar seeker. Its 70-pound warhead could also be a source of explosives. But, for Italy, Qatar, Spain, and possibly France, figuring out exactly where this 530F went missing and how, as well as if there are any more out there, are likely more pressing concerns than determining who the prospective buyers for this particular missile might have been.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The U.K.’s Pint-Sized Martlet Missile Will Guard Royal Navy Ships And Much More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.K. Royal Navy Type 23 frigate has successfully destroyed a mock fast attack craft with a Martlet missile during a test in the Irish Sea. The ship fired the weapon using a new launcher assembly attached to one of its existing DS30M Mark 2 remotely operated 30mm cannon turrets. This new combination offers an easy way to add another layer of point defense capabilities to the Type 23s, as well as other Royal Navy ships, especially to protect against swarms of small watercraft and explosive-laden suicide boats , a threat that has become particularly pronounced in the Middle East in recent years . But the super-adaptable miniature missiles may also soon find their way onto new platforms, such as drones, and performing new roles, including short-range air defense. In total, HMS Sunderland fired four Martlets, also known as the Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM), during the test, according to an official Royal Navy news item dated July 16, 2019. The story did not say when specifically the event had occurred, but did say that it took place within the Aberporth Range at the southern end of Cardigan Bay off the coast of Wales. “The current defense against fast inshore attack craft, the 30mm gun, is highly effective for closer range engagements,” Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander George Blakeman, the Weapon Engineer Officer aboard Sunderland , said in a statement . “By adding the missile to the gun mount it is anticipated it will extend the reach of the ship’s defensive systems – key to successful defense against fast craft using swarm attack tactics.” The testing in Cardigan Bay also involved firing the 30mm gun to successfully demonstrate that there was no notable loss of accuracy from the addition of the missile launcher. The first of the four missile launches was specifically to see if the backblast and shock of firing would damage the cannon, the weapon mount, or the ship, which it did not. The last three launches involved missiles carrying telemetry recording equipment in the place of their warheads to track their flight performance At just over four feet long and with a weight of just under 29 pounds, Martlet is a small missile. For comparison, the U.S.-made AGM-114 Hellfire , which the U.S. Navy is integrating into its Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) to defend against similar threats , weighs more than 100 pounds and is over five feet in length. The latest variant of the much larger RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) is primarily used in the close-in air defense role, but also provides a similar anti-surface capability for many American and allied warships. The Thales-built Martlet missiles have multi-mode seekers that use beam-riding laser guidance to get close to the target and then switch to an imaging infrared seeker in the terminal phase of flight. This helps ensure a hit even if the laser beam gets disrupted for some reason. They also have a laser-ranging proximity sensor to trigger their small fragmentation warheads, which weigh roughly seven pounds, in the event of a glancing shot. Development of the Martlet, originally called the Future Air-to-Surface Guided Weapon (Light), or FASGW (L), began in 2008 and the U.K. Ministry of Defense placed an order for an initial batch of 1,000 missiles in 2011 specifically for the Royal Navy’s AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopters. Though the weapons were initially expected to enter service in 2015, the service does not expect the Wildcats to be flying with the small missiles until next year . The Wildcats have a pair of stub wings, each with two pylons, and any of those hardpoints will be able to accommodate five- or seven-tube clusters of Martlets, for a maximum load of 28 missiles. The Royal Navy had initially intended for the Wildcats armed with these missiles to provide protection for ships against swarming boat attacks. The helicopters will also eventually be able to carry the Sea Venom lightweight anti-ship missile to engage larger targets. But the Royal Navy has since decided that it also makes sense to integrate the missiles onto ships themselves to provide an additional defensive capability. This makes good sense as Lieutenant Commander George Blakeman noted, the missiles, which have a range of up to five miles, offer significantly greater range over the existing 30mm cannons. The development of a launcher that pairs the two weapons together will also make it easier to integrate the missiles onto existing and future ships . Thales had already been working on validating the Martlet’s surface-to-surface capabilities, including against small boats. The defense contractor revealed that it had conducted its own tests against these types of targets using a shore-based launcher earlier in July 2019. The ship-mounted system as it exists now uses the same five- or seven-round clusters, as well as the same all-up-rounds, as the air-launched version. This will also help reduce maintenance and logistics requirements. Type 23 frigates already have a pair of the 30mm cannon-armed DS30M Mark 2s , so adding the Martlets would give the ships 10 and 14 read-to-fire missiles. The DS30M remote weapon stations are also found on the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers and the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, among other ships. Unfortunately, the pairing may also limit the flexibility of the new weapons to some degree. The 30mm cannons and Martlets won’t be able to engage targets approaching from widely different vectors to the ship simultaneously. Still, the Martlet launchers will offer important additional capabilities for Royal Navy ships, as well as other U.K. armed forces platforms, which could further expand as time goes on. Thales has previously test-fired the missiles from a Schiebel Camcopter S-100 drone helicopter and a BAE Systems Fury unmanned aircraft. The weapon’s diminutive size makes it ideal for integration onto other unmanned aircraft, in addition to manned platforms. An S-100 helicopter drone on display with a launcher for the Martlet missile., MilborneOne via Wikimedia Thales also touts the missile’s basic design as a modular one that will be able to readily accept new warheads and guidance packages in the future. With the missile’s already small warhead, air-to-surface and surface-to-surface versions could be very useful for engaging small and sensitive targets where there might also be a greater risk of collateral damage. On July 4, 2019, the service also announced that Royal Marines also demonstrated shoulder-fired and pedestal-mounted versions in the surface-to-air role. These variants use launchers that appear similar the ones for the older Starstreak short-range surface-to-air missile. Thales had leveraged elements of the Starstreak design in the development of the Martlet, to begin with. This capability could make the ship-mounted versions useful for engaging enemy helicopters or small drones, in addition to small boats. A short-range air defense capability would make the missiles an even more valuable addition to the Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, which have very limited close-in defenses, at present. The Royal Navy has made no secret that the growing threat of swarming boat attacks and of manned and remote-controlled explosive-filled watercraft was the primary driver of the decision to develop the Martlet launcher for maritime applications. It has turned out to be a very timely decision. On July 10, 2019, three boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) boats harassed the U.K.-flagged tanker British Heritage as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz on its way out of the Persian Gulf and into the Gulf of Oman. HMS Montrose , another Type 23 frigate that was escorting the commercial ship at the time, successfully got in between the Iranian boats and the tanker and issued verbal warnings, after which the Iranians retreated. The frigate reportedly had its 30mm cannons trained on the boats during the incident. The Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose ., Crown Copyright This incident was almost certainly in response to authorities in the British territory of Gibraltar seizing an Iranian oil tanker on July 4, 2019, over sanctions violations. Various senior officials in Iran subsequently made threats to retaliate, including a pledge to seize a British tanker in response. Since the beginning of May 2019, the threat the IRGC’s fleets of small boats pose has already been increasing pertinent amid steadily escalation tensions between the regime in Tehran and the U.S. government, too. The United States has blamed Iran for attacks on a number of commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman across two separate in incidents, one in May and one in June . It is important to note, however, that the Royal Navy says that work on the ship-mounted Martlet launcher is at least five months old. This would mean the U.K. government made the decision well before the incident with British Heritage and before the U.S. government first said in May it had begun receiving intelligence pointing to an increased risk of attacks from Iran or Iranian proxies in the Middle East. This isn’t necessarily surprising. In the past few years, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, in particular, have employed remote-controlled boats in a number of attacks on both warships belonging to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and commercial ships in the Red Sea. A composite image that the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen released on July 9, 2019, showing low-profile “blow fish”-type remote control boats the Houthis had reportedly employed in attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea in 2018 and 2019., Government of Saudi Arabia By every indication, the Royal Navy is taking clear steps to give its Type 23 frigates, as well as other ships, an important additional layer of defense to help counter them. But this also looks like the next step in expanding the roles and applications for the Martlet missile, which has the potential to become a remarkably versatile addition to the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s arsenal in general.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 10, 2019",Here’s How North Korea Got Kim Jong Un His New Armored S600 Mercedes Maybach Limos,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report says that North Korean premier Kim Jong Un’s newest limousine, a late body armored Mercedes-Maybach S600s that first emerged publicly in February 2019, got smuggled into the country via a circuitous route that included stops in China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. The purchase and delivery of this vehicle, along with a second S600 in the same shipment, underscore North Korea’s extensive sanctions-busting networks , which this same investigation says has enabled the regime in Pyongyang to import more than 800 foreign cars and trucks, including luxury models, in total from multiple countries since 2016. The Center for Advanced Defense Studies, or C4ADS , a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, in partnership with The New York Times , released its report on July 16, 2019. The report also notes that analysts used “software and systems” from Palantir, a California-based software and big data analytics company with major ties to the U.S. Intelligence Community and the U.S. military , to support their work. The analysis focuses heavily on the particular case of two Mercedes-Maybach S600s, at least one of which appeared publicly for the first time just weeks before Kim met U.S. President Donald Trump for a second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. “High-end luxury goods share key features with dual-use goods for North Korea’s weapons program: they are scarce, specialized products with high monetary value and great symbolic importance for the Kim regime,” the executive summary for C4ADS’ report, titled Lux & Loaded , explains. “However, unlike dual-use goods, luxury products like armored Mercedes vehicles are easily identifiable on publicly available trade records and at port.” The exact origins of the S600s remain unclear. Daimler, which presently owns the Mercedes and Mercedes-Maybach brands, markets the armored Pullman Guard version of these vehicles specifically to VIPs, including government officials, and says it conducts background checks on all prospective buyers. The company has previously gone on the record to deny selling these cars, or any others, to individuals serving as fronts for North Korea. A screengrab from the official North Korean state media broadcast that first showed one of the new S600s earlier this year., North Korean State Television capture Part of the issue is that the cars may not actually be from-factory S600 Pullman Guards, but rather S600s that subsequently received an armor package from a third party company. In looking at the North Korean video footage from February 2019, NK Pro had pointed out some differences between the armor visible inside the door of Kim’s S600 from that of a standard S600 Pullman Guard. Whatever the case, in June 2018, the cars, each in separate shipping containers, arrived at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, according to C4ADS. A Dutch freight forwarding company, Slavenburg & Huyser B.V., then put them on a ship to Dailan, China. After arriving at the Chinese port, a Japanese trading company, Zuisyo Company, signed for the containers and had them shipped again to Osaka, Japan. While in Japan, another freight forwarding company called Mino Logistics Japan subsequently took responsibility for the containers and then sent them to Busan, South Korea, where South Korean firm Mino Logistics Company signed for them. C4ADS says it could not verify whether these two companies are related despite their nearly identical names. The route Kim’s new S600s took to get to North Korea, according to C4ADS’ investigation., C4ADS What happened after the cars arrived in Busan on Sept. 30, 2018, is the crux of the story. Reportedly, dockworkers loaded the cars onto DN5505 , a Togo-flagged cargo ship belonging to Do Young Shipping Company, which has its headquarters registered in the Marshall Islands. Shipping records indicate that Zuisyo Company had been the one to formally ship the cars to Do Young by way of the other freight forwarding firms. This is when things get murky. Shortly after taking on the cars in Busan, DN5505 set sail with its stated destination being Nakhodka, Russia and estimated arrival date of Oct. 5, 2018. The ship appeared to turn off its transponder on Oct. 1 and the signal did not reappear until Oct. 19, an 18-day gap. A map showing the positions of DN5505 before and after its “dark voyage” with the transponder off., C4ADS When the ship’s transponder began broadcasting again, it was heading back to Busan. C4ADS found no reports that the vessel had arrived in Nakhodka, or any of five other Russian Far East ports, on or about Oct. 5. However, after arriving in Pohang, South Korea, the ship’s crew informed South Korean customs officials that it had picked up a cargo of coal in Nakhodka. Also, on Oct. 7, 2018, Air Koryo, North Korea’s state airline, had dispatched three Il-76 Candid cargo planes to Vladivostok in Russia, which is around three hours driving distance to the east of Nakhodka. C4ADS says that Air Koryo’s Il-76s, which are capable of carrying vehicles and often bring limos and other cars to support Kim’s foreign trips, do make trips to Vladivostok, but they do so irregularly. The October visit, which was otherwise unscheduled and did not appear to be in relation to any other known North Korean state activity, was the first time any of the planes had flown there since July 2018. The belief is that the Il-76s then brought the S600s back to North Korea. Four months later, North Korean state media released video of Kim getting driven around in one of his new limos. All of this would seem circumspect enough to raise questions by itself, but Do Young and DN5505 are also at the center of separate allegations of violating sanctions with regards to North Korea. In February 2019, South Korean authorities seized DN5505 as part of an investigation into exports of North Korean coal in violation of international sanctions. That same month, South Korea detained the Panama-flagged tanker Katrin , the only other ship Do Young owns, on suspicion of delivery petroleum products to North Korea, again in violation of international sanctions. DN5505 ‘s owner appears to be Russian businessman Danil Kazachuk, who was also listed briefly in 2018 as Katrin’s owner, according to C4ADS’ investigation. Kazachuk, who also owns an auto shop in Vladivostok, denied being responsible for what the ships carried in an interview with The New York Times , but he was also flippant about whether or not he was aware of or involved in the smuggling of the S600s. “This is my company’s business secret,” Kazachuk told The Times by phone from Russia. “Why do I need to tell everybody where I bought these cars and to whom I sold the cars?” Separately, the United Nations is also investigating Enermax Korea for violating sanctions on North Korea. Enermax is also tied to the detention of the North Korean-flagged coal ship Wise Honest in Indonesia in April 2019. That ship is now in U.S. government custody . North Korea’s Wise Honest , which is now in U.S. government custody., AP Enermax has denied allegations that the coal on board DN5505 when it arrived in Pohang last year was actually from North Korea. Enermax also says it was working with a party in Indonesia to buy coal, but that that deal fell apart before any money changed hands. An unnamed representative for the company also called into question how the ship could have carried the cars at all in an interview with NK Pro . “There is a ship hatch on a coal vessel,” the Enermax official explained, according to NK Pro . “We open a hatch-cover and put coal into [the container]. But how can they load up the cars?” This, of course, discounts the possibility that the ship has modifications specifically for the smuggling of other items. DN5505 notably also has links to Ocean Maritime Management, a company tied to North Korean arms smuggling. The investigation into Enermax is ongoing and The Times notes that there is also no hard evidence linking Kazachuk to North Korea’s smuggling network’s directly. However, the murky nature of both his connection to the ships in question and who exactly owns and operates Do Young Shipping only underscore the kinds of gray areas that the regime in Pyongyang is able to exploit. C4ADS’ investigation says that there are strong indications that these sort of realities helped North Korea, by way of its own front companies along with legitimate shipping and freight forwarding companies, import a total of 803 foreign-made cars, including luxury models, across 82 individual shipments between February 2016 and November 2017 alone. The vast majority of these vehicles were purchased in Russia, though actual Russian makes, such as 4×4 UAZ Patriot sport utility vehicles, made up less than 10 percent of the shipments. C4ADS C4ADS The United Nations has even implicated firms in the United States of being involved or otherwise wrapped up in this international smuggling operation. In May 2019, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The War Zone , the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control refused to confirm or deny the existence of any investigations into any companies over the involvement in the delivery of luxury vehicles to North Korea. The shipments of cars also clearly continued beyond the period from 2016 to 2017 that C4ADS examined. While the North Korean regime was working on getting the two S600s into the country in October 2018, Kim Jong Un arrived at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a previously unseen Rolls Royce Phantom. All of this comes at a time when North Korea is continuing to argue for sanctions relief , particularly from the United States, in exchange for progress on talks related to its controversial nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs . But C4ADS’ report clearly shows that the country has developed extensive means for getting around those sanctions in the meantime, both in order to prop up the regime and meet the demands of Kim and his inner circle for foreign luxury goods. The United States has continued its push to sanction firms in other countries, such as Russia and China , who are enabling North Korean imports and exports in violation of international sanctions. At the same time, unfortunately, both of those countries have shown either an inability or an unwillingness to clamp down on violators themselves, as they work to improve their own ties with Pyongyang. C4ADS’ report argues that improved, unified export controls and definitions about what constitutes luxury goods could help in both identifying and targeting “commercial facilitators” and then better focusing sanctions on where they would hurt Kim’s regime the most. It’s certainly true that common agreed-upon standards, and more universal implementation of them, can only help in sanctions enforcement. At the same time, the journey of the S600s to North Korea between June and October 2018, a trip that involved at least five different companies across five separate countries, highlights just how difficult it is to truly isolate the regime in Pyongyang from an only increasingly interconnected global economy. Regardless of what happens now, it is clear that the existing sanctions regime has been largely ineffective in preventing Kim and his inner circle from acquiring new luxury vehicles, even when those deliveries pass right through countries that are supposedly watching very closely for potential violations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",A Guide To The Pentagon’s Shadowy Network Of Bases In Africa,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Feb. 27, 2017, American special operations forces and their partners kicked off the Flintlock training exercise at sites across North and West Africa. More than 2,000 troops from the United States and more than 20 other countries would spend almost three weeks running through drills, sharing skills and best practices for dealing with terrorists and other crises. Since 2005, the Pentagon has held Flintlock every year in one or more countries. After its creation in 2008, U.S. Africa Command took over the annual war game from U.S. European Command. America’s top headquarters in Europe had previously been responsible for all American military operations in Africa. “Long live the relationship between the different countries and the armed forces of our countries,” Col. Maj. T.N. Pale, the Chief of Staff of Burkina Faso’s military, said during one opening ceremony in his country’s capital, Ouagadougou. “Long” is definitely the operative word; the U.S. military have been actively involved in Africa since World War II . But Flintlock might be a near perfect microcosm of how many people view U.S. military activities in Africa. Though shadowy commando missions and drone bases generally garner the most attention, a survey of the Pentagon’s deployments and infrastructure across Africa show a force ready for a host of contingencies. And while this particular exercise has transformed and expanded since 2008, it’s an outgrowth of smaller exchanges dating back to the late 1960s. To help show this diversity of effort, The War Zone mapped a snapshot (undoubtedly incomplete) of units and locations, to the best of our knowledge, as of January, 2017. The marked locations are approximations and not definite, specific positions of American forces. Make sure to check out the interactive google map that goes along with this piece linked here Here’s what we do know: To be sure, commandos and unmanned aircraft, along with manned spy planes, are a major part of American military operations in Africa. Both the regional Special Operations Command Africa and the secretive Joint Special Operations Command have active elements and contractors moving around at least six countries, including the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Somalia, South Sudan, and Uganda. Djibouti’s Camp Lemonnier , attached to the country’s main Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport, is the only official U.S. base in Africa and hosts more than 3,000 U.S. military personnel from across the services and contractors assigned to Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa, or CJTF-HOA. Among them are a number of special operators who form Special Operations Command (Forward) – East Africa, abbreviated SOCFWD-EA. Ever-growing Camp Lemonnier takes up the south side of Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport., Google Earth CJTF-HOA handles counter-terrorism efforts, security cooperation and other activities across the region, including battling Al Shabaab terrorists in Somalia and supporting African peacekeepers in that country. SOCFWD-EA helps coordinate the special operations end, from training American allies to hunting militants. Separate from that command structure, there is likely a Joint Special Operations Command task force working in Somalia. According to documents obtained by The Intercept in 2015, a group known as Task Force 48-4 had elite troops working in Somalia and neighboring countries, as well as across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen, as of 2013. We could not confirm any of the elements were still in the same positions, or even active, four years later. A 160th SOAR MH-47 crew trains local soldiers how to fast-rope., The Pentagon’s top headquarters for Africa has U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and contractor-operated reconnaissance aircraft situated in Djibouti and Kenya to help snoop on Al Shabaab. American drone bases in island nation of the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean and at Arba Minch in Ethiopia are no longer active. In September 2013, the Air Force moved its drone force from Camp Lemonnier to a nearby but more remote airstrip to the west, called Chabelley Airfield. After numerous accidents, Djiboutian authorities were reportedly concerned the pilotless planes were a risk to the regular air traffic at Djibouti-Ambouli and anyone living nearby. American forces at Chabelley now handle all unmanned aircraft flying out of the country. In October 2015, the Air Force pulled the last MQ-1 Predators from the Horn of Africa and inactivated the 60th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. Unidentified elements now fly the MQ-9 Reaper exclusively from the site, while the 870th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron handles the administrative side of things. Chanbelly Airfield near camp Lemonnier. , Google Earth Fixed wing surveillance aircraft cover East Africa from bases in Europe and smaller sites on the continent. This includes various platforms, from the airliner-sized RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, equipped to scoop up enemy radio chatter and other electronic emissions, to the single turboprop engine U-28A platform, capable of tracking terrorist communications and filming full-motion video. The Navy’s P-3C Orion patrol planes, which can carry additional sensor packages for reconnaissance missions, and the dedicated EP-3E Aeries II intelligence-gathering planes are involved as well. This might include operations from the obscure Camp Simba in Manda Bay, Kenya; scant public information is available about this Navy-run facility, which American troops have also used for training exercises in the past. Inside Somalia, elite troops work with both the African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, and the country’s central government. In 2015, Foreign Policy reported JSOC teams were in Kismayo near the Kenyan border and outside Mogadishu at an old, Soviet-built airstrip in Baledogle. In October 2013, the Pentagon had publicly sent a three-person Military Coordination Cell to Mogadishu handle requests for support from AMISOM and the Somali government. As of January 2017, the MCC was still in the country and had an average size of five people. “The overarching goal in Somalia for the Department of Defense is to help the government of Somalia provide a safe and secure environment for the people of Somalia, and deter organizations such as Al Shabaab,” Robyn Mack, an AFRICOM spokesperson, explained to The War Zone in an email. “The [Military Coordination Cell] is comprised of a lead planner and technical advisors who will work with AMISOM and Somali security forces to increase their capabilities and promote greater security in Somalia.” In Central Africa, another special operations task force helps hunt for the Lord’s Resistance Army and its brutal leader, Joseph Kony. In 2011, President Barack Obama announced a comprehensive plan to help defeat the LRA, which had become particularly infamous for kidnapping children and forcing them into combat or sexual slavery, among other atrocities. A MQ-9 Reaper with external fuel tank is seen operating out of a forward base in the region., DoD Special Operations Command (Forward) – Central Africa—aka SOCFWD-CA—coordinates operations, including contractor-flown cargo planes and helicopters and manned intelligence-gathering aircraft, out of Entebbe International Airport, in Uganda. As part of the mission, American special operators and their partners have access to small airstrips in Obo in the Central African Republic, Dungu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nzara in South Sudan. In February 2017, The Daily Beast published a report highlighting how a successor to the notorious private military company Blackwater was flying some of these Central African sorties. In 2014 , one of EP Aviation’s twin-engine CASA 212 transports made an emergency landing on a highway in Uganda, shining a light on those operations. The “EP” stood for Erik Prince, the former SEAL and Blackwater founder. In 2010, Prince sold the charter air firm to another company, AAR Airlift Group, Inc. However, these units and private contractors could transition to a broader counter-terrorism or security mission soon. “We are at a point in time where we need to transition that mission,” U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the Pentagon’s top officer overseeing operations in Africa, told Stars and Stripes in November 2016. “The number of fighters in that whole [LRA] organization has gone way, way down to the point where it is almost [at] insignificant levels.” American commanders wouldn’t want to throw away the valuable infrastructure and relationships U.S. Africa Command spent more than five years putting together. The sites and assets sit right in the middle of a region unfortunately well known for political upheaval, violent rebel movements and other crises. Air Base 101, Niamey, Niger., A third regional setup exists for North and West Africa. The primary American facilities for that mission are now located at Niger’s Base Aérienne 101, which is attached to Diori Hamani International Airport in the country’s capital, Niamey. From there, the Air Force’s 409th Air Expeditionary Group flies MQ-9s, presumably over hot spots like Libya, Mali and Nigeria. The group has been responsible for drone operations across the continent since at least 2009, previously running the detachments in the Seychelles and Ethiopia. The Air Force ultimately consolidated the unit in Niamey and stood up the 768th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron as part of a larger restructuring of the Air Force’s 435th Air Expeditionary Wing headquartered in Germany, a public affairs officer for U.S. Air Forces in Europe wrote to The War Zone in an email. USAFE’s commander is “dual-hatted” as the chief of U.S. Air Forces Africa. As of January 2017, the 409th ran a second site further north co-located with Niger’s Base Aérienne 201 at Manu Dayak Airport in Agadez, where the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron manages day-to-day activities. While the airfield could conceivably handle Predators or Reapers, there was no indication of American unmanned aircraft on location at the time. The American base in Niamey apparently plays host to to the third regional special operations task force in Africa, as well. Sometime in 2014, the Pentagon renamed Joint Special Operations Task Force – Trans Sahara as Special Operations Command (Forward) – West Africa, or SOCFWD-WA. Along with the name change, the unit appeared to have moved from its previous location in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. This task force is the lead element for planning and conducting the Flintlock exercises. A Senegalese soldier checks for booby traps outside of a room they will clear during training near Thies, Senegal, as part of exercise Flintlock 2016., DoD Niger’s relative political stability would have been a major driver in these decisions. In November 2014, national protests forced Burkina Faso’s longtime, autocratic president Blaise Compaoré out of power. Troops loyal to Compaoré attempted but failed to stage a successful coup nearly a year later. Regardless, American special operators have been deployed throughout the region to train and otherwise support international peacekeepers fighting Al Qaeda-linked insurgents in Mali, Al Qaeda- and Islamic State-aligned terrorists in Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia, and the vicious Boko Haram group in Nigeria. Separately, an unidentified U.S. Army task force covers part of Nigeria with MQ-1C Gray Eagles flying from Garoua International Airport in Cameroon. It is unclear whether American pilotless spies were still operating from Chad’s capital N’Djamena. The map’s coverage is no doubt missing other small, inconspicuous facilities that special operations units are using for counter-terrorism missions. For instance, in December 2015, images appeared on social media showing an Air Force Special Operations Command C-146 Wolfhound transport aircraft—with its discreet, civilian style blue-and-white paint job—and special operators in Libya. These missions dominate the headlines and overshadow a host of other American military units and facilities. Senegalese soldiers exit an Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Osprey during mission rehearsals as part of exercise Flintlock in Bamako, Mali., DoD Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti is itself a hub for all sorts of missions, including working with allied forces, coordinating support to peacekeepers in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa, being on call during humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters, and conducting various civil affairs missions like pop-up medical clinics and non-military construction projects. While the Air Force’s 449th Air Expeditionary Wing does oversee the 870th at the nearby Chabelley drone base, the bulk of its units are tailored to more traditional military missions. There are three expeditionary rescue squadrons—81st, 82nd and 303rd— with HC-130P/N aerial tankers, HH-60G rescue helicopters and pararescue airmen. These units are on call to recover American military personnel or allied forces in need both in Africa and out into the Gulf of Aden. The airmen routinely practice for these scenarios with African troops and other American elements stationed at Camp Lemonnier. In addition, there is the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, with its C-130J transports, to ferry cargo and troops to training exercises and other missions. And the base can handle additional aircraft when necessary—including for operations in Yemen. U.S. Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa, greets members of the 510th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, Feb. 1, 2017., DoD As of January 2017, elements of the 510th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and the 351st Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron were on Camp Lemonnier’s main ramp. In July 2016, the Pentagon sent the force of F-16 fighter bombers and KC-135 tankers to Djibouti in response to the possibility of renewed violence in South Sudan. In December 2013, three Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 Ospreys took significant damage during an abortive rescue mission to Bor, South Sudan. A Navy SEAL who was part of the rescue force nearly died , and other elite sailors and airmen suffered serious injuries. The next month, a more substantial U.S. Marine Corps contingent based in Moron, Spain helped American nationals evacuate the country’s capital, Juba. In both cases, the American forces had staged in Djibouti before moving south. To enable other contingency operations, U.S. Africa Command has reached agreements with various African government to place so-called “cooperative security locations” in their countries, especially at or near major airports. Our map lists a few of these sites, but it is important to note while American forces may have access, it doesn’t mean there are troops on the ground permanently. “There’s nothing there but a couple of warehouses full of stuff,” then-head of U.S. Africa Command Army Gen. David Rodriguez said of these forward bases in an interview with Stars and Stripes in 2015. “When people come down, they put up tents and that’s where they stay.” At that time, Rodriguez said AFRICOM had 11 cooperative security locations. Our map has eight marked out, based on statements and known operations. U.S. Soldiers assigned to the 1st Combined Arms Battalion, 63rd Armor Regiment transport cargo from an Air Force MC-130P Combat Shadow aircraft assigned to the 81st Expeditionary Rescue Squadron in the Grand Bara Desert, Djibouti, May 17, 2013, as part of an evaluation exercise in support of Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA)., DoD The turn-key approach was on full display in January 2009, when the Pentagon helped move hundreds of Rwandan peacekeepers into Sudan’s hotly contested Darfur region. U.S. Air Forces Africa’s 404th Air Expeditionary Group, the 435th’s main contingency unit, had opened up the cooperative security location in Kigali and activated the 722nd Expeditionary Air Base Squadron to handle the airlift. “This was a complicated project that ultimately took several months of interagency and interdepartmental coordination and planning,” Air Force Maj. Greg Lococo, chief of operational planning for Air Forces Africa, said at the time . After the mission wrapped, the 722nd packed up and went home. The Pentagon repeated the process to move French and African forces into Mali beginning in January 2013 and more African troops into Central African Republic less than 12 months later. Starting in September 2014, American troops shuttled aid, equipment, and other support in and around West Africa after a deadly Ebola epidemic exploded across the region. The cooperative security location Dakar, Senegal served as the hub for the operation. A MV-22 Osprey departs as a recon team part of the Joint Forces Command, United Nations Military, and River Gee City officials prepares to locate sites for army mobile labs Nov. 10, 2014, in River Gee, Liberia in response to the Ebola virus outbreak., DoD Some of the oldest American military elements in Africa are actually focused specifically on infectious diseases like HIV and AIDS. The U.S. Army Medical Research Unit – Kenya has been in the country’s capital Nairobi since 1969. The U.S. Navy stood up the Naval Medical Research Unit – No. 3, Ghana Detachment in Accra in 1993. It’s notable that the Pentagon repeatedly describes the vast majority of these deployments and developments, some of which have now existed continually for years, as temporary. Officials have even challenged the assertion that the sprawling Camp Lemonnier is, in any way, akin to long-standing, permanent facilities in Europe or Asia. In a press conference in April 2014, Rodriguez characterized the base, home to more than 3,000 American troops and contractors, as a “major forward operating site.” In 2014, Washington agreed to pay Djibouti $630 million to lease the entire Camp Lemonnier facility for another decade. While taking questions, the officer corrected a reporter who used the word “base.” In its Email to The War Zone, USAFE’s public affairs office described both American locations in Niger as “temporary” and “expeditionary.” Just repaving the runway at Niger’s Agadez airstrip so it accommodate American C-130 cargo planes reportedly cost approximately $100 million . Of course, it’s worth noting the map only plots out American military-operated facilities and associated units, too. With the exception of possibly one JSOC task force, it doesn’t reflect the plethora of U.S. warships operating off the coast at any given time, which the Pentagon has in the past called upon to blast terrorists , keep tabs on so-called “ high value individuals ,” and more. The ability of American troops to make use of bases outside of Africa means they don’t always have to rely on the infrastructure on the continent, either. In addition, American troops and intelligence agencies work out of Embassies and other diplomatic posts and likely use additional secretive sites—such as the now-famous CIA annex to the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya—across Africa for security and intelligence-gathering purposes. A member of the Ghanaian air force guards a U.S. Air Force C-130J Hercules during the capstone event of African Partnership Flight 12-2., USAF Officials in Washington have historically tried make operations in Africa as low-profile and unobtrusive as possible. Part of this is because of the continent’s historical sensitivities to Western troops. It is impossible to talk about foreign military involvement in Africa without taking colonialism into account. Many African countries have been independent from harsh European authorities for less than a century, and those memories are still relatively fresh. The new governments in many cases had (and many still have) autocratic tendencies and histories of human rights abuses. Leaders in countries such as Djibouti, Ethiopia, Niger, and Uganda, among others, are probably happy to downplay American involvement. Under the right circumstances, the presence of U.S. troops could easily inflame the populace and give political ammunition to opposition parties. For its part, the Pentagon denies doing anything to prop up these regimes, and has routinely shifted military activities after political upheaval. “Airmen deployed to Africa, in support of U.S. Africa Command and local governments, concentrate our efforts on helping African nations and regional organizations build capable and professional militaries that respect human rights, adhere to the rule of law, and more effectively contribute to stability in Africa,” USAFE’s public affairs officers noted in their email. These considerations don’t just apply to American troops. In particular, China has quietly but steadily increased its own military presence in Africa, including construction of a naval hub—which it refers to simply as a “logistics facility”—in relatively close proximity to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. In reality, whether Burkina Faso’s Col. Maj. Pale was aware of it or not when he made his speech at the beginning of Flintlock 2017, the Pentagon is definitely in Africa for the long-haul—no matter how American officials phrase it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Remembering Hugh Hefner And His Iconic Jet Black DC-9 “Big Bunny”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Long before the aerospace industry had a whole subset marketplace dedicated to providing custom lavish flying palaces for the super rich, wealthy and extravagant businessmen and entertainers would have to find companies willing to adapt airliners for their personal use—and the results were far from consistent. Elvis Presley’s Convair 880 “Lisa Marie,” Bobby Sherman’s Boeing 707 “The Starship,” and later Donald Trump’s 727 are among the most well known of these pre-Boeing Business Jet airliner adaptations. But in the aviation community, one of these aircraft in particular may be the most beloved—the late Hugh Hefner’s jet black DC-9 with the Playboy bunny emblazoned on its tail famously named “Big Bunny.” The plane was nearly as unique and compelling as the man who commissioned it, and like Hefner, it has stood the test of time when it comes to capturing the public’s imagination. At the pinnacle of Playboy Magazine’s popularity, in 1969, Hugh Hefner had pretty much every material possession a man could ask for—aside from his own flying Playboy Club. So after researching what airframe would be best suited for the culture icon’s partying and logistical needs, Playboy Enterprises chose the still relatively new DC-9 as Hefner’s flying chariot and brand ambassador. AP For the era, the DC-9 was economical, reliable, offered a lot of square footage, had two of its own air-stairs, and most importantly, it was sleek and sexy, a trait the competing Boeing 737 didn’t really offer. On January 27th, 1969 Playboy took possession of a DC-9-32 straight from the McDonnell Douglas factory at the cost of $5.5M—not a small check to write in 1969! The jet’s registration number was N950PB. Big Bunny airlifted Hugh for the first time on February 2nd, 1970 after finishing up a year long outfitting process. , AP Hef and crew head off the tarmac in a Mercedes limo., AP N950PB went through an interior outfitting process unlike any jet before it. Instead of the bolted down velvet couches and audio consoles flown on other large private jets of the era, the Playboy jet got a futuristic Scandinavian design influenced interior that looked like something out of Space Odyssey 2001 with a little Barbarella thrown in. Inside it featured a theater, multiple lounges, full bathrooms with showers, and of course a big rounded water bed for the top playboy himself. Throughout his life, Hefner did much of his business atop his bed sheets , and to him the bed wasn’t just a place to sleep and to, well, party, it was also an office. The bed had silk sheets with a Tasmanian opossum beadspread and all the comfort and connectivity controls the airplane had to offer were build into a sweeping console that curved along the side of the eight foot bed, below the windows. It looked like Captain Kirk’s quarters aboard the Starship Enterprise. AP The jet also featured an integrated entertainment system which was way ahead of its time, including an 8-track surround sound system and multiple televisions, two film projectors, and a video system which was cutting edge tech in 1969. It was a disco in the sky replete with a dance lighting system. Amazingly, the jet also had “dimming” windows that would go black at the touch of a button—something that wasn’t introduced to fleet airliners until the 787 well over 40 years later. The DC-9 also received an executive communications suite that allowed Hef and his guests to make phone calls while cruising through the stratosphere. Big Bunny sported a special crew of flight attendants dubbed aptly “Jet Bunnies” who weren’t casted just for their looks, but also for their abilities to actually provide flight attendant service while underway. The women were pulled from Hefner’s clubs in Los Angeles and Chicago and sent for training with Continental Airlines. Passing the famous airline’s intense flight attendant school was a prerequisite for the job. Their outfits were one of a kind, designed by fashion designer Walter Holmes with Hefner’s input. Generally they featured leather mini dresses, black go-go boots, white aviator scarves, and even bunny ears and tails on some occasions. Hefner wrote in 2010 that “they look as though they had just stepped out of a Bond movie.” AP The N950PB’s iconic paint job was unlike any other at the time. No other private jet had been painted black before so Playboy had to seek special approval from the FAA before applying the unique scheme. Hefner wanted the plane to stand out, and the glossy black livery sure did the trick. Extra bright spotlights were also installed on the jet’s exterior to light up the Playboy bunny on its tail for all to see as Hefner made his grand arrivals to various locales. AP The jet hauled Hugh and his entourage of beautiful women, celebrities, and Playboy staff all over the world, including some extremely exotic and austere locales. Hefner also used the jet to commute from his properties in Los Angeles and Chicago where he taped episodes of Playboy After Dark . “I loved the convenience of the jet… It was literally a floating apartment with a bedroom, a living room, a dining room and a disco area in the back” Hefner told the Wall Street Journal while describing his memories of the plane. “I lent it to Elvis Presley to fly to concerts and I lent it to Yul Brynner… When anyone asks me if I ever miss the plane, I reply, ‘only when I fly.'” The Playboy jet was constantly visited by some of the most famous people of the era. Poet Shel Silverstein, artist Leroy Neiman, director Roman Polanski and many others were regulars aboard. Sonny and Cher and Elvis leased the jet for international tours. Big Bunny was such a big deal that lavish reception parties would be organized for its arrival in foreign countries, often including international celebrities and local elite. Hefner talks to reporters aboard Big Bunny while seated in his special chair. , AP In 1975, Hugh even lent Big Bunny to “Operation Babylift” which saw the jet fly babies orphaned by the Vietnam War to New York City where they were received by their adoptive families. The jet was also used to ferry a gorilla named Baltimore Jack across the U.S. to meet a potential mate. The massive cost of maintaining and operating a non-revenue airliner, with its own handpicked crew no less, was too great for Playboy to justify as the magazine’s circulation began to decline in the mid 1970s. Hefner had also fallen in love with a new toy, an estate that would become widely known as the Playboy Mansion which he acquired in 1971. By 1974 he was no longer splitting his time between Los Angeles and Chicago, which meant the need for the plane was largely reduced. Playboy Enterprises The famous jet was sold to Venezuelan Airlines in 1975. It went on to spend decades in and out of storage before ending up with Aeromexico where it served running normal airline service, its incredible interior long gone, until 2004 when it was finally retired. The parted-out jet’s fuselage is now an educational tool having been donated to the city of Cadereyta in Mexico. Oddly enough, Hefner’s DC-9 wasn’t the last aircraft to sport the jet black paint scheme with a big white Playboy bunny on its tail. Navy fast jet test squadron VX-4 “Evaluators” adopted the Playboy bunny insignia in the 1960s and flew it on their aircraft. Following the arrival of Big Bunny on the world stage, one of VX-4’s F-4 Phantoms always wore the same gloss black paint scheme. This aircraft was famously nicknamed “Vandy 1” after the unit’s “Vandy” callsign. USN The F-4 that was painted in the livery ended its service life in 1987 upon which time the motif was transferred to one of the unit’s F-14 Tomcats. Multiple Tomcats wore it over the years, even after VX-4 was shuttered in 1994 and VX-9 “Vampires” took over its duties. The Vampires carried on the Vandy 1 tradition with F-14D serial number 164604 being the last jet to wear the motif. It did so until it was pulled from service and retired around 2005. The jet lived its entire life at NAWS Point Mugu and was the last F-14 ever built. It had never been deployed aboard an aircraft carrier and was just 12 years old when it was pulled from service. It sits today as a gate guard at NAS Oceana, its Vandy 1 scheme long gone. Instead it wears the markings of VF-103. USN VX-9 has not applied a Vandy 1 paint scheme to another jet since 164604’s retirement and it is debatable if the Playboy insignia would even be allowed to fly on a Navy fighter’s tail again considering the politically correct social climate within the military today. But all is not lost, the paint job has been applied on a handful of private jet warbirds, so it still graces the skies to this very day, albeit in a non-governmental or corporate capacity. AP Hugh Hefner is such an interesting character who lived an absolutely fascinating life. He was both revered and despised, but he truly embodied the lifestyle that his brand promoted. Part of that was having the best and most outlandish of toys. A big black jet that was as much a flying nightclub as it was a business tool certainly fits that bill. In many ways the whole concept behind Big Bunny was far ahead of its time. Today billionaires can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on their flying palaces, with Middle Eastern royalty and Russian oligarchs being prime supporters of a growing ultra lavish private air travel marketplace. Some of these aircraft make the Playboy DC-9 look minuscule in scale as even Boeing’s largest aircraft, the 747-8i has been sold as a private Boeing Business Jet. But none of these dream machines will have the historic significance of Big Bunny, nor will their owners be remembered quite like Hugh Hefner.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 27, 2019",This Is The Only Photo Of A U.S. Navy Supercarrier Being Sunk (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Supercarriers are the ultimate form of American power projection and remain a capability no other Navy on the planet possesses. They are the most expensive ships—let alone weapons—on the planet. In the coming decade, a single Ford class supercarrier , the successor of the venerable Nimitz class, will cost nearly the entire annual defense budget of Canada, and this doesn’t include the billions worth of aircraft deployed as part of the ship’s air wing . But what’s really irreplaceable are the close to 6,000 souls that call the ship home while underway. With all this in mind, it’s hard to imagine one of these national treasures being sunk in combat, although Hollywood has played with the idea from time to time. But quite frankly, it is a real possibility, especially now, when peer-state foes are on the rise and anti-surface warfare is becoming a far more complex and deadly affair —one full of new low and high-end threats . USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) the first new U.S. Navy supercarrier class in five decades., USN Those tasked with designing and building these leviathans of the sea have to take this reality into account and, at the very least, do what can be done to improve the survivability of the ship and its crew if the nearly unthinkable should become reality. As the Navy looked towards the future of its carrier fleet in the 2000s, it set out to design a new class of supercarrier. But in order to make it more survivable, they needed data on what the actual effects of certain types of weapons and their resulting damage was on one of these huge fighting ships. The problem was that since USS Forestall’s (CV-59) appearance on the high seas in the 1950s, an American supercarrier had never been sunk. Data was largely simulated and based on the sinking of older, smaller aircraft carriers and surface combatants that didn’t really represent the unique attributes of a supercarrier. USS America’s island seen during a 1976 cruise. Note the diverse group of aircraft on her deck—A-7s, A-3s, A-5s, S-2s, and F-4s. A SH-2 can also be seen., USN Spurred by the wind-down of the Cold War, America’s conventionally powered carriers were drawn out of service in the 1990s and 2000s. Although some organizations tried to acquire these ships as museums, they ended up proving to be too large and expensive to convey and sustain and were sold off for scrapping . Just USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) , which is in somewhat of a class of her own, is still being held for donation. Recently, USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) was being eyed for refurbishment and return to service to help fulfill the Navy’s 355 ship inventory goal , but this plan has been passed over, likely for valid reasons . USS America during a cruise in the early 1980s. , USN But one of these mothballed supercarriers, USS America (CV-66), was spared the scrapper’s torch in exchange for Davy Jones’ Locker. The Kitty Hawk class carrier that had ended its active service life in 1996 would act as a destructive test platform so that the Navy could gain new insights into how a supercarrier would soak-up different forms of attack. Those lessons would then be applied directly to the Nimitz class successor supercarrier program. It was a noble but morbid cause for the storied ship. Still, there was opposition. The idea that a ship named USS America would be sunk on purpose angered some including veterans who served aboard her. The ship had been part of so many important moments in American history—taking part in Vietnam and Persian Gulf Wars, and in combat operations over Libya, along with many other notable missions—and tens of thousands of sailors called the vessel home during her comparatively short 31 year operational career. Four US Navy carriers form “Battle Force Zulu” following the 1991 Gulf War; America (bottom right) cruises with Midway (top left), Theodore Roosevelt (top right) and Ranger (bottom left)., USN Still, the Navy was adamant about using the ship for this one final purpose. In 2005, then Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Nathman explained the Navy’s reasoning : “ America will make one final and vital contribution to our national defense, this time as a live-fire test and evaluation platform. America ‘s legacy will serve as a footprint in the design of future carriers—ships that will protect the sons, daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of America veterans. We will conduct a variety of comprehensive tests above and below the waterline collecting data for use by naval architects and engineers in creating the nation’s future carrier fleet. It is essential we make those ships as highly survivable as possible. When that mission is complete, the America will slip quietly beneath the sea. I know America has a very special place in your hearts, not only for the name, but also for your service aboard her. I ask that you understand why we selected this ship for this one last crucial mission and make note of the critical nature of her final service.” After being prepared for a SINKEX operation , on April 19th, 2005, the ex- USS America was towed hundreds of miles off the Virginia coast. Soon after taking up station, the onslaught began. The ship was pummeled by explosions both above and below the waterline. After nearly four weeks of these activities, the carrier was scuttled. On May 14th, 2005, the vessel’s stern disappeared below the waterline and the ship began its voyage to the seafloor. USN/Public Domain The image came to my attention when one of our most esteemed commenters and veteran S-3 Viking sensor operator, AncientSubHuntr, posted it in our discussion section. It shows the carrier’s bow deeply buried below the waterline, with waves coming up to the middle of the ship. But amazingly, beyond that, the tough ship looks well intact. Regardless, this is a haunting image that one can hope never gets repeated during an operational cruise, although some of America’s foes clearly wish otherwise . The exact location of the ship, which at the time of its sinking was said to be roughly 300 miles off Virginia, was actually quite a bit further out according to this interesting article about its final resting place. The depth it rests at is also quite telling—nearly 17,000 feet down. Clearly, the Navy didn’t want anyone nosing around the hulk after it sunk. The results of this mother of SINKEX drills remain classified, as do any other pictures or video of the operation. Hopefully, the exercise did help inform the design of USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) and its successors. The closest thing to a test like this that the Navy’s new class of carriers will see will be shock trials , but the Navy has pushed to delay this critical series of tests possibly until the second Ford class supercarrier, USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) is plowing the seas. By that time, the third ship in the class, USS Enterprise (CVN-80) will already be deep in construction . And this is nothing compared to a SINKEX, as shock trials are used to see how critical components react to a nearby concussive blast and are not highly destructive in nature. A photo shot not long after the tough ship slipped below the waves. , USN But regardless, considering America stood up to four weeks of abuse and only succumbed to the sea after demolition teams scuttled the ship on purpose once and for all, it’s clear that America was built to sustain heavy damage in combat and still stay afloat. The big question now is do they still make ’em like they use to? As for the USS America name, a new vessel sails with it today, the amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6) of the America class , which is already in its second design iteration . It’s unlikely that another SINKEX of this magnitude will occur anytime in the foreseeable future. America’s nuclear supercarriers are far more challenging and expensive to dispose of compared to their conventionally powered predecessors. Scrapping USS Enterprise (CVN-65), America’s first nuclear supercarrier, is slated to take a decade and a half and cost a whopping $1.5B . Making one of these ships environmentally suitable for sinking would likely cost far more money and that’s if it’s even really feasible at all. Update: 5:20pm PST— A wider angle of the image was posted on Facebook in one of the groups I follow. It shows the bow totally submerged. Supposedly it hangs somewhere in the Pentagon: Facebook user submission The ship’s deck was bowed downward around the landing area and large holes were punctured in the deck around the forward catapults. Supposedly, the ship’s hull had massive fissures in it and the hangar deck was obliterated by the time it was ready to be scuttled. In addition, we have found out from another source that the carrier’s hangar bay was packed with ex-Ohio Air National Guard A-7Ds that had been sent to Aberdeen Proving Ground. They were barged over to the carrier and loaded aboard before it headed out to the target area. So one of the goals of the operation was to see how aircraft reacted to explosions inside the ship’s hangar bay.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 3, 2019",Here’s What We Know About Russia’s New Floating Nuclear Power Plant Heading To The Arctic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has begun towing the first of its new floating nuclear power plants, the Akademik Lomonosov , to Murmansk, where it will receive the nuclear fuel for its two reactors. The only one of its kind in service today, the program’s progress is yet another example of the Kremlin’s active push to expand its presence in the increasingly strategic Arctic region, but the concept could find use in various roles elsewhere, as well. The Lomonosov left the Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg on April 28, 2018. The Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk on the White Sea in northern Russia had first laid down the barge in 2007, before transferring it to the Baltic Shipyard the following year. The vessel will first test its reactors by the end of 2018 and it will enter formal service in Pevek in Russia’s Far East region in 2019, according to a press release from the shipyard. The Russian government plans to buy at least seven of these power barges in total. When it becomes operational, the nearly 500-foot long Lomonosov will have a displacement of around 21,500 tons. Inside the warehouse-like superstructure is more or less a typical nuclear power plant, with a reactor complex, control facilities, and the necessary equipment to generate electricity and safely transfer it ashore. There’s a helipad on top to help ferry technicians to and from their jobs onboard. Each Lomonosov -class vessel will have two KLT-40S pressurized water reactors , a derivative of the standard KLT-40 and improved KLT-40M, the latter of which powers Russia’s Taymyr -class icebreakers . Each S variant can produce up to 35 megawatts of electricity or 150 megawatts of thermal energy. Tugs maneuver Akademik Lomonosov as it begins its voyage in Saint Petersburg . , Alexander Galperin / Sputnik  via AP According to the press release from the Baltic Shipyard marking the departure from Saint Petersburg, the thousands of miles long voyage to Murmansk will be relatively slow going. At the very best, the four tugs belonging to Russia’s Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transport, or Rosmorrechflot, will be able to move the power plant at around four knots, or just over four and a half miles an hour. But the lumbering Lomonosov is significant in a number of ways. Most importantly, it represents the first of a class of floating nuclear power plants, which is also known as the Project 20870, that engineers designed from the very beginning to be mass produced. The first nuclear power ship, the Army’s MH-1A Sturgis , which provided power in the Panama Canal Zone between 1968 and 1975, was a conversion of an existing World War II-era Liberty ship . As such, Russia has suggested that if this type proves successful that it could export it to other nations with significant populations situated along coastal areas. As of 2008, the Russian state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom claimed that China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Algeria, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Argentina had all expressed an interested in the Project 20870 vessel or similar designs. A cutaway showing the basic configuration of Akademik Lomonosov ., IAEA For the Russian government specifically, the ships will significantly allow it to significantly expand its activities in the Far North and Arctic regions, which can often be isolated from communities further south for months at a time. As a result, it can be difficult to support fossil-fuel powered power stations in these areas, as it requires the prepositioning of large quantities of coal, oil, or natural gas. At the same time, shifting permafrost and other terrain features, as well the generally harsh climates, can often make it difficult to quickly and safely erect complex structures, such as nuclear power plants, to support even civilian communities near or above the Arctic Circle. A mobile, floating power station helps get around these issues. In Pevek, Lomonosov will be able to quickly replace the Soviet-era Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant and the Chaunskaya coal-fired power plant. Of the other six planned Project 20870 floating power stations, five are already set to help Russia’s state-run oil and gas company Gazprom expand its off-shore activities in and around the Arctic region. The last one could go to Dudinka on the Taymyr Peninsula or Vilyuchinsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, both also in the country’s far north. Another view of the Akademik Lomonosov ., Alexander Galperin / Sputnik  via AP If the concept proves sound, though, it seems likely that the Kremlin could look to expand the number of floating nuclear power plants, either of Project 20870 type or separate designs, to support additional efforts in the Arctic region, including supporting new or rehabbed military facilities. Starting in 2014 , Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to refurbish various abandoned sites in the area, as well as build entirely new air, ground, and naval bases. This decision was part of a generally more assertive Russian force policy that had already become apparent with the illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region earlier that year. In April 2017, Russian officials unveiled one of the first of its all-new Arctic sites, called the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , which translates variously as Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock, which sits on Alexandra Land, an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, and is north of the Arctic Circle. It is unclear whether this base’s own power plant, which helps it remain self-sufficient during the winter months when it is largely cut off from the mainland, is conventional or nuclear. A mobile radar system sits in front of the main building of then still under construction Arctkicheski Trilistnik in 2015., Russian MoD On top of that, the Kremlin has reportedly already been expanding its military use of nuclear power, including developing smaller underwater nuclear power stations as part of expanding undersea sensors networks in the Arctic region. This makes sense if Russian officials are looking to better monitor foreign submarine movements and otherwise secure territorial claims in the area. Floating nuclear power plants such as Lomonosov could similarly help provide the critical power for permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary stations in remote areas, on ice floes, or even on the water’s surface over protracted periods of time. Typical portable generators using fossil fuels might be enough to sustain basic life support in these locations, but could require a significant and regular logistical pipeline and wouldn’t necessarily be able to run power-hungry sensor or weapon systems . With more robust bases with these types of assets, the Russians would be better positioned to actually limit foreign military activities, especially in a crisis, rather than just monitor them. A landing ship assigned to Russia’s Northern Fleet deployed a tank on a snow-covered beach during a training exercise., Russian MoD That’s not to say there aren’t potential limits to or concerns about the fleet of nuclear power barges. As noted, these floating platforms are not particularly easy to move and once in place, they may essentially take on the role of a fixed power plant. With tugs only able to move them at a top speed of four knots, it could take an immense amount of time and effort to bring them back to Murmansk or Saint Petersburg for any necessary heavy maintenance, as well. The plan for the Lomonosov with its 70-megawatt output to fully replace the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant, with its top generating capacity of 48-megawatts, as well as the Chaunskaya generating plant might be optimistic, as well. It would no doubt require the ship to run regularly and without incident in order to provide that steady stream of power to the communities in and around Pevek. And while Russian authorities insist that the KLT-40S reactor design is both proven and reliable, it is based on a decade’s old design. In 2011 , the icebreaker Taymyr suffered a coolant leak on one of its KLT-40Ms that resulted in a release of radiation into the atmosphere in spite of various redundancies and other safety features found on that already updated design. Combining it with a floating platform in a region where weather can quickly turn extreme has long prompted concerns about the potential for a major radiological incident and environment disaster , as well. Russia claims that the Lomonosov is sufficiently hardened against a variety of natural disasters and accidents, reportedly being strong enough to even brush off a small plane crashing into it. A diagram showing the basic components of the KLT-40S reactor., IAEA And regardless of whether the base KLT-40 design is safe in principle, there are questions about whether or not Russia’s nuclear industry is capable of the necessary quality control and routine maintenance to keep it that way or will have adequate funding to do so. Just in the past 18 months, there have been reports of unexplained increases in radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere originating from Russia, with experts saying the most likely culprits are poorly maintained nuclear power plants and waste facilities . Still, the Project 20870 program, along with Russia’s other military and civil investments in the Arctic region, show that the country is serious about expanding its presence there. Doing so can only help the country gain improved access to various natural resources and trade routes, as well as deny the same, as well as freedom of military movement in a crisis, to its potential opponents. The Kremlin isn’t alone in identifying the growing importance of the region, either. China, among others, is now reportedly increasing its own activities and investments in the Arctic, presenting another challenge to the United States its regional partners, such as Canada, Japan, and South Korea. The Chinese government expects to commission its first domestically produced ice-capable research ship, the Xuelong 2 or Snow Dragon 2 , in 2019. China’s Xue Long icebreaker., Bahnfrend via Wikimedia “U.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just power projection; it’s a matter of national security,” U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft, who’s service controls the U.S. government’s only two remaining icebreakers , told legislators during a hearing in May 2017. “If they remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of influence to over five million square miles of Arctic ice and water.” If the Project 20870 program proves workable to any serious degree, it might kickstart a renaissance of sorts for power ships and float nuclear power plants, which could have broad applications in coastal areas. As already noted, Rosatom has indicated that the Lomonosov could be an attractive design for any country that is looking to rapidly expand reliable power in coastal regions. Depending on how robust the power grid might be, it might even be possible to use the floating power station to provide electricity much further inland, as well. This sort of capability could easily have a wide variety of applications in any remote littoral area, such as the Pacific Ocean, it might be otherwise difficult to rapidly establish the necessary prime power during sustained, but distributed military operations or in the aftermath of a natural disaster. For military forces especially, being able to deploy a high-capability, but relatively mobile power plant might just be increasingly necessary given the growing electricity demands of advanced sensor systems and other equipment, and even potentially certain future weapon systems such as land-based railguns . Akademik Lomonosov under construction., Rosatom In addition, concepts such as the Lomonosov could serve as a stepping stone to the development of even smaller, more portable nuclear reactors to support military operations. These units would also be even better suited to rapid deployment as part of a humanitarian relief mission. “Maybe one of the most tragic events in recent history with the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. 3.5 million Americans who are without electricity. We’re trying to get micro generators down there. We’re trying to get fuel down there,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said during a panel discussion in September 2017. “Wouldn’t it make abundant good sense if we had small modular reactors that literally you could put in the back of a C-17 aircraft, transport to an area like Puerto Rico push it out the back end, crank it up, plug it in that could serve tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people very quickly?” As with the MH-1A floating nuclear power plant, this wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. government has explored this concept. During the 1960s, the Army experimented with an air-transportable nuclear reactor called the ML-1 , which was small enough that its two main parts could each fit on the back of a  tractor-trailer truck or a rail car. The U.S. Air Force also employed small nuclear reactors during the Cold War to power remote radar stations and a similar, containerized design supported U.S. government research work for a time at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. In the aftermath of Hurricane Iwa in 1982 in Hawaii, the U.S. Navy investigated whether it might be possible to power storm-damaged areas by linking a nuclear submarine to the local power grid. It’s an idea that reappeared on internet forums and comments sections after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, these ideas have so far not proven to be practical options. ML-1 was exceptionally expensive and proved unsuitable for use on a wide scale. It hasn’t appeared to be any more cost-effective to use nuclear warships as temporary power stations. Experts are also skeptical about whether miniature reactors such as ML-1 could be any cheaper to produce now and suggest that any practical mobile designs that a company could mass produce would still be closer in size to the one on Lomonosov or other ships . The safety and security requirements of deploying numerous small reactors could easily add to the overall costs and make the concept of dubious value in the end. It remains to be seen how rapidly the Russians can build the remaining six planned Project 20870 power plants and how capable they actually are in practice, for operations in the Arctic or anywhere else. If nothing else, Lomonosov ’s trip to Murmansk makes it clear that the Russians are moving ahead to expanding that influence in the Arctic to the full extent that they can, especially as additional competitors, such as China, are making their own inroads in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 6, 2019",Sweden’s New Civil Defense Guide Tells Citizens To Resist Fake News As They Would An Invasion,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in nearly three decades, Swedish authorities have issued a new civil defense brochure that calls on citizens to prepare for national emergencies by making sure they have adequate food , water, shelter…and access to reliable information. Though it doesn’t identify any potential adversaries by name, the strong emphasis on the potential for dangerous disinformation during a crisis is almost certainly driven by Russia’s continued overt and covert weaponization of traditional and new media and other information warfare campaigns . The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency , an element of the country’s Ministry of Defense , put together the new 20 page-long brochure , titled “If Crisis or War Comes,” which it unveiled in May 2018 and is also available in English. One will be sent to the almost five million residential addresses in Sweden. This isn’t the first time the agency has published one of these handouts, but it is the first time it has issued a new one since the end of the Cold War. “Many people may feel a sense of anxiety when faced with an uncertain world. Although Sweden is safer than many other countries, there are still threats to our security and independence,” the pamphlet says in its introduction, titled “For the population of Sweden.” “Peace, freedom and democracy are values that we must protect and reinforce on a daily basis.” The guide is primarily meant to promote habits and preparedness for all sorts of emergencies, ranging from natural disasters to terrorist attacks to an outright foreign invasion. In the center, there is a checklist of suggestions for what Swedish homes should have at the ready. Artwork from “If Crisis or War Comes,” showing CV90 armored vehicles and UH-60 Black Hawk and NH90 helicopters , all of which are in Swedish military service., Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency These include three relatively typical categories – food, water, and warmth – as well as a miscellaneous section. Having a supply of clean water and shelf-stable, but nutritious food is good preparedness advice for people anywhere. “Warmth,” rather than shelter more generally, is particularly important for Sweden specifically given the climate throughout the country. Average temperatures in the country’s northern regions can remain below zero all day during the winter months. The “other” category includes various personal items, such as medicine, hand sanitizer, diapers, and feminine hygiene products. They also recommend having some spare cash in small denominations and “fuel in the tank” of the car in case you need to get out of the area in a hurry. Elsewhere, the guide also provides information on Sweden’s national “ Total Defense ” doctrine, which various different agencies implementing policies that are all supposed to be fully functioning by 2025. The country’s military , which has mandatory conscription, as well as its expansive civil defense and reserve apparatus that applies to anyone between the ages of 16 and 70, are key components of this plan. Anyone in that age range could find themselves assigned one of a host of different tasks during a contingency to help defend the country. The state may requisition personnel property as appropriate, too. In the video below, Swedish Air Force General Micael Bydén, Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces discusses the country’s Total Defense doctrine among other issues. There are also details about how to decipher different warning siren sounds and where to go to seek shelter in case of an attack. Sweden also has an outdoor public address system, known as “ Hesa Fredrik ” or “Hoarse Fredrick,” outside municipal buildings and nuclear power plants. There are various web links and other information, as well as a number of different nation-wide emergency phone numbers. And “if Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up,” the guide states bluntly near the end. “All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false.” That last part is particularly important and it’s a theme that permeates through the entire handout. Two of the guide’s 20 pages are almost entirely dedicated to the dangers of information warfare during a crisis and the personal checklist includes a fifth “communications” category entirely separate from the others. “We must be able to resist various types of attacks directed against our country,” the page on resistance notes. “Even today, attacks are taking place against our IT systems and attempts are being made to influence us using false information.” Here is the full page on “false information”: Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency But it’s everywhere in the brochure. “Mobile networks and the internet do not work” is a potential problem that gets equal billing with “the heat stops working” and “the shops may run out of food and other goods.” The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency warns people against sharing unconfirmed information “online or in any other way” during a possible terrorist attack. “Cyberattacks that knock out important IT systems” and “attempts to influence Sweden’s decision makers or inhabitants” require just as much resistance as “military attack, for example airstrikes, rocket attacks or other acts of war.” “What is most important is that you have water, food and warmth and are able to obtain information from the authorities and the media,” the guide says in no uncertain terms. “In the event of emergencies and heightened states of alert, their [voluntary defense organizations] tasks include distributing important information to Sweden’s population. You are needed and your contribution makes a difference!” The guide says that public broadcaster Sveriges Radio’s P4 station will be the primary reliable source of information in a crisis, along with state-run Sveriges Television, which has a teletext warning message system. At least one radio with rechargeable batteries – including solar or hand-crank power – and another one in the car are on the preparedness list specifically so you can tune in. “You also need to be able to follow how the media are reporting events.” The full preparedness checklist from “If Crisis or War Comes.”, Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency According to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Company , previous versions also warned Swedes to be “on guard” against possible propaganda and to keep an eye out for possible enemy “spies and saboteurs.” But by the pamphlet’s own admission Swedish authorities put much less emphasis on those issues after the Cold War came to an end and peace and Europe for the foreseeable future appeared assured. “For many years, the preparations made in Sweden for the threat of war and war have been very limited. Instead, public authorities and municipalities have focused on building up the level of preparedness for peacetime emergencies such as flooding and IT attacks,” the guide explains. “However, as the world around us has changed, the Government has decided to strengthen Sweden’s total defence [sic]. That is why planning for Sweden’s civil defence [sic] has been resumed.” Once again, the brochure does not mention Russia or any other country by name. At the same time, it obvious that the Kremlin’s actions have been one of, if not the primary force driving the countries authorities to reexamine their civil defense procedures. Russian authorities have adopted an increasingly aggressive foreign policy , which has included outright threats against Sweden, especially over the country’s growing ties with NATO members and the alliance as a whole . The Kremlin has also been using hybrid warfare tactics , including information warfare and electronic warfare attacks , against NATO and non-NATO opponents in Europe despite ostensibly being at peace with them. An American soldier takes a selfie with a smartphone during an exercise with Polish troops., US Army For example, many national authorities and experts understand the Russian government to have been behind a number of cyber attacks to disrupt or disable computer networks in various countries since at least 2007. In that year, Estonia suffered a massive distributed denial of service attack that originated from Russia, which effectively blocked access to governmental and non-governmental websites, in what many cybersecurity professionals treat as one of the first state-sponsored incident of its type. The Kremlin has since expanded its internet-based activities to include more complex operations, including setting up networks of fake social media accounts to rope in physical actors, knowingly or not, to influence elections and other political discourse , spread rumors and disinformation , and harass political opponents at home and abroad. There have also been hacks of Email accounts and other web-based personal information belonging to American and foreign military and government personnel, which trace back to Russia’s intelligence services . The Russians have reportedly then used that information that information to try and discredit or harass those individuals. Some U.S. military personnel in Europe reported hacks only to be approached by strangers – likely intelligence agents from Russia – who knew a potentially dangerous amount about their personal lives. For years now, Russian authorities, including president Vladimir Putin, have been publicly and officially trading in conspiracy theories and other dubious claims , deflecting from discussing its own behavior typically by accusing others of being responsible for even more heinous crimes. Even after yet another independent report emerged in May 2018 full of evidence that Russia was at least complicit in the shootdown of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin insists it had nothing to do with the incident. Russian President Vladimir Putin., Mikhael Klimentyev / Sputnik  via AP The goal, of course, is to put forth so many convoluted and confusing stories that it becomes too difficult for the average individual to separate truth from fiction, making them inclined to question even the most rudimentary facts about a particular event. Often amplified by spurious social media accounts, the swirling narratives can quickly take on a life of its own , making it hard for anyone to trace it back directly to the Russian government. Most notably, the Kremlin has employed these tools to meddle in a number of foreign elections . One of the best-known examples is its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and have since reportedly attempted to do the same in various European polls . This new reality almost certainly influenced the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency’s decision to prominently include resistance to “attempts to influence Sweden’s decision makers or inhabitants” in the civil defense guide. The Agency has avoided pointing the finger at Russia, so far, but has made it clear that the particular points in the guide about misinformation, among others, are immediately applicable. “That is quite a big issue in Sweden especially now – we are going into elections,” Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency’s Christina Andersson told CBC. “It’s a problem in the society as a whole.” The country will have a general election in September 2018. Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, head of the center-left Social Democratic Party, is facing a challenge from an opposition bloc in favor of closer ties with NATO and potentially joining the alliance formally. This is something Russia has voiced its opposition to and some Swedish authorities have been clear about their concerns that the Kremlin might try to sway the election’s results. “The biggest threat to our security in that perspective is Russia,” Anders Thornberg, head of the Swedish Security Service, analogous to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States, told the BBC in January 2018. Anders Thornberg speaks to the press about a terror alert in Sweden in 2015., Fredrik Sandberg /TT News Agency via AP The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency’s pamphlet is just one component of a nation-wide campaign to curtail information warfare campaigns in the run-up to the polls. Sweden has also implemented a curriculum to warn high school students about the dangers of propaganda and established a national “Facebook Hotline” where anyone can alert authorities to pages on the social media network that are falsely claiming to be official Swedish government sources. It’s not clear whether these mechanisms will have a net positive impact. Reporting mechanisms, such as the Swedish hotline, which governments and private companies have implemented in the past in various ways on various platforms, have proven easy for nefarious actors and pranksters to game. Sometimes website operators have shut down legitimate founts of information as a result. Other countries around the world are wrestling with the same issues. A number of national governments have even implemented laws against “fake news” that actually seem designed to provide a way to shut down political dissent . Sweden clearly thinks its crisis preparedness guide is broadly useful and it has put it online in 13 total languages. But if nothing else, the handout makes it clear that information has become a ubiquitous weapon available to almost any entity interested in using it as such. In the age of social media and a 24-hour news cycle, defending against actual lies and deception has not only become more important, but it’s also harder. “The best way to counteract propaganda and false information is to have done your homework,” the Swedish guide says. “Do not believe in rumours [sic] – use more than one reliable source in order to see whether the information is correct.” It’s definitely a good place to start and valuable advice for virtually anyone. But there’s still a long way to go to find robust systems that can reliably counter the increasingly constant deluge of false or misleading information readily available, especially on the Internet, without inadvertently clamping down in legitimate free speech and political disagreement.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 22, 2018","Navy’s Railgun Now Undergoing Tests In New Mexico, Could Deploy On Ship In Northwest","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has quietly moved its experimental electromagnetic railgun to the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and has been conducting new live-fire tests of the potentially game-changing weapon. This comes amid reports that the service could be finally getting close to mounting this railgun, or a derivative thereof, on a ship for at-sea testing in the Pacific Northwest. On May 31, 2019, the Navy quietly revealed that it had sent from railgun from its original test site at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWC Dahlgren) in Virginia to White Sands, also known as WSMR. A detachment from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division (NSWC Port Hueneme) in California is now overseeing the testing in New Mexico. “The installation of the railgun began earlier this year and required a large effort for the mount, gun, power controls, displays, and functional ties into the range,” Site Manager John Winstead said in an official statement . “The object of the test was essentially a shakedown of the newly-installed mount with accompanying power containers, controls, and a fully functional execution team .” At least one live-fire test occurred on May 15, 2019, according to the Navy . This involved the firing four rounds for diagnostic and verification purposes. The video below shows an earlier live-fire test of the Navy’s experimental railgun at a test site in Virginia in 2016. “Initial estimated test dates were reduced from three to two days due to the success of the firings,” an official news item explained . “The tests were very successful and alleviated the need to have further installation and check-out testing required for verification,” Winstead added. There were no additional details on any other part of the upcoming test schedule at White Sands. This appears to be the first official mention of the program, outside of statements to the press, in more than two years. In 2017, by all accounts, Chief of Naval Operations U.S. Navy Admiral John Richardson instituted a gag order on virtually any public discussion of substantive details about the railgun program by Navy officials or representatives from BAE Systems, which is the prime contractor. At the Navy League’s annual Sea Air Space conference in April 2019, a BAE representative told The War Zone , for the second year running, that they could not comment on the status of the program and the Office of Naval Research, which manages the program has not responded to our requests for a status update. Since 2017, there have then been various reports that the railgun project, which the Navy has been working on since 2005 and that The War Zone has been following closely , might be in danger of cancellation, despite relatively stable funding requests in the service’s annual budget proposals. In its latest budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, the Navy re-created a budget line specifically for the electromagnetic railgun program, or EMRG, and requested another $7.6 million to continue the research and development. This was an increase over the request from the previous fiscal year. DOD DOD There are indications that the movement of the land-based experimental railgun to White Sands could be a lead up to at-sea testing, either of this particular weapon or a derivative thereof. In 2016, the Navy pushed back plans to put the railgun on a ship at least until 2019. In March 2019, the Navy released a draft of an updated environmental impact assessment for training and testing activities on the Pacific Northwest. The report included sections outlining potential impacts from future tests of the railgun at sea and noted that these were entirely new additions. One particularly notable portion of the review reads as follows: The kinetic energy weapon (commonly referred to as the rail gun) will be tested aboard surface vessels, firing explosive and non-explosive projectiles at air-or sea-based targets. The system uses stored electrical energy to accelerate the projectiles, which are fired at supersonic speeds over great distances. The system charges for two minutes and fires in less than one second; therefore, the release of any electromagnetic energy would occur over a very short period. Also, the system is shielded so as not to affect shipboard controls and systems. The amount of electromagnetic energy released from this system is low and contained on the surface vessel. Therefore, this device is not expected to result in any electromagnetic impacts and will not be further analyzed for biological resources in this document. The Navy had previously considered using the expeditionary fast transport USNS Millinocket as a test platform, but there is no information about what ship or ships the service might be considering using for at-sea railgun tests now. In May 2019, the Navy did stand up Surface Developmental Squadron One (SURFDEVRON 1), which The War Zone has covered in detail here and here , to test and evaluate new surface warfare tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as associated technologies, such as advanced weapons. This unit will eventually include, among other ships, the three Zumwalt -class stealth destroyers, which the Navy has long eyed as potential platforms for the railgun. The electromagnetic weapons would offer one possible replacement for the Zumwalt ‘s failed 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS), which effectively became dead weight after the Navy decided not to buy any of the exorbitantly expensive Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP) for the guns to shoot. Regardless of what ship serves as the first test platform, an at-sea test would be a major step forward in the program. If the Navy can prove that the technology is practical and cost-effective, it could be a revolutionary development for naval warfare. The existing prototype weapon can fire solid spike-like kinetic projectiles, also known as Hyper-Velocity Projectiles (HVP), which destroy their targets by smashing into them rather than with an explosive warhead, at speeds up to Mach 6. The HVP program has now taken on a life of its own , separate from the railgun development, as a multi-purpose high-velocity ammunition type, which could include versions with high-explosive warheads , for conventional five-inch naval guns and land-based 155mm howitzers, too. The HVP will use different sized sabots to keep it stable in the barrels of the railgun, five-inch guns, and 155mm howitzers, but the general dimensions of the projectile will remain the same regardless of the weapon firing it., Joseph Trevithick The Navy’s has long had a stated goal of developing a final weapon design with a range of more than 100 miles. The service believes that railgun’s hypervelocity projectiles and ability to hit targets, even fast moving ones, at extended ranges, could make it capable of performing air and missile defense roles, destroying ships at sea, and engaging targets on land. You can read more about the railguns potential capabilities here . A graphic showing a number of potential missions for the railgun., USN That we are starting to hear more about the railgun again and that the program appears to be making steady progress toward an at-sea test is not necessarily surprising. In January 2018, images began to publicly emerge of an experimental Chinese naval railgun mounted on a modified amphibious landing ship. There have been reports since then that the U.S. Intelligence Community is of the view that China’s rapidly growing People’s Liberation Army Navy could have railgun-armed ships in its arsenal by 2025 . China’s development of other advanced weapon systems, as well as similar work going on in Russia, has been a major driver of other aggressive development programs across the U.S. military, including air- , ground- , and sea-launched hypersonic missiles and new air-to-air missiles . It would make sense that Chinese advances in railgun technology would prompt the Navy to step up its own efforts. Chief of Naval Operations Richardson’s decision to curtail public discussion about the railgun program was also part of a larger effort that was aimed, in particular, at making it more difficult for Chinese spies to gain any insight into Navy activities or steal sensitive information . “We’ve learned a lot and the engineering of building something like that that can handle that much electromagnetic energy and not just explode is challenging,” Richardson said at a gathering at the Atlantic Council think tank in February 2019 , when he would have been aware of plans to move the railgun to White Sands and a possible new schedule for at-sea testing. “So we’re going to continue after this, right? We’re going to install this thing. We’re going to continue to develop it, test it. It’s too great a weapon system, so it’s going somewhere, hopefully.” “We just need to get the clock sped up with respect to the railgun,” he added, having noted that the program had been going on for nearly 15 years. “I would say that railgun is kind of the case study that would say ‘This is how innovation maybe shouldn’t happen.'” But with the railgun now engaged in a new set of tests at White Sands and renewed talk of at-sea tests in the future, it certainly seems that the program is finally “going somewhere” after more than a decade of development.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Mattis’s New Unpredictable Carrier Strike Group Deployment Strategy Has Begun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Early last May we received clear indications that Secretary of Defense James Mattis was looking to radically overhaul the way the Navy deploys its forces, and most importantly, their carrier strike groups—the most powerful flotillas on the sea. Now, the first example of this new strategy has come to pass, and it is likely just a preview of what’s to come. America’s nuclear supercarriers have historically deployed in a highly predictable and cyclical fashion, with cruises lasting six to nine months that follow predictable routes. In recent years, there has been a bit more flexibility built into the system for surge operations, but a wily and cunning modus operandi it is not. Mattis described the new plan as “dynamic force employment” and claims it is necessary in a new age of great power competition, stating the following to House lawmakers: “The way you do this is ensure that preparation for great power competition drives not simply a rotational schedule that allows me to tell you, three years from now, which aircraft carrier will be where in the world… When we send them out, it may be for a shorter deployment. There will be three carriers in the South China Sea today, and then, two weeks from now, there’s only one there, and two of them are in the Indian Ocean. They’ll be home at the end of a 90-day deployment. They will not have spent eight months at sea, and we are going to have a force more ready to surge and deal with the high-end warfare as a result, without breaking the families, the maintenance cycles — we’ll actually enhance the training time.” This is precisely what the Truman Carrier Strike Group just did. USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), USS Normandy (CG-60), USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) and USS Forrest Sherman (DDG-98) just spent three months in the 5th and 6th Fleets’ areas of responsibility, returning to Norfolk on July 21st, 2018. A number of other surface combatants assigned to their strike group have remained deployed on unique tasking. CVN-75 Facebook page Truman’s homecoming was a far more subdued event than the usual homecoming spectacle. The Navy specifically downplayed the ship’s return to port after its truncated cruise. Rear Admiral Gene Black, commander of the Truman Carrier Strike Group, described the change in deployment structure and the lack of a major homecoming as such to local reporters : “You’ll notice, I’m in a working uniform and captain is in his flight suit. We don’t have any balloon makers. We don’t have a band and all that. This is a working port… What you’re seeing is the Navy’s execution of dynamic force employment in support of the national defense strategy,” Black said. “We’re strategically predictable and operationally unpredictable… We’re in until we’re told to sail,” Black said. “We could deploy next week and go right back over to sixth fleet or fifth fleet. We’re 100 percent ready to go, we’re fully mission capable. Based on the performance I’ve seen to date, there’s no challenge you can throw at my sailors that they won’t crush.” Admiral Black addresses the crowd pier-side. , CVN-75 facebook page Black also described the Truman’s most recent deployment and the new cruise format as such in a Navy release : “I couldn’t be more proud of this strike group team’s performance over more than three months of operating in a highly-dynamic environment across two theaters… We carried out the full spectrum of missions from sustained combat flight operations to training and integration with NATO allies and regional partners. Our strike group’s missions have demonstrated we are inherently maneuverable and flexible while remaining operational unpredictable to any potential adversary… This epitomizes the Navy’s dynamic force employment concept and shows this strike group is ready and capable of accomplishing any mission, at any time, as our nation directs.” Truman and her escorts will continue to train and be at the ready to deploy at any given time in the coming months, and they could feasibly redeploy tomorrow as an unannounced planned operation or due to a crisis. Overall, the strategy is meant to inject unpredictability into America’s sea-going force.  In the process, it could make life at home for sailors and their families more bearable. Additional training and maintenance opportunities may also prove valuable under this new plan. But how exactly this dynamic force employment strategy will actually coexist with the Navy’s traditional 36-month supercarrier operations cycle is yet to be seen. Under this traditional operational structure, carrier strike groups usually deploy for roughly eight months, execute lower intensity training and receive heavy maintenance for 16 months, and sit ready for a relatively short-notice deployment for another year. Predictability is the cornerstone of this scheduling plan, with air wing workups, major ship maintenance, manning levels, and pretty much everything else planned in parallel to it. The German Navy frigate FGS Hessen (F 221) renders honors to the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75). FGS Hessen operated with the Truman CSG during part of the ship’s deployment to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. , CVN-75 Facebook page As Defense News’s David Larder article on the subject explains, the strategy may provide more reactionary capacity and it may also ease the mechanical pressure being applied to an aging fleet , but it also sacrifices upfront presence and deterrence. Also, there is no getting around it, that if the strike groups do surge it could result in cascading disruptions down the line in terms of everything from operational budgets to the time ships will need to spend in port or drydock for maintenance. 90-day deployments also may be unrealistic in the long-run because of just how long it takes a carrier to transit vast stretches of ocean. More than half that time can be eaten up just reaching a flotilla’s intended station. Whether the return on investment makes sense, under those circumstances, is up for debate. Really, the size, cost, complexity, and rigid maintenance requirements of the nuclear supercarrier make such a strategy hard to realize over the long term. This is just another reason why the Navy needs to field smaller aircraft carriers , potentially with conventional power plants, instead of an all-nuclear-powered supercarrier force that is already becoming dangerously unaffordable. French Rafale-Ms also spent time aboard the Truman during its three-month-long deployment. , CVN-75 Facebook page We’ll have to see just how sustainable all this is with the current hardware in the Navy’s inventory and a very strong habit of highly predictable carrier operations. But if the Navy ends up liking what it sees operationally speaking, it may realize that more deployable and smaller carriers may be necessary to maintain Mattis’s dynamic force employment strategy in the decades to come. In the meantime, welcome home to the Truman Carrier Strike Group! It may have been a shorter deployment, but a deployment all the same.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 27, 2019",Navy’s Stealth Destroyers Now Part Of Experimental Squadron Alongside Drone Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s official, the Navy has stood up Surface Development Squadron 1, abbreviated SURFDEVRON, in the place of the already existing Zumwalt Squadron 1 that had been established to operate the Navy three Zumwalt class stealth destroyers . This new experimental unit will not only be responsible for the Zumwalt class ships, it is also tasked with ushering in a new era of unmanned surface warfare and more. USNI News’ Megan Eckstein has put out a great report on the establishment of the outfit, a move that will have far-ranging impacts and could significantly influence the U.S. Navy’s future force structure and battle doctrine. The new unit will first focus on figuring out how the Zumwalt class destroyers’ unique capabilities and technologies can be leveraged by the fleet. This is especially important as the ship’s identity has changed drastically in recent months following the revelation that its Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) that take up the better part of the front third of the huge destroyers are now considered dead weight as there is no round that can affordably make use of them. The Navy has since separated the AGS issue from the class’s larger mission, deciding to move ahead with getting the ships in operational shape regardless of missing a key reason why they were built. The Zumwalt class will now be focused on surface strike . This could one day include ripping out the guns altogether and replacing them with something else—possibly more vertical launch cells—if the service thinks it’s worth spending even more money on the ships that already cost an ungodly amount to develop and procure—roughly $23 billion for just three hulls. Other major changes from this new organizational structure include: Pairing the Zumwalts with unmanned ships. The first of these vessels will be two Sea Hunter experimental drone ships —one of which has been operating for years and has been incredibly successful—a main reason why the Navy is now betting big on unmanned surface warfare. The other will be delivered in 2020. The medium and large drone ships the Navy has set out to procure this year will follow those efforts, working with the Zumwalt class ships experimentally to build a list of key recommendations that will drive everything from future procurement to tactics and procedures for the fleet. Between 2020 and 2023 SURFDEVRON will have all three Zumwalt class destroyers operating alongside the two Sea Hunter experimental unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for experimentation. By 2024, medium and large USVs will begin joining the squadron. Around that same time, the first four Littoral Combat Ships built, which are now relegated to testing and training , will join SURFDEVRON, as well. This will integrate work they are doing with small USVs, leaving seamless continuity of unmanned surface vehicle experimentation and operation. The unit will not just experiment with unmanned assets and the Zumwalt and Littoral Combat Ships themselves, but all types of new mechanical systems, sensors, communications, tactics, procedures, weapons, and more. Overall, the unit is seen as an accelerator of sorts to get new ideas and capabilities to the fleet faster. Sea Hunter at rest., USN What’s most interesting in Eckstein’s report is that we finally have some details as to how the Zumwalts will actually deploy operationally beyond just functioning in an experimental capacity. Eckstein explains it as follows and quotes Vice Admiral Richard Brown, commander of Naval Surface Forces and Naval Surface Force Pacific for further clarification: As for the Zumwalt destroyers, they will continue with plans to operate as part of a carrier strike group eventually. Under the Optimized Fleet Response Plan, they will go through training and then deploy with the rest of the assigned strike group, but during the sustainment phase – when the CSG would be maintaining its peak readiness at home and being on call for tasking as needed – the DDG-1000s would peel off and conduct experiments instead. “It is such a unique and capable class of ship. We want to be able to quickly experiment with it,” Brown said. “So the Zumwalt class will be assigned to a carrier strike group, they will do the whole basic, advanced phase of training, integrated training, go deploy, they’ll be in the same under the OFRP, much like a cruiser or destroyer – but the capability that those ships bring is so unique that we really believe they belong in the SURFDEVRON so we can continually and rapidly experiment with them when they’re not on deployment.” USS Lyndon B. Johnson under construction at Bath Iron Works in Maine. , USN All this sounds intriguing and it seems like a great way to really figure out what the Navy wants in its future fleet, but it is also an expensive and resource-heavy endeavor that may foreshadow exactly what The War Zone has warned of for so long—that the Zumwalt class destroyers could end up only being experimental test ships. Due to their unique design that features many one-off components, if these ships aren’t out on the front lines, justifying the existence of three of them may become very challenging. As a result, it is possible that one or two of the three ships could end up being cannibalized to keep the remaining hull or hulls functioning. This is especially true if sequester returns or budgets shrink due to changing political winds, a faltering economy, and/or the specter of the ballooning national debt. In fact, according to the latest GAO report on the DDG-1000 program, this is already happening: To limit further delays to DDG 1000 and DDG 1001 construction, the Navy has authorized its shipbuilder to take parts from DDG 1002—the third and final ship of the class, which is under construction. The Navy does not yet know the full extent to which these actions will delay DDG 1002’s construction schedule, but stated that these parts typically can be borrowed and replaced without causing a delay. The Navy has scheduled the ship’s HM&E delivery in March 2020 followed by final delivery in September 2022. Just replacing the guns is a good example of how hard it is to justify investing more money into such a small fleet and one that has already been woefully watered down in terms of capabilities time and again over the years. In fact, just the change in focus from land attack to surface strike will cost a huge sum of money according to the GAO: In a January 2018 decision memorandum, the Navy changed DDG 1000’s primary mission from land attack to offensive surface strike. Navy officials are in the process of determining the operational concept for the ship within its new mission. The Navy has yet to establish testing plans to evaluate these future mission sets. According to Navy officials, the Navy’s planned modifications to support the new mission will cost about $1 billion, from non-acquisition accounts. Time will tell if the Zumwalt class becomes the white elephant many of us have warned it could become or if its tiny cadre of three ships will stay whole and deploy operationally in a reliable manner while also being tasked with experimentation on a grand level. But in the meantime, at least they will be helping the Navy turbocharge its efforts to modernize its forces and get a leg up on the growing peer state threats abroad.

Our good friend and contributor , flying photographer Frank Crebas of Bluelife Aviation , put it together, along with our other great friend Rich Cooper from the Centre of Aviation Photography , and location coordinator Tim Laurence , not to mention the 323rd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Edwards AFB. Frank has flown missions alongside RNLAF’s F-35s based out of Edwards AFB as part of the combined F-35 test effort and his photo work documenting the RNLAF’s new fighter’s developmental road to initial operating capability has made its way all over defense and social media. Rich Cooper arranges the world’s best aviation photography opportunities and takes some of the best shots around as well. With Frank and Rich acting as a nexus between the aircrews and photographers, the magic was able to happen. The formation was led by Colonel Albert ‘Vidal’ de Smit, the RNLAF detachment commander at Edwards AFB. His wingman was Major Ian ‘Gladys’ Knight., Dafydd Philips Although this was not by any means the first time F-35s thundered through the canyon, it certainly was the most dynamic. The jets showed up after finishing a sortie supporting exercise Green Flag . In the end the spectacular visit by the F-35s was a win-win for the RNLAF and the F-35 program as a whole. Pilots got to practice a bit of complex low-level flying while also gaining a bunch of publicity in the process. Regardless of your stance on the F-35, there is no doubt that those who have shepherded the program along, from the pilots to the test contractors to the ground support crews, deserve a ton of recognition for their hard work and dedication. These shots of the F-35 in action, and others like it, certainly provide that recognition is spades. RNLAF F-35 tears its way through Rainbow Canyon., Dafydd Philips As Rainbow Canyon continues to draw aviation photographers and military technology enthusiasts from around the globe, it hasn’t disappointed in providing spectacular subjects for photographers to shoot on an incredible backdrop, as well as some unique spotting opportunities. For instance, just last week one of Area 51’s rare F-16Ds blasted through the canyon with an interesting sensor attached. But these F-35s put on an entirely different level of display altogether and thankfully we have video and pictures to show for it. Well done RNLAF, Bluelife Aviation ,and Dafydd Philips, well done.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Canada Has Given Up Trying To Find A Good Home For Its Retired Leopard Tanks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada is throwing in the towel when it comes to trying to find a suitable buyer for dozens of aging Leopard C2 main battle tanks. A potential deal to sell them to Jordan has apparently fallen through amid that country’s own plans to trim back its heavy armored forces and now the bulk of the C2s look destined for the junk heap. Canada’s Global News was first to report on the development after learning of the negotiations with the Jordanian government through its source’s and the country’s access to information law. Canadian authorities have been trying to sell off the tanks, upgraded versions of the examples it first bought from Germany in the late 1970s, since 2015 . “No firm buyer was found and the department is assessing alternate disposal options,” Daniel Le Bouthillier, a spokesperson for the Canadian Department of National Defense, told Global News. “The last option would be to destroy the tanks.” Another possibility would be to turn them into training targets for the Canadian Army. Of the approximately 50 remaining C2s, 11 will also be put into museums or on static display outside Canadian Forces facilities, according to Le Bouthillier. A Leopard C2 tank, without a common add-on armor package, already on display in Canada., Skaarup.HA via Wikimedia Otherwise, Canada seems unlikely to find another interested buyer. The C2s are based on the Leopard 1 , which Porsche first designed for what was initially a multi-national tank program that first began in 1956. The Canadians began receiving their vehicles in 1978, at which time they were known as C1s. These were equivalent to the Leopard 1A3 variant, which had improved armor and sights over earlier types. In 2000, Canada put 114 of its 127 C1s through an upgrade program , with the resulting vehicles becoming known as the C2. The modifications included replacing the entire turret with the design found on the Leopard 1A5, the final production type, which included a version of the day- and night-capable fire control system found on the more modern Leopard 2 series. One of the Leopard 1 prototypes, which Porsche built in 1960, in a museum in Germany., Darkone via Wikimedia German manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) had also designed this larger turret to accommodate a 120mm gun instead of the Leopard 1’s original 105mm cannon. KMW and its customers both found that this was no more cost-effective than simply buying Leopard 2s, which had this weapon as standard. As a result, the Leopard 1A6 program came to a close after a single prototype. The larger, 62-ton Leopard 2 also had the advantage of being faster and better protected than its 42-ton predecessor. The Canadian C2s could also accommodate the Modular Expandable Armor System (MEXAS) from German firm IBD Deisenroth Engineering. Canada had deployed a small number of C1s with this same add-on armor package to Kosovo in 1999 on a trial basis and subsequently made it a standard option on the C2s. In the end, the C2s only ever saw combat in Afghanistan, with units deploying to the country between 2006 and 2011. That experience might also help explain why the Canadians were unable to find a buyer for the remaining tanks. Within a year of the first deployment, Canada’s government had made the decision to purchase new Leopard 2s as a replacement. The most immediate issue was the Afghan heat, which was sweltering for crews in tanks with no air conditioning that Canada had originally expected would primarily fight against a Soviet invasion of more temperate parts of Europe. The C2s eventually received a cooling system to mitigate this issue. Though more comfortable than before, the tankers still had to contend with Taliban rocket-propelled grenades and roadside bombs. Canada lost three MEXAS-equipped C2s while engaged in Afghanistan and another 15 reportedly suffered some type of damage. By the end of 2007, the Canadians had already secured a short-term lease on 20 Leopard 2s to supplement the older tanks as a stopgap measure ahead getting the ones they had purchased from KMW. “This government will not hesitate to provide the Canadian Forces whatever equipment it requires to carry out the difficult tasks we ask them to perform,” then-Defense Minister Gordon O’Connor said in April 2007 . “They [the Leopard 2s] are state-of-the-art.” A Canadian Leopard 2 in Afghanistan in 2011., The Canadian Press, MURRAY BREWSTER/AP With this in mind, it’s hard to imagine that a country like Jordan, situated in the heart of the Middle East, which faces potential threats, such as ISIS terrorists, armed with improvised explosive devices and suicide car bombs , rocket-propelled grenades, and guided anti-tank missiles , would be inclined to pick up the aging, second-hand tanks. The country does have an active and capable domestic defense industry that has extensive experience upgrading main battle tanks , but it’s not clear how cost effective it would have been to put the dated C2s through such an update program. On top of that, in February 2018, the Jordanian Armed Forces revealed plans to retire their own larger Challenger 1 -based Al Hussein tanks in favor of a mixed, more flexible armored force. The Jordanian Army eventually plans to field a force made up of upgraded American-made M60A3s , known Phoenixes , along with Iveco Centauro 8×8 wheeled 105mm assault guns. This course of action would almost certainly have killed any prospects Canada had for a deal for good. With Jordan no longer an option, it’s hard to say who else might have necessarily been interested in acquiring a Leopard 1-based tank that is increasingly hard to maintain. There are only six countries in the world that still operate any variants of this type. In October 2017, Brazil reportedly visited Italy and Switzerland to discuss buying retired Leopard 1A5s from those countries to augment its existing fleet. The other problem is that both Canadian and German officials would have to approve any final sale, which could have made it difficult for Canada to offload the tanks to any country with a questionable human rights record. The governments in both countries both espouse a major commitment to human rights, but have increasingly come under fire for exporting arms to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey , which are respectively involved in controversial interventions in Yemen and Syria . A Brazilian Leopard 1A5 tank., Exército Brasileiro Difficulties in securing export approval from the Germans had already put the brakes on a Belgian plan to deliver Leopard 1A5s to Lebanon. As of 2010 , the tanks had yet to arrive and it’s unclear if they ever did. The Belgian M113-based Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicles (AIFV) did make it to the Lebanese military, since those vehicles only required approval from the U.S. government, which has been actively supplying weapons and other military equipment to Lebanon itself. “The marketplace for us to sell and basically keep within most of our policies to not abet countries that are, shall we say, problematic, is pretty limited,” Rob Huebert, a senior research fellow at the University of Calgary’s Center for Military and Strategic Analysis, told Global News. The Canadian government appears to have arrived at much the same conclusion. Unless the situation changes significantly in the coming months, it looks like the remains of Canada’s Leopard C2 fleet is finally headed for the firing range or the scrap yard.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 31, 2019",The Afghan Air Force Just Can’t Quit The Hind Gunship Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Afghan Air Force’s fleet of four Mi-35 Hind helicopters is grounded and it’s not clear when they might fly again. As far as its American advisors are concerned, the service shouldn’t even have any of the imposing Russian-made gunships anymore and won’t offer any support to get them flying again, but the Afghans continue to resist the push to retire the type for good. The Pentagon included an update on Afghanistan’s Hinds in its latest Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan report, which it published in June 2019, but only publicly released on July 12, 2019 . This is a semi-annual review of the security situation in that country, as well as support from the NATO-led coalition to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANSDF), which includes both military and national police elements. This latest edition covered the period from Dec. 1, 2018, to May 31, 2019. “All four [Mi-35] aircraft required their 500-hour inspection and have been grounded until completed,” the report noted. “The AAF is trying to source funding to complete repairs.” The Hind was an iconic component of the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan, which lasted from 1979 until 1989. The country’s nominally independent Soviet-backed military also received dozens of the heavily armed and armored gunships, which also have the unique ability to carry a small number of armed troops, during the conflict. An Afghan Air Force Hind in action in 1989. , AP Photo/Liu Heung Shing The helicopters continued to be a feature in the country’s civil conflicts in the years that followed the departure of Soviet forces. By the time of the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, though few were still operational. But, as the NATO-led coalition began to rebuild the country’s military, the Hinds, along with Russian-made Mi-17 Hip armed transport helicopters, became an important component of the reformed Afghan Air Force. The two helicopters have a certain degree of commonality and are relatively easy to operate and maintain. When it came to Afghanistan, they were also types that many Afghan pilots and ground crews were already familiar with. But the Pentagon’s latest Afghanistan review only mentions the gunships in a footnote, because the NATO-led coalition and the U.S. military, which is the biggest contributor to that multi-national force, refuse to help the Afghan Air Force with their operation or maintenance. This has been the case since 2015 , when Afghan authorities formally removed the Hinds from the service’s official force structure at the urging of their NATO advisors. “The Mi-35s were removed from the authorized fleet in 2015, but the Afghans continue to attempt to sustain them,” the Pentagon review added. “DoD [the Department of Defense] has advised them against doing so and to instead focus on the aircraft that DoD is providing as a part of the aviation modernization program.” Leading up to 2015, it had appeared that Afghanistan would have no choice but to give up on its Hinds for good. The Czech Republic had supplied five Mi-35s to the growing Afghan Air Force in 2008, but after seven years of combat operations, they had hit the end of their service life. The United States pushed the country to adopt the smaller MD 530F light attack helicopter. A Czech-supplied Afghan Air Force Hind in 2013., US Army The stated reason for this was the desire for the Afghans to adopt an attack helicopter platform that was less maintenance intensive and otherwise easier to operate than the aging Hinds. On top of that, after Russia’s seizure and illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, it became increasingly politically untenable for the U.S. government to continue purchasing Russian-made helicopters for the Afghan Air Force and otherwise contracting with Russian suppliers to support them. Subsequent sanctions against the Kremlin only compounded the difficulties, which also had serious impacts on Afghanistan’s Mi-17s, a topic The War Zone has covered in-depth in the past. But in September 2015, Afghan Air Force Colonel Qalandar Shah Qalandari gave The New York Times a scathing interview about the smaller helicopters, commonly known as Little Birds, decrying them as ill-suited to the country’s conditions. “It’s unsafe to fly, the engine is too weak, the tail rotor is defective and it’s not armored,” he declared. “If we go down after the enemy we’re going to have enemy return fire, which we can’t survive,” he continued. “If we go up higher, we can’t visually target the enemy.” Qalandari, a Soviet-trained pilot who was, at the time, the country’s most decorated aviator, wanted more Hinds. That same year , India, an increasingly important partner of the Afghan government, stepped in to donate four more of the gunships. These are the ones that are now grounded pending the 500-flight hour inspections. It is worth noting that the exact capabilities the existing Hinds had provided up until that point had often been questionable, given the small size of the fleet , limited numbers of individuals trained to operate and maintain them, and dwindling spare parts inventories . The gunships did have the range to self-deploy to different forward operating locations around the country, but there was only so much capacity four helicopters could offer across an area just slightly smaller than Texas. Afghan pilots only had very limited abilities to conduct operations at night , too, when the Taliban and other militants and terrorists in Afghanistan are most active . In June 2015, right around the planned retirement date of the Czech-supplied gunships in 2015, the Pentagon also revealed that Afghan Hind crews had fired unguided 57mm rockets from the helicopters for the first time in more than three years. This appeared to be a restriction NATO advisors had imposed on Afghan pilots to try to reduce civilian casualties. In the intervening period, each of the helicopters had only carried a pair of 23mm gun pods, one slung under the stub wings on either side of the fuselage, in addition to the four-barrel 12.7mm YakB machine gun in their nose turrets. Now, it’s unclear if the four existing gunships will fly again, but the Afghan Air Force still hasn’t given up on flying Hinds. India is in the process of donating four more. The first two of these helicopters, which came by way of Belarus to avoid violating U.S. sanctions, arrived in May 2019 . “These are a replacement for the four attack helicopters previously gifted by India to Afghanistan in 2015,” the Indian Embassy in the country said in a statement at the time . Indian authorities specifically said that the gunships would help in “combating the scourge of terrorism.” One of the two Mi-35s India delivered to Afghanistan in May 2019., Indian Embassy in Afghanistan In 2018, The Diplomat had reported that an Indian team had also conducted an assessment of the Afghan Air Force two years earlier and concluded that it would take $50 million to rehabilitate another 11 Hinds that remain in storage, as well as seven unspecified transport helicopters, likely Mi-17s. It is unclear if this total includes the five Hinds the Czech Republic had supplied nearly a decade ago. There have been separate reports that India and Russia might have reached an agreement to help maintain Afghanistan’s Russian-made helicopter fleets, though this could risk triggering U.S. sanctions. Somewhat curiously, the U.S. government has been a major advocate for India increasing its support Afghanistan, even as it pushes the Afghan Air Force to abandon the Hinds. The United States continues to deliver MD 530Fs and, regardless of any shortcomings , have been flying steadily increasing numbers of combat sorties in recent years. However, contractors continue to provide 80 percent of the required maintenance and logistics support of these helicopters. The U.S. military now has plans to eventually supply the Afghans with an armed version of the UH-60A+ Black Hawk . The United States is already in the midst of a deeply controversial plan to replace the Afghan Air Force’s Mi-17s with Black Hawks. In recent years, the U.S. government has also been facilitating steady deliveries of A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft to further bolster the Afghan Air Force’s close air support capabilities. AC-208 Eliminator light attack aircraft are now entering Afghan service, as well. But, if the past five years are any indication, the Afghan Air Force is likely to continue flying Hinds, even in a limited capacity, for the foreseeable future. With India’s help, the service may even be able to increase the size of this “unauthorized fleet.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Afghan Air Force Air Air Forces Helicopters"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 17, 2019",Italian Cops Raid Neo-Fascists And Find Air-To-Air Missile That France Had Sold To Qatar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Italian police have seized a French-made Matra Super 530F air-to-air missile in the course of raids to arrest multiple individuals allegedly linked to far-right extremist groups who had provided aid to groups fighting Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. Authorities also uncovered a large cache of automatic rifles, submachine guns, and other small arms, as well as Nazi paraphernalia, during one of the arrests involving an individual linked to Italy’s neo-fascist Forza Nuova political party. A regional special police force, also known by the Italian acronym DIGOS, in the Northern Italian city of Turin headed up the operation on July 15, 2019, but authorities in the cities of Milan, Varese, Forli, and Novara also took part. Police found the Matra missile, which is reportedly live, in a hangar at Forli airport. Fabio Del Bergiolo, one of three individuals that Italian authorities arrested, was a former customs official and had run for a seat in Italy’s Senate as a member of Forza Nuova in 2001. Alessandro Monti, a Swiss national, runs the company that owns the hangar where the missile was located. There do not appear to be any additional details on Fabio Bernardi, another Italian, who was the third individuals swept up in the raids. Pictures and video that authorities released of the items seized show a wide array of contemporary and more dated European, American, and Eastern European small arms, including AK- and AR-15/M16-type rifles of unknown origins, Austrian and Czech submachine guns, and more. This is “a seizure with few precedents for the quality of the weapons and their violent potential,” Turin Police Chief Giuseppe De Matteis said, according to Italian newspaper la Repubblica . But, by far, the most curious item was the Super 530F . Matra first introduced the medium-range, semi-active radar-seeking Super 530F in 1979 specifically for the Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jet. The missile was an evolution of the short-range R.530 , which first entered French service in 1962 and used a mix of infrared and semi-active radar guidance. The missile’s transit case has markings that say it was originally sold to Qatar as part of a contract signed in 1980. It’s not clear when Matra manufactured this particular missile or where and how the arrested individuals acquired it. Qatar bought 14 F1s, along with weapons to go with them, in 1980. The missile reportedly remains in Qatari inventory, along with the Super 530D, though the country’s newer Mirage 2000 fighter jets, which it obtained in the 1990s, now primarily carry newer MICA missiles from European missile consortium MBDA. Personnel prepare a Qatari Mirage F1 for a mission during the first Gulf War in 1991., DOD There’s no indication that the arrested individuals intended to use the missile in any way. La Repubblica reported that police had been tipped off the weapon after intercepting calls to and from Del Bergiolo about selling it. The group reportedly was offering it for 470,000 Euros – just over $529,100 at the rate of exchange at the time of writing – and that one of the buyers included “a foreign government official.” It’s not clear what government entity might be in the market for a single air-to-air missile that is compatible only with a limited number of aircraft. After 40 years and numerous export sales around the world, the Super 530F is likely of diminished intelligence value. One possibility might be Libya’s Government of National Accord (GNA), the internationally recognized government in that country, which operates a very small number of Mirage F1s. The GNA has been in desperate need of weapons and other military equipment to stave off the advances of rogue General Khalifa Haftar , who, along with his Libyan National Army (LNA), is trying to seize control of the country. In May 2019, the LNA shot down one of the GNA’s F1s near Tripoli and captured its pilot, who turned out to be a U.S. Air Force veteran. The details about how Jamie Sponaugle, who had been a maintainer during his service, but earned a private pilots license after leaving the Air Force, came to be an apparent mercenary pilot in Libya remain murky. Haftar’s forces released him in June 2019 as part of a deal that Saudi Arabia reportedly helped broker. Another potential customer might be Iran, which also has a small fleet of Mirage F1s it captured as they fled Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991. The Iranians have a noted history of acquiring missiles and other weaponry on the black market and then reverse-engineering them for their own use or for export to regional proxies . Iran, as well as its regional allies, have also repurposed locally-built clones of various missiles for new roles , including as land-based surface-to-air weapons , and could potentially do the same to the Super 530F design. There could be secondary market beyond foreign governments for the missile, including certain specific components, such as its radar seeker. The weapon does also contain a roughly 70-pound high-explosive warhead. Beyond the missile and the guns, Italian police also put various Nazi paraphernalia on display, including various items that appear to be artifacts from Nazi Germany. Italy’s parliament tried to ban fascist symbols, as well as the Roman salute , in 2017, but faced opposition from various political parties , including the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which is now part of the country’s governing coalition. Far-right neo-fascist political parties in Italy are a small, but still notable force in Italian politics. They have also seen something of a resurgence in recent years, latching onto popular discontent surrounding various issues, particularly immigration and a growing influx of refugees , especially from North Africa and the Middle East. There have also been concerns about increasing links between Russia and right-wing groups with similar agendas across Europe. Recently, a tape recording emerged of Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini during a visit to Moscow in 2018 discussing ways to secretly funnel Russian oil money into the coffers of his own right-wing Lega Nord party. For years already , Italian authorities have also been investigating far-right groups for sending individuals to fight alongside Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine, as well as other aid. Just on July 3, 2019 , Italian authorities jailed three other men after a court in Genoa found them guilty of fighting in Ukraine. However, in this case, Italian police said that the individuals arrested had been linked to groups fighting against the Russian-supported forces in Ukraine. There have been accusations that forces fighting on the side of the Ukrainian government, most notably the Azov Battalion , also have ties to neo-fascist elements, both in the country and elsewhere . Separate reports suggested this latest series of raids may have also stemmed from searches of Forza Nuovo’s offices in Turin in June, which led to the arrest of the party’s top regional official, Luigi Cortese, on charges of “ apologizing for fascism ,” that is to say publicly lauding the World War II-era regime of Benito Mussolini, which is banned under Italian law. DIGOS raided the homes of other Forza Nuovo members last week . It’s unclear what will happen now to any of the items Italian authorities seized. So far, there are no reports that Qatar has asked for its missile back. Correction: Though it has been widely reported that the arrests that led to the seizure of the Super 530F missile were the result of an investigation into groups tied to Russian-back separatists in Ukraine, the actual official press release regarding the raids says they were the product of monitoring far-right Italian groups supporting the other side.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 23, 2019",France Launches The First Of Its New Class Of Super Quiet “Barracuda” Attack Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. French shipbuilder Naval Group launched the future first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine Suffren earlier today, the first of six submarines the French Navy will eventually receive to replace the existing Rubis class. These new boats , which will be able to fire SCALP land-attack cruise missiles and carry small teams of special operations forces, will be significantly more capable than their predecessors and be able to take on a varied array of missions. France’s President Emmanuel Macron and the country’s top naval officer Admiral Christophe Prazuck, among other dignitaries, attended the launch ceremony at Naval Group’s shipyard in Cherbourg on the English Channel on July 12, 2019. What was then known as DCNS first laid down the future Suffren in 2007. The French Navy expects to commission the boat next year. Suffren is years behind schedule, with the original contract with DCNS saying that the boat was supposed have begun sea trials in 2016, with delivery later that year or the year after. But Naval Group agreed to a fixed-price contract, whereby it agrees to shoulder the burden for any cost overruns, which has helped keep the price tag stable. As present, according to the French government , the total budget for the six-submarine program is approximately $10.2 billion, an impressively low figure by modern combat submarine standards . “The construction of the Suffren is a collective success, the result of a strong cooperation with our long-standing partners: the French Navy and the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA), but also the Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission (CEA), TechnicAtome, and all the manufacturers of the sector,” Hervé Guillou, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Naval Group, said in a press release . “Now, we are all focused on finalizing the Suffren tests at the shipyard, with the start-up of the nuclear boiler room in the coming weeks, but also on producing the complete series [class].” Development of the submarines, also known as the Barracuda class, first began in 1998. The design incorporates a number of features, including the advanced pump-jet propulsor, which leveraged earlier work and lessons learned from the French Navy’s Triomphant class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Those larger subs had begun entering service in the 1990s. The Triomphant class also represented the French Navy’s second generation of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. Suffren and her sisters will similarly replace France’s first-generation nuclear attack submarines, the Rubis class , which began entering service in the early 1980s. The Rubis class had proved to be much noisier than expected, a serious issue, to say the least, as submarines rely on their ability to stay silent to survive. The last two boats in the class had a significantly revised hullform and other modifications to make them quieter and the other four subs were eventually brought up to the same standard. The Rubis class submarine Casabianca ., via Wikimedia Naval Group touts the new Suffren class as particularly stealthy. Vincent Martinot-Lagarde, the company’s director of the Barracuda program, claims the boats are no louder than the “sound of the ocean” or “the noise made by shrimp,” according to Defense News . This may be something of an exaggeration, but, by all indications, the Barracuda design is set to be one of the most advanced submarines to date when it comes to quite-running capabilities. It’s also interesting to note that the French shipbuilder also subsequently developed a conventionally-powered derivative, known as the Shortfin Barracuda , which uses an advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, for export. In 2016, Australia became the first customer for a variant of this design, which The War Zone profiled in depth at the time, and plans to buy a dozen of these boats, which will become the Attack -class. That contract, worth tens of billions of dollars, and how the Australian government handled subsequent negotiations with Naval Group, has turned into a significant controversy and could become the subject of a formal inquiry . The French shipbuilder is also now pitching Shortfin Barracuda to India . The class is unique in its size and capabilities for a modern non-nuclear attack submarine. The idea being that it offers capabilities that begin to approach those of a nuclear boat, but without having to deal with the infrastructure and cost to support and sustain nuclear powerplants. An artist’s conception of a future Attack -class submarine., Royal Australian Navy For France, the new Suffren class submarines will offer important added capabilities over the older Rubis class . The new boats are longer and wider and displace nearly twice as much when submerged. Though both classes have four 533mm torpedo tubes, the Suffren and her sisters have 20 storage racks for torpedoes, as well as tube-launched Exocet anti-ship cruise missiles, which is four more than in the magazine on a Rubis . The French Navy also plans to integrate the SCALP land-attack cruise missile on the new subs, too, opening up entirely new possible missions for the submarines. These would also be tube-launched, as the Suffren class does not have a vertical launch system capability. The French Navy’s Aquitaine class frigate Languedoc fired surface-launched versions of these missiles during U.S.-led strikes against chemical weapons sites in Syria in April 2018 . France also employed air-launched variants of this weapon during that operation. French aircraft have fired the missiles at ISIS targets in Syria and used them during the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011, too. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fatOaut82Xk “This is not just a patrol submarine,” Admiral Christophe Prazuck said at Suffren ‘s launch ceremony, according to Defense News . “It’s a hunter.” Despite being larger, the Suffren class has a typical crew complement that is five individuals smaller than that on the Rubis class, due to its advanced systems and greater automation. In addition, it has space for a contingent of 12 naval special operators. The submarines have the ability to mount a dry deck shelter (DDS) on the upper hull, offering a “hangar” for swimmer delivery vehicles and possible unmanned underwater vehicles in the future, as well. Combat swimmers would be able to enter and exit the submarine while submerged through the DDS via a diving chamber . In addition, submarines, especially ultra-quiet ones such as the Suffren class, have the inherent ability to act as intelligence gathering platforms . The French boats’ low noise signature will also make them well suited to silently creeping around in enemy littoral areas. Naval Group expects to deliver three more of the submarines in 2025 and the last two in 2030. As the Suffren class boats arrive, the French Navy will begin to phase out the Rubis class. All told, Suffren’s launch represents a major step forward in France’s modernization of its submarine force. The full class, which French authorities expect to serve into the 2060s, at least, is set to become the backbone of the country’s submarine capabilities for decades to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is no aircraft in the history of human flight that seems to have captured the public’s imagination like the SR-71 Blackbird. I have covered all aspects of this aircraft and its history, including first-hand accounts of memorable missions , the plane’s celestial navigation system , very memorable flybys — and I mean very memorable —and departures , fascinating cockpit tours , tense Cold War moments , and even some of the exotic concepts that were proposed for its predecessor, the A-12 Oxcart . Even the finest details about the SR-71 and its history are extremely interesting, yet a really good general overview of the iconic black jet can be just as intriguing. A segment from Wonderful World Of Flying, shot back in the 1990s and hosted by airline pilot Barry Schiff, is exactly that. The video gives us a hands-on look at the broader strokes that make up the SR-71 and its concept of operations, along with some interesting factual tidbits along the way. It was shot at the very end of the Blackbird’s flying career, as the final flying examples were serving with NASA , which is a civilian agency, so the video is about as straightforward and up-close and personal as it gets. It’s amazing to think that nearly 55 years after the SR-71 first took flight , and two decades after its last flight, it still offers so many fascinating elements to study and remains arguably the most fascinating flying machine mankind ever created… Well, at least that we know of!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 1, 2019",You Can Buy One Of The Army’s Most Capable Ships As The Service Guts Its Naval Fleets (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government is auctioning off the former USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda , one of the eight General Frank S. Besson -class Logistics Support Vessels, or LSVs, which V.T. Halter Marine built for the U.S. Army between the 1980s and the early 2000s. The General Services Administration says it expects to sell off another LSV, along with dozens of other landing craft, tugs, and other Army maritime assets by the end of 2020. This is in line with reports earlier this year that the service has decided to gut its already unappreciated maritime capabilities, which could easily prove to be short-sighted given the value of these vessels, especially with regards to a potential conflict and the Pacific region . The former Kuroda , also known by the hull number LSV-7, which displaces 6,000 tons, first appeared on the General Services Administration’s (GSA) official auction site earlier in July 2019 and the auction ends on July 31. The ship is presently pier-side in Tacoma, Washington, and one can contact the Army to schedule an in-person inspection. At the time of writing, someone had bid $1 million for the vessel, though this has not met an unspecified reserve price for the ship, which originally cost $26 million to build. You can read more about the LSVs in detail in this past profile of these ships at The War Zone . Kuroda had entered Army service in 2006 , making her a relatively young ship. She is the second to last of the General Frank S. Besson -class and, along with her sister ship USAV Major General Robert Smalls , or LSV-8, it is part of a small subclass. These two LSVs are 1,800 tons heavier than their cousins, primarily on account of a longer, more hydrodynamic bow. They also have double the horsepower of the earlier ships, the ability to generate large quantities of fresh water, and otherwise feature an expanded design with better living conditions for longer-duration operations. These capabilities, together with a range of 6,500 miles, meant they were better suited to responding to crises farther from their home ports, especially across the vast expanses of the Pacific. Some views from inside the former Kuroda that the GSA posted online as part of the auction., GSA GSA The Army’s LSVs, in general, represent the top-tier of the service’s obscure maritime capabilities , which are often referred to as the Army’s Navy. This allows the service to not necessarily have to call on the U.S. Navy or chartered ships in order to move personnel and materiel by sea. This, in turn, also eases the burdens on the Navy, which has seen its amphibious and sealift capabilities increasingly stretched thin already. The LSVs, which have front- and rear-mounted ramps to rapidly unload vehicles, including tanks and other heavy armor, and other cargo straight onto beaches, can also support a wide variety of important non-combat missions, including aid in the response to major natural disasters . They’re also ideal for moving oversized cargo. In 2009, Kuroda transported a C-17A Globemaster III aircraft fuselage, which was destined to become a training aid , from Seal Beach in California to Fort Lee in Virginia, highlighting both its load-carrying and long-distance capabilities. Dockworkers load the C-17 fuselage onto Kuroda in 2009., DOD So, it had already come as something of a shock when it emerged in January 2019 that the Army had decided, seemingly out of nowhere, to divest a significant portion of its watercraft fleets. Publicly, the Army has described the effort as limited to “Reserve Component” units, which includes the Army Reserve and National Guard, and as being a “right-sizing” of its maritime capabilities in order to free up funding for other priorities. “This will be a long-term process as we review all aspects of Army watercraft employment,” Cheryle Rivas, an Army spokesperson, told The War Zone by Email in January . “The Army watercraft force that emerges will be more ready and capable of meeting the National Defense Strategy and combatant commander requirements.” However, it remains unclear exactly how the Army arrived at this decision in the first place and, by all indications, it came as a surprise to the units affected, too. “A lot of things are happening a lot faster than we’re prepared for,” Chief Warrant Officer 2 Brandon Redmon, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Morehead City, North Carolina told the Carteret County News-Times in April 2019. This mirrors the comments that U.S. Army Major David Finn, the Chief Force Manager for the Army Reserve’s 377th Theater Sustainment Command, made during a briefing on the divestment plan in January 2019, which The War Zone subsequently obtained. Finn’s briefing says that the decision was made outside of routine Army Structure memorandums, or ARSTRUCs, and that, at that time, there were still no written orders from the Department of the Army’s top headquarters, or HQDA, to inactivate Reserve watercraft units, despite separate instructions to have them shut down completely by September 2019. A slide from Major Finn’s January 2019 briefing describing the “issues” with the Army’s watercraft plans., US Army “The ARSTRUC reflect changes to the force that are a result of critical analysis conducted during the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process,” Finn wrote in the notes accompanying the PowerPoint presentation. “Usually an in-activation is identified in the ARSTRUC between 2-5 years prior to EDATE [Effective Date of the inactivation].” The decision to sell off Kuroda , one of the two youngest and most capable LSVs, only further calls into question what kind of watercraft capabilities, if any, the service is truly interested in retaining. GSA’s announcement that it could auction a second LSV might point to the Army planning to get rid of Smalls , as well. A banner advertisement on GSA’s auction website also says that it expects to sell 18 LCU-2000 and up to 36 LCM-8 landing craft , along with 20 tugs and a pair of floating crane barges, between now and the end of next year. The divestment of the LCM-8s makes some sense, given the Army awarded a contract worth nearly $1 billion in 2017 to buy all new Maneuver Support Vessels (Light) , or MSV(L)s, to replace these Vietnam War-era landing craft. A screenshot of the top of the GSA Auctions website at the time of writing with the advertisement touting the upcoming “Army Vessel Sale.”, GSA But divesting 18 of the larger LCU-2000s would mean cutting more than half of the Army’s current fleet of those landing craft. The plan, at least according to GSA’s ad, involves getting rid of all of the service’s tugs, too. Three tugs and one of the crane barges are already listed on the GSA Auctions website. These divestments would go well beyond simply shutting down watercraft units in the Army Reserve. There are only seven LCU-2000s and eight tugs in Reserve Component units. The rest of these watercraft are either in Active Component Army units or in prepositioned stockpiles around the world, meant to be in place and available on short notice specifically in case of unforeseen contingencies. An overview of the Army’s watercraft fleets as of November 2018. “AC” stands for “Active Component,” or regular Army units, while “RC” is for the “Reserve Component,” which includes Army Reserve and National Guard Units. APS stands for Army Prepositioned Stocks ., US Army Whatever the origins of the decision were and what the Army’s exact plans for its watercraft fleets are now, it seems clear that the service is rapidly moving to significantly scale back its maritime capabilities. It’s a decision that it could easily come to regret, especially as the U.S. military as a whole is supposed to be increasing its capabilities with a particular eye toward a potential conflict in the Pacific region . The “ tyranny of distance ” in the Pacific inherently means that Army units could easily find themselves scattered across a broad area thousands of miles from established logistics hubs. Organic watercraft able to move personnel, vehicles, equipment, and supplies around such a theater of operations without necessarily having to wait for support from the Navy or private contractors could be extremely valuable. They would also offer added capacity to move cargoes from larger ships ashore and within littoral areas, such as between islands within a chain. A US Army Logistics Support Vessel prepares to move tanks and other vehicles ashore after taking them on board from the larger USNS Pollux in the Port of Pusan in South Korea in 1998., DOD The watercraft can also provide more novel capabilities, including carrying artillery pieces and acting as mobile fire support platforms . The Army’s Navy would also be able to free up Navy ships for more demanding missions and provide added operational flexibility all around. The Army’s divestment plan also comes amid a recent spike in tensions between the United States and Iran . Army watercraft have long been forward deployed in the region for years to provide valuable support to operations in the Persian Gulf and other Middle Eastern littorals. Beyond that, Army ships and smaller boats continue to be important tools for responding to natural disasters at home and abroad . Army watercraft units are staffed with uniquely trained mariners who may need significant retraining before taking on other roles. Given the high number of Reservists impacted, it may simply be hard to retain those individuals at all if they lose the vehicles that are intrinsic to their specialized training. This lost knowledge base could make it particularly difficult to reconstitute these capabilities in the future. Unfortunately, with the former Kuroda and the other Army ships already up for sale, and GSA touting that there are dozens more to come, the service’s decision to severely downsize its watercraft capabilities may be one that is hard to reverse. For anyone in the market for any of these still very capable ships and smaller craft, now seems to be the time to start watching the government’s auction website. UPDATE: 7/12/2019— At some point after the publication of this story, the listing for USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda disappeared from the GSA Auctions website, despite the auction period have been listed as ending on July 31, 2019. A representative at the auction site’s help desk hotline told The War Zone that the entity who had made the item available for sale in the first place, the U.S. Army, in this case, would have been responsible for delisting the item, but had no further information. We have since reached out to the Army to inquire as to why they took down the listing for Kuroda , but have not yet heard back. In addition, the banner advertisement promoting the “Army Vessel Sale” was still up at the time of writing and one large tug, two small tugs, and the crane barge were still listed on the auction site.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 7, 2019",Turkey’s Newly Delivered S-400 Air Defense System Threatens To Shoot Down Relations With U.S. (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian government has delivered the first batch of vehicles and equipment related to the S-400 air defense system to Turkey, a move that has brought tensions between the Turkish and U.S. governments to a new level. The deliveries will very likely push the Pentagon’s decision to expel Turkey from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program beyond the point of no return and will almost certainly trigger additional U.S. sanctions . This, in turn, could prompt officials in Ankara to respond by blocking access to military facilities that American forces use in Turkey, including Incirlik Air Base , which also houses dozens of U.S. nuclear weapons . The Russian and Turkish Ministries of Defense both confirmed the arrival of S-400 system components at Murted Air Base outside the Turkish capital Ankara on July 12, 2019. Two An-124 Condor heavy cargo aircraft, along with an Il-76 Candid , brought various vehicles and other equipment, including road-mobile transporter-erector-launchers. Turkish media had previously identified Murted as one of two bases, the other so far remains unknown, which will host the new air defense systems. Turkish personnel have been training to use them in Russia since May 2019 . Video and pictures of personnel unloading the Russian aircraft do not appear to show that Turkey has received any of the radars or missiles for its S-400s yet, making the systems they do have far from function at this point. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has previously said that the Russian-made air defense systems will not become operational until October 2019 . Russia has, in the past, shipped missiles for S-400 systems to export customers via ship and that appears likely to be the case with Turkey. In 2018, a lot of advanced 40N6 missiles for China’s S-400s notably never made it tho their destination after the vessel carrying them hit a storm in the Baltic Sea. It remains unclear if those missiles were simply damaged beyond repair or if they physically fell off the ship. Turkish Defense Minister Akar’s comments notwithstanding, it remains to be seen when Turkey will declare their S-400s have reached a true operational capability. But the start of the deliveries of components for these air defense systems will, barring some significant change in U.S. government policy, make the Turkish government’s ouster from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program all but irreversible. For Turkey to change course now, the country would have to physically return the items it has received, as well as cancel the rest of the order it has already paid for, which would be extremely embarrassing to do. Trucks associated with the S-400 air defense system arrive at Turkey’s Murted Air Base on July 12, 2019., Turkish Ministry of National Defense The Pentagon had already repeatedly warned its Turkish counterparts that the only way to remain in the F-35 program was to cancel the S-400 deal. In June 2019, senior U.S. military officials publicly revealed their roadmap for cutting the Turkish government, as well as the country’s defense contractors , off from anything related to the Joint Strike Fighter. Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters on July 12, 2019, that the U.S. position remained unchanged and that he would call his Turkish counterpart to discuss the situation later in the day. Members of Congress have already made similar statements, as well. The U.S. and other countries that operate the stealthy fighters, or expect to in the future, fear that Turkey having those aircraft and the Russian-made air defense systems could expose sensitive details about their radar signatures and other capabilities. Turkey is also part of NATO and the alliance’s central authorities have warned that the S-400s will not be compatible with systems in use in other member countries, potentially making it difficult for allies to communicate and share information with Turkish air defenders during a crisis. The first F-35A for Turkey at a rollout ceremony in June 2018., Anadolu Agency But there is a very real possibility for a more serious chill in U.S.-Turkish relations, at least, as a result of the S-400 deliveries. Turkey’s deal with Russia looks almost certain to trigger sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA , though it remains uncertain how and when they might get implemented. Turkish President Recep Erdogan has made public statements suggesting he has received assurances from U.S. President Donald Trump that this will not happen, and Trump has offered his own comments in support of Erdogan, but it’s unclear how the Trump Administration could actually skirt the law. There is a powerful bipartisan contingent in Congress that fully supports sanctions and other measures against Turkey over the S-400 deal, as well as a host of other issues , including Turkey’s increasingly warm relationship with the Kremlin in general. The Turkish military has reportedly already begun hoarding spare parts for its F-16 fighter jets, as well as components for various other U.S. made military hardware, over fears that tensions could escalate further and result in even harsher sanctions or a full-on arms embargo. A Turkish Block 50 F-16 fighter jet., Turkish Armed Forces Publicly, Turkey, and Erdogan, in particular, has remained defiant over the issues. The decision to base at least some of the S-400s at Murted itself seems to be something of a statement to the Turkish government’s critics. The base, formerly known as Akinci Air Base, was one of those that supported an attempted coup against Erdogan in 2016 and forces loyal to the president bombed its runways to prevent rebel aircraft from taking off or landing. Afterward, Erdogan’s Administration changed the name, shuttered all the units there, and there were discussions of turning it into a park or national memorial . At the same time, a popular, but completely unfounded conspiracy theory , that Erdogan himself and his supporters have advanced at times, has emerged since then claiming that the U.S. military was actively involved in the abortive coup. In 2018, a group of pro-Erdogan lawyers demanded the arrest of various U.S. military officials and a raid on the U.S.-operated portion of Incirlik Air Base to search for evidence. Various U.S. military units call Incirlik home and it also houses some 50 American, B61 nuclear bombs . With all this in mind, tensions and new sanctions over the S-400 could lead to calls both within Turkey and the United States for U.S. military forces to leave Turkish bases. As of 2017, beyond Incirlik, the United States operates facilities at a half a dozen other Turkish bases, including a secretive radar facility at Kurecik, near the city of Malatya, also known as Site K . At the very least, it seems increasingly prudent to consider removing the B61s from the country. U.S. military-owned, leased, and otherwise operated facilities in Turkey as of September 2017 per the official annual Department of Defense Base Structure Report., DOD There are also reports that Turkish forces, along with their local partners in Syria, may be preparing for a new offensive in that country’s northeastern region. Such an operation would be targeted against Kurdish groups, including those that continue to enjoy support from the U.S. and other members of the coalition fighting ISIS in both Syria and Iraq. American support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, which has drawn primarily from the Kurdish People’s Protection Units , also known as the YPG, has been a major point of contention between Washington and Ankara for years. Turkish authorities view the YPG as terrorists who are a direct threat to their national interests, something the U.S. government disputes. Trump’s surprise announcement in 2018 that he was ordering all U.S. forces out of Syria, a process that is still ongoing and could lead to increased deployments of forces from other coalition partners to the area, emboldened Erdogan to make new pushes against the YPG. Erdogan has also threatened to attack American troops in the past if they got in the way of Turkey’s operations against the Kurds. All of this could also push Erdogan and the Turkish government closer to Russia’s sphere of influence. The Kremlin has already said they are in talks with Turkey about the latter country becoming involved in some way in the production of the S-500 air defense system . The Russians have also stated that they are willing to bring Turkey into the Su-57 advanced combat aircraft program if the country finds itself cut off from the F-35. With this in mind, while the S-400 deliveries have certainly underscored U.S.-Turkish tensions, the real showdown between the two countries, which could also have ramifications for Turkey’s other international relationships, including with NATO, looks to be still yet to come. UPDATE: 4:45pm EST— The Pentagon has “postponed indefinitely” an on-camera press briefing regarding the S-400 deliveries to Turkey that was scheduled to occur earlier on July 12, 2019. At the same time, the Turkish Ministry of National Defense has released the following readout of Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar’s call with U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper: National Defence Minister Hulusi Akar had a phone call with US Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. Turkey’s procurement of long-range regional air and missile defense systems as well as security issues concerning Syria were discussed during the phone call. Minister Akar told his US counterpart that Turkey remains under a serious air and missile threat and that purchase of S-400 defense systems was not an option but rather a necessity and Turkey was still assessing the bid to acquire US patriot air defense systems. Emphasizing that Turkey is a partner of the F-35 fighter aircraft program and that program should continue uninterrupted, Akar said that Turkey’s proposal was still on the table for setting up a joint working group – that could include NATO – to assess the possible interaction of F-35 aircraft and S-400 systems. Turkey has fulfilled all its obligations under the F-35 program and it remains committed to its position, Akar said. Minister Akar stressed that Turkey’s purchase of S-400 does not in any way mean change of its strategic orientation and reiterated that deterioration of bilateral relations would serve the interests of neither Turkey nor the US nor NATO. Akar emphasized that the only military force that is ready, competent and appropriate for the establishment of the safe zone in northern Syria was the Turkish Armed Forces.  He reiterated that for Turkey, protection of its borders and people was the priority and in the face of intensive attacks from the Syrian border Turkey would have to take necessary measures and would not allow terror groups seeking safe haven right across its borders. Minister Akar and Acting Secretary Esper agreed during the phone call that the communication lines should be maintained a US military team should urgently be dispatched to Ankara next week to further the discussions on the safe zone in Syria.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 19, 2019","Qatar To Get New AMRAAM-ER Surface To Air Missiles, U.S. Capital May Be Next","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Qatar is the first country to officially purchase the AMRAAM-ER surface-to-air missile that is designed to work with Raytheon and Norway’s Kongsberg Defense’s National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, better known as NASAMS. The purchase is part of a larger deal worth $2.2B that will also include components of the latest iteration of the MIM-104 Patriot air defense systems. NASAMS can be paired with Patriot as part of a larger, multi-layer, highly-integrated air defense system (IADS). A Raytheon press release reads as follows: Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) announced it was awarded two direct commercial sales contracts by the State of Qatar for additional integrated air and missile defense capability. The contracts, worth approximately $2.2 billion, include the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, final certification of the AMRAAM®-Extended Range missile, and an unspecified quantity of additional Patriot™ fire units. These awards are part of a larger agreement being pursued by the Qataris with the U.S. government. The combined value is expected to total up to $3B. “Raytheon’s integrated air and missile defense capabilities provide a combat-proven, layered approach that protects citizens, militaries and infrastructure from a broad spectrum of threats,” said Ralph Acaba, President of Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems. Qatar is the first country to procure AMRAAM-ER, the surface-to-air extended-range variant of the combat-proven AMRAAM air-to-air-missile. Qatar also becomes the 11th country to procure NASAMS, a medium-range air-defense solution manufactured by Raytheon and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace AS. NASAMS uses the Raytheon Sentinel radar, and fires multiple interceptors, including AMRAAM-ER. The combat-proven Patriot™ system is the backbone of air and missile defense for 16 nations. AMRAAM-ER leverages the forward warhead and guidance section of the AIM-120C7 air-to-air missile and the motor and control section from the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM). RIM-162 is a mainstay medium-range air defense missile for U.S. Navy destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and amphibious assault ships. It’s also widely deployed on surface combatants in service with NATO members and other U.S. allies. You can read all about ESSM and its new Block II capabilities in this past piece of ours. The primary missile used by NASAMS is the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile—a missile that was designed to be launched at altitude and with the benefit of the speed of its launching aircraft. It’s thought that the current AIM-120 equipped NASAMS has a range of around 20 miles and a maximum ceiling of about 50,000 feet. Leveraging the ESSM’s motor and control section—a system that was designed from scratch to be fired from the surface of the earth—reportedly boosted NASAMS’ engagement range about at 50 percent and increased its ceiling by 70 percent. Keep in mind that these figures are likely conservative if not deliberately discounted. In addition, the missile should have better energy management and a greater ability to take down low-flying, fast-flying, and hard maneuvering targets. It’s also worth noting, that as far as we know, the newest variant of the AIM-120, the AIM-120D , which features substantially more range than the AIM-120C7, has not been adapted for NASAMS use. AMRAAM-ER undergoing windtunnel testing. , Raytheon With the latest Patriot’s ability to swat down short-range ballistic missiles during their terminal stage of flight and traditional air-breathing threats over longer ranges, this enhanced version of NASAMS will complement Patriot nicely, acting as a second layer of defense in high-risk target areas. Qatar has a variety of short-range point defense systems to protect individual targets as a last line of defense. All of this is in addition to Qatar’s fighter aircraft fleet, which will soon include the world’s most advanced F-15 Eagles . Currently, NASAMS is used right here in the United States for the country’s most critical air defense mission. Most Americans don’t realize it, but this SAM system is the primary ground-based kinetic component of the integrated air defense system that protects the Capital Region, along with AN/TWQ-1 Avenger short-range air defense systems that are positioned in a few key locations. NASAMS launchers are located near very high-profile targets around the greater Washington, D.C. metro area, but their ranges overlap, creating a large coverage area that can put many types of aerial threats at risk. F-16C/Ds based at Andrews AFB and MH-65 Coast Guard helicopters based at Reagan International Airport make up the aerial component of the anti-air umbrella over the nation’s capital. You can read all about NASAMS’ role in protecting Washington, D.C. in this past feature of mine and about the Capital’s other defenses here. AMRAAM-ER undergoing a test firing from a NASAMS box launcher. , Kongsberg Upgrading to the AMRAAM-ER for the 10 countries that already use NASAMS is highly logical as this missile can make better use of the advanced and far-reaching sensor networks that are part of, or feed data to NASAMS. In addition, the existing launchers can readily accommodate the missile, as well as others, such as the AIM-9X Sidewinder . The somewhat limited range of the standard ground-launched AIM-120 wasn’t a huge plus for this system. Adapting an air-to-air missile for ground-to-air purposes never is ideal. With AMRAAM-ER available, NASAMS moves deeper into the medium-range air-defense class. With this in mind, sales to entirely new users are also now far more likely than in recent memory. For countries that operate the AIM-120 and the ESSM, which many U.S. allies do, there will probably be a minimal increase when it comes to secondary costs of introducing and sustaining a new missile like AMRAAM-ER. On a side note, it will be interesting to see if AMRAAM-ER gets evaluated for air-to-air adaptation. ESSM was not built to handle the rigors of flight and especially not on a hard-turning and fast-flying fighter aircraft, so it is unclear what it would take to make it capable of doing so. Still, this has been done on multiple occasions over the years. As an example, Israel is working to adapt its innovative Stunner missile for air-to-air use. Currently, the USAF and the Navy are rapidly pursuing multiple new long-range air-to-air solutions to eventually replace the AIM-120 as America’s go-to beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. If AMRAAM-ER offers such a substantial performance in its ground-launched form, it would be interesting to know what it could do if it was air-launched at high-altitude and transonic or even supersonic speed. It could be a somewhat off-the-shelf option for fighters that carry their missiles externally or for stealthy fighters while not operating in low-observable configuration. It could represent increased value for operations where those fighters would work as arsenal planes for stealth fighters with limited magazine depth that are operating deeper into enemy airspace. Now that NASAMS has a more powerful and far better-optimized missile, it will be interesting to see if it enjoys anywhere near the same success as the latest Patriot missile systems have as of late. But regardless of its export potential, there’s a very good chance that AMRAAM-ER will be tasked with protecting America’s seat of power in the not so distant future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 7, 2019",Pentagon Will Raid F-35 Spare Parts Budget To Help Pay For Kicking Turkey Out Of The Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon says it needs more than $200 million to help find new suppliers for various components for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter due to the “potential application of sanctions” on unspecified “foreign countries,” almost certainly a reference to Turkey . Last month, senior U.S. military officials outlined a roadmap for how they planned to kick Turkey out of the F-35 program, including ending the roles that numerous Turkish companies play in the construction of the stealthy jets, over the Turkish government’s purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system. But the plan is to shift those funds from an account set aside to buy spare parts for these aircraft, which has been a major contributor to the abysmal readiness rates for all three F-35 variants across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. Elaine McCusker, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), signed off on the request to move $206 million within certain parts of the U.S. Navy budget for the 2019 Fiscal Year on May 31, 2019. However, the Comptroller’s office only recently posted the document online . By law, the Pentagon has to submit requests to reallocate funding from one part of the budget to another to Congress for approval. “Funds are required in support of supply chain alternate sourcing for the F-35 program. The Department is already taking steps to establish alternate sources of F-35 components to protect from potential disruption of current sources,” the request explained. “These efforts target components manufactured in foreign countries where the U.S. is considering the potential application of sanctions, which would disrupt the F-35 supply chain.” DOD This aligns with comments the Pentagon made in June 2019 about what would happen if Turkey were to get ejected from the F-35 program over the S-400 deal. Turkish officials say the first deliveries of these Russian air defense systems could begin within days . On June 7, 2019, Ellen Lord, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions and Sustainment, said that there would be a “disciplined and graceful wind down” of all existing Turkish contracts related to the F-35 program by early 2020 . The United States and other F-35 operators have concerns that the Turkish military operating both Joint Strike Fighters and S-400s could expose sensitive details about the jet’s radar signature and other characteristics. Turkey’s purchase of the Russian air defense system could trigger other U.S. sanctions , as well. The first F-35A for Turkey at a rollout ceremony in June 2018., Anadolu Agency The reprogramming request interestingly only pumps additional funds into the accounts for the short takeoff and vertical landing-capable F-35B and the carrier-based F-35C. The Navy’s F-35B procurement account would receive an additional $108 million under this plan and the F-35C would get an infusion of $98 million. “This action is necessary to protect F-35 production schedules and supports Phases I and II of the Department of the Navy’s supply chain alternate sourcing requirement strategy,” the request said. “Phase I focuses on developing new sources for high-medium risk single source parts, while Phase II will focus on developing new sources for medium-low risk single source parts. The remaining efforts in Phase III ($155 million) will be further refined and funded during the execution year.” It’s unclear what steps the U.S. Air Force might be taking in relation to the F-35A. Turkish firms have been the only suppliers for some 400 different parts for the F-35, Undersecretary of Defense Lord had added last month . Notably, electronics firm AYESAŞ builds the panoramic cockpit displays that go into all three variants of the F-35. Also curious is what account the Pentagon is shifting these funds from . All $206 million is coming out of funding set aside for F-35 spare parts. DOD “Funds are available due to contract savings achieved during prior year F-35 spares contract negotiations,” the request said. “A portion of the FY 2019 F-35 spares requirement will now be funded using these prior year contract savings, resulting in the FY 2019 funds are available for realignment in support of higher priority requirements within the F-35 program.” This is particularly notable given the difficulties the Navy, as well as the Air Force and the Marine Corps, have had in improving dismal availability rates across their respective F-35 fleets. By the end of 2018, Marine Corps F-35Bs were fully mission capable, on average, less than 15 percent of the time, while the rate for Navy F-35Cs was under five percent. The exact reasons for these difficulties are multi-faceted and complex, something The War Zone has explored in detail previously, but the Pentagon’s central F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) has previously identified shortages of spare parts, as well as existing stockpiles including parts that are no longer usable, as the “ biggest factor impacting availability .” US Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force work together on a pair of US Air Force F-35As during a visit to Norway in June 2019., USAF Finding new suppliers to fill the gaps left by the expulsion of Turkey from the F-35 program is certainly an important priority. However, the purchase of spare parts seems equally important. Between May and November 2018, F-35s across the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy were unable to fly at all 30 percent of the time, on average, because of a lack of spares and difficulties in getting parts that were available where they needed to go, according to a report the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released in April 2019 . All told, with regards to the saga that is the F-35 program, an additional $206 million to offset the loss of Turkish suppliers is a relatively minor expenditure and would fit with the Pentagon’s previous public assessments that there would be minimal disruptions to the Joint Strike Fighter program if this occurred. At the same time, the Navy is already expecting to need an additional $155 million on top of that to handle additional offsets in relation to the F-35B and C and it’s unclear how much the Air Force might need with regards to the F-35A. Furthermore, while the Pentagon has clearly deemed these supply chain concerns to be more pressing than the acquisition of additional spare parts, it remains to be seen how that might impact F-35 readiness in the near-term. How the United States and other Joint Strike Fighter operators will manage the costs and complexities of operating, maintaining, and sustaining the stealthy jets remains a major question mark for the program as a whole going forward. What is clear is that the Pentagon is moving steadily along with its plans to completely cut the Turkish government, and that country’s defense contractors, out of the F-35 program for good.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We literally have no details to report, which is almost worth reporting in itself, beyond an alarming official tweet sent out by the Pantex nuclear weapons assembly plant located in Carson City, Texas. The tweet simply says “The Pantex Plant is experiencing an operational emergency. The Emergency Response Organization has been activated.” Yeah, not too reassuring is it? The facility is the primary location for nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly and works to ensure the reliability of the nation’s nuclear stockpile. Needless to say, security is very heavy at the site and the vehicles that come and go carrying nuclear warheads are uniquely hardened against attacks . Still, there have been incidents of concern at the facility which dates back to the dawn of the nuclear weapons age. The Pantex Plant is experiencing an operational emergency. The Emergency Response Organization has been activated. — Pantex Plant (@PantexPlant) October 23, 2018 We will continue to update this post as we find out more details regarding this as yet to be explained emergency situation. Update: 10:45am PDT— Not much to report, but this is what local outlets generally have at this time: “The Pantex Plant has activated its Emergency Response Organization to respond to an unexpected event at the plant. At this time, there appears to be no offsite impact and no need for the public to take any action. The Pantex onsite response effort is being conducted by the Emergency Response Organization, a highly-trained group of employees with detailed knowledge of plant operations and emergency response procedures. These employees represent plant functions such as security, logistics, safety, medical response, radiological assessment, firefighting, operations and public information. In addition, local Emergency Management agencies in Armstrong County, Carson County, Amarillo/Potter/Randall Office of Emergency Management, and DPS have been notified of the event and are taking appropriate actions. … Carson County Sheriff Department is reporting that FM 2373 is closed from I-40 north. Officials are also reporting the east side of the Pantex Plant is completely inaccessible.” We have no idea what this is. It could be something major or something smaller, such as a strange package or an access issue or an unaccounted for non-nuclear component, etc. Update: 10:56am PDT— Some good news to report here, Pantex says the security event has ended. Still no word on what exactly caused it in the first place. The security event at Pantex has ended without incident. Thanks to the Carson County Sheriff and @AmarilloPD for their quick response. — Pantex Plant (@PantexPlant) October 23, 2018 Update: 2:15pm PDT— Two separate sources have told us that today’s security scare was due to a suspicious vehicle parked near one of the facility’s buildings that a police bomb-sniffing K-9 unit got a hit on. In the end, the vehicle and its owner were cleared.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The decade-old Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) is centered on a relatively small cadre of special operators trained in a wide variety of tactics and specialties. But two things that any special operations soldier is likely to face on a modern battlefield is engaging or evading threats on the road, and the need to use their rifles and pistols with precision in that environment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Kalashnikov Hopes This Odd Looking Gun Will Become The AK-47 Of Pistols,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The late Mikhail Kalashnikov, the legendary engineer who designed the instantly recognizable AK-47, once quipped that he wished he’d made an equally popular lawnmower . Today, the company that now bears his name has stuck with guns and hopes its Lebedev PL-15 pistol will be as successful as the iconic assault rifle. Unfortunately, it has to contend with a shrinking Russian defense budget, political wrangling, international sanctions, and more first. In 2015, the Kalashnikov Concern, previously known as the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, or just Izhevsk, formally announced the Lebedev PL-14 at the annual Army International Military-Technical Forum in Moscow. The next year, the company unveiled the improved PL-15 version, though many sources continue to use the older nomenclature. “Trials are currently under way and we hope that they will be completed this year,” Kalashnikov’s CEO Alexei Krivoruchko told the Russian government-owned TASS news organization in March 2017. “We hope that the pistol will be sought after by the Defense Ministry and other uniformed and law enforcement agencies.” For troops and cops there might be a lot to like about the PL-15. Chambered for the ubiquitous 9x19mm round, the handgun has a nearly 5 inch barrel and is just over 8 inches long overall. Some versions have a slightly longer, threaded barrel that can accept a suppressor, an important feature for special operations forces. The gun is also unique in that its chamber can also accommodate cartridges with longer than average bullets. In its prototype form, the PL-15 weighs just shy of 1.8 pounds. Kalashnikov hopes to eventually reduce that figure by using a polymer frame instead of an aluminum one. In addition, the existing models have an accessory rail that can accept lasers, flashlights and other common accessories. The gun features ambidextrous controls, including an inset manual safety and a shrouded hammer. There is also a loaded chamber indicator and designers focused specifically on reliability and ease of maintenance. Kalasknikov Concern In addition, the Lebedev design is double-action only, meaning that the shooter cocks and releases the firing mechanism each time they pull the trigger. Though a long-standing debate continues, many engineers and experts feel double-action mechanisms are inherently safer if an individual wants to carry the weapon ready to fire with a round loaded in the chamber, and especially for those pistols without a manual safety. In a single-action arrangement, the hammer or striker would be poised to spring forward and fire the cartridge, which could happen accidentally if the shooter hit the trigger inadvertently. Usually single action firearms features a much lighter trigger pull as well. With double action pistols, there is also often a noticeably longer, heavier trigger pull, since the movement has to re-cock the action every time for safety purposes. This in turn can potentially throw off a shooter’s aim. Of course, training and experience could easily mitigate these issues and some firearms, such as the Glock, have near single action weight trigger pull (around 5.5 pounds), but function as if it were a double action pistol. Kalasknikov Concern The dimensions and features make the gun larger and heavier than the Cold War-era 9x18mm Makarov PM-series, but similar in size to the more recent Russian military designs , such as the 9x19mm MP-443 and OTs-27 . With a new frame made of rugged plastic, the Lebedev would probably have a similar weight to KBP’s polymer-framed GSh-18 . Kalashnikov also makes the PM and MP-443. The PL-15’s most distinctive feature is a grip that encourages the shooter to take a “high” grip on the gun. This gives the weapon the appearance of a competition pistol rather than a military handgun and offers a very low bore axis , which helps with managing felt recoil and speeds up the time it takes to get the pistol back on target. All this is entirely by design. As it crafted the pistol, Kalashnikov consulted with prominent Russian target shooters, as well as elite military and police personnel, according to TASS. “Before I shot it, I was a little concerned it [the configuration] would hurt the ergonomics,” Larry Vickers, a veteran of the U.S. Army’s Delta Force and a noted firearms instructor, explained in a video review in 2015. “Actually it doesn’t. You get very high on the gun, you can still turn and get to the magazine release very easily.” On the inside, Kalashnikov made sure the PL-15 could handle the Russian military’s standard 7N21 round, which is significantly more powerful than many commercial 9x19mm loads. On his website , Russian firearms expert Maxim Popenker says the gun’s estimated service life with this ammunition is at least 10,000 rounds and could be two or three times longer if the user stuck to more common cartridges. Also these estimates are usually far lower than reality, especially as the firearm design matures. “Overall, pretty slick gun, accurate, very controllable,” Vickers said after shooting one of the prototypes. Kalasknikov Concern Of course, even if these features prove appealing and the guns perform well in the unspecified trials Krivoruchko mentioned, there’s no guarantee the Russian military will adopt any version of the Lebedev. As in most countries, the new weapon will immediately have to overcome budgetary and political hurdles. Since 2014 , the drop in the global price of crude oil, a major Russian export, and international sanctions on the government in Moscow have led to a significant decline in the overall Russian economy. The United States and the European Union both imposed travel and trade bans in protest over the Kremlin’s activities in Ukraine and Syria. In October 2016 , reports began to appear suggesting the Kremlin might have to reduce defense spending by as much as 30 percent in the coming year. At least one expert suggested the actual cuts would amount to less than 10 percent , but this would still be significant. This isn’t the first time a Russian gun maker has tried to upend the country’s pistol market, either. In 2012, Russian firm Arsenal Firearms offered its own Strizh — meaning “swift bird” in Russian—as a potential replacement for military and police sidearms. Unnamed sources disputed whether mechanical troubles or politics scuttled those tests, according to Popenker. The company’s Italian subsidiary now makes a commercial variant called the Strike One for sale primarily in Europe and the United States, but it has achieved modest sales at best. If the PL-15 runs into resistance in Russia and Kalashnikov turns to the international market, the handgun would be competing with many established designs, including the Beretta Model 92 , FN FNP-9, and the Sig P320, which won the U.S. Army’s XM17 pistol competition in 2017. A version with plastic components would still be akin, at least in overall bulk, to the Heckler and Koch USP and internationally-recognized Glock 17 . Companies around the world offer dozens more 9x19mm pistols in various configurations. Many of these handguns also come in other calibers, including .45 ACP—exceptionally popular in the United States civilian market—and .40 Smith and Wesson, a common law enforcement choice. It is possible Kalashnikov could develop additional PL-15 variants to meet these demands. Sanctions might put U.S. customers completely off limits, too. Before American officials hit Moscow with trade and other restrictions in 2014, Kalashnikov had established a division in Florida and was expanding its business in the United States, even considering hiring action movie star Steven Seagal as a “ brand ambassador ” at one time. Afterwards, Kalashnikov USA severed ties with its Russian parent and went its own way. Newer members of Kalashnikov’s much better known assault rifle product line., Kalasknikov Concern Whether this now-independent company could license production of the PL-15 is unclear. Vickers only got his chance to shoot one during a visit to Russia. Still, in February 2017, Kalashnikov reportedly hired more than 1,500 new employees to meet increasing export demands . The company has major military clients around the world for its rifles and shotguns. Many of these deals are subsidized by the Russian government through low-interest or no-cost military aid grants to allies, such as Belarus and Venezuela . The bottom line is that Kalashnikov has an almost religious following around the globe, a fact which which could lead to high interest in the PL-15 as a companion to the rugged AK-47 and its many sub-variants. The worldwide success of the AK-47 family owes a great deal to the Soviet Union, sending hundreds of thousands of them to partners during the Cold War, too. It might take a similar push for if Kalashnikov wants its new handgun to be anywhere near as prolific.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 15, 2019",Nearly All F-15Es Photographed Arriving In Middle East Carried Dragon’s Eye Radar Pods,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. F-15E Strike Eagles from the 336th Fighter Squadron, the “Rocketeers,” of the 4th Fighter Wing based at Seymour Johnson AFB arrived at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE on the 14th of June, 2019. The contingent was part of the bolstering of U.S. forces in the region that began in May after still largely undisclosed intelligence warned of potential Iranian aggression throughout the region. We closely examined the official photos showing the arrival of the detachment of Strike Eagles at Al Dhafra Air Base and came away with a noteworthy observation—five out to the six aircraft photographed are carrying AN/ASQ-236 “Dragon’s Eye” Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar pods on their centerline stations. The pod is self-contained and carries a stabilized AESA radar that rotates around the pod’s center axis as well as geo-positioning and cooling systems. As such, it can work as a side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), taking high detailed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) maps of an area the Strike Eagle flies parallel too or even over, with near photo-like fidelity. In fact, it is supposedly so sensitive that it can detect roadside and semi-buried IEDs and possibly even groups of people on foot. It is also rumored to be able to generate ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) geolocation data on vehicles, such as trucks and armor, or vessels at sea. In this image, taken at Al Dhafra AB after the F-15E’s arrival, five out of the six F-15Es in the foreground can be seen carrying the pod., USAF It’s also worth noting that AESA arrays have a secondary ability to act as powerful electronic attack nodes. Considering the AN/ASQ-236 is quite mature, it is possible that they have acquired software that would allow them to work in this mode, even if only against a limited set of enemy emitter types. These functions and the jet’s multi-role fighter abilities and long-range not only give the F-15E crew the ability to collect very high-quality intelligence in less than friendly neighborhoods, but they can also rapidly acquire very precise targeting information that can be used to sling weapons, like GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs, at those targets. Above all else, they can do this in any weather and under any battlefield conditions. The radar is not affected by the time of day, smoke, or cloud cover. Because of its unique talents and two crew concept of operations, the F-15Es have become manhunters of sorts , able to take out high-value and highly mobile individuals in remote and hostile locales. Their ability to dash at supersonic speed also allows them to reposition and react to changing conditions far quicker than say a MQ-9 Reaper drone. The AN/ASQ-236 has been acknowledged officially since 2009, but it had been in limited testing for years before that. Still, we have never seen a single unit brandish so many at one time. From what we know, the pods remain something of a low-density, high-demand asset. In other words, they are not that plentiful, but they provide high-value capabilities that are often requested by combatant commanders. Other aircraft have been tested with the pod, including the F-16 , B-52, and AC-130 , but it hasn’t been officially adopted by any other platform as of yet. AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye pod being mounted on a B-52H for testing., USAF With even its basic confirmed set of capabilities, it really isn’t surprising that the F-15Es equipped with as many Dragon’s Eye pods as possible would have been ordered to the region. They provide combatant commanders with a powerful intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tool that could be deployed around known hotspots or even along the Iranian border. One could see how important the capability could be when monitoring activities in Iranian ports and near and within the volatile Strait of Hormuz. The fact that the F-15E can defend itself and abruptly prosecute ground and surface targets is an even bigger plus. Which begs the question, were the Rocketeers called back to the Middle East primarily for their Dragon’s Eye capabilities? If this is the case, it was a good call, as just days after their arrival, a defenseless RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) was shot down by the Iranians as it peered into Iranian territory from international airspace near the strait. Although it is unknown if it has been officially deemed operational, SBD II, better known by its nickname Stormbreaker, will feature a tri-mode seeker and network connectivity that will allow it to strike groups of moving targets at standoff ranges. This capability combined with the targeting information gathered by the Dragon’s Eye pod, as well as the F-15E’s ability carry 20 of these weapons—16 without the centerline station—at one time, as well as two fuel tanks and four air-to-air missiles, could make the Strike Eagle an absolutely devastating weapon for combating small boat swarms under literally any conditions, including dense fog. Once again, we are not aware that this weapon has been made operational at this time, but it was slated to be in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Still, it wouldn’t be unheard of for such a munition at the tail end of its development to see pre-operational use due to urgent operational demands. It will also be interesting to see what role the AN/ASQ-236 will continue to play once the F-15E gains its own AESA radar in the near future. The AN/APG-82 AESA radar set has already begun replacing the older mechanically scanned array AN/APG-70 in some Strike Eagle Squadrons. This is an incredibly powerful radar and is among the most capable in the world, if not the most capable. Certain capabilities may overlap with the AN/ASQ-236, but there could be new synergies to be leveraged between the two sensors that were not possible with the Strike Eagle’s older fire control radar. F-15E equipped with the AN/APG-82 AESA radar. , Official DOTE report Regardless, the Rocketeers brought Dragon’s Eye on their pop-up deployment to the Middle East in a very big way and these incredibly flexible multi-role fighter jets are likely providing key intelligence data on a continuous basis in that very troubled part of the world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 16, 2019",AC-130J Ghostrider Gunships Have Flown Their Very First Combat Missions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s new AC-130J Ghostriders have been flying combat missions in Afghanistan since June 2019. The gunships took over from AC-130U Spooky IIs that had been supporting U.S. and coalition special operations forces and their Afghan partners in that country. Those Spooky IIs have now returned to the United States, marking the last scheduled combat deployment ever for that version of the AC-130. Northwest Florida Daily News had been the first to report on June 28, 2019, that the AC-130J had flown its first-ever combat mission in Afghanistan. This detail had emerged during a change of command ceremony at Hurlburt Field in Florida, during which U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General James Slife took charge of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) from Lieutenant General Brad Webb. The Ghostrider’s first combat sortie had taken place “just days before,” according to the story . “We are pleased to announce the AC-130J has deployed in support of combat operations overseas,” U.S. Air Force Captain Keavy Rake, an AFSOC spokesperson, confirmed to The War Zone in an Email on July 10, 2019. “The first AC-130Js deployed in late June 2019 to relieve the AC-130Us, who arrived home to Hurlburt Field on 8 July 2019.” The Air Force declared that the AC-130J had reached initial operational capability in late 2017, with the 73rd Special Operation Squadron at Hurlburt Field becoming the first operational unit to fly the aircraft in 2018. The 73rd is the squadron presently flying the Ghostriders over Afghanistan. AC-130Js had previously taken part in a number of exercises in the United States and abroad . An AC-130J from the 73rd Special Operations Squadron flies over Papa Range in Estonia during an exercise in 2018., USAF We don’t know much about the 73rd’s initial deployment with the Ghostrider yet, but AFSOC’s AC-130s most often fly at night, supporting special operations forces on the ground, either providing direct close air support or armed overwatch during their operations. U.S. special operators remain heavily engaged in Afghanistan, against the Taliban and a variety of other terrorist and militant groups, including an ISIS-linked faction that first emerged in 2015. In the past, AC-130s have also conducted targeted strikes against specific individuals in support of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command’s task forces in the country. An AC-130U from the 4th Special Operations Squadron was also notably involved in the infamous mistaken strike against a Doctors Without Borders hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz in 2015. A subsequent investigation revealed a number of equipment failures and human errors that led to the tragedy. The 4th SOS is the last squadron to fly the U-model, including the ones that just returned home this week. It will continue to keep some of those aircraft available for unscheduled contingency deployments until its full complement of AC-130Js has arrived, according to Military.com . The squadron received its first Ghostrider in March 2019. The AC-130U has been working hard for more than 20 years, haunting the night skies above the enemy. Now it's time for the AC-130J Ghostrider to pick up where the Spooky left off. pic.twitter.com/y87lyXx5Nj — Hurlburt Field (@Hurlburt_Field) July 9, 2019 The last Ghostrider deliveries are scheduled to occur in 2021 and the Air Force plans to eventually have a fleet of 37 of the aircraft in total, which will replace all of the remaining AC-130Us and AC-130W Stinger II gunships. As of March 2019, AFSOC had already retired seven of the 10 remaining U models and three of the 12 W variants, according to Pentagon budget documents . The service already retired the last of the AC-130H Spectre gunships in 2016. The deployment of the AC-130Js and the end of scheduled combat operations for the AC-130Us very much marks a shift in AFSOC’s gunship operations, as well. The Spooky IIs, which entered service in 1995, are the last of the Air Force’s old school AC-130 gunships with a five-barrel 25mm GAU-12/U Gatling cannon, a single-barrel 40mm Bofors cannon, and a 105mm howitzer as their only armament. These aircraft were a direct evolution of the original Vietnam War-era AC-130s. By all indications, the AC-130Us are also the last platform of any kind in the U.S. military to use the 40mm Bofors gun, a World War II-era weapon, which proved to be a deadly aerial weapon, but also increasingly hard to operate and maintain. The Air Force had found itself scouring the world for spare parts in the early 2000s and rebuilding 40mm ammunition from the 1940s in recent years to keep the guns operational. A close up of the 40mm Bofors cannon, at left, and its 105mm howitzer, at right on an AC-130H Spectre gunship. The AC-130U has a similar configuration., Clemens Vasters via Wikimedia The AC-130J is a very different beast, though it does have the same 105mm howitzer as the AC-130U, as well as a smaller 30mm GAU-23/A Bushmaster cannon. But the Ghostrider, from the very beginning, was designed to also employ precision-guided munitions, including the AGM-114 Hellfire missile , the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), the GBU-44/B Viper Strike glide bomb, and the AGM-176 Griffin, which can function as a powered missile or as an unpowered glide bomb. The AC-130Ws, which are conversions of older C-130H cargo aircraft, have a virtually identical armament package. The Air Force had not even originally planned to install the 105mm howitzer on the AC-130J, or the AC-130W, but eventually changed course . AFSOC took delivery of the first Block 20 AC-130J with the howitzer in 2016 . There had also been concerns about the functionality of the Ghostrider’s 30mm GAU-23/A, but these issues have all since been resolved , according to the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. The precision-guided munitions capability has really added a new dimension to the gunship’s capabilities, giving it more stand-off reach and the ability to engage targets in multiple distinct areas simultaneously, something you can read about in more detail here . The addition of new weapons in the future, including the GBU-53/B Stormbreaker, previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb II , and the GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition , both of which have multi-mode guidance systems, will only increase the AC-130J’s flexibility. With its 30mm and 105mm weapons, the Ghostriders can also still provide the same kind of extremely precise direct fire support as their predecessors. The AC-130Js are also packed with a variety of updated sensors, data links, communications systems, and more, and the Air Force is already in the process of further updating those systems. The latest Block 30 Ghostriders, which the 4th Special Operations Squadron began receiving in March , feature a number of improvements over the Block 20 aircraft that the 73rd Special Operations Squadron is flying in Afghanistan now. This includes upgraded sensor turrets with higher fidelity electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras and a new, large broadband satellite communications “hump” on top of the forward fuselage. Members of the 4th Special Operations Squadron offer a tour of the unit’s first Block 30 AC-130J., USAF The Air Force is looking to improve the survivability of all of its remaining gunships against newly emerging threats, such as GPS jamming, too. In 2018, U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, then head of U.S. Special Operations Command, said that unspecified opponents – most likely Russian or Russian-backed forces – were using electronic warfare attacks against gunships operating over Syria. Entirely new capabilities might find their way onto the Ghostriders as time goes on, too. AFSOC is planning to demonstrate a high-energy laser weapon on one of its AC-130Js in 2022 . But with no more AC-130U deployments on the schedule and AC-130Js now flying combat missions, the Air Force has already entered a new era of gunship operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2019",One Company Is Putting A New Spin On How To Yank Downed Pilots Out Of Enemy Territory,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. defense contractor is pitching a novel way to extract downed pilots who might find themselves deep within hostile territory or stranded in otherwise inaccessible terrain whereby another plane throws them a line that simply yanks them off the ground and tows them to safety. The proposal is, in many ways, a spiritual successor to similar systems that emerged during the Cold War, but could offer significant advantages in reliability and safety, as well as being something that virtually any aircraft could employ with limited modifications. This new development also comes as the U.S. Air Force, in particular, is increasingly concerned about how to rescue the crew of aircraft that get shot down in heavily defended territory that will only be increasingly off-limits to conventional combat search and rescue platforms. Modern Technology Solutions, Inc. (MTSI), an engineering firm that already has a number of contracts across the U.S. military, first announced what it is calling the Rapid Aerial Extraction System (RAES) back on June 5, 2019. The company is already at work on the project as a private venture and conducted an initial demonstration of the concept in February 2019, according to Aviation Week . This test involved a light plane recovering a dummy. “RAES gives you the speed, range, and economy of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vertical lift hoist-like capability of rotorcraft,” Ben Bosma, MTSI’s Principal Engineer, said in a press release . “The system is scalable and can be mounted on a wide variety of aircraft from fighters to transports.” The system itself consists of just a stabilizer, winch, and tether package, according to MTSI’s website. There are no special modifications required to install these components on any aircraft and a computer-generated video presentation, seen below, shows an A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft deploying the RAES via a podded arrangement that it carries like any other store. How it works is relatively simple. The plane deploys the stabilizer which then begins to fall to earth unwinding the tether line – which MTSI says is “stronger than steel” – from the winch as it goes. A drogue chute deploys right before the stabilizer hits the ground. Above, the aircraft that launched it performs a series of maneuvers to create a spiraling loop in the line with a radius of approximately 2,400 feet. Down below, the downed pilot straps themselves onto the stabilizer, which also includes a new parachute. They then signal the plane orbiting above, which then flies away with the individual in tow. Screen captures MTSI released from a video taken from its demonstration of a Rapid Aerial Extraction System prototype in February 2019., MTSI This is, in many ways, is similar to how the Air Force’s now-retired Fulton Recovery System , also known as Skyhook, worked. That system involved a specially modified plane dropping a canister to a downed pilot, after which that individual would inflate a balloon with helium that would carry aloft a tether line. The plane would use a v-shaped hook mounted on the nose to catch this line. The aircraft’s crew would then use a separate set of equipment to reel in the recovered individual and get them onboard. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) was the last to employ the Fulton on modified MC-130E Combat Talon special operations transports. AFSOC officially retired the system in 1996. However, MTSI says that RAES will exert much less force on the individual at the end of the tether than Fulton, making it much safer all around. In its February 2019 demonstration, the vertical force exerted on the package at the end of the line was less than two Gs. This new system also won’t require a modified cargo aircraft to deploy it. The RAES operating concept actually owes more to a technique that Nate Saint , a Christian missionary pilot, devised in the 1950s to drop items to isolated native tribes in South America. Saint would drop packages at the end of a line and then enter a circular orbit creating a spiral that would both slow and stabilize the payload, causing it to fall both accurately and gently. MTSI’s recovery concept just puts all this in reverse. If RAES proves to be feasible, it could also potentially have applications beyond combat search and rescue (CSAR), just like Fulton. U.S. military aircraft might be able to use it to recover covert agents or small numbers of special operations forces, as well as other small payloads, from denied areas. Since it uses Saint’s basic principles, there is also the possibility that MTSI might be able to develop a version that can insert personnel or cargo, too. “The recent RAES demonstration points to a cost-effective and highly adaptable solution to combat search and rescue in the contested domain,” Mike Hostage, a retired U.S. Air Force General who last served as head of Air Combat Command and was a known critic of buying new traditional CSAR helicopters , said in MTSI’s press release. “The concept may also offer a rapid and covert means of precision insertion and extraction for special operations.” A US Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter, which is the service’s primary CSAR platform today., USAF Of course, this new personnel recovery system wouldn’t necessarily be a perfect solution that would work in all cases. The most obvious issue is if the downed pilot was too injured to make it to where the stabilizer landed and strap themselves in. Another issue is that if the area where a downed pilot is awaiting extraction is too heavily defended for traditional CSAR platforms, it may be equally dangerous for any aircraft carrying the RAES externally. Having to hold a relatively stationary orbit while the stabilizer falls to the ground and then have to keep doing so as the individual below straps in could be a risky proposition. It is possible that stealthy aircraft could carry RAES internally, as they do with towed decoys , but any package that includes a spare parachute will be much larger than those countermeasures systems. A future stealthy transport aircraft might be another option to deploy such a system in particularly high-risk scenarios. A US Air Force graphical “Operational View,” or OV, describing how a stealthy transport plane might fit into broader concepts of operation, including inserting and extracting special operations forces conducting clandestine missions from behind enemy lines. RAES could potentially help support these types of secretive activities., USAF via FOIA The radar signature of any aircraft towing a person behind is likely to be significantly increased compared to one flying in full-stealth mode, too. It’s not clear just how fast any plane will be able to safely pull the exposed individual along as they egress the area, either. But MTSI already envisions RAES as part of a larger CSAR ecosystem. After the plane towing the downed pilot reaches a safer area, the individual trailing behind is supposed to release their harness and parachute down to the ground, where more traditional platforms, such as HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters or CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, would recover them as they would normally. Beyond that, it’s clear that the Air Force, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, is increasingly aware that traditional CSAR platforms are unlikely to be able to perform all of their missions in future large-scale conflicts where stealthy planes are flying deep into denied areas that the service has already deemed too risky for non-stealthy aircraft. Potential high-end opponents, such as Russia and China , are only continuing to develop more capable integrated air defense networks. In May 2019, the Air Force Research Laboratory issued its own call for proposals for a potential autonomous “ air taxi ” type recovery system that a cargo plane could drop to downed pilots and that would then fly them to safety. At the same time, the service remains fully committed to begin fielding its new HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter , a very traditional platform, next year. All told, it will be very interesting to see how the development of the RAES progresses and how such a system might fit within new, over-arching CSAR operating concepts that the Air Force, and other services, will have to implement in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A joint Russian-Norwegian team of researchers has taken new seawater samples from around the wreck of the sunken Soviet Project 685 nuclear-powered submarine K-278 Komsomolets , one of which was 100,000 times more radioactive than uncontaminated water. The findings raise concerns that the boat is now actively leaking radiation, either from its reactor or a pair of nuclear-armed torpedoes, after sitting at the bottom of the Barents Sea for more than three decades. This news comes nearly two weeks after a top-secret Russian nuclear submarine suffered a fire that killed 14 sailors, though the Kremlin says this incident did not result in any radiation leaks and that it was able to safely recover the vessel. News of the test results first broke in Norwegian media on July 8, 2019 . The research team aboard the Norwegian research ship G.O. Sars , which Norway’s Institute of Marine Research and the country’s University of Bergen operate jointly, had employed the Norwegian-designed Ægir 6000 deep-diving remotely operated submersible to inspect Komsomolets and take the water samples from a ventilation pipe. The sub is resting at a very deep depth of more 5,500 feet below the surface approximately 100 nautical miles southwest of Norway’s Bear Island in the Barents Sea. Two samples came back perfectly normal before researchers got the one that produced the extremely elevated radiation reading, according to Norway’s public broadcaster NRK . The team has made clear that their findings are only preliminary, as well, and will need further analysis. Ægir 6000 was also able to get some eerie video footage, seen below, of the submarine sitting at the bottom of the ocean. “It is important that the monitoring of the nuclear submarine continues, so that we have updated knowledge about the pollution situation in the area around the wreck,” Hilde Elise Heldal, a researcher from the Institute of Marine Research, said in a press release . “The monitoring helps to ensure consumer confidence in the Norwegian fishing industry.” Komsomolets was the only Project 685 submarine the Soviet Union ever built, getting commissioned into the Soviet Navy in December 1983. Also known as the Plavnik -class to the Soviets and as the Mike -class to NATO, the boat, which featured a titanium inner pressure hull and displaced 8,000 tons submerged, was intended more as a developmental design, but was still fully combat-capable with six 533mm torpedo tubes. The boat was capable of firing conventional torpedoes or the RPK-2 Vyuga , also known as the SS-N-15 Starfish, an unusual anti-submarine missile system you can read about more detail in another piece at The War Zone here . Western intelligence believed initially that a pair reactors using liquid-metal lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) coolant powered Komsomolets , giving it extremely high speed, though this later proved to be incorrect. Liquid metal-cooled reactors can run at much higher temperatures before there is a risk of the coolant boiling off. LBE also won’t react spontaneously with water or air, unlike sodium or sodium-potassium coolants, making it much safer. However, it also highly corrosive and LBE reactors need to be kept consistently at relatively high temperatures or there is a danger that the coolant will solidify. Komsomolets running on the surface in 1986., DOD The Soviets had also considered using LBE reactors for the ultra-fast Project 661 submarine , another one-off design also known as “the Golden Fish,” but eventually chose to use two VM-5 pressure water reactors instead. Komsomolets used a single OK-650b-3 pressure water reactor. LBE reactors were a feature on the Afla -class attack submarines . K-278’s actual claim to fame was its deep-diving capabilities. On Aug. 4, 1984, Komsomolets reached a then-record depth of 3,350 feet. There are also reports that the design incorporated a number of advanced, automated features that allowed a relatively small crew to operate the submarine. After years of tests and evaluations, Komsomolets was on her first operational patrol when disaster struck in the Barents Sea on April 7, 1989. A short circuit in the engine room caused a fire that spread quickly and eventually caused the reactor to scram . The submarine, which was submerged at the time, was able to make an emergency ascent and most of the crew were able to get off. Four crew members still died as a result of the fire. Unfortunately, Soviet authorities were slow to respond to the incident and another 34 members of the 64-man crew subsequently died of hypothermia after prolonged exposure to the elements in the frigid Arctic waters. Komsomolets burned for hours before finally sinking. She has remained at the bottom of the Barents Sea ever since. Her reactor was not the only radioactive payload on board, as she was also carrying two torpedoes with nuclear warheads. Heldal, the researcher from the Institute of Marine Research, said she wasn’t surprised by the sample showing a potential radiation leak, according to NRK . There have been numerous expeditions to investigate the wreck since the accident that have detected elevated levels of radiation around the boat, though there has never been any confirmation of an actual leak. But a Russian survey in 1992 found cracks along the entire length of the hull and its hard to believe that the submarine has not continued to degrade in the decades that followed the sinking. On various occasions between 1993 and 1994 , Russian officials warned that as time went on the risks of radiation leakage would only increase and called for routine monitoring of the wreckage. Russia conducted further expeditions in 1994 and 1995 to better seal in the nuclear torpedos as they had been damaged in the accident and were jammed in place, too dangerous to remove. The new video footage from Ægir 6000 still shows extensive damage to the submarine’s hull. A screen capture from the video that the Russian-Norwegian research team took of Komsomolets using Ægir 6000 showing the poor state of a portion of just one portion of the boat’s hull . , Institute of Marine Research capture Still, experts have cautioned that the danger from any radioactive leaks the boat may have is likely to be minimal given how deep the wreck is and the limited amount of sea life there, to begin with. Heldal said she was confident that it is still safe for Norwegian fisherman to continue working in the area. Still, “the new surveys are important for understanding the pollution risk posed by Komsomolets,” Ingar Amundsen, Head of the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority explained to NRK . The new survey has also taken on a new dimension given that Russia recently suffered a new submarine accident, which also involved a fire caused by an electrical fault on board a nuclear-powered boat. The sub in question is widely reported to be the top-secret deep-diving spy submarine Losharik and the incident, which occurred on July 1, 2019, killed 14 sailors. Russia says it was able to safely recover the submarine this time and that there was no radiation leak from this new accident, though details about the exact scope of the damage remain murky. “They all shared one and the same fate – to save the lives of their comrades, to save their vessel and to prevent a catastrophe of global proportions at the cost of their own lives,” Sergei Pavlov, an aide to the Russian Navy’s top commander, reportedly said at a funeral on July 6, 2019, according to Russian media outlet Fontanka . This may imply that the situation on board was more precarious than Kremlin has acknowledged. Losharik is already shrouded in secrecy, so we may never know for sure what happened exactly and it may be hard to tell when and if the Russians return her to operational service. But she does appear to have escaped a fate similar to Komsomolets , wasting away at the bottom of the sea. UPDATE: 7/10/2019— Norway’s Institute of Marine Research has released an updated figure about the radioactivity of one of the seawater samples taken from the Komsomolets wreck, now saying that it is 800,000 times more radioactive than uncontaminated water, according to The Barents Observer . The research team’s assessments about the risks that the wreck poses to commercial fishing in the region and to sea life in the area, in general, remain unchanged. “What we have measured has very little impact on Norwegian fish and seafood,” Hilde Elise Heldal, one of the researchers from the Institute of Marine Research, said . “Levels [of radioactivity] in the Norwegian Sea are in general very low, and the pollution from Komsomolets is quickly diluted to harmless levels because the wreck is at such deep water.” Still, “good documentation of the levels in both seawater, sediments, and not least in fish and seafood is needed,” she added. “We will, therefore, continue checking both Komsomolets especially and Norwegian waters in general.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Nuclear Nuclear Power Sea Submarines"
Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 16, 2019",New Details On Russian Submarine Fire Emerge Along With An Intriguing Schematic (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Krasnaya Zvezda , the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, has included a heretofore unseen drawing of the Project 09852 Belgorod , a heavily modified Oscar II -class submarine outfitted for various “special projects” missions , in its latest report about a fire that killed 14 sailors onboard a still-unnamed Russian submarine on Monday. Russia officially launched the still-under-construction Belgorod , which is presently the world’s longest submarine, in April 2019 . At the same time, new details regarding the July 1st accident have begun to trickle out, although they are limited in number and some are unconfirmed in nature. Though Belgorod is more widely associated with the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed long-range torpedo, this special mission boat will also be capable of serving as a mothership for smaller, highly specialized, and deep-diving submarines, such as the Project 10831 Losharik . Independent Russian media outlets have widely reported that Losharik , also known by the hull number AS-12 and more recently AS-31, was the submarine that experienced the deadly blaze on July 1, 2019. You can find more details about Losharik and what is known so far about this accident in The War Zone ‘s earlier extensive coverage of the incident here . Krasnaya Zvezda , also known as the Central Organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense, attached the rendering of Belgorod , sometimes referred to by its hull number K-329, to a new story about the submarine fire on July 3, 2019. The drawing shows the boat carrying a smaller submarine underneath. There is no caption for the illustration and the story does not otherwise mention Belgorod , but the shape of the sail and other features make it clear that this is K-329. The drawing of Belgorod carrying a midget submarine underneath its hull that appeared in a Krasnaya Zvezda story on July 3, 2019., Krasnaya Zvezda This appears to be one of, if not the first official release of a depiction of Belgorod in its final special mission configuration. In 2015, a similar image had emerged on Russian state television, which also revealed the existence of the Poseidon torpedo, then known as Kanyon or Status-6 . This “leak” did appear to be deliberately contrived , but was not a formal release. A screenshot from a 2015 Russian television broadcast that revealed the existence of the Poseidon torpedo. A depiction of Belgorod carrying a midget submarine underneath, very similar to the one that has now appeared in Krasnaya Zvezda , is also visible at the top left., Channel One Russia capture We have no way of knowing whether this means that the Belgorod was in some way involved in the incident. There are no reports that this submarine has put to sea for any period of time for any reason since April 2019 , though details about the boat and the progress of its construction are extremely limited. The Kremlin officially plans to commission it sometime in 2020. A picture of Belgorod from the launching ceremony in April 2019., TASS Some earlier reports from Russian media outlets, citing unnamed individuals, had suggested that one of the Russian Navy’s other submarine motherships was involved some way in the incident on Monday. Those stories specifically named the modified Project 667BDRM Delfin -class ballistic missile submarine BS-64 Podmoskovye and the Project 09786 BS-136 Orenburg , a converted Project 667BDR Delta III -class ballistic missile submarine, both of which are understood to be special mission boats capable of performing this role. Local fishermen reported seeing Podmoskovye surface in the Barents Sea near the town of Kildin around the time of the reported fire. The rapid surfacing was quickly followed by a lot of commotion on the large mothership submarine’s deck. Soon after, two tugs and a warship met it and escorted it into the Kola Bay. Russian newspaper Kommersant , citing anonymous sources, also said that Losharik had been ascending from the seabed in order to dock with Podmoskovye in a Northern Fleet training ground to the west of Kola Bay when the fire broke out. On July 3, 2019, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had visited Severomorsk, which is in the Kola Bay, where the still-unnamed damaged submarine is reportedly now pier-side. The day before, Russian President Vladimir Putin had met with Shoigu and ordered him to personally go to the base, which is home to the headquarters of the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet, to meet with officials and get briefed about the accident. A separate, unconfirmed report said that the Russian Navy had actually towed the damaged submarine to Gadzhiyevo , which is situated to the north of Severomorsk. “It [the submarine] belongs to the highest level of classified data, so it is absolutely normal for it [the name] not to be disclosed,” Putin’s personal spokesperson Dmitri Peskov said on July 3, 2019 , all but confirming that the submarine in question is one of Russia’s shadowy special mission boats. The Russian President himself had previously described the sub as an “ unusual vessel .” Speaking at an open meeting with officials in Severomorsk, Shoigu also described the submariners who died in the fire as “ high professionals ” and “unique experts.” The highly specialized Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, a naval intelligence entity also known by the Russian acronym GUGI , operates the Russian Navy’s fleet of special mission submarines, including Loshari k and Belgorod . Previous reports had already identified seven of the 14 sailors who died as Captains of the First Rank, equivalent to U.S. Navy captains, including two who were Heroes of the Russian Federation , the country’s highest honorary title. In addition, the Russian Defense Minister disclosed that a civilian expert from the country’s state-run defense industrial complex had been on the submarine at the time of the accident. This might point to Losharik being involved in a test of new equipment during the mishap. “The submariners acted heroically in the critical situation,” Shoigu said . “They evacuated a civilian expert from the compartment that was engulfed by fire and shut the door to prevent the fire from spreading further and fought for the ship’s survival until the end.” A reported picture of Losharik running on the surface., via Top Gear Russia The few details we have seem to point to a possible scenario where Losharik was attached to its mothership when the fire broke out or its crew got the sub back to its mothership just before the fire overwhelmed them, with the civilian being saved before sealing-off a compartment—or possibly the entire submarine—to protect Losharik and maybe even the larger submarine it was attached to from being completely lost. It’s also possible that eye witness accounts are inaccurate and that Losharik was operating independently and was able to make it to the surface intact. Whatever the situation was, the official narrative from the highest levels of the Russian military is that the highly-trained crew on the small, but extremely valuable submarine heroically died saving at least one civilian onboard. The exact cause of the accident, or the scope of the damage, remains unclear, as well. Unconfirmed reports have said that a short circuit or battery malfunction may have sparked the blaze. The Russian Ministry of Defense has denied separate reports that there had been an unspecified “gas explosion” onboard the submarine. The Kremlin has also said there was no release of dangerous radiation as a result of the incident. Losharik , as well as the various submarine motherships, are all nuclear powered. “It’s too early to say what caused the fire and whether or not it was human or mechanical error,” Jeffrey Edmonds, a researcher Center for Naval Analyses think tank in Washington, D.C. and a former U.S. National Security Council staffer, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on July 2, 2019 . “The Losharik incident will likely have a deep operational impact on the Directorate for Deep Sea Research, given how advanced and relatively few these submarines are.” Given the sensitivities surrounding the submarines that appear to have been involved in or otherwise present at the time of the accident, it remains to be seen when and if the Russian government will release any new details about the incident. Defense Minister Shoigu has ordered the Russian Navy to work together with the country’s defense industry to repair the submarine and get it back into service. Some independent media commentators in Russia have begun to accuse the Kremlin of covering up the severity of the situation, but it is impossible to tell whether or not this is the case. What we do know for sure is that the fire struck one of Russia’s most important submarines, focusing new and significant attention on GUGI’s secretive activities in the process. UPDATE: 6:50pm EST— Pictures have emerged that reportedly show Podmoskovye , the submarine mothership that may have been involved in the July 1 accident, docked in Severomorsk after the incident. The pictures show a green tarp over the boat’s dorsal payload cradle , but do not appear to show any damage to the submarine, at least to the parts that are visible above the waterline. UPDATE: 7/4/2019— The Kremlin has released an English translation of a second meeting that Defense Minister Shoigu had with Putin following his visit to Severomorsk, which includes a number of significant new details. Shoigu said that the submarine was nuclear-powered one, that the fire broke out in the battery compartment, and that the boat’s nuclear reactor was undamaged in the incident. He assured Putin that it would be possible to repair the sub and return it to service “quickly.” The complete exchange was as follows: President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr. Shoigu, how is the work progressing in Severomorsk? Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr. President, we have made the necessary arrangements and established a headquarters, which is working very actively. We are using the services of the submarine designers and industry representatives to assess the volume and timeframe of repairs. Our first conclusion is that the submarine can be repaired. Moreover, this must be done, in this particular case. We are now assessing the timeframe. We have pinpointed the main reason for the tragedy: a fire in the battery flat that spread out. Vladimir Putin: What about the nuclear power unit? Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, the nuclear power unit has been sealed off and all personnel have been removed. Plus, the crew has taken the necessary measures to save the unit, which is in working order. This means we can repair the submersible quickly. Vladimir Putin: Completely? Sergei Shoigu: Yes, completely. Next, we have a group working with the submariners’ families. We are working with each family separately. As per your instructions, we will provide the necessary assistance in accordance with our laws and regulations and, on the other hand, because it is our duty to the deceased sailors. Assistance measures include good education for those children who are still studying and a decent standard of living for everyone, just as we did following similar bitter tragedies. The families with minor children will receive their deceased husbands’ salaries until the children come of age. Vladimir Putin: Mr. Shoigu, please submit your proposals on awarding state decorations to the crew. Sergei Shoigu: Will do.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",Here’s What You Should Know About China’s New African Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a truism that if a country’s military, no matter how big, cannot operate for a protracted period beyond its own boundaries, then it is little more than a territorial defense force. Since the end of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China and its People’s Liberation Army have been hard at work to shake this perception of their capabilities and expand their presence around the world.  Now, Chinese troops are on their way to the Horn of Africa to staff the country’s first permanent overseas base, which opens the door for deployments well beyond the continent. On July 12, 2017, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported that the first group of personnel and equipment was headed to the country’a new “support base” in the small East African country of Djibouti. China first announced the plan in 2015 and began building the facilities , situated in the capital Djibouti City, the following year. “The support base will better serve Chinese troops when they escort ships in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off the Somali coast, perform humanitarian rescue, and carry out other international obligations,” Xinhua explained , citing statements by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang. “Moreover, the base will be conducive to driving Djibouti’s economic and social development, and assist China’s contribution to peace and stability both in Africa and worldwide.” Though it can undoubtedly fulfill these functions, on closer inspection the site looks in line with a larger trend on the part of the PLA to take a more active role internationally. The base provides Chinese Forces a key stepping stone for persistent and independent access to the Middle East, Europe, and beyond, regardless of their mission. The Donghaidao , a semi-submersible logistics ship helping transport Chinese forces to their new base to Djibouti., Xinhua What is China’s plan? The Chinese have been particularly sensitive about the new base and the contingent it would house, offering few specific details about the composition of either. In official remarks , neither Geng nor Vice Admiral Shen Jinlong, head of the PLA Navy (PLAN), provided any additional information. However, previous reports suggest that there will ultimately be approximately 1,000 Chinese military personnel in Djibouti. Officially, the job of this contingent is “ logistics support ” for PLAN forces in the region. Chinese ships have deployed to the Gulf of Aden since 2008 to help protect commercial shipping against piracy and other dangers. Though its forces have not part of any of the other multi-national counter-piracy task forces in the region, China has conducted this mission unilaterally under the broad mandate of a number of U.N. Security Council resolutions . https://youtube.com/watch?v=NGZ_772ABr4 “The support facility will be mainly used to provide rest and rehabilitation for the Chinese troops taking part in escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia, U.N. peacekeeping and humanitarian rescue,” the Chinese Defense Ministry told The New York Times in a written statement as recently as February 2017. But the choice of the word “mainly” may be a key caveat. Fox News obtained unclassified satellite imagery from earlier in July 2017 that showed extensive construction at the base still underway. Most notably, there appear to be new aviation facilities that could ultimately support helicopters or unmanned aircraft. There are at least seven structures that look like hangars, connected by a 1,300 apron for planes to park, refuel, and rearm. In addition, there is another, central building that could serve as a control tower and command center. The work is unfinished in the July 4, 2017 images and there are no aircraft present. However, the site looks large enough to accommodate China’s Wing Loong or Wing Loong II drones, which can carry both weapons and sensors and are roughly equivalent to the U.S. military’s MQ-1 Predator .  With a reported range of over 2,400 miles, these pilotless planes would be able to fly armed surveillance missions throughout the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and even further out into the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean from the base. It would also allow over-land operations in East Africa, including South Sudan, where Chinese troops are part of a U.N.-backed international peacekeeping mission. From the base, helicopters could also ferry troops and supplies – and casualties and evacuees – back and forth from nearby ships. The base’s potential to support broader expeditionary operations was on full display during the ceremony marking the departure of the first PLA contingent headed for Djibouti. Official pictures showed a two ship flotilla consisting of the Jingangshan , a Type 071 landing platform dock, and Donghaidao . This second ship, which the PLAN only commissioned in 2015, is semi-submersible logistics vessel displacing approximately 20,000 tons when fully loaded and is similar in concept to the U.S. Navy’s much larger Mobile Landing Platforms . With this unusual looking design, these types of ships can carry over-sized cargo or act as floating sea bases in support of amphibious and other operations. In the past, the Chinese have showed off the ship, which first deployed in support of the country’s expanding presence in the South China Sea, acting as a mothership for a Zubr -class air-cushion landing craft. The ship is just one component of a larger expansion of the PLAN’s blue water capabilities, which notably includes work on multiple aircraft carriers and advanced surface warships that will be at the core of future carrier battle groups, as well as be able to perform independent operations. AP What do the Chinese really want? There is nothing to suggest that China’s ostensible reasons for wanting a permanent base in Djibouti aren’t true. Since the 1990s, Chinese military and police forces have become key components of the U.N.’s peacekeeping structure. As of 2015, the country had committed approximately 8,000 personnel to the international organization’s standby reserve , making up a fifth of the total force. The majority of these activities are in Africa. On top of that, China is an active support of the African Union’s own peacekeeping missions, having pledging at least a $100 million to help maintain its own rapid response elements. By December 2016, in addition to the deployment in South Sudan the country had troops with other U.N. missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Mali, and Sudan’s contested Darfur region. Other personnel had joined the U.N. contingent in Lebanon. The government in Beijing had become the largest contributor to these operations, on average, among the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. This makes perfect sense, since China has similarly increased economic ties across Africa, particularly in regards to resource extraction industries. Chinese workers dot the continent and China outright paid for the entire $200 million construction of the African Union’s new headquarters in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa, which has been called “ China’s gift to Africa .” Its powerful soft-power diplomacy that has helped ingratiate the country with regimes across the continent, though not always the local populace. Djibouti’s President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh meets with then Chinese premier Hu Jintao in Beijing in 2012., AP Though the United States is often accused of propping up African dictators, the totalitarian government in Beijing has far less interest in even broaching sensitive topics such as human rights abuses, with a long-standing official policy of not “meddling” in other countries’ affairs and demanding the same of others. This makes them a particularly attractive partner for repressive leaders. These include regimes that the U.S. and other western powers refuse to work with, such as the governments in Sudan and Eritrea . In the case of Djibouti itself, international monitors, independent humanitarian groups, and opposing political factions have accused President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh and his ruling People’s Rally for Progress party of rigging elections , suppressing political opposition , and jailing opponents on trumped up charges. Chinese political and economic engagement in Africa has only reinforced the need for an outpost on the continent to support unilateral military missions in times of crisis. In 2011, as the regime of Libya’s long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi collapsed , China suddenly had to find a way to help more than 35,000 of its nationals flee the country. In 2014, it repeatd the process, but had to call upon other countries, including Greece , to help. Authorities in Beijing facilitated a much smaller evacuation of some 600 individuals from Yemen as the small country on the Arabian Peninsula devolved into civil war four years later. The simple act of sailing up and down the coast of Somalia hunting for pirates had already been logistically complicated for the PLAN. During those operations, “Chinese officers and men encountered difficulties in replenishing food and fuel, and Djibouti offered logistical support in multiple instances,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng had acknowledged in his July 2017 remarks. Chinese troops bound for South Sudan in 2015., AP China as an international military power But these official missions are just one piece of the larger picture. Beyond regional security concerns, the facility in Djibouti can only help China obvious desire to expand its military presence well beyond its borders. The African country is strategically located near the Suez Canal, providing a stable, Chinese-controlled stop-over point for military fleets heading to Europe and beyond. Its especially well positioned to both protect the transport of Middle Eastern and African energy and mineral resources critical to China’s overall economic development, as well as provide storage space for the fuel and other supplies the PLA needs to conduct operations in Africa and Europe. Having these port facilities will be essential if the country wants to conduct far-flung carrier battle group operations. It seems almost guaranteed that once the base in fully operational the country’s first operational carrier, the Liaoning , and its escorts will make it a regular port of call . The decision to establish the overseas base has lined up with dramatic cuts to the PLA’s ground forces, too. In 2015, the Chinese military trimmed 300,000 personnel from its total strength . Just one day before its troops set sail for Africa, the PLA unveiled a plan to slash its land units even further, cutting the total ground force to less than one million individuals, and redistribute the remaining personnel to all other branches, including the PLAN , specifically to support operations abroad. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IcDQGWW07YA “This reform will provide other services, including the PLA Rocket Force, Air Force, Navy and Strategic Support Force (mainly responsible for electronic warfare and communication), with more resources and inputs, and the PLA will strengthen its capability to conduct overseas missions,” Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the government-funded China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told Global Times , an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. “The PLA must be capable of spotting overseas threats and destroying hostile forces thousands of kilometers away before they enter our 12 nautical mile territorial waters. China’s overseas interests are spread around the world and need to be protected. These are beyond the army’s current capabilities.” Its perhaps not surprising then that as Chinese forces make their way to Djibouti, three PLAN warships are in the process of conducting an uncommon “goodwill voyage” through the Mediterranean Sea, while a separate flotilla is moving through the area en route to joint drills with the Russian Navy . During the transit, China’s sailors practiced blasting targets at sea ahead of the upcoming Joint Sea 2017 exercise, which will take place in the Baltic Sea . Since 2005, the two countries have held seven combined naval exercises. The last of these, Joint Sea 2016, occurred in the contested South China Sea and was the first in the series to include simulated “island seizing missions.” With its African lily pad, the PLAN could step up its involvement in these European drills or even start all new unilateral, bilateral, or multinational exercises with its partners in Africa and the Middle East. Regardless, it will make it much easier for China to show its flag in general and make those appearances much more significant whenever and where ever they occur. A U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter during a training exercise in Djibouti., USAF Potential for tensions The PLA’s push to become a bigger player on the international scene has long worried other countries, including the United States. The establishment of a base in Djibouti in particular has only added to those concerns about potential tensions. Though small, the African country already plays host to American, French, British, and Japanese military contingents. Other countries, including Iran and the United Arab Emirates , have or are considering basing military forces in the country or elsewhere in the Horn of Africa. The U.S. military in particular uses Djibouti as a major hub for operations across East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula on the other side of the Gulf of Aden, something The War Zone has previously covered in depth . The ever expanding American bases at Camp Lemonnier and Chabelley Airfield have served as a staging point for drone strikes and special operations missions in both Somalia and Yemen, as well as other regional military activities. In the past year, dangers in the area for American forces have only increased, with Yemeni rebels firing cruise missiles at U.S. Navy warships and laying sea mines that could threaten both military and commercial ships. Combined with an expanding , secretive counter-terrorism campaign in neighboring Somalia , the country will undoubtedly continue to be strategically significant to the U.S. military for the foreseeable future. And American commanders aren’t necessarily thrilled about having to run these sensitive operations in a shared space with the Chinese. The U.S. military “expressed … concerns about some of the things that are important to us about what the Chinese should not do at that location” to President Guelleh, U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, told members of Congress in March 2017. The War Zone Make sure to check out our interactive google map showing U.S. military facilities across in Africa. “We’ve never had a base of, let’s just say a peer competitor, as close as this one happens to be, so there’s a lot of learning going on, a lot of growing going on,” Waldhauser said in a separate interview with Breaking Defense. “Yes, there are some very significant operational security concerns.” In both cases, he declined to elaborate on what those concerns were specifically. However, having Chinese personnel in such close proximity could give both parties the opportunity to spy on each other. For China in particular, it would give them a better opportunity to observe its American counterparts during actual operations. There are also concerns that authorities in Beijing could pressure Guelleh to change or even rescind the terms of America’s lease agreements, though this seems unlikely. These deals are worth millions in direct payments, as well as the economic benefits of hosting large numbers of U.S. troops and supporting contractors. Neither party would be in a hurry to willingly give up the strategic position either. “The Bab al-Mandeb [strait between Yemen and Djibouti] is an essential maritime chokepoint from an energy, shipping and security perspective,” Dr. Geoffrey Gresh, an associate professor and Chair of the International Security Studies Department at the National Defense University, as well as author of Gulf Security and the U.S. Military: Regime Survival and the Politics of Basing , told me by Email back in 2015. “Djibouti is an important and essential gateway or doorway to the rest of Africa.” With the Chinese now establishing their base, whatever its purpose ultimately turns out to be, that gateway is getting just a little bit more crowded.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2018",Pentagon Watchdog Slams U.S.-Backed Efforts to Expand The Afghan Air Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s top watchdog has released a report that is highly critical of NATO-led, U.S.-supported efforts to improve and expand the Afghan Air Force, amid plans to triple that service’s size over the next five years. The review acknowledges that Afghanistan’s air arm has improved in some respects, but says significant gaps in training and logistical support remain, that coalition advisers are not adequately prepared for the tasks at hand, and that the international effort still lacks a coherent, overarching strategy . The Department of Defense Inspector General, or DODIG, released the results of its assessment , which it had conducted between March and August 2017, on Jan. 4, 2018. The evaluators broke down their findings into six main conclusions, these being improving Afghan Air Force capabilities, an ill-defined advisory mission, private contractor support, broad training gaps, and how the Afghans made use of the Mi-17 Hip helicopter. All but one of these contained significant criticisms of the state of the Afghan force and the international advisory mission. “TAAC‑Air’s efforts to train, advise, and assist the Afghan Air Force have resulted in notable accomplishments,” the report says in its executive summary, referring to the NATO-run Train, Advise, Assist Command-Air. “However, TAAC‑Air does not have a plan defining the terms of its mission statement to develop the Afghan Air Force into a ‘professional, capable, and sustainable’ force. TAAC‑Air cannot track the Afghan Air Force’s progress because they have not defined the intended end state and related metrics for determining the capabilities and capacities of the Afghan Air Force.” This overall assessment that the U.S.-backed international mission does not have a way to determine if its efforts to improve the Afghan Air Force are working, or even central concept for how to implement its guiding principles, is shocking since the coalition has been working to develop the force for more than a decade. It is even more galling, given that, since at least 2016, the NATO-led security assistance mission in Afghanistan, known as the Resolute Support Mission, has been working to implement a much-touted Afghan Aviation Transition Plan (AATP). US Air Force Col. Armando Fiterre, commander of the 738th Air Expeditionary Advisory Group, part of TAAC-Air, watches as personnel unload one of the first UH-60s for the Afghan Air Force in September 2017., USAF This plan, which the Pentagon says will cost more than $800 million so far, aims to effectively triple the size of the Afghan Air Force. One of the AATP’s core goals is for the Afghans to field more A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft and MD 530F light attack helicopters, as well as add new AC-208 armed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planes and UH-60 Black Hawk choppers to their inventory. DODIG’s investigators did find some evidence that the Afghan Air Force was improving its abilities to operate its existing A-29s, fly at night with unspecified helicopter and fixed wing aircraft, and work directly with Afghan troops on the ground. In the first three months of 2017, the service had sent the Super Tucanos out on more than 10 times as many missions as they had in the last three months of 2016, according to the report. This was in line with a previous Pentagon report had noted that the Afghans had flown more sorties with the light attack planes in the second half of 2017 than they had in all of 2016. DOD At the same time, there were indications that Afghan pilots had taken the initiative to try and avoid potential civilian casualties. Between April and December 2016, A-29s had aborted nearly 20 percent of their attack runs due to concerns about innocent bystanders, friendly fire, or simply an inability to positively identify the target, according to the NATO Air Command-Afghanistan, or NAC-A. There was no mention of the present inability of the Super Tucanos pilots to fly at night or that the aircraft still lack a long-promised precision guided munitions capability, which we at The War Zone were first to reveal . With precision weapons, the crews might have been able to follow through with more attacks, especially against moving targets or those where the enemy was dangerously close to friendly forces or civilians. NATO advisers also highlighted the improving skills of Afghan Tactical Air Controllers (ATACs) and their increasing ability to call in air support independent of coalition forces. The Afghan military as a whole was steadily increasing the use of aerial support in day-to-day operations broadly, including for resupply and casualty evacuation. The Afghan Air Force had also stepped up coordination with teams of contractors operating Scan Eagle drones . The report acknowledges that the latter coordination only occurs during the mission planning process, not while the Super Tucanos are in flight. Since these discussions occur over the phone or face-to-face, it might not involve the actual sharing of full motion video or other imagery the drones capture, either, something we at The War Zone have indicated could be the case in the past . The A-29s are “a glimmer of hope to Afghan Air Force and the Afghan National Army,” head of NATO’s Train, Advise, Assist Command-South told the evaluators, a somewhat backhanded compliment to the country’s military as a whole. “A U.S. Intelligence advisor to the Afghan National Army 215th Corps supported this observation, saying that the A‑29s produce good results when they engage their targets,” the report noted. But the rest of the review suggests that any improvements have likely come in spite of serious and long-standing structural problems on the part of both the coalition and the Afghan Air Force. TAAC-Air did not even have an approved plan of action to perform its mission until 2016, when the incoming commanding officer crafted a concept with four lines of effort touching on both the advisory unit’s strategic direction and what it actually envisioned as the Afghan Air Force’s end state. This means that for at least a year, and possibly longer, the unit was working without any firm, overarching strategy or goalposts. In January 2015, NATO rebranded the NATO Air Training Command – Afghanistan, which had existed since 2008, as TAAC-Air . DODIG redacted the actual four guiding principles from the version of the report it released publicly, so we don’t know what they are. This apparently puts us in the same position as some top advisers, at least as of 2017, though. “Advisors’ responses revealed that TAAC-Air advisors do not share a consistent definition of the mission statement, nor a common way to achieve the mission end-state,” the report explained. “Finally, we asked the Commander of the [U.S. Air Force’s] 738th Air Expeditionary Advisor Group, a subordinate commander under TAAC-Air, if he was aware of the lines of effort. He replied that he had heard about them, but had not seen them.” An Afghan Air Force Mi-17 helicopter., USAF On top of apparently not agreeing on or even necessarily knowing what the coalition’s plan for the Afghan Air Force might be, DODIG found that advisers received no specific training or information about the service before arriving in country, though they did take courses on Afghan culture broadly. As such, they had to spend time during their temporary deployments, in which they were supposed to be aiding the Afghans in their day-to-day tasks, learning how their units operated, how they interacted with the coalition, and even the basic organizational and command structures of the country’s air force. “Air advisors assigned to TAAC-Air reported they ‘…were less efficient and effective…’ until they achieved sufficient on-the-job training and completed the ‘…learning process…’ to acquire the requisite knowledge and skills,” the Pentagon investigators wrote. “This learning period delayed the development of the relationship between the advisors and their Afghan counterparts, thereby hindering the continued development of Afghan Air Force personnel.” The impacts of this apparently haphazard approach were obvious in the criticisms the Pentagon watchdog leveled at the state of the Afghan Air Force. As the Pentagon routinely notes, and as we at The War Zone have reported on repeatedly, the Afghan military continues to lack an effective pipeline to train personnel for a host of key job descriptions, even after more than a decade of U.S.- and coalition-backed efforts to improve its capabilities. Limited education, language barriers, and a lack of appropriate facilities, blended together with a host of socio-political factors – which some U.S. officials have dubbed “ The Afghan Condition ” – have long made it difficult for U.S. and other coalition forces to train and advise their Afghan counterparts. Training aviators and aircraft mechanics has been particularly difficult and Afghanistan still lacks the capacity to conduct the necessary training programs in country. Sending Afghans to the United States and elsewhere to learn the necessary skills has proven costly and complicated. Trainees have abandoned their courses , possibly due to low morale, a desire not to return to the grueling fight, or just fears for their personal safety in Afghanistan. Some have outright applied for political asylum . There’s no clear plan for how to improve the quality of training in Afghanistan, or the potential benefits of doing so, either. “The Chief of the Training and Education Division within the Security Assistance Office of Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan stated that the command does not know how much it costs to provide similar aviation-specific training within Afghanistan because no such aviation-specific training programs or institutions currently exist,” the report explained. In addition, the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, the U.S. military’s top advisory element in the country, said there was no existing requirement at all for in-country training at present or in the future. As such, it couldn’t conduct an analysis of what it might cost to do so that would be in any way accurate. The seemingly perpetually sluggish pace of training Afghan Air Force was particularly and unsurprisingly most apparent when it came to the service’s maintenance and logistics capacity, something we at The War Zone regularly highlight in our reporting about the Afghan Air Force . This issue warranted an entire section in the report by itself and indicated that the relying on private contractors to sustain Afghan aircraft, and how the coalition had implemented that support, was having a negative impact on the force as a whole. As of the end of 2017, private contractors were responsible for more than half of the total maintenance work on four of the six types of aircraft the Afghan Air Force operates. Those companies supply 100 percent of the support for Afghanistan’s C-130 Hercules transport planes and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Data on contractor logistics support (CLS) that TAAC-Air provided to DODIG. Not shown here is the breakdown for the Afghan Air Force’s UH-60s, which were 100 percent contractor maintained as of the end of 2017., DOD NATO has and continues to award those contracts based on the immediate needs of the service, not an established long-term plan to turn those responsibilities over to the Afghans. This, in turn, “de-emphasized” the need for the Afghan Air Force to develop its own organic capabilities within a set timeframe. The wording of the C-130 maintenance contract actually bars the Afghans from working on their own aircraft, which makes it difficult for them to gain the necessary skills to take over in the future. “Of all five CLS [contractor logistics support] contracts supporting Afghan Air Force airframes, only the contract covering the Mi-17 defined transition criteria or identified transition timelines,” the evaluators found. “As the exception, this contract directs the contractors to transition responsibility to the Afghans.” An Afghan Air Force C-130 Hercules., USAF This is something of a moot issue for this particular type, though. The Afghan Air Force already performs 80 percent of the maintenance on these helicopters, which both it and international coalition describe as the service’s “workhorse.” The other 20 percent is almost entirely heavy depot maintenance the Afghans can’t perform in country. On top of that, per the AATP, the United States and NATO are pushing for the retirement of this entire fleet and replacing them with UH-60s, a dubious plan we at The War Zone have already examined in depth multiple times . A separate section described how the Afghan Air Force was just running those helicopters into the ground by giving regional Afghan Army Corps commanders direct control of small detachments to try and better meet heavy demand for air support. Those officials had no sense of the maintenance requirements, though, and were sending them out on missions even after it became clear they were in need of repairs, increasing the potential relatively minor problems could escalate to the point of requiring out-of-country depot maintenance. Afghan Air Force and coalition personnel unload an Mi-17 from a contractor aircraft in 2013., USAF Advisors told the DODIG investigators that they understood this was an unsustainable situation, but that they were unsure how else to get appropriate helicopter support to units in the field. Otherwise, they said, requests for support would have to go through a national-level command chain, which would slow down the pace of operations and put individual regions in direct competition with each other for aircraft. All of these findings, of course, only underscore previous concerns that the Afghan Air Force simply lacks sufficient capacity to meet the country’s basic needs for responsive air power and that there’s no indication when this might change. The U.S. military has billed the AATP as a truly transformational endeavor that will finally put the service on the path toward a realistic, independent capability. The DODIG report, however, calls the most basic underlying assumptions of that plan that into question. The Pentagon watchdog recommended that the TAAC-Air command finally publish a full strategic plan that includes the four lines of effort, make sure advisers got that information, and review the process by which it hires contractors to support the Afghan Air Force. It also said the U.S. military should better prepare advisory personnel for their mission and conduct a review of its requirements and procedures for training the Afghans. The U.S. military concurred with every one of the Pentagon watchdog’s recommendations, which shows they are aware of the issues and the seriousness of the situation, too. At the same time, though, this hasn’t stopped them from initiating the purchases of new aircraft for the Afghans under the AATP or prompted a delay in the plan’s five-year schedule. The U.S. military and NATO apparently developed the concept and initiated purchases of dozens of new aircraft, including all new types the Afghans have no experience with, while advisory personnel in the country were conducting their mission without any clear objectives. We at The War Zone have often questioned whether the Afghans would be able to readily absorb and sustain any significant number of additional airframes, especially new, more complex aircraft, such as the UH-60 Black Hawk , which are more maintenance intensive than existing types the country has. Based on the information available, there was already reason to believe this would actually hamper the Afghan Air Force’s operational capacity in the near term . The review also underscored the reality that, unless the situation on the ground or U.S. government policy toward the conflict in Afghanistan changes dramatically, American forces in particular will continue to need to provide critical air support for Afghan troops as they struggle to contain the Taliban, ISIS, and other terrorists and insurgents. The United States is already quietly assuming something closer to a combat mission once again, increasingly deploying personnel on advise and assist missions and other joint operations in the field. “The hard work, sacrifice and investment of our 39-member coalition is helping build the Afghan National Defense Security Forces and delivering on a coherent vision,” U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Lance Bunch, the director of the Resolute Support Mission’s future operations office, insisted to reporters on Dec. 12, 2017. “The momentum here has clearly changed, and the combat capability gap between the Afghan Defense Forces and the Taliban has never been greater.” Based on the DODIG’s assessment, and the responses from commanders in Afghanistan, there still seems to be a long way to go in producing that coherent vision for the Afghan Air Force, even after more than a decade of coalition support.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 4, 2021",This Shadowy Testbed Jet Has Been Flying Missions With A False Registration For Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The shadowy world of flying sensor test bed aircraft, both foreign and domestic , is a fascinating one. These highly modified airliners and business jets do critical work validating new radars, missile seekers, data-links, targeting pods and much more. Some of the shyest among them also work to quantify aircrafts’ thermal and radar signatures from an air-to-air perspective. But one of these aircraft—a gonzo-nosed DC-9, known as a NC-9D, with an interesting backstory—has been suddenly quite active and seems to suffer from a case of multiple identifies. The DC-9 in question began its life 41 years ago as a typical airliner and went on to serve with Ansett, Spirit , and Midway airlines. Then in 1998 it was converted into a major avionics and sensor systems test bed by BAE and Raytheon. The jet had a major modification to its nose section, with a big bulbous fairing installed that can accept modular sensor payloads, such as fire control radars and missile seekers. The aircraft is also fitted with a large communications array that runs along its spine. A ventral antenna farm is also present on the aircraft as well. Firebird II, Akradecki/Wikicommons The aircraft was named “Firebird II” and it wore a high-profile purple and white scheme with a big phoenix on its tail. Its civilian registration was N932ML. In the mid 2000s the jet was put into storage at Mojave Air and Space Port before being brought back into service a couple years later in 2008, when it began flying sporadically for testing assignments once again. At some time there appears to have been an organizational change with how the aircraft was owned and operated. According to Flightaware.com, the last time the aircraft was flown under its N number—which it supposedly still wears— was in 2011 . According to FAA records the aircraft’s registration is not active and hasn’t been for some time. What’s most interesting is that the owner under its lapsed registration is listed as the US Navy with an address at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake —the Navy’s leading-edge research and flight test center near Death Valley, California. The jet, which has been repainted in a discreet blue and white motif, sans giant phoenix on its tail, also has the active Navy bureau number 168277, which odd. But what makes all this even more interesting is that it has been flying under a completely different N number, that being N879AD. This registration does not exist at all in the FAA’s database. N932ML rotating away from Tucson International Airport after leaving the Raytheon Missile Systems compound. , James O’Rear The aircraft shows up on Flightaware.com and on ADS-B flight trackers under this registration and it has been quite active over the last month and a half, flying between Tucson, Phoenix, Mojave, Holloman AFB, and NAS Point Mugu. The fact that it has been flying under this registration for at least four months largely discounts the possibility that it’s the result of some sort of error. Just some of the tracks the NC-9D has been making as of late (NAS Point Mugu 2X and Holloman AFB). As of yesterday it was still flying missions out of NAS Point Mugu., Flightradar 24 Convoluting things even more is that the aircraft also flies under the callsign “Flight Systems 01” which is a BAE Systems reference to their aerospace modifications and services division based at Mojave Air and Space Port. In the following air traffic control audio you can actually hear the aircraft as “Flight Systems 01” on approach to Tucson International and being cleared to taxi to Raytheon’s hangar. Recent flight log of the NC-9D under the non-existent N number N879AD. Starting November 14th there is a big uptick on flights operations., Flightaware.com So what’s going on here? We really can’t say conclusively. Even the arrangement of who owns, operates, and provides testing systems for the aircraft remains unclear. It very well could be a convoluted arrangement where the Navy owns the jet but it is operated and modified by BAE Flight Systems, while Raytheon and BAE Systems provide sensors and systems for testing purposes. These types of complex and often fluid arrangements between the DoD and defense contractors aren’t unheard of by any means when it comes to sensitive missions and projects, and they can be just as much a tool used to hide an aircraft’s true identity as one of operational convenience. But this still doesn’t explain why the aircraft is flying under a non-existent registration or why the registration number it wears isn’t even active or in most cases relevant if it is indeed a military aircraft. The NC-9D’s nose section can accommodate different fairings to test different radars and missile seeker arrays. , James O’Rear As for what the aircraft is up to we can only guess. But considering its primary mission is radar and missile seeker testing, and taking into account the places it has been and where it is currently operating, this is most likely the case. The question is what is it testing or what is it being tested against? The Navy’s massive range complex off Southern California is used for all types of trials and exercises, from submarine launched ballistic missile and cruise missile tests to giving Navy SEALs a place to discreetly practice urban warfare . Live-fire occurs on San Clemente Island and a whole host of unique and elaborate hardware supports testing out in the range complex. Recently there seems to be a spike in testing in the area, and some pretty shy test-related assets from the USAF have been caught packing exotic sensors and electronic warfare systems while possibly transitioning eastward after missions over the California coast. With this in mind, could this aircraft be supporting a highly classified program? It is possible, especially considering we know some big initiatives are underway, including the B-21 bomber program . Even the RQ-170 Sentinel has a presence nearby at Vandenberg AFB. Such an aircraft would offer an ideal detection challenge for any new radar or missile system. Then again the NC-9D could be testing a new missile seeker design or fire control radar system against far less exotic targets, or even new data-link systems, all of which we know are currently under development. If anything else, the peculiar comings and goings of the NC-9D are just another reminder of the massive although little seen test apparatus that supports America’s sprawling defense industrial complex. With peer-state competitors rising in power, an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula looming, a big boost in defense related spending, and a new focus on accelerated weapons testing, it’s likely we will see a lot more of this aircraft and others like in the coming days, months, and years.

The Pentagon is reportedly working to create a new U.S. Space Command to oversee the nation’s space-focused military forces and a new entity to handle buying military satellites and space launch services within months. This could serve as a stepping stone to a fully independent Space Force service branch, but the plan already highlights many of the potential pitfalls of pursuing that course of action, including who will pay for it and how it will fit in with other, existing military organizations. Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber got the scoop that the U.S. military is planning to implement the sweeping organization changes by the end of 2018, according to a draft of a report. Following a failed push by some members of Congress to pass legislation to create the wholly separate Space Force in 2017 , the Pentagon agreed to study the issue and give its recommendations to lawmakers on how American forces should handle operational and other activities related to space in the future. “The Department of Defense is establishing a Space Force to protect our economy through deterrence of malicious activities, ensure our space systems meet national security requirements and provide vital capabilities to joint and coalition forces across the spectrum of conflict,” the draft report, dated July 30, 2018, says, according to Defense One . “DoD will usher in a new age of space technology and field new systems in order to deter, and if necessary degrade, deny, disrupt, destroy and manipulate adversary capabilities to protect U.S. interests, assets and way of life … This new age will unlock growth in the U.S. industrial base, expand the commercial space economy and strengthen partnerships with our allies.” Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is reportedly the principal architect of the report. He is no stranger to controversial decisions, having also been the primary author of the Pentagon’s latest policy regarding cluster munitions . The US Air Force’s secretive X-37B space plane, one of the projects that could end up under the control of a new US Space Command or Space Development Agency., USAF Three new space-focused organizations His plan for space will create three distinct entities, U.S. Space Command, a Space Operations Force, and a Space Development Agency. This goes beyond the provisions in the proposed defense spending bill for the 2019 fiscal year, which called for the creation of the first organization, but within U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). The Senate is expected to vote on that legislation in August 2018, after which President Donald Trump could quickly sign it into law. Though the changes the Pentagon review recommends will be significant, creating a functional U.S. Space Command, or SPACECOM, will be among the easiest things for the Pentagon to do. Between 1985 and 2002, this entity actually existed before then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ordered it merged with STRATCOM. This subsequently evolved into the Joint Functional Component Command for Space, or JFCC-Space, which stood down in December 2017. The head of the Air Force’s own Space Command, or AFSPC, was also in charge of JFCC-Space and now has the additional title of Joint Force Space Component Commander. Shanahan’s report describes creating a new, fully separate SPACECOM that will be on equal footing with the U.S. military’s other three functional commands – STRATCOM, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) – but that still shares a commander with AFSPC. In effect, substantial parts of the existing U.S. military space bureaucracy will gain new titles and certain additional authorities, but will remain otherwise unchanged. The insignia of US Space Command, which existed from 1985 to 2002., DOD The same goes for the Space Operations Force, which will have to be abbreviated SpOF to prevent confusion with Special Operations Forces, or SOF. “Similar to Special [Operations] Forces personnel provided by all military services, the Space Operations Force will be composed of the space personnel from all Military Services, but developed and managed as one community,” the draft report says. It’s not clear if this is truly an accurate representation of the plan, though. When it comes to the SOF community, individual services continue to have some administrative responsibilities for these specialized units, but cede all operational control of them to SOCOM. The SpOF could similarly end up referring to a collection of existing space-focused units, such as those under AFSPC , with a similar command relationship to the future SPACECOM. It might also refer to the services contributing personnel to create new units, similar to how U.S. Cyber Command went about establishing the National Cyber Mission Force for operations in cyberspace. It may turn out to be a combination of both. Either way, this will almost certainly involve leveraging most, if not all of the existing U.S. military space units and expanding them, but only as necessary. Again, though this will help improve communication and coordination between existing organizations, it won’t necessarily fundamentally change much of their existing command structure, especially at the lower echelons. Vice President Mike Pence during a visit to the US Air Force’s 50th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force Base. This unit could end up as part of the new Space Operations Force., USAF A single manager for buying satellites The biggest change, by far, will be with the creation of the Space Development Agency, or SDA, which will be similar in concept to the Missile Defense Agency , or MDA. It’s not clear if SDA will be a separate entity as is the case with MDA and distinct from SPACECOM or if this organization will be subordinate to the new space-focused headquarters. Regardless, this new agency will take charge of buying any new military space systems or services, Defense One explains . As existing space-related contracts come up for renewal, responsibility for continuing those deals, or not, will pass to SDA. At present, the Air Force handles approximately 85 percent of space-related acquisition. With SDA, the service’s direct role in this will effectively cease and could lead to the shuttering of the Space and Missile Systems Center, which oversees most of this work. It is possible that the center could simply morph into the SDA, too, and take on the small amount of space-focused purchasing that exists elsewhere in the U.S. military, primarily within the U.S. Navy . Even more importantly, the Pentagon report says all of this will serve as a starting place for a fully-fledged separate service branch , as some members of Congress have called for in the past. The plan would be to include a request to create the Space Force in the annual defense budget request for the 2020 fiscal year. An artist’s impression of “Neighborhood Watch” space monitoring satellites of the Air Force Space Command’s Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program, or GSSAP , one of many programs that the Space Development Agency could take responsibility for in the future., USAF A change in attitude at the Pentagon This is a dramatic change in the Pentagon’s opinion on the matter from just a year ago, when Secretary of Defense James Mattis personally intervened to kill the previous proposal to create a Space Corps under the Department of the Air Force. The Air Force itself remains vehemently opposed to the idea and stands to lose the most in terms of personnel and resources to an independent space-centric service. “I think the most important thing is to stay focused on the warfighter and maintaining the lethality of the service, no matter how the org-chart boxes go,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said during an event The Washington Post hosted on July 25, 2018. “If we keep focused on that and not on which boxes move around which place in the Pentagon, then we’ll do the right thing for the nation.” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson speaks at an event in January 2018., K.M. Cannon/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP The shift at the Pentagon is likely in no small part due to Trump’s own increased support for a Space Force. The president has publicly declared more than once now that the new service is coming, even though it would be up to Congress to create it, and it continues to face opposition from the Air Force. Deputy Defense Secretary Shanahan reportedly cut the service out of the planning process some time ago, even though their participation will be essential to make the process work, according to Defense One . And there’s no guarantee that even if a provision for a Space Force ends up in drafts of the Fiscal Year 2020 defense spending bill that it will be part of the legislation when it becomes law. When the plan first appeared in 2017, many lawmakers felt the idea had been sprung on them out of nowhere and questioned whether it made any sense. Those same individuals could easily seek to block funding just for the new SPACECOM or the SDA or demand the Pentagon make additional changes to its space-related command structures and budgeting. There remains a healthy debate around the notion of a Space Force and it’s unclear how much support the initiative has in Congress at present or might have in the near future. The Pentagon’s immediate plans already underscore many of the possible issues with the idea, chiefly where the money will come from and how SPACECOM will work together with other agencies that have interests in space , such as MDA, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). President Donald Trump has become a vocal supporter of an independent Space Force., Steve Helber—AP Serious questions remain As I have noted before , supporters of the Space Force concept argue that the Air Force doesn’t have the time or inclination to make space issues a priority and that a single manager is necessary to focus on the issue and streamline the purchases of necessary assets and services. But if the Air Force’s top space officer ends up in charge of SPACECOM, it’s hard to see how that changes. That individual’s attention, especially when it comes to developing budgets, will actually end up split between the service and the military-wide command in this arrangement. Critics have similarly questioned whether it makes sense for the head of U.S. Cyber Command to also be in charge of the NSA and whether that individual can realistically give adequate attention to both entities. And if SPACECOM ends up having its own budget supplemented with funding through the individual services, as is the case with SOCOM, this might lead to confusion and disputes over who is actually responsible for paying for what programs. There’s also the simple matter of adding another major line into the Pentagon’s overall budget that could lead to infighting for certain resources. This could become more pronounced if SDA ends up separate from SPACECOM and requires its own distinct funding stream. “Creating a Space Force won’t reduce those tribes,” former Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James, who is also opposed to the plan, said during a panel discussion at the Brookings Institution think tank on July 30, 2018. “It’s too small and will be lost in the shuffle.” The budget issue will be inseparable from a discussion about what roles and missions SPACECOM, or an independent Space Force, will actually have, too. Any difficulty in segregating its functions from other organizations will become readily apparent if the Pentagon follows through with its plan to create the command and SDA by the end of the year. A view inside the U.S. military’s Joint Space Operations Center., USAF Immediate hurdles The proposed 2019 defense spending package requires MDA to begin development of new sensor-carrying satellites to spot and track incoming ballistic missiles, as well as weapons to destroy them on those missiles on their launch pads from space. Under the Pentagon’s plans, SDA could end up in charge of procuring the satellites and getting them into space, while MDA would be in charge of the payloads. This could create additional layers of unnecessary bureaucracy and the potential for costly miscommunication that might lead to delays if there is any confusion about the exact technical requirements. The same questions will arise when it comes to other satellite launches for NRO or other intelligence agencies. A Cold War-era artist’s conception of a notional hybrid ground- and space-based laser weapon to destroy enemy satellites or incoming ballistic missiles., USAF Of course, none of this is to say that the U.S. military doesn’t need to ensure that it remains serious about how it operates in space and responds to emerging threats in that domain. American forces are increasingly reliant on space assets for communication, navigation , weapon guidance , and more. At the same time, potential high-end opponents, such as Russia and China, have focused their energies on mitigating those advantages in any future conflict through anti-satellite weapons , electronic warfare systems , and other technologies and strategies . Russia has already criticized the plans for the Space Force, accusing the United States of seeking to militarize space , and these broader issues won’t be a purely military problem . At the same panel discussion at Brookings where former Secretary of the Air Force James spoke, Frank Rose, a Brookings senior fellow who previously worked on space security policy for President Barack Obama’s administration, called for a more thought out, whole-of-government approach that combined diplomatic efforts and input from civilian space stakeholders. Whatever happens, there is a real need for the Pentagon to reassess how it operates in and with regards to space and it appears to be doing just that with the plans for SPACECOM and its associated entities. At the same time, it seems likely that the future military space organization will continue to evolve in the coming months and years and there’s still no guarantee that the end result will actually be a separate, independent Space Force.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 18, 2019",U.S. Fighter Jets Are About To Get Infrared Sensors That Could Be Huge For UFO Reporting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s long and murky relationship with unidentified flying objects has taken an abrupt turn in recent years and especially in recent months as the Navy has officially admitted that its pilots are encountering things it cannot, or isn’t willing to explain, at an alarming rate . With this news, the establishment of high profile UFO-related groups like To The Stars Academy , as well as a new level of engagement by the press in regards to the topic, the public’s fascination with the phenomena has once again been elevated. This American UFO renaissance of sorts was further catalyzed by a number of bizarre incidents involving U.S. Navy fighter pilots and puzzling objects operating within tightly controlled and highly monitored airspace . Regardless of what these things actually were, and in some cases, there are compelling explanations pointing to the possibility that they may be very much of terrestrial origin , we know that a relatively recent revolution in fire control radar technology was a major factor in detecting them. But there is about to be an even more relevant leap in U.S. fighter aircraft sensor capabilities that could prove far more significant when it comes to more easily detecting and classifying these strange objects, and thus explaining, or at least better defining some aspects of the phenomenon. I was recently involved in a project that tasked me with deeply contemplating the technology that could be brought to bear when it comes to learning more about unidentified flying objects, regardless of their origin. During this process, it hit me that just as the proliferation of new fighter-borne active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars was key in detecting mysterious objects with low radar cross-sections that were flying in the vicinity of U.S. Navy fighter aircraft, a reality that The War Zone was first to report on in detail , the looming Pentagon initiative to field very capable infrared search and track systems (IRSTs) could have even a larger impact. It could even serve as the final technological element needed to springboard potentially revolutionary data collection on the phenomenon. As it sits now, not only is the Navy’s Super Hornet fleet slated to get IRSTs very soon, but the Air Force’s fighter aircraft tasked with protecting the homeland, and the F-15C, in particular, are also set to get these sensors. F-15C carrying the AN/ASG-34 IRST21 sensor. , USAF IRSTs have been a major interest of mine for years. You can and really need to read this in-depth feature I did explaining how they work and why they matter and this recent follow-up for full context, but suffice it to say they fill a major and increasingly pressing sensor gap that exists across much of America’s tactical aircraft force. IRSTs have been around for many decades, and back in the 1960s, many U.S. fighters and interceptors featured them. But in the last four decades or so, the U.S. has fallen far behind when it comes to fielding a modern iteration of the concept and integrating it as part of the Pentagon’s air combat doctrine. Russian aircraft have sported the technology consistently through the latter half of the Cold War, albeit with questionable utility , and have not stopped since. Beyond Russian fighters, allied jets like the pan-European Typhoon and French Rafale carry highly advanced IRSTs today. In fact, even recent export variants of the Strike Eagle are equipped with an IRST. Although the performance of these systems was sorely lacking for many decades, the fact of the matter is that the IRST’s time has finally come. These sensors are far more sensitive than their predecessors and aided by fast computer processing and highly specialized software, as well as integration with the aircraft’s other sensors and mission computer, they are exponentially more capable than they were in the not so distant past. A 1960s vintage F-101 Voodoo equipped with an IRST. , USAF While radars use the radio frequency spectrum to detect and track targets, something that can be challenging to do when said target has a low radar cross-section due to is size, shape, and/or coatings—in other words, it’s stealthy—or due to the presence of electronic warfare tactics that can jam, confuse, and spoof radars, IRSTs have no such limitations. They mainly work in the long-wavelength infrared band and are passive in nature. In other words, unlike radar, they emit no energy at all. Instead, they rapidly peer around the sky looking for targets that radiate or reflect infrared energy. The IRST’s main limitation isn’t really tied to enemy tactics at all, it’s atmospheric conditions that can adversely affect its detection ranges. While IRSTs are increasingly important when it comes to countering stealthy fighters, and especially those that will increasingly operate in combat environments where electronic warfare tactics are being employed, those same attributes make them ideal for detecting, tracking, and further investigating the puzzling objects Navy pilots report encountering. In those cases, the craft are hard to continuously track on radar and in some cases, active jamming seemed to be employed against the pursuing fighter’s radars. In either case, the IRST would have remained totally unaffected. Beyond being able to detect targets when radar cannot, or at least when it can’t consistently, the IRST’s benefits are synergistic as it can work in tandem with the jet’s radar and targeting pod to detect, track, and gain telemetry and visual information on the target in question. For instance, the IRST can be cued to the targets the fighter’s radar detects, and it can do this over significant ranges. This means that even if the radar loses lock intermittently, it can more easily regain it as the IRST will continue to track the object. In addition, because of the IRST, a lock of some type is never actually lost. As a result, far more resilient tracking can be realized against stealthy targets or those that are employing electronic warfare tactics. Conversely, if the target has a faint infrared signature, but radar can detect it, the IRST can regain tracking the target more easily with the help of the radar or it can begin tracking it once it has come close enough to the IRST sensor to be detected. Beyond that, IRSTs allow fighter pilots to hunt and even engage aerial opponents ‘silently,’ as in without turning on their radar at all. The radar’s emissions can give away not only the presence of the fighter it is attached to, but also its location. So, the IRST can act independently of radar entirely and be used as a primary, standalone air-to-air sensor system. Su-27’s IRST mounted in front of the windscreen. The USSR has been steadfast adopters of IRST technology just as the U.S. moved away from it during the middle part of the Cold War. Up until the last two decades, these systems had somewhat limited utility. , Boevaya Mashina/Wikicommons Also, remember that radar and IRST are just two of the fighter’s three primary sensors. The third one is the targeting pod, which leverages infrared sensors, as well, but does so in a very different manner than the IRST. There is actually a fourth primary sensor group, that being electronic support measures (ESM)/radar homing and warning receiver (RHWR), but as far as we know, these mysterious objects don’t emit RF energy that can be detected by these systems. Traditionally, targeting pods are used for laser-designating ground targets and for non-traditional reconnaissance, but they are also used for enhanced-range visual detection and tracking of aerial targets. This was a secondary function for many years of various targeting pods, but more recently it has become a primary one. While Super Hornets carry the Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) targeting pods primarily for ground attack and surveillance, the USAF’s F-15Cs have adopted the more capable Sniper targeting pod specifically for long-range high-definition identification of airborne threats. This is very useful for Air National Guard F-15 units that sit alert, patrol America’s vast maritime borders, and protect the country’s coastal population centers from airborne attack. The EF-2000 is equipped with the PIRATE IRST, an advanced system that is integrated into the Typhoon’s combat systems architecture., Sgt Pete Mobbs/MOD The Sniper pod’s long zoom and high-definition optics allow Eagle pilots to positively identify an aerial target far sooner than they can with the naked eye and especially in the dark of night. This is a very important capability to have for pilots that may be charged to rapidly make life and death decisions, such as to take down an aircraft that may threaten the homeland. USAF F-15C Eagles with Sniper pods are also now deploying abroad and using the system for similar purposes during counter-air patrols over foreign territory. Yet any of America’s fighters, almost all of which carry targeting pods or have similar internally mounted systems, can slave the pod’s optics to a target that its radar sees automatically or the pilot can manually steer the pod’s sensor to ‘latch on to’ and track an airborne object. We see this in action in the “Go Fast” and “Gimbal” videos released by the Pentagon that supposedly show UFOs. I don’t believe these videos show anything really out of the ordinary at all, and certainly nothing definitively so, and there has been some very good forensic analysis done on them already that reinforces this point of view. Mick West, in particular, has really done compelling work on this topic. Some of his videos are posted below and are worth consideration. The third video that was released, the one of the infamous “Tic Tac” from 2004, looks like, well a Tic Tac, at least to me. Regardless, they all show FLIR footage taken by Hornets’ targeting pods. These pods, which operate at shorter infrared wavelengths than IRSTs, have a far more limited range compared to radar and IRSTs and they are not designed specifically to rapidly scan huge swatches of sky to pick out potential targets, nor sort and classify them. What they can do is gather far higher fidelity information on a target once it is within relatively close range. While some IRSTs are able to produce an image of a target, their visual fidelity is in most cases lacking compared to targeting pods operating at shorter IR wavelengths with optics specifically tailored for high visual fidelity. In fact, most targeting pods also have TV/electro-optical sensors, as well, that record in full color on the visual spectrum. So, what you have is a suite of three complementary sensors—radar, IRST, and targeting pod—that work together to maintain tracking on a target and collect disparate forms of data on said target. Radar has the longest reach, followed by the IRST which has intermediate range, followed by the targeting pod. But regardless of range, the IRST can spot what the radar can’t, and the IRST, like the radar, can put the targeting pod’s imaging sensors on the target, as well. Without the IRST, if the radar loses the target before the targeting pod is within range, and it can’t re-acquire it, that’s that. The Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod: Both the Air Force and the Navy are leveraging Lockheed’s AN/ASG-34 IRST21 sensor, which has evolved over nearly three decades into its current Block II form. The Super Hornet will carry the sensor in a specially designed centerline fuel tank, while the F-15C carries it in an open architecture payload pod known as the Legion Pod . The Super Hornet will be able to carry the IRST and a targeting pod at the same time. It’s not clear if the F-15C will be able to do the same as currently the Sniper Pod and the Legion Pod occupy the same centerline station, but with data-link connectivity, the targeting telemetry from the IRST pod can be passed from the carrying aircraft to others in the formation, such as another F-15C carrying a Sniper targeting pod. Eventually, the Legion Pod and IRST21 will migrate to other U.S. fighter types, like the F-16. In fact, the system has been operating on shadowy F-16s flying out of Area 51 for some time, and before that, the 64th Aggressor Squadron tested the IRST21 during a Red Flag exercise. The F-15C’s Legion Pod and the Super Hornet’s centerline tank-equipped IRST21 will be fielded operationally within the next two years and this widespread deployment, alongside the powerful AESA radars and targeting pods that equip both types, could result in a major breakthrough, or at least a major uptick, when it comes to detecting and gathering information on so-called unidentified flying objects, if they are indeed out there. Although we may not be privy to what comes of any of this, it could at least give our pilots and intelligence officers a better idea of what they are encountering. Once again, it was the widespread deployment of fighter-borne AESA radars that largely led to the reports of the encounters we know of in the 2014-2015 timeframe, so there is a chance that the introduction of IRSTs could result in a similar if not more pronounced subsequent disclosure of future incidents. Maybe the Pentagon already knows this and it is a factor in their decision to change the procedures by which its personnel, and its pilots, in particular, report such encounters. IRST21 installed on the specially-built centerline fuel tank. , USN The events off the eastern seaboard in 2014-2015 were remarkably widespread . Yet the base commanders seemed to have received no explanations or help from higher powers even after a safety report was filed following a near miss with a strange object. In the end, they resorted to posting Notices To Airman (NOTAMs) supposedly stating that there were hazards in the sky outside of their control in the restricted training areas where their pilots frequently drill. If these events crop back up again, that is if they ever really stopped entirely, aircrews and base commanders will likely know far more about the nature of what they are seeing then they did before the deployment of advanced IRSTs. It’s also worth noting the majority of these encounters were limited to radar. If some of these radar returns are in fact the result of electronic warfare tactics, the IRST will work as an independent source of tracking data to confirm this. There has been lots of talk of extreme bursts of speeds and altitude variations that are reminiscent of electronic warfare manifestations on radar. The IRST is not impacted by any of this, so it can work as a hard check to validate what is actually out there and what isn’t. With all this in mind, the Pentagon may be about to get more than it bargained for in regards to what its long-awaited advanced IRSTs can and can’t detect during daily operations. On the other hand, they may prove that some of what supposedly is there, isn’t, or that some of the performance characteristics associated with these mystery objects don’t mesh with reality.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K.-flagged tanker Pacific Voyager appears to have had an escort in the form of the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose , along with an unknown Sandown -class minehunter , as she sailed from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman today. This comes less than a week after an Iranian official threatened the seizure of a British ship in retaliation for U.K. officials seizing control of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar. Online ship trackers first noticed that Montrose , which is forward-deployed to the region, and the minehunter were shadowing Pacific Voyager on July 9, 2019. The minehunter’s transponder appeared to identify it as HMS Ramsey , but that ship is based in the United Kingdom. There are four other members of the Sandown -class that do operate forward-deployed in the region. Pacific Voyager successfully passed through the Strait of Hormuz without incident later in the day. “The UK maintains a long-standing maritime presence in the Gulf,” a spokesperson for the U.K. Ministry of Defense told the Daily Star , refusing to confirm or deny that any Royal Navy ships were escorting Pacific Voyager . “We are continuously monitoring the security situation there and are committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law.” The United Kingdom is a contributor to the U.S. Navy-led Combined Task Force 150 , which is based in Bahrain and helps ensure freedom of navigation in waterways throughout the Middle East and guards commercial shipping in the region against terrorist attacks and piracy. The U.K. military has dubbed its maritime contributions in the region as Operation Kipion . The apparent escort the Pacific Voyager follows a threat from Mohsen Rezaei , who is presently the Secretary of Iran’s powerful Expediency Discernment Council, an advisory body to the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to seize a British ship in response to U.K. authorities boarding and taking control of Iran’s Grace 1 over apparent sanctions violations . That incident occurred on July 4, 2019, and Rezaei, who is also a former commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), made his statement the following day. The U.S. government has blamed the IRGC for carrying out, or otherwise supporting, attacks on a number of oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in two separate incidents, one in May 2019 and another the following month . The IRGC also claimed responsibility for shooting down a U.S. Navy drone in June 2019, which almost prompted the U.S. military to launch strikes against targets in Iran . With the situation so tense, Pacific Voyager had already caused a stir after it came to an unexpected stop in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia, raising fears that the IRGC had followed through with Rezaei’s threat. A representative of the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) office subsequently told Reuters that the ship was “safe and well” and that it had paused its voyage simply to ship its estimated time of arrival its next port of call. It possible that this may have also been in order to allow Montrose and the minehunter to arrive in position. In addition, there’s no indication that naval mines have become an imminent threat in the region and its more likely that the smaller ship simply provided additional security for the tanker during the passage. HMS Shoreham , one of the Sandown -class minehunters now reportedly forward-deployed to the Middle East, during an exercise., USN On July 8, 2019, another U.K.-flagged tanker, the BP-owned British Heritage , which had been on its way to Basara, Iraq, abruptly changed its plans and dropped anchor off Saudi Arabia. The ship had been under charter to Dutch Royal Shell, but has reportedly canceled its booking and may now be waiting for its own escort out of the region. The situation underscores the often inherent risks to maritime commerce in the region, despite it being a major transit point for a third of the world’s oil supply and for 90 percent of all energy exports, including natural gas, to destinations outside the Middle East. It also highlights the difficulties that even countries with maritime assets forward-deployed in the region face in responding to major security challenges. The Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigates are of a now older design, dating back to the late 1980s, but still have significant anti-aircraft, anti-ship, and anti-submarine capabilities. But while Montrose , together with the Sandown -class minehunter, would certainly be able to deter a small force from trying to board a tanker, but the two ships alone might have trouble contending with a larger Iranian contingent riding in a swarm of small boats , especially if coupled with other threats, such as mines , shore-based missiles , and small unmanned aerial vehicles . With all this in mind, it remains to be seen now whether Montrose and other Royal Navy ships in the region will begin escorting British-flagged commercial vessels regularly, or if those tankers and cargo ships increasingly avoid taking jobs in the region for the foreseeable future over potential Iranian threats.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 16, 2019","U.S. OKs Sales of M1 Abrams Tanks, Stinger Missiles To Taiwan, But Where Are The F-16s?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has approved a potential sale of more than $2.2 billion in M1 Abrams tanks , FIM-92 Stinger short-range surface-to-air missiles, and host of associated equipment, ammunition, and services to Taiwan. But there’s still no official word on whether or not the United States will finally allow the Taiwanese to buy more than 60 new Block 70 F-16 Vipers . This is arguably a more important purchase given the increasing age of the Taiwanese Air Force’s fighter fleets and steady improvement’s in China’s air combat capabilities, but also one where Chinese authorities have historically drawn a “red line.” The U.S. military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the State Department had signed off on two possible deals, one relating to the Abrams and the other to the Stingers, on July 8, 2019. The M1 package is distinctly larger, with a value of approximately $2 billion, while the FIM-92 one is worth just over $223.5 million. It is important to note that just because a country has received U.S. government approval for such purchase, this doesn’t necessarily mean they will do so or that the final deals will be exactly as DSCA has described them now. However, Taiwan is very eager to acquire new and improved stocks of U.S.-made weapons and other military hardware in recent years and there have been previous reports about the desire to buy M1 tanks specifically. “This proposed sale of M1A2 tanks will contribute to the modernization of the recipient’s main battle tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,” DSCA’s statement said . “These tanks will contribute to the recipient’s goal of updating its military capability while further enhancing interoperability with the United States and other partners.” The proposed sale is for 108 Taiwan-specific M1A2T variants, but the notice does not provide detailed specifications on how these differ from other M1A2s. Previous Taiwanese media reports had said that they would be “ M1A2X ” tanks, based on the M1A2C variant, which is another name for the U.S. Army’s latest M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3 (SEPv3). The first M1A2 SEPv3 prototype in 2017., General Dynamics Land Systems If true, this could mean that the Taiwanese tanks would benefit from the SEPv3’s various improvements , which include upgraded communications and data sharing capabilities and added power generation to support those systems, as well as other additions in the future. The M1A2Ts will also have a remotely operated weapon station on top of the turret, allowing the crew to employ a secondary .50 caliber M2 machine gun from safely within the vehicle. But the notice also seems to suggest that the vehicles will be in a somewhat downgraded configuration. The M1A2Ts will notably have “FMS [foreign military sales] export armor” rather than the Next Generation Armor Package (NGAP) found on Army M1A2s, which builds on earlier passive armor suites with plating made from various materials, including ceramics and depleted uranium. There is also no mention of any of the advanced countermeasures found on the M1A2 SEPv3, such as radiofrequency jammers to defeat improvised explosive devices or the Trophy active protection system , making their way over to the Taiwanese version. Still, the M1A2T does offer significantly improved capabilities over Taiwan’s Cold War-era American-made M60A3 Pattons and locally upgraded CM-11 and CM-12 Brave Tiger tanks. All of these tanks feature 105mm main guns, compared to the Abrams’ larger 120mm cannon. The CM-11, which first emerged publicly in 1990, is a hybrid design that mates the turret from older U.S.-supplied M48A3 Pattons with the M60A3 chassis. These tanks also feature a derivative of the fire control system found on the M1A1 Abrams, making them more accurate, including on the move. Taiwan also obtained a significant number of additional fire control upgrade kits and installed them on some of their remaining M48A3s, resulting in the CM-12. Despite these improvements, these tanks have become increasingly vulnerable to improving Chinese designs, including the latest Type 99s . A CM-11 Brave Tiger., 玄史生 via Wikimedia The M1A2T package also includes various 120mm rounds and ammunition for the tanks’ secondary machine guns. There are also 16 M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporters (HET) and 14 M88A2 tank recovery vehicles that the Taiwanese Army will need to help support units receiving the Abrams, which are significantly heavier than the M60s and Brave Tigers. Various contractor logistics and other support services are part of the package, as well. The Stinger missile package, as its overall value would suggest, is significantly smaller, centered primarily on 250 FIM-92F missiles and 108 man-portable, shoulder-fired launchers, as well as various ancillary equipment and services. Also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), these weapons can only help bolster Taiwan’s short-range air defense capabilities . But again, it’s not clear if these weapons have the latest improvements found on American versions, including the improved ability to engage small unmanned aerial vehicles, another area where China has been making significant investments . US Marines fire a Stinger missile during an exercise., USMC Regardless, any U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are likely to draw protests from Chinese authorities, who do not recognize the Taiwanese government’s authority to conduct such business or otherwise engage in independent foreign affairs. The U.S. government itself recognizes Beijing as the government of China, though it reserves the right to sell Taiwan weapons and other military hardware ostensibly for defensive purposes until such time as the island’s final status has been formally agreed upon. As such, foreign military sales to Taiwan are done through the auspices of Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO), which functions as its unofficial embassy in Washington, D.C. The new proposed sales to Taiwan could be particularly sensitive, given that U.S. and Chinese authorities have just recently rebooted negotiations to try to find a way out of a bitter trade war that has led to painful tariffs on both sides and other tit-for-tat measures, including the arrests of notable Chinese and foreign nationals. It also comes at a time when tensions between authorities in Taipei and in Beijing have been steadily growing. In April 2019, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen threatened to “ forcibly expel ” any Chinese military aircraft that violated the de facto boundary separating the island from the mainland. More recently, Taiwanese authorities have offered rhetorical support for mass protests in Hong Kong over a new law that would weaken that semi-autonomous city’s judicial independence from the mainland. Tsai, who Chinese authorities have branded in the past as an “ independence extremist ,” has also developed a very close relationship with President Donald Trump and his administration, who have, in turn, increased naval patrols in the Taiwan Strait to the ire of China. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen., Kyodo News via AP All of this could help explain why what is perhaps the most important U.S. arms deal with Taiwan, the sale of the new F-16s, has yet to receive formal, public approval from the U.S. government. Reports that Taiwanese authorities were negotiating this purchase first emerged in March 2019. Negotiations were still reportedly ongoing as of July 3, 2019, according to a report from Foreign Policy . That same report said the goal was to get negotiations to the next step before Congress goes into recess in August, but did not say where in the process the discussions over the fighter jets were at present. The War Zone has covered Lockheed Martin’s Block 70 F-16s in detail in the past and suffice to say that they would give the Taiwanese Air Force a significant boost in capability . Taiwan is already in the process of upgrading its existing fleet of around 145 Block 20 F-16A/B Vipers to the near-identical F-16V standard, but this only came after long and arduous negotiations. Taiwan Air Force F-16s., Government of Taiwan Chinese authorities have made it clear that the sale of additional new fighter jets to Taiwan is a firm “ red line ” they find categorically unacceptable. So, if the U.S. government were to approve the Block 70 order, it’s not hard to see how it might scuttle U.S.-China trade negotiations, or worse. Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly threatened in recent years to use force to unseat Taiwan’s government if it appears to be moving closer to declaring the island an independent country. With that in mind, it remains possible that the Trump Administration has floated out the Block 70 deal as leverage in its own negotiations with Beijing, while offering the M1A2T tanks, Stinger missiles, and other hardware as a sort of consolation prize for Taiwan. There have also been discussions about alternatives options, such as leasing fighter jets to Taiwan, which might be less likely to provoke especially strong Chinese reactions. But even if Taiwanese authorities were aware of any such bargain, it could still serve as a bad precedent to treat a long-time regional partner in this way so publicly. It would very clearly show that the U.S. government is willing to negotiate away arms sales after otherwise agreeing to them in order to secure concessions from third parties. With the Trump Administration now in the midst of a renewed push to make a trade deal with China, it may not be too long before the fate of Taiwan’s Block 70 F-16 purchase becomes clear.

James Wallace and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",Confessions Of A C-2 Greyhound Carrier Onboard Delivery Pilot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s relatively tiny C-2 Greyhound community and the carrier onboard delivery (COD) mission was in the news last week for tragic reasons . A Greyhound flying out of Okinawa to the USS Ronald Reagan went down near the carrier, which was operating hundreds of miles from land. Amazingly eight of the 11 souls aboard survived and are in fine condition, but sadly three didn’t make it including one of the aircraft’s pilots . They were declared lost at sea after many hours of searching by US Navy and Japanese Navy assets. The fact is that the C-2 has a pretty impressive safety record, although according to one pilot who flew it in the 1980s, before the type was upgraded significantly it was anything but reliable and its critical mission lacked support, as well as appreciation, from the Navy. James Wallace came to fly the C-2 at what is now viewed as something of a golden era for Naval Aviation. It was the early 1980s and the Cold War was in full swing. The Reagan Administration was executing a new form of foreign policy and backstopping it with massive defense spending. Still, the C-2 community didn’t see much, or any, of this windfall according to Wallace, at least not early on. What he did experience was a neglected flying community infested with faulty officers and an airframe that was run-down and never really well prepared for its mission in the first place. And he almost paid for the aircraft’s chronic deficiencies with his life. But the unique carrier onboard delivery mission provided Wallace with an equally unique set of skills, namely how to operate on the fly from anywhere in the world with minimal support. He ended up turning these experiences, as well as his flight skills and his geology background, into a number of successful businesses, including Avior Technologies and Greystoke Leasing and Engineering, operating a wide number of aircraft in some of the toughest and most underdeveloped neighborhoods in the world. As James puts it: “I really attribute my success and ability to work in war zones to the resourcefulness I learned flying the POS COD and its goofy mission. It made it so I am completely unfazed when things go wrong, terribly wrong, in an aircraft. I now have five complete engine failures, glide to landings in my career.” James Wallace’s recollections remind us that the remodeled C-2s that are in need of replacement today are the product of some very tough lessons learned by those who flew their finicky and underpowered predecessors. It also underlines how critical the C-2’s mission still is , regardless of the amount of attention it gets. This is especially important considering the Navy controversial plan to replace the Greyhound with V-22 Ospreys. Here’s James’s story. USN Hitting the Greyhound track Flying in the Navy is truly a real adventure. Well it was for those of us that entered the service as refugees from the final days of the “draft lottery.” I ended up in NROTC at UCLA in the early ’70s and it was a joy. Everybody hated and shunned us. Well we finished up our degrees and most of us at UCLA got shunted off to the flight program. Being in those “tweener“ years before Regan took over, we got sent to Corpus Christi in the late ’70s to a flight program that was barely working. There we flew the last gasping T-28’s for our initial and intermediate flight training. We were supposed to transition to US-2B’s (the “Used To Be”) for our advanced flight training and carrier qualifications. The US-2B’s ended up being condemned just as we were being moved to the squadron. So in a fit of desperation the Navy got the T-44 for us to do advanced maritime multi-engine training. But there was one tiny problem—you can’t land a T-44 on the carrier. We only had two prop aircraft that routinely landed on the carrier at the time, the C-2 Greyhound and E-2 Hawkeye. Both were absurdly expensive to operate and unsuitable for initial training of “nuggets” in the carrier environment. So they dusted off some T-28C models from the boneyard at Davis Monthan AFB and gave them a fresh coat of paint. We qualified on the carrier in them and were last people to ever do single engine radials on a U.S. carrier. It was fairly useless training for us, as the radial single engine approach to landing on the carrier is a cut pass versus fly onto the deck pass. And we didn’t do catapult shots, we did deck runs for take off. However, it did carrier qualify us, but they would “enlighten” us later on at the RAG (replacement air group) on the proper way to do it. I received my orders out of Corpus Christi to VR-24 to fly the Super COD out of Sigonella, Sicily via the RAG RVAW-120, who flew E-2s. Well, if I ever had any ambitions to have a career in the Navy, it ended there. There was no “career path” for a Carrier Onboard Delivery pilot. This was immediately apparent when we got to the RAG, and were greeted with “oh, another COD puke.” We did our training in E-2C models, since the TE-2As were permanently un-serviceable, at least for the 11 months I was at the RAG. Courtesy of James Wallace Trust in COD The E-2 is an unusual aircraft to fly, aside from its unusual looks. It was unstable in two axes. That made it a handful to fly and a joy to land on the carrier. Little did we know, the C-2 was unstable in all axes. So much so that the prototype killed the two Grumman test pilots during spin testing. This led to a big warning in the NATOPS manual : “Do not enter a spin.” As if I was going to try it out for fun one day with a load of cargo. The C-2 and E-2 shared a common engine platform, the Allison T56 . A fine engine—lots of power instantly available. It ran at a constant speed with a variation of -6 to +3.5 RPM. The core runs a gearbox via a shaft. Which in turn runs a propeller that is actually regulating the engine speed via a whole host of systems. First off the propeller is a separate hydraulically actuated and electronically controlled unit. This is protected by an auto feather system, a negative torque system, a pitch lock system, and finally a decoupling device to separate the engine from the gearbox. Oh, this was a fun system to maintain, especially in the carrier environment. First off, the auto feather system would occasionally detect a power differential between the two engines via the Negative Torque System during a cat shot, leading to one of the engines feathering as you went down the cat track. You were usually at max gross weight when this happened making for a fun scramble to keep the aircraft flying and setting up for an air start when things settled down. The engine, if for whatever reason it chose, due to a low RPM situation, would automatically shut down at 94% since the bleed valves would open and it would stop generating power. The last fun failure was a pitch lock. This system was to keep the prop from over-speeding and would lock the props pitch setting at the last point it was operating at. This was our worst nightmare. If it happened at altitude, we would have what was in essence four giant speed brakes spinning on the wing, which would only get worse as we descended. This happened to one of our C-2’s at Barcelona, Spain. The aircraft was virtually un-controllable on landing, unless there was arresting gear on the field. Barcelona didn’t have it and this led to a rather famous quote from the pilot: “I knew we were in trouble when the main landing gear passed us by.” It had ripped off the nacelle after going off the runway over a ditch. Un-believably, they re-worked that aircraft and gave it back to us, 18 months later. The C-2, aside from being a paper napkin design born at a bar in Bethpage, New York was a very limited production aircraft. So much so that of the four we had one was the second prototype, still serving in the ’80s. It was 1,000lbs heavier and mostly in the aft section. It even had its own set of maintenance manuals. It flew very differently than the other three, making it challenging if you had not flown it for a while or were taking it on the boat. The C-2’s mission was very diverse and very critical to the Navy, which wasn’t reflected in how we were supported. The priority for logistical support is a hierarchy much like this: Pointy number one is fighters, then attack, then anti-submarine warfare (ASW), then electronic warfare (EW), then space aliens and pond slime and finally, oh yeah, the C-2 guys. We had the same engine family as the E-2 but we had 650 less horsepower per side and operated 4,000lbs heavier. So we had a non-standard bastard stepchild engine that gave us no end of problems, and they were old, real old. The aircraft had an auxiliary power unit (APU). Nice since the engines needed air for start. Well that APU only supplied air—no power, no hydraulics, just air. To make it worse, there wasn’t any associated plumbing. The crew had to plug a hose into the fuselage receptacle and run it to each engine in turn and plug the hose into the engine’s nacelle. Then un-plug it all roll it up and put it back in the airplane! What were they thinking!? We always carried four cartons of Marlboros in our secret compartment to help us obtain an air start cart at remote airports. The lousy APU was anything but reliable. Courtesy of James Wallace Unglamorous but essential The Navy needs the C-2 to actually fight a war. We had two critical missions—supply engines for the carrier’s air wing as replacements and carry nukes back to the boat when they wanted to have nukes on them. During war fighting, aircraft eat engines with foreign object debris (FOD) being the biggest problem. Apparently flying through the debris cloud caused by your attack on a ground target, or the randomly disintegrating aircraft you’re fighting against, doesn’t do much good for a jet engine. We would be tasked to deliver two to four engines a day during combat to keep the air wing operational. Then there was the other mission critical parts, the general stuff, from landing gear to rotor blades. We also had the capability to carry liquid oxygen (LOX) at 300 gallons a shot. This was a comical mission for us. We loaded on this huge skid mounted tank of LOX and we then connected its vent to on overboard vent. We had to wear parachutes when we flew with it onboard. Why? Who knows. If it failed in flight I suspect our first warning would have been the large explosion hurling aircraft bits and pieces of us in different directions. We also carried personnel in 24 aft facing seats—four abreast facing aft with two tiny windows for one row to look out of. These poor souls would get to experience either a cat shot in a dark tube or a fun ride down to an arrested landing, in the dark. Frequently, you would look at the passengers (pax) shambling out white faced as they unloaded (we called pax, “self loading cargo”). Our final and least critical mission, at least to the Navy, was carrying the mail. This was the most important to the ship’s crew and general morale. It was also fun for us as it made us modestly popular. Most of us sported USPS Letter Carrier patches on our flight suits. One of our aircraft even had a big sticker from a postal truck on the nose wheel door. The postal mission seemed to be so important to the ship’s captain that we could use it as leverage. We were usually detached moving around at will for 30 days at a time. We would operate from someplace convenient, hit the ship and go to someplace else to spend the night. They didn’t like us to stay onboard the ship as we were too big and took up too much deck space. We took the break after the F-4s and F-14s landed so we could load and parked right behind the jet blast deflector on cat 1. We launched right after the fighters. It was rare we would spend a night onboard unless the weather was bad or we had mechanical issues. So normally we would get to shore and bed the aircraft down at night and go off to search out some seedy hotel that would be covered by our meager per diem rate. Courtesy of James Wallace On the road chasing carriers Frequently we wouldn’t get to bed until 10:00pm. We didn’t have time for dinner, we had to launch at sunup to make our overhead time above the carrier, which was frequently 300 to 400 miles offshore. So we rarely got meals and depended on our box lunches supplied by the carrier. Well for whatever reason the air transfer officer (ATO) on the USS Independence thought this was some kind of joke (we hit virtually every carrier in the fleet, so rarely had any special relationship with one) and we got garbage in our box lunches. So after a few of these, “lunches” I took it up with the Air Boss. I explained that this was frequently our only meal of the day and my crew and I are living like gypsies with no support. So when I get back to, in this case Alexandria, Egypt, I am going to do a good walk around on the aircraft (I was the Airframes Division Officer). I will most likely write up around 80 gripes on this antique, whistling shitcan. So we will sit in Alexandria until somebody at the Smithsonian rounds up the parts and ships them to us so we can get back in the air. Then, maybe in a month or two, you will get your mail again! We got much better meals after that, in fact, superb meals. The C-2 had a large suite of comm gear, including a UHF—standard fare for carrier aircraft—a VHF Civilian com radio, and an HF with a 200 foot trailing wire. We would typically get our next day’s tasking via the HF from Air Services Coordination Mediterranean (ASCOMED) in Naples. We would vaguely know where the ship would be in 24 hours. They would give us a PIM—projected intended movement—the day before or occasionally we would get it from the local base or embassy in hard copy form. It was classified, so it was not transmitted via radio. Well the damn boat never went where they told us it would be. This was unnerving since we could not refuel in flight and only had so much range. We frequently went out to the ship without the possibility of return to shore unless we refueled on the boat. Well we would navigate out to the boat with an OMEGA system, a now defunct long-range navigation system. This would get us to the general vicinity of the boat. We would then use our advanced Bendix black & white weather radar in map mode to find what looked like the battle group—a bunch of blips clustered around a big blip. Sometimes, the E-2 would be kind to us and give us vectors, but the carrier frequently operated in ENCOM—no radio communications. It was a wonder we found them as frequently as we did. There were times I couldn’t locate the ship and I would transmit in the blind that we where turning back “with 4,000lbs of mail” and magically the E-2 or marshal controller onboard the carrier would answer us and give us vectors. The arrival of the COD means mail call for many sailors. , USN Our comm gear was one of the frequent failures. In Grumman’s infinite wisdom, they placed the VHF radios in the prop arc in a rack behind the cockpit. These were the same models used in the P-3 Orion. We really needed this radio, as we had to return to some civilian field someplace from Mombassa to Reykjavik. They tended to fail after the cat shot. So once, in my primate curiosity, I had the plane captain remove the box and bring it up to me in the cockpit. I was not going to try to get back to Athens NORDO (no radio). I took out my swiss army knife and opened the box and found all the transistors rattling around in the box. Cleverly these were all socket-mounted and would eventually rattle loose. At least they all seemed to be the same part number and I plugged them back in. Magically this worked and became a standard post-cat shot procedure. We did a lot of VIP flights. The Navy likes to do “dog and pony” shows for various bigwigs around the world. Normally, we had special seats for those flights. Special, being they where actually clean, not the normal hydraulic oil soaked ripped up POS’s we normally used. You see we would go from all passengers to all cargo between lifts and have to un-track all the seats, stack them up and strap them down, build up the cargo cage and set up for cargo. This didn’t do much for the condition of the seats. I have personally taken folks such as ministers of defense of UK to President Mubarak of Egypt to the boat, along with all their entourage. We hated VIP lifts. They were a huge opportunity to screw up something and provided little praise or benefit to us. One Air Force four star general took offense to my being so young, I was 23.5 years old and the plane commander. He wanted the much more seasoned older Lieutenant Commander, my co-pilot, to fly him out. I patiently explained that as a flag officer he can take command of the aircraft and do as he wishes. However the Lieutenant Commander here is not qualified to land this aircraft on the boat and I am feeling suddenly un-well and will stay ashore. My skipper commanded me to grow a beard to appear older. Note the eagle lifting the engine can. This was the C-2’s most important mission., Courtesy of James Wallace The “Elephant Graveyard” Our squadron, VR-24, was uniquely staffed and frequently referred to as the “Elephant Graveyard.” We had more commanders and lieutenant commanders than lieutenants. This was due to the following situation: If you screwed up someplace in the Navy but not enough to be kicked out, they sent you to us to get your 20 years in. We also had some contract re-enters to fill up the roster as well. The problem was we could never get a boat deck to do their quals (carrier qualifications). So we only had four plane commanders to staff up 4 aircraft. Not too bad since we could only ever keep three of the aircraft even remotely airworthy at a time. VR-24 also was unique in that it was a composite squadron. In addition to the C-2 we had a couple of C-1s (cargo variant of the S-2 Tracker), which were the last in the service and rarely went to the boat since there was no avgas on the boat. We also had T-39s (VIP Sabreliners jets), H-53Ds helicopters, and C-130s. So our squadron was actually several tiny squadrons in one. The upside down distribution of senior officers led to a situation in that they had no ground job, and were referred to as “team pilots.” In other words they were there simply for flying and had no division or department head jobs. We never took them seriously and they tended not to give us any trouble, they were there to retire. It just made it awkward on detachment since the senior plane commander commanded the detachment. We tended to have our usual crew which quickly became like family, just being the four of us for a month or two. Of course once one of the “elephants” had just joined the squadron, they didn’t get the relationship and would become offended when my crew would refer to me as “boss.” “He is a lieutenant in the US Navy” one of the new elephants shouted at my crewman, “you will call him SIR!”  “OK, Boss Sir, what’s the plan for today?” I did mention we had no illusions as to our future careers in the Navy. Courtesy of James Wallace Resorting to the “alternative supply system” Our supply problems were so bad that our flight equipment was typically in tatters. Our squadron never had spare flight suits, gloves, sunglasses , boots and so on. We would have to use the “alternative supply system” to get our gear. This would include snatching up stacks of “Star and Strips” and taking them down to some supply chief on the boat and trading them for what we needed. Frankly, we got quite a trading empire going to keep ourselves supplied. We would get whatever trade goods we could on shore—rugs, trinkets and such—to trade for gear—not booze, dear god we would go to prison for that. We would occasionally spirit one of our buds off the boat to spend the night onshore. This could have led to huge disciplinary issues if we had ever gotten caught. We were discrete. We were on the bottom of the carrier pecking order, which runs downhill from fighters. One of my buds from flight school who was flying pointy planes, once talked to me on the boat on one of our rare overnight stays. He asked if it wasn’t humiliating to be stuck in such a POS aircraft. I replied “yes it isn’t the most glamorous thing to fly, but I’m going back to shore today to have a beer and talk it over with some chick in the bar back in Scotland.” Not living on the boat was refreshing. I only had to do one four month deployment FLOATEX in the Indian Ocean. It was more or less a waste of time, since almost everyplace we could go was out of range. Once a week, the ship would steam over closer to Oman and we would fly over to Masirah, a small chunk of the moon that was offshore of Oman—not a single plant on that island. We would meet up with a C-141 and swap out whatever cargo and passengers we had. Mostly we bored holes in the sky. They launched us everyday to get us off the deck. We would fly around randomly picking up ships on our weather radar and photographing them for the intel boys. We also took a load of folk off the carrier so they could get the experience of a flying off the boat. We would let them cycle through the co-pilot seat to get a decent view. This was a big reward for the hard working enlisted guys on the boat. Courtesy of James Wallace Saved by Cyprus I had a large number of emergencies in the C-2, way more than any other aircraft I ever flew (76 different aircraft and helicopters by now). The aircraft were simply worn out, much like the fleet today. My most memorable and one I am very thankful to be alive from occurred off Beirut. It was my first flight as a plane commander. At the 90 on final to land on the boat, I got a fire warning light on the left engine. I really didn’t have time to do anything but just land, the boat’s firefighting detail could deal with it. I trapped, made a call “COD’s on fire” and caged everything and we evacuated. It turned out that a bleed air line had failed and the fire indicator was caused by hot air on the sensor. I was flying serial number 148148, the one unique C-2, it was the prototype and at that point 25 years old with nearly 50,000 hours on it. It was in a category beyond POS and started its life as an E-2. It was hacked and built into a C-2. I launched off the next morning, deadhead—no pax or cargo—since it was a transfer back to base to complete the rest of the checks after the emergency. The cat shot was the normal thrill ride and we were climbing really fast as we were very light. At around 15,000 feet I started to get an RPM TIT fluctuation on the left engine. I just happened to have the Allison tech representative on board, since he was going to check out the engines when we got back to shore. I said to myself, “oh fantastic, finally this engine is going to do it for him! Now perhaps he can finally see it and figure it out, once and for all.” He come up forward and studied the engine and we do some tests with the prop control by switching to mechanical and to the fuel control out of electronic trim. Then the rep says “now I know what it is, you better shut it down, it’s only going to get worse.” So we start to go through the precautionary engine shutdown procedure. A long list of switching things deliberately into the proper emergency configuration. Well we were down to the final item, fuel condition lever to shutdown-feather when the right engine fire warning started up. There were flashing lights all over the board and the fire bell going off, just not on the left engine! Don’t second guess the system. I pushed the power back up on the left engine and reached over and pulled the right ’T’ handle. As soon as I pulled it the engine exploded and the aircraft rolled 60 degrees to the right—not what I expected. I must have pushed the extinguisher button 20 times but we still had very healthy flames coming out of the panels on the right engine nacelle, showing no indication the extinguisher did anything. Well there is only so much you can do in the cockpit when things go to shit. I made my Mayday call on the radio with our position. The E-2 was vectoring folks to our position and kept us in sight. I did the last thing I could do when you’re burning, I pushed the nose over and ran it up to redline—350kts—in an attempt to blow the fire out by providing more oxygen than the fire could burn. It doesn’t work by the way. The air boss on the carrier was telling us to bail out, which if we had parachutes onboard that day we gladly would have. We normally didn’t carry them, passengers get so upset when you jump out and leave them behind. The C-2 had a beautiful bailout system. You pulled a handle and a section of the floor fell away, leaving a large hole to jump through—if you had a chute. We were all terrified, as any sane person would be. The air boss told us to ditch, since we could not land on the boat—the deck was fouled and it would take too long to clear it for our return (we were the only launch of the day). I told the boss “not an option, we all die.” So I told the crew as we were passing 5,000 feet “I can try to make Cyprus, we may not make it, but we aren’t going to make it ditching, you know that.” 148148 before its transformation from E-2 Hawkeye to C-2 Greyhound., San Diego Air And Space Museum We headed to Akrotiri, 126 miles away—the longest 126 miles of my life. We were loosing power on the other engine the entire way and descending. We ended up in ground effect on the final approach to the runway. My hat is forever off to the fire crew at RAF Akrotiri, it was their day off and they manned up by the time we got there. We did a landing—well kind of a landing—as I no longer had steering, just 12 applications of the brakes. We had no flaps and no arresting gear. I had to blow the landing gear down with the emergency air bottle as we were on emergency hydraulics. If I didn’t land there was no going around and I couldn’t get the gear back up anyways. I was fast and more or less in limited control of the situation. Ultimately, to stay on the runway I blew both main tires braking differentially. By the time we stopped there was nothing left of the right main and the other main was a burning rim. We all jumped out of the aircraft’s various hatches and ran from the burning hulk with the fire crew spraying us and the aircraft. I was running one way and one of the fire crew was running to the aircraft in a sliver suit. He had a giant asbestos blanket to wrap the burning main wheel and brake. They will blow up and red hot beryllium shrapnel shards will damage the fuel tank, which would make things so much worse. That firefighter had the biggest balls or the smallest brain of anybody I had seen to date. After it all settled down I was really shaking and strangely really, really needed to take a leak. So I told the officer in charge there on the runway that I really needed to pee and I think my crew needs a drink. “No problem lads, we have a bar right  here on the flight line, if you don’t mind warm beer!” We ended up there for a month. It seemed we stumbled or bumbled into a secret squirrel operation the black hat guys had going on with a U-2 and its flights over the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. We seemed to have stirred up the press’s interest by going over the beach at 25 feet with apparently a bit of flame coming out of the engine. We were so sorry for ruining their day and honestly would have gone someplace else, had we known. Actually, they threw us a party a couple days later and gave us their T shirts that said, “IF WE’RE NOT HERE, WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?” Even the spooks have a sense of humor. Since we where stuck there, we naturally had lots of time on our hands awaiting engines and gear and a bunch of parts. They couldn’t just drop the stuff off. We had to send messages up to the Brits, who would walk it over to CINAVEUR who would send it to the squadron. Then the stuff had to ship to England so they could transport it on a RAF aircraft to Akrotiri. It took forever. Well there was a junkyard of all the UN vehicles from Palestine—mine casualties and such. I drove a Land Rover Series III in Sicily. Well Land Rovers always need parts, so I scavenged a bunch of bits and pieces, including a gear shift lever. When we finally got back to Italy, my wife came to pick me up in the Land Rover. Well the gear shifter broke off while she was pulling into the parking lot. Some of the other pilots pushed her into the space and she came out to meet me on the flight line. She was not super happy about this and she greets me with the gear shifter in her hand. I reach in my parachute bag and pull out a new one.”See not a problem.” Which she replied “you knew it was going to break!” We actually fixed up 148148 well enough to fly it back to Sigonella in Italy after a month where it was completely repaired and soldiered on for a few more years until the next generation C-2s took over. I hope it is gracing a pole in front of some airport someplace. I still have a model of it on my shelf in my office. The NARF crew at NAS North Island while James was a test pilot there., Courtesy of James Wallace Reflecting back and looking towards the future When I got back, my skipper was proud of me, not dying and all. He told me he knew a lot of “really good pilots, but very few lucky pilots.” He said “you my boy are the luckiest one I know.” He ultimately got me my orders as the program manager and test pilot for the E-2 and C-2 at the Naval Air Rework Facility (NARF). He knew I had no intention of staying in the Navy and he told me that going in the Aviation Engineering Duty Officer route was a career dead end, but was the best possible job if you got out. It was, I ended up transferring my commission to NOAA and doing research flying for a few years. The NARF trained me to fly a whole host of aircraft and helicopters and under some pretty intense circumstances. Most fleet guys almost never get to do a field arrestment. I did one almost once, and even sometimes twice a week. I had one string of flights that I did one every day. The NARF at NAS Alameda did the prop controls for the P-3, E-2, C130 and such. There were four guys in the shop, the oldest one retired and I received a string of seven bad prop controls, with one aircraft getting two. I did a precautionary shutdown on one engine and was on approach for an arrestment. At about 50 feet the remaining engine flamed out when the RPM dropped below 94 percent. I hit hard, real hard, but luckily caught the wire. I blew both tires and fragged the mains. Fouled the runway for about eight hours that day while they hunted around for the special rigging to pick the airplane up with a crane. The crash crew loved me. In between NARF and NOAA I worked at Electrospace doing kind of the same thing I did at the NARF, but I was Special Mission Systems Program Manager, which paid a whole lot better. We built one-offs for various agencies and did the weird electronic warfare (EW) aircraft like refitting the A-3’s for jamming, special EW DC8s, Citations, Cheyennes and foreign aircraft like Super Mystères for South American customers. I took the job with NOAA—they sought me out—as they wanted a geologist and I was a safety school graduate who could fly anything they had. In the year before I got there they had 12 accidents with 18 pilots on staff! Well NOAA stands for No Organization At All. After 3 years, I left and started my own thing and never looked back. I became an owner operator of a host of aircraft and repair stations in some various unique places. I still look back to my COD puke days as the most fun a 20 year old could have, with a few moments of terror thrown in. The aircraft were horrible but the flying off of the boat and being left to our own devices all over the world was a hoot. We learned how to get into any country and deal with whatever we needed to on the ground without any support from anybody. We all worked on the aircraft together on detachment. We all loaded and worked like a tight little family. Rank had little meaning, we each had a job to do, did it and had fun. Ultimately, while at the NARF, I was able to give a lot of input on the successor COD. This included having bigger engines and we finally got the APU plumbed internally, thank god. It had a better navigation suite, new props (which gave better range), lift devices on the leading edge which gave it a gross weight increase along with smoother flight performance. We couldn’t make it pretty, it was still so ugly you had to preflight it in a mirror. If you looked at it directly you would turn to stone. I know for their peculiar reasons the Navy wants the V-22 Osprey to do the COD’s job now. I don’t see it. Engines were our primary hauling job and it simply can’t do it, the Osprey doesn’t have enough cargo volume in the cabin. We had H-53s in our squadron as an experiment to do our job and it couldn’t do it either. The H-53 is a fabulous machine to fly, I’ve flown both the H-53D and H-53E , they are smooth powerful helicopters, but they are simply even less reliable than the C-2 and don’t have the range required for the COD mission. We used to refer to our H-53s as “mobile palm trees” Since they would go out to a remote location, break down, and we would rig a parachute over the rotor blades for shade to work on it. They also looked like a palm tree from the air. A lot of different options have been suggested to work as C-2 replacements including the S-3 Fat Albert . It would work, but apparently it was far too expensive to re-engineer. It would have issues as well hauling the F-35’s engine. Our limit on engines was the J79 with an afterburner attached. We couldn’t take a full fuel load with one loaded onboard. Aside from that, the method we loaded it was ludicrous. It was skid mounted and we had to drag it onboard with a winch we had mounted in the floor. The winch frequently broke, leading to rigging a cable with a snatch block out the airstair door and using a tow tractor to drag it on. The military makes strange decisions. The COD replacement was chosen not by anybody with any experience in the COD community. No, it will be some guy with a lot of gold on his sleeve who probably flew pointy planes with lots of support people keeping him in the air. If he ever went someplace different, there was always cast of thousands keeping him flying. I do not think he or she has ever been in a sweaty, hydraulic oil stained flight suit on some remote airport, in some remote country, with a wrench in his hand helping get the moody POS back in the air. I feel for the poor crew of that recently lost C-2. I know their terror. I wished it had worked out better for them. At least the majority of the folks got out of it alive, which is kind of a miracle in itself. The folks up front likely didn’t fare as well. Best wishes to them. I have only respect for what they did and how little the Navy in general respected them or supported them. We were the little people that kept the big machine working. If we didn’t do our job it couldn’t do its—well not for long at least. USN Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com James Wallace and Tyler Rogoway Air C-2 Transports"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Army Asks To Shift Millions To Fast-Track “Hit-To-Kill” Armor-Busting Artillery Shell,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants to shift more than $24 million in funds from other parts of its budget to help fast track the development of a new 155mm anti-armor “hit-to-kill” artillery shell. Based on the M982 Excalibur GPS-enabled inertial navigation system-guided round, the projectile is the first step in a multi-phase effort to replace existing cluster munition artillery shells with new options that are more precise, effective, and reliable. Inside Defense was first to report the Army’s budget request on July 8, 2019. The $24.4 million the service wants for its artillery shell program, which is formally known as Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition (C-DAEM) Increment I, is part of a larger Pentagon proposal to Congress to shift $2.8 billion worth of funds allocated within certain portions of the 2018 Fiscal Year defense budget to other priorities. “Funds are required to support the demonstration of a long-range hit-to-kill (HTK) munition to address the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program’s Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition (C-DAEM) Increment I initiative,” according to the request, which Inside Defense obtained . The ERCA program, which The War Zone has covered in depth previously here and here , is working to develop new 155mm cannons for self-propelled and towed howitzers to extend the range of those weapons out to more than 40 miles. The reprogramming request describes the new round as using a modified version of the “airframe” from the combat-proven 155mm M982 Excalibur GPS-guided artillery shell. An “armored target seeker” will allow the projectile to home in moving armored vehicles, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, and self-propelled anti-aircraft and artillery pieces. It is not clear what guidance system shell might use, but millimeter wave radar, imaging infrared seekers, and laser guidance packages are popular options. It is possible that the round might use a multi-mode seeker , which would make it more flexible, adaptable to different combat environments, and resistant to enemy countermeasures, such as jamming. Multi-mode guidance packages are increasingly popular in both ground- and air-launched precision-guided munitions, such as Raytheon’s StormBreaker smart bomb for the U.S. Air Force, formerly known as Small Diameter Bomb II , in general, for exactly these reasons. Otherwise, the design of the shell is also still largely unknown. “ Hit-to-kill ” typically refers to rounds that hit their targets with sufficient force to destroy them without the help of an explosive charge. They may use an inert penetrator, typically made from dense metals such as tungsten or depleted uranium, to help pierce the armor on their targets. But it’s not clear whether the C-DAEM Increment I round will be a single “unitary” projectile or be a cluster munition round with multiple hit-to-kill submunitions inside. “The hit-to-kill effort: (1) upgrades the mature Excalibur airframe with an armored target seeker, (2) is the quickest solution to address four extremely high risk gaps by defeating moving and imprecisely located armored targets at long ranges, (3) is fully compatible with current Army howitzers, and (4) is low risk for compatibility with future howitzers,” the request says request. “Also, the effort will significantly reduce the cost per kill and improves the stowed kills of cannon artillery compared to existing non policy-compliant cluster munitions against medium and heavy armor.” This latter point refers to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates’ major policy shift in 2008 that called for systematically removing all cluster munitions from U.S. service that had an average failure rate of greater than one percent. This was driven by high failure rates among existing cluster munitions, including 155mm cluster munition artillery shells, also known as Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM). A typical 155mm DPICM round contains almost 90 individual submunitions, which are designed to work against both armored vehicles and soft targets, including personnel in the open. Unfortunately, DPICM rounds have a high failure rate, with one Army study from 2000 finding that, on average, 14 percent of submunitions failed to explode, leaving unexploded ordnance strewn across the battlefield that could be hazardous to both friendly forces and innocent civilians. The C-DAEM program, which dates back to at least 2017, has been exploring various potential replacement options for existing cluster munitions shells. However, in 2017, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan issued a memo indefinitely delaying the final removal of non-compliant cluster munitions, a controversial decision regarding an already controversial policy that The War Zone previously explored in detail . But the Army’s desire to accelerate the development of the Increment I shell shows that the service remains very interested in alternative ammunition types. It’s interesting to note that this would not be the first time the Army has adopted a precision-guided anti-armor artillery shell. Martin Marietta, now part of Lockheed Martin, developed the laser-guided M712 Copperhead in 1975, with the same general mission in mind. The Army, as well as the Marine Corps, had expected Copperhead to offer a more effective option for artillery units when engaging enemy armored formations on the move, even compared to cluster munitions. However, this would have been a complicated proposition given the need for personnel closer to the enemy to designate individual targets with a laser. During the initial stages of Operation Desert Storm in 1990, U.S. troops employed M712s primarily as a precision weapon against high priority static targets , such as radar stations and bunkers. U.S. forces only ever used Copperheads on a limited basis and a relatively small number of American allies and partners ever bought the rounds. In 2017, Lebanon did fire hundreds of the shells to significant effect against ISIS targets along the country’s border with Syria. While C-DAEM Increment I may still have laser-guided functionality, a millimeter wave radar and/or imaging infrared seeker would give it an important fire-and-forget capability that Copperhead lacked. This may help the shells be a more practical and efficient option for striking mobile opponents when their exact position is unknown, too. The request for the shift in funds is also partly in response to a separate request from U.S. Army Pacific to develop a “Multi-Domain Cannon Artillery” capability, which implies the precision-guided anti-armor round might have a shore-based anti-ship role in the future, too. The Army has already been exploring a variety of anti-ship capabilities, including ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and employing guided artillery rockets against maritime targets as it looks to improve its readiness for a high-end conflict in the Pacific region. The Marines have similar requirements and may be just as interested in the C-DAEM Increment one round as they were in the older M712. But if the new round is unitary, it remains to be seen whether using one shell to destroy or damage one target, on land or at sea, will be as cost-effective as the Army hopes. The shells will need to have some method of deconflicting themselves and not all homing in on the same target during massed fires to have any real chance of quickly destroying enemy armored formations, as well. Networking the rounds together might be one option to provide this capability. This is one of the reasons why cluster munitions have persisted in U.S. military service. These weapons remain valuable options for targeting large concentrations of enemy forces, including those on the move, particularly when they pop-up suddenly and might threaten to overwhelm lightly-defended friendly positions. The Army isn’t necessarily convinced that hit-to-kill shell will be the only new ammunition type they’ll need to fully replace DPICM, either. There is already plan for an Increment 2 round to engage clusters of lightly armored and stationary targets, as well as enemy personnel. In the past, the C-DAEM program had evaluated a number of cluster munition shells with “smart” bomblets that have multiple modes of operation and can sense targets, as well as unguided submunitions with greatly improved reliability. Praxis, an 155mm cluster munitions shell containing four smart submunitions, is just one of the rounds the Army has evaluated as part of the C-DAEM program., US Army At the same time, the service has made it clear it is focusing on the Increment I design first because it is lower risk, given that will leverages much of the existing M982 Excalibur design. If Congress approves the cash infusion into the program, Army artillery units could be looking to recieve the first of what might become a family of new artillery rounds sooner rather than later.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 19, 2019",Marines Moving To Composite Hornet Squadrons Made Up Of F/A-18Ds And F/A-18Cs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Single-seat F/A-18C Hornets have started appearing in Marine all-weather strike fighter squadrons, designated VMFA(AW)s, which have traditionally been equipped with two-seat F/A-18Ds. It hasn’t been made clear exactly what is going on with what is truly an odd sight for military aviation aficionados to see—single-seat Hornets flying with the designations and motifs of famed two-seat VMFA(AW) squadrons. The War Zone w as just as curious as anyone about the peculiar arrangement, although we had a good idea of how and why it came to be. But still, the move, if permanent, is a major one for the USMC and its four VMFA(AW) squadrons, so we reached out to the Corps to get the bottom line on just how extensive and long-lasting the new squadron structure may be. The information we received from our inquiry describes a far more widespread metamorphosis that is happening across the entire Marine Corps’ Hornet enterprise. Before we get to that, we need to make it clear that the two-seat Hornets in VMFA(AW) units are not trainers, they are fully missionized with their rear cockpits outfitted with interfaces and tactical displays for dedicated Weapon Systems Officers (WSOs) to use. Historically speaking, these unique squadrons, which are exclusively land-based, have taken on more complex missions, including the Forward Air Control (Airborne) role, as well as the tactical reconnaissance mission. The latter of which involves using the small number of specially modified F/A-18Ds—a dozen in total, three serving in each VMFA(AW) squadron—equipped with the Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System (ATARS) in their noses. An ATARS equipped F/A-18D. , Cpl Terry Haynes The Marines’ four VMFA(AW) units can still perform more traditional Hornet strike fighter missions, as well, and all weather deep strike is clearly also a part of their repertoire. Now, as the Navy divests much of its Legacy Hornet inventory, the USMC is getting an influx of very badly needed fresher F/A-18C airframes. This is a great thing for the Corps, but it has to be somewhat bittersweet for the VMFA(AW) squadrons who will no longer live by the long-standing two crew concept of operations that dates back half a century to early Marine A-6 Intruder operations. Yet the changes as a result of this shuffling of assets aren’t as simple as swapping out tired single-seat Hornets for less worn single-seat Hornets, or even porting over a single-seat Hornet to a VMFA(AW) squadron temporarily due to fleet management requirements, which has occasionally occurred with non-deployed units in the past. Here is what Captain Christopher Harrison, a Communications Strategy Officer for the Marine Corps Communications Directorate, shared with us about the changes to the aircraft inventories of VMFA(AW) squadrons: “As the F/A-18 nears the end of its service life, the number of F/A-18Ds available in its inventory will start to equal the number of F/A-18Cs. Known as F/A-18 composite squadrons, Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) commanders began placing F/A-18Cs in VMFA(AW) squadrons while at the same time introducing F/A-18Ds into VMFA squadrons. A mix of F/A-18Cs and F/A-18Ds provides the MAG with increased flexibility in resourcing squadrons while simultaneously spreading the more proficient mission skills associated with two-seat cockpits, such as an airborne forward air controller (FAC(A)), to more squadrons. The F/A-18 community is comparable in readiness to the AV-8B community, and the materiel condition of the F/A-18D fleet is nearly the same as the F/A-18C fleet.  However, as the Marine Corps progresses through the next decade, it will have a larger pool of low-flight-hour F/A-18Cs from the Navy as the F/A-18D reaches the end of its service life sooner. The Marine Corps is not prioritizing F-35B/C replacement of the F/A-18D (or F/A-18C) over the AV-8B.  In accordance with the 2019 Marine Corps Aviation Plan, we are replacing both F/A-18 and AV-8B squadrons concurrently, alternating back and forth between platforms over the next decade until the last AV-8B squadron transitions in Fiscal Year (FY) 2027 and the last F/A-18 squadron transitions in FY 2030.  In any case, the F/A-18 will remain the primary TacAir bridging platform to the F-35B/C throughout this transition.” VMFA(AW)-225 “Vikings” F/A-18D. , Lance Cpl. Clare J. McIntire There is some big news in that statement. First off, the very idea of VMFA(AW) squadrons seems to be heading toward its demise within USMC as single-seat VMFA squadrons are also getting some F/A-18Ds redistributed to them as the fleet is consolidated. In addition, Captain Harrison adds further evidence to the notion that there is no prioritization for replacing either the Harrier or the Hornet first with new F-35s. It had been reported that the USMC would focus on replacing its aging Hornets before its AV-8B Harriers as the Harrier fleet had better longevity and readiness, not to mention the dozens of surplus Royal Air Force Harriers that the USMC bought for a laughably low sum largely as a spare parts bin. The Navy’s move to buy more Super Hornets and divest the majority of its Legacy Hornet fleet has either upended this initiative or it hasn’t ever been the plan to replace one type over the other, at least not in the last few years. The only thing we don’t know is where this leaves the USMC’s tactical jet Weapons Systems Officers that have been a huge part of the VMFA(AW) community for decades. Will the Marines wind down that position entirely, putting pilots in both seats of F/A-18Ds as they get dispersed throughout the Marine Hornet community, or will they continue field WSOs, with each squadron with D models getting a number of them on hand? VMFA(AW)-224 ‘Bengals’ F/A-18Ds depart in formation., A1C Joshua P. Strang, USAF We will reach out again to the USMC to try and clear this up, but regardless, it seems abundantly clear now that Marine Hornet squadrons are going to look increasingly diverse with single and two-seat models on-hand as time goes on. And we have to stress that the Legacy Hornet has many years of service ahead of it with the USMC, with current plans putting its out of service date around 2030. 98 of these aircraft are being deeply upgraded with new Active Electronically Scanned Array radars, along with other modifications , which will provide a huge leap in capabilities . It remains unclear if any of the F/A-18D fleet will be part of this upgrade, but having two crew available to work the new radar set—which can operate in multiple modes, such as air-to-air and air-to-ground, at the same time—is a big advantage. So, even though it may be sad to see the unique identity of VMFA(AW) squadrons fade, the Marines’ plan to squeeze the most out of the last of the Pentagon’s front-line Hornets is pretty exciting.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2019",Norwegian Tanker That Was Victim Of Purported Iranian Attack Is Now Headed For Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a curious twist of events, the Norwegian-flagged Andrea Victory , one of four oil tankers the U.S. government says were victims of attacks by Iranian forces or their proxies in the Gulf of Oman in May, is now on its way to complete delivery of its cargo to Iran . In the Mediterranean, there also continue to be confusing and conflicting claims surrounding Grace 1 , an Iranian tanker reportedly bound for Syria that British security forces seized last week off the coast of Gibraltar, which Iranian authorities now say was going “somewhere else.” TankerTrackers.com was among the first to notice on July 6, 2019, that Andrea Victory had taken her cargo back on board and was signaling that she would be taking a route to Iran’s Bandar Imam Khomeini port at the northern tip of the Persian Gulf. Bloomberg and Refinitiv Energy have since confirmed Andrea Victory ‘s final destination as Bandar Imam Khomeini. The tanker had offloaded her cargo of vegetable oil, which she had originally picked up in Argentina, following a still nebulous attack on May 12, 2019 , in the Gulf of Oman near the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. That left the ship with a hole in her empty aft peak tank, which required it to go into dry dock for repairs. Nearly two months later, no group has publicly taken responsibility for the attack on Andrea Victory or any of the three other tankers that also suffered damage off the coast of Fujairah in that incident. The United States has blamed Iran or proxies for carrying out the attacks, as well as subsequent attacks on two more tankers in a part of the Gulf of Oman closer to Iran in June 2019 . Iran has strenuously denied involvement in either of these incidents. “Suspicious doesn’t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said regarding the second set of attacks in June. The revelation that Andrea Victory ‘s final destination was Iran is likely to fuel this narrative that some other party may have staged these tanker attacks in order to provoke a confrontation with the Iranian regime. However, so far, there is no hard evidence to support this theory, while there are significant indications that Iran was at least involved in some way in the June attacks. It is equally possible that Iranian forces or their proxies had targeted Andrea Victory in the May incident to help cast doubt on the country’s involvement or that they simply struck tankers at random. In May 2019, Reuters had also reported that the Norwegian Shipowners’ Mutual War Risks Insurance Association, also known by the Norwegian acronym DNK, had concluded that it was “ highly likely ” that Iran or its proxies were responsible for the attack on the tankers off Fujairah. DNK reportedly made its assessment based, in part, on similarities between what had happened to Andrea Victory and attacks that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had launched on commercial and military ships using unmanned, explosive-laden boats . But it remains unclear what the exact weapons employed in the May attacks were and whether they included limpet mines, as appears to have been the case in the second set of tanker attacks a month later. In the Mediterranean Sea, the details surrounding the U.K. government’s seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar on July 4, 2019, along with what its final destination was, are also increasingly murky. The United Kingdom says that it conducted the operation since the ship was bound for Syria’s Baniyas Refinery in that country’s port city of Tartus. Baniyas is the target of European Union sanctions against the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. At the time of Grace 1 ‘s seizure, government-run and semi-official news outlets in Iran did not dispute the ship was heading for Syria. A screen capture from an infrared video camera showing a Royal Navy AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopter, at left, hovering over Grace 1 ‘s deck on July 4, 2019, as Royal Marines rappel onto the ship., Crown Copyright “Its destination was somewhere else,” Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister, told reporters on July 7, 2019, without saying where it was purportedly headed. “The port named in Syria does not even have the capacity for such a supertanker to dock.” Araghchi is right that Baniyas does not have the facilities necessary for Grace 1 to dock, but this would not prevent it from conducting a ship-to-ship transfer to a vessel that would then offload the oil on shore. If the tanker was not bound for Syria, it’s also unclear where else it would be heading given its circuitous route. By Iran’s own admission , the ship sailed all the way around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope specifically to get into the Mediterranean, reportedly because Grace 1 ‘s draft when fully loaded made it impossible to sail through the Suez Canal. In April 2019, there had also been reports that Egypt, which controls the canal, had blocked access to Iranian tankers heading to Syria. Iran has denied that the tanker made this long voyage in order to somehow escape scrutiny. If Grace 1 wasn’t going to Syria, its presence in the Mediterranean Sea would point toward a destination either in Southern Europe or North Africa. The countries in these regions are predominantly U.S. allies and partners, which might point to potential cracks in the maximum pressure campaign. By most accounts, this isn’t the case, though. For instance, Greece and Italy reportedly stopped buying Iranian oil in November 2018 and Turkey followed suit in May 2019 . But even if Baniyas was actually the tanker’s final destination, it brings up additional legal questions regarding the seizure. The E.U., as a matter of principle, does not apply its sanctions to non-members. In addition, Spanish authorities had initially said that the United Kingdom conducted the raid at the behest of the United States, something that U.K. officials have denied. On July 6, 2019, CNN producer Hamdi Alkhshali also reported that the United Kingdom had seized the ship in part because of reports that it was or had been carrying unspecified weapons, which Iran subsequently denied. In May 2019, the United States did say it had received intelligence that purportedly indicated Iran might have been loading or installing missiles of some type on civilian ships, but so far no hard evidence has publicly emerged to corroborate this. A senior Iranian official has also now threatened to seize a British tanker in retaliation over the seizure of the Grace 1 . All of this comes as the United States continues to increase economic and political pressure on the regime in Tehran to try to force it to abandon its controversial nuclear program and halt other malign behavior in the region. A central part of this policy of “ maximum pressure ” has been American sanctions against all of Iran’s lucrative exports of oil and refined petroleum products and the U.S. government’s efforts to get its allies and partners to also abide by those restrictions. Iran has responded defiantly to those efforts and tensions between it and the United States have been steadily ramping up in recent weeks. This came to a climax in June when Iranian forces shot down a U.S. Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman, which almost led to U.S. military strikes against targets in Iran . Though both countries have now taken a step back, there are reports that the U.S. government is working to build a new international coalition that would be responsible for escorting commercial shipping near Iran and otherwise stepping up monitoring of Iranian forces and their proxies in the region. Separately, the regime in Tehran, along with the International Atomic Energy Agency, has confirmed that it has begun enriching uranium above the level set out in the controversial international deal over its nuclear program after it accused the United Kingdom, France, and Germany of failing to uphold their end of the agreement. The United States pulled out of the deal completely in 2018. Critics say that the enrichment activities put Iran closer to a “ breakout capability ” to build a nuclear weapon, if the country were to decide to do so. At the same time, Iranian officials appear to be enriching at a still relatively low level with an eye toward pressuring the European parties to the Iran Deal to make concessions or otherwise further drive a wedge between them and the United States. Though no longer party to the Iran Deal, the United States has still said Iran’s decision to increase uranium enrichment will only lead to more American sanctions and efforts to isolate the country politically and economically. It seems likely that maritime shipping to and from Iran will be under increasing scrutiny in the near future as the maximum pressure campaign, and Iran’s responses to it, continue to escalate.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35 Heritage Flight team has been zipping around the U.S. as air show season continues. On August 18th, the team gave the masses arrayed along Chicago’s picturesque waterfront one hell of a show. And considering it was a remote show over water, and that the air off Lake Michigan was nice and moist, full vape cones and capes were in effect. The Joint Strike Fighter in particular has proven to be quite adept at manifesting such atmospheric effects, a fact that was captured wonderfully by Airman 1st Class Alexander Cook. Airman Cook seems to know how to go the extra mile to capture the F-35 to the max. This is not as easy as it sounds, just finding unique angles and positions to shoot the aircraft, yet alone at an air show, takes creativity and hard work. In this case, he nailed it, setting up along the coast atop one of Chicago’s many high-rise buildings.

This is not accurate at all. Although these effects can be greatly intensified as an aircraft reaches transonic speeds (approaching the speed of sound), they can also manifest themselves in various ways at far lower speeds. The phenomenon is caused by low pressure areas created on the aircraft’s skin and wings as it moves through moist air. As the pressure drops so does the temperature, and if the temperature reaches the saturation point, water vapor is created. Such conditions are highly sought-after by aviation photographers. I have chased these conditions for years in order to execute certain photos. They are also a reason why it’s worth getting excited about an air show that may not feature perfectly blue skies or even dry conditions. Some aircraft create vapor in more exotic ways than other due to their shape and their performance envelope. The F-22 is notorious for its uncanny ability to create crazy vapor effects even at slow speed and in relatively dry conditions. The F-15 is known for its streamers and its thick vape-capes that propagate along the top of the aircraft’s lifting-body fuselage. Hornets and Super Hornets make great shock cones, and so on and so forth. You can check out the F-35A Heritage Flight team for yourself at a couple of shows that are still left in the season, here’s their schedule . As the show season winds down and the weather turns you will have a better chance of seeing atmospheric effects like the ones caught in Chicago, as well.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It may take more than 15 years for workers to completely scrap the now-decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Enterprise , but the Navy is already recycling parts and raw materials from the ship. Components from “Big E” are already on certain Nimitz -class carriers and more could find their way onto new Ford -class carriers, including a future flattop that will also carry the name Enterprise . Defense One ‘s Marcus Weisgerber and Brad Peniston got the details on how the former Enterprise will continue serving the Navy during a visit to Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia on May 1, 2019. The one-of-a-kind ship, the first ever nuclear aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, has been at the shipyard since 2013. The flattop had first entered service in 1961 and the Navy finally decommissioned her officially in 2017. “She’s a unique [nuclear reactor] plant,” Chris Miner, Vice President of In-Service Carriers at Newport News, told Defense One . “But there’s still other things that are essentially very similar that we can leverage off of.” When Newport News designed Enterprise in the 1950s, no one had ever built a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier before, so engineers had looked back to previous flattops that used multiple oil-fired boilers to drive the steam turbines that powered the ship, according to Defense One . But instead of boilers, they substituted eight relatively small nuclear reactors on Big E, two for each of its four propeller shafts. The subsequent Nimitz – and Ford -class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, all of which Newport News has built, feature two larger nuclear reactors to provide the immense amount of power required for a modern supercarrier. USS Enterprise at Newport News Shipbuilding in 2016 undergoing an initial process ahead of her formal decommissioning., Steve Helber/AP The complexities of Enterprise ‘s dated and unique reactor plant design, coupled with the fact that no one has ever had to dismantle a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier before, has created a serious debate about how the service should proceed. The entire process of breaking down the ship and properly disposing of its reactors could take up to 15 years to complete and cost more than $1.5 billion, depending on what course of action the Navy chooses. You can read more about these particular issues in detail here . As the Navy continues to consider its options, Newport News has already been stripping off parts of the ship to reuse and recycle. “We are harvesting as many parts as we can from the Enterprise … She’s still giving back even today,” Miner said to Defense One ‘s reporters during their tour. One of Enterprise ‘s massive anchors is already installed onboard the Nimitz -class USS Abraham Lincoln . It’s not clear when this swap occurred, but Lincoln finished a major four-year rehab process, officially known as a Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), in May 2017, three months after Big E’s decommissioning. We don’t know whether the Enterprise uses the exact same anchor design as the Nimitz -class carriers did, at least initially, which weigh around 60,000 pounds each. The chains that hold the anchor, 12 of them in total, add another 20,500 pounds, but it’s not clear if Lincoln got those from Enterprise , too. One of the USS Nimitz ‘s two anchors., USN Regardless of the exact design, aircraft carrier anchors do not appear to have changed much since even before Enterprise entered service. As of 2003, the Nimitz -class USS Harry S. Truman was using the anchors from the conventionally powered first-in-class USS Forrestal , which the Navy had decommissioned in 1993. Lincoln also received components from Enterprise ‘s steam-powered catapults . Other catapult parts are now going into the Nimitz -class USS George Washington , which is presently at Newport News and is in the middle of its own RCOH . The Navy has also taken back Enterprise ‘s four 32-ton propellers , each of which has five blades. Newport News told Defense One that the Navy would refurbish and possibly use them again. The new Ford -class carriers do use a 30-ton five-bladed design . It is also possible that the screws could end up on display. Three of USS Enterprise ‘s four screws are visible in this photograph from underneath the ship while it was in drydock circa 1985., USN Lastly, Newport News has already melted down steel from Enterprise ‘s hull to use in the keel of the future Ford -class carrier that will carry the same name. Commemorating old ships, or other notable objects, by incorporating them into the construction of new vessels is not without precedent. Most notably, the hull of the USS New York , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock amphibious ship, includes steel that workers salvaged fallen World Trade Center towers in New York City, New York, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2002, the Navy had approved the naming of the ship after the state of New York following a special request from then-Governor of New York George Pataki. It seems likely that in the coming years, more components, and potentially additional raw materials, will make their way from Enterprise onto either existing Nimitz -class carriers or future Ford -class ones. The Navy expects the future Ford -class USS Enterprise to enter service in 2027. If nothing else, there’s more than 60,000 tons of steel and another 1,500 tons of aluminum in the decommissioned carrier that could be salvageable. “I think it goes to how well the material on these ships are designed and built,” Newport News’ Miner told Defense One in reference to the ability to recover useful parts and materials from Enterprise on new carriers. But whatever else happens, Big E is still finding ways to serve the Navy two years after its formal decommissioning.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 13, 2019",The Puzzling Case Of The Navy’s Attempt To Retire Supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman Early,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is reportedly planning to at least delay a major overhaul and refueling of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman , a decision that would force the ship into early retirement. Congress is almost certain to prevent this from ever occurring and it also flies in the face of the service’s own repeated complaints of a carrier “gap.” This calls into question whether this entire plan, if it is even a real proposal, might actually be an effort to get legislators to approve additional funding, not less, for various programs. The Washington Post was first to report the proposed course of action, but without naming the specific Nimitz -class carrier, on Feb. 26, 2019. Breaking Defense subsequently reported that the ship in question was the Truman and obtained more specifics about the plan on Feb. 27, 2019. Foreign Policy and USNI News both laid out additional information about the proposal in stories on Mar. 1, 2019. What’s the plan? The Post said that canceling the carrier’s mid-life rehab process , known formally within the Navy as a Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), could free up as much as $4 billion dollars for other priorities. USNI News subsequently reported that the total amount was $5.5 billion, but that there had only ever been around $16.9 million in the upcoming Fiscal Year 2020 budget request. Breaking Defense noted that the full savings over time could be up to $30 billion, taking into account an operating cost for Truman of around $1 billion per year through its planned retirement date in 2048. So far, the Pentagon and the Navy have both declined to comment on the record about the scope of the proposal, how much money it would make available for spending elsewhere, and when. Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who resigned in December 2018 , had first proposed the plan to the Navy in exchange for approving a block buy of two new Gerald R. Ford -class aircraft carriers at once, according to Foreign Policy . Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who is now Acting Secretary of Defense, reportedly supported the decision initially and has not reversed it. The Pentagon, under Shanahan, signed off on the block buy in January 2019 . The RCOH for Truman would involve major renovations and modernization of the ship, as well as replacing the fuel in its nuclear reactors. Under the existing plan, the carrier was supposed to enter Newport News Shipbuilding’s shipyard in Virginia in 2024 and return to the fleet in 2028. If the Navy gets approval to axe Truman ’s RCOH, it would have to decommission the ship decades earlier, likely sometime in the mid-2020s. The exact date would be largely be up to how fast the existing fuel in the carrier’s reactors runs down. The USS Harry S. Truman sails in the Atlantic Ocean in December 2018., USN What’s the issue? The service faces immediate legislative obstacles. Congress has enshrined in law a requirement for the U.S. Navy to have at least 11 carriers in service at any time. The service meets this demand at present by counting the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford along with the ten Nimitz -class ships. The Navy plans to commission the next Ford -class carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy , in 2024. Depending on when Truman would end up forced to leave service, the Navy could find itself in real danger of breaking the law. Ford herself has been beset by numerous difficulties and delays that might only increase this risk. But “the Truman is only about 25 years old which in [terms of] an aircraft carrier is actually pretty young,” Representative Joe Courtney, a Democrat from Connecticut and is in charge of the House Armed Services Committee’s Seapower Subcommittee, told Defense News on Feb. 28, 2019. “So, we just approved a two-carrier block buy in September. So, to do that and then reduce the size of the carrier fleet seems like a contradictory policy, as far as I’m concerned.” To be fair, Ford is still some time away from being combat capable, meaning that the Navy realistically has less than 11 carriers already. This has been the case since 2012, when the service inactivated Enterprise and began preparing her for decommissioning . But in terms of operational requirements and policy, the Navy and Congress have been in agreement that even 11 carriers aren’t enough. “We’re an 11-carrier Navy in a 15-carrier world,” Randy Forbes, then a Representative for Virginia, said in 2014 . The year before, U.S. Navy Admiral Samuel Locklear, then in command of U.S. Pacific Command, told legislators the he couldn’t meet his regional requirements with only 11 carriers available. In 2016, the Navy determined that this was the optimal number was 12 and Congress made this a formal policy goal in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2019 Fiscal Year. Lawmakers stopped short of making it a legal requirement. President Donald Trump has, at least in the past, also endorsed this idea , which is part of a larger, long-standing Navy push to increase the overall size of its combat fleets to 355 ships in total . The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN Do we need this many carriers? Historically, the reasoning for having a dozen carriers has been to maintain a constant naval aviation presence in the Western Pacific , the Atlantic or the Mediterranean , and the Persian Gulf , as well as having another ship forward-deployed in Japan . Theoretically, with 12 flattops in total, the Navy could have four ships deployed in each one of those locations, another four preparing or heading out to relieve them, and four undergoing maintenance and other post-deployment activities, thought it has generally not worked out this way for a variety of reasons . The extra ships also provide for a surge capability in the event that it is necessary to sortie additional carriers. Still, freeing up $1 billion a year for the next three decades or so, could give the Navy space to invest in other priorities. Just in the last year or so, when it comes to ships, the service has initiated plans to buy a new class of frigates , begun developing an all-new Large Surface Combatant , discussed adding two new classes of submarines onto of the new Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines, and begun laying the groundwork for growing the fleets of unmanned surface and underwater vehicles . An artist’s rendition of the future first-in-class ballistic missile submarine USS Columbia ., USN This doesn’t take into account a host of other modernization efforts underway, including developing or otherwise buying new missiles to its surface ships and submarines, including hypersonic types , as well as buying advanced manned and unmanned aircraft, including the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter and the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone. On Feb. 28, 2019 , the Navy declared it head reached Initial Operational Capability with the F-35C, marking the beginning of actually deploying operational squadrons with the type and paving the way for larger purchases of the aircraft. The Navy is also still struggling to reverse serious personnel shortages , which a major issue that could require additional funding to fix through monetary incentives and other initiatives. Furthermore, Mattis and Shanahan reportedly questioned the long-term viability of the aircraft carrier as a basic concept, according to Foreign Policy . Critics have contended for years that potential adversaries, such as Russia and China, will only continue to develop increasingly advanced weapons, especially anti-ship missiles and submarines , which could eventually render the aircraft carrier obsolete in high-end conflicts. China’s DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile, which reportedly has an anti-ship capability. Chinese media has dubbed it the “carrier killer” and it is one of the weapons that critics of carriers in general often point to as in support of their argument., Imaginechina via AP But the Navy remains unmoved by these assertions, even after apparently accepting the Pentagon’s terms, which still resulted in them getting approval to buy two new aircraft carriers. The service sees these ships as a key part of its future plans and routinely complains about a growing carrier “gap.” This has led the Navy to develop and implement a series of new deployment models to try and meet its continuing demands with fewer ships. There has even been talk of extending the life of the USS Nimitz to help get to the 12 carrier fleet goal. The Navy also briefly considered reactivating the conventionally-powered USS Kitty Hawk for the same reason. All this, among other things, appears to be was what Courtney was referring to when he rightly said the decision to cancel Truman ’s RCOH seemed “contradictory.” But this contradiction may be entirely by design. So, what’s going on? By all indications, Pentagon’s upcoming budget proposal for the 2020 Fiscal Year, including the individual requests from the different services, is set to be smaller overall than it was for Fiscal Year 2019. Congress, of course, will get the final say and, by agreeing to the Pentagon’s conditions to get the new Fords , the Navy seems to have placed legislators in the uncomfortable position of either allowing the plan for Truman to go ahead or finding more money in the budget. Lawmakers similarly rejected a plan that President Barack Obama’s administration first proposed in 2014 to retire the Nimitz -class carrier USS George Washington early. At that the time, the argument was also about the need to trim the defense budget. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 had built upon the Budget Control Act of 2011, putting even more severe caps in place on defense spending as part of a process known as sequestration . The Pentagon described things such as decommissioning George Washington ahead of schedule as the necessary “hard choices” that had to get made to meet the letter of the law. The comments from the unnamed Pentagon staffers who first revealed the new plan to send Truman into mothballs early to The Washington Post seem to fit a similar argument, even though the U.S. government is not longer hamstrung by a sequester. Cutting Truman’s RCOH is another “hard choice” that Mattis and Shanahan, no matter their apparent objections to the carrier in general, would have had to have known would face extreme opposition in Congress. Legislators were apparently largely unaware that this “deal” existed until the Post reported it, according to subsequent reports. The Nimitz -class carrier USS George Washington ., USN “Hard choices” Congress is now staring at a limited number of options if the Navy does decide to include the measure in its upcoming budget request. Legislators can accept Truman ’s early retirement, they could look into deferring or modify the Ford block buy, or they could pass a final budget that includes both. Making any changes to the Ford block buy contract, which the Navy signed in January 2019 , could result in costly penalties or otherwise be prohibitively difficult to manage depending on how the deal is structured. Separately, Seapower Subcommittee head Courtney has already indicated he has no intention of even entertaining the idea of cutting a Nimitz -class carrier until the next budget cycle. “This is really a 2021 issue in terms of timing, when the Truman has to go into its refueling,” Courtney said to Defense News . “So, I think in terms of it getting any endorsement in the Seapower mark this year I think is zero.” Representative Joe Courtney, right, walks with then Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert during a visit to the Electric Boat Shipyard in Connecticut in 2012., AP Photo/The Day, Dana Jensen “We have made a significant investment in these ships,” Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican who is also the ranking GOP member on the Seapower Subcommittee and a leading proponent of a 355-ship Navy , told The Virginian-Pilot . “I am perplexed why anyone would consider taking the cornerstone of the United States naval force and allowing it to atrophy.” A lack of endorsement from the Seapower Subcommittee wouldn’t automatically prevent legislators from still approving the Navy’s plan for Truman , but it would make it highly unlikely to make it into the 2020 Fiscal Year defense spending bill. The Ford block buy has also enjoyed considerable support on Capitol Hill. Virginia Representative Rob Wittman., Dave Ellis/The Free Lance-Star via AP The industrial base In addition, there are concerns that even delaying the construction of new carriers could set back getting them into service, if not make it difficult to build them at all in the future. Shipbuilding is an inherently long-lead time affair and carriers especially so given their size and complexity. Changing the schedule for building new Fords could prompt Newport News Shipbuilding to lay off hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled workers and cut back on buying various materials and equipment in the interim. If that happened, it would be time-consuming and expensive to rehire that workforce and reestablish the required supply chains, which would lead to cost increases with the ships, which have already seen significant cost overruns . Newport News has warned that there could be some risks of this happening just from canceling the Truman ’s RCOH. The delay in the start of George Washington ‘s rehab led the shipbuilder cut around 1,200 jobs even though it went ahead in the end. It’s also worth noting that this one shipyard has been responsible for building every one of the Navy’s nuclear-powered supercarriers. The future USS John F. Kennedy under construction at Newport News Shipbuilding’s shipyard in Virginia in September 2018., Rob Ostermaier/The Daily Press via AP A RCOH is “an extremely complex engineering and construction project which involves more than 680 suppliers from 40 states providing material and services critical to the overhaul process,” Beci Brenton, a spokesperson for Huntington Ingalls Industries, Newport News’ parent company, said in a statement to The Virginian-Pilot . “The stability of this industrial base is critical to our ability to continue to build and maintain the Navy fleet our Navy and nation needs.” The deliberate mention of 40 states having vested financial interests in Truman getting her rehab as scheduled only further points to the broad political forces that will likely be opposed to scrapping that plan. Legislators from Virginia, where the shipyard is located, have already been vocally opposed to this idea. “These reports, which I just heard yesterday, are really puzzling,” Virginia Senator Tim Kaine told reporters on Feb. 28, 2019. “It’s just a waste of the investment if you do not refuel a carrier that has another 25 years of life.” “You wouldn’t do that unless you intended to maintain the 11-carrier Navy,” Kaine added, referring to the block buy of two additional Fords . What happens now? If Congress is unwilling or unable to slow buying more Fords and won’t allow the Navy to halt plans for Truman ’s rehab, then it has to fund both. At the same time, if the service still insists that it still has to cut from somewhere in order to pay for more pressing priorities and still keep costs within the requirements of slimmer overall defense budget, legislators could find themselves faced with the prospect of either trading something else in exchange for the RCOH or having to find additional money. Truman isn’t the only significant cut the Navy is reportedly already looking at in the upcoming defense budget when it comes to shipbuilding. The service will reportedly propose deferring the purchase of two additional San Antonio -class landing platform dock amphibious ships until sometime after the 2020 Fiscal Year, according to Breaking Defense . The first-in-class USS San Antonio landing platform dock., USN Again, the Navy says it needs to do this in order to free up funds for other priorities. But there is likely to be yet more backlash from Congress for a similar mix of policy and political reasons, not least of which additional concerns about maintaining the industrial base around these ships, which Huntington Ingalls builds at its shipyard Mississippi. The options again are either to acquiesce to the Navy’s proposal or insert additional funds into the budget. Congress has already shown itself willing to do the latter with the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, adding three more of these ships into the last spending bill beyond what the service had asked for. The Navy and legislators have also voiced concerns about the industrial base suffering if LCS construction slows. An Independence -class Littoral Combat Ship under construction., General Dynamics-Austal There are alternatives None of this is to say that it might not be worthwhile for the Navy to actually re-evaluate its carrier needs. We at The War Zone have noted on multiple occasions that there are practical and cost benefits to moving away from requirements for 11 or 12 supercarriers, such as the Nimitz – or Ford -classes, and adopting a mix of ships of that size and smaller flattops. Having a mix of supercarriers and lighter, cheaper, conventionally-powered carriers would allow for a larger, but more flexible force, one that is not nearly as heavily tied to long and extremely costly programmatic maintenance periods. Since the 1980s, the overall size of a carrier air wing has shrunk due to ever-increasing capabilities of individual aircraft, thanks in no small part to advances in precision-guided munitions. Smaller carriers with smaller air wings could take on lower-magnitude missions, freeing up supercarriers for deployments that require their additional capacity. The light flattops could augment supercarriers to more readily distribute airpower throughout a particular region during distributed operations , as well. They could also eliminate the need to use the larger ships for basic training duties, such as naval aviators’ carrier qualifications. The Navy, working with the U.S. Marine Corps, has already demonstrated that amphibious assault ships can provide limited, but sustained aerial support in lieu of a carrier in certain situations . The Navy’s purchase of the USS America , an aviation-focused amphibious assault ship, reflects this reality. The first-in-class USS America amphibious assault ship, in the foreground, passes by the Nimitz -class carrier Carl Vinson ., USN In 2017, the Marines publicly revealed that they had been working on a concept known as the “ Lightning Carrier ,” which would involve embarking between 16 and 20 F-35Bs on an amphibious assault ship, effectively turning it into a light carrier. You can read more about this concept, which evolved from earlier “ Harrier Carrier ” concepts using the AV-8B Harrier jump jet , here . A look at the deck configurations of the USS America , also known as LHA 6, and her sister ship, the future USS Tripoli , or LHA 7, as well as that of the significantly redesigned forthcoming USS Bougainville , or LHA 8 . , USN If nothing else, a carrier fleet only made up of supercarriers looks to be increasingly unsustainable in the long run. Ford has already cost the Navy $13 billion and still needs significant work to ensure it can actually perform in combat. The hope is that the second Ford -class carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy , will escape some of these problems, but they are already more than a billion dollars more expensive than the Navy’s original estimate. None of these figures include the annual operating costs of the increasingly complex ships, which the Navy claims will be somewhat more efficient than their predecessors, but that has yet to be proven. Cost savings from retiring Truman early also need to take into account the expense of scrapping a nuclear aircraft carrier, something no one has ever done. The Navy is still working through how to go about doing this with Enterprise , with estimates ranging as high as $1.5 billion to break down that ship. Lack of support Unfortunately, there has been relatively limited support within the Navy and Marines or from Congress for any actual alternative proposal. The final National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 Fiscal Year nixed a clause that would’ve required the Navy to study smaller carrier concepts. The Marines also rejected our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a briefing on the Lightning Carrier concept from 2012, arguing that its contents remained “pre-decisional.” The U.S. government can legally withhold information from release under the FOIA if it argues that the details might prejudice decision makers or present an inaccurate impression of U.S. government policy. It’s also an exemption to the law that is routinely abused to conceal controversial or embarrassing records. Whatever the reality is in this case, the Marines do not appear to have made the Lighting Carrier concept formal doctrine so far. US Marine Corps F-35Bs on board the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp in February 2019., USMC All told, with there still being a legal requirement for an 11 carrier force, a policy goal to eventually have 12 flattops, no active plans for alternative ships, and political opposition mounting by the day, it seems hard to see how the Navy, or the Pentagon, expect the plan to cancel Truman ’s RCOH will ever go ahead. At the same time, it is difficult to see how Mattis and Shanahan wouldn’t have known all of these things beforehand. This can only call into question what they would’ve ever expected to get out of this strategy. It seems almost inevitable that the Navy will get both its new carriers and Truman ‘s RCOH and all the Pentagon will only get a battle with Congress in return. The idea that the two men were diametrically opposed to new carriers, but agreed to let the Navy purchase two carriers in exchange for giving up one ahead of schedule already seems curious. There is no information, so far, on just how distasteful Mattis and Shanahan actually found carriers and what their ultimate plan for the Navy’s flattop inventory was in the end. The Navy’s own most recent long-term shipbuilding plan already suggests that the service might only have nine carriers in service by 2048. The Navy’s ship inventory projections through 2048, as of February 2018., USN Even if the Pentagon’s eventual plan was to drastically cut back the number of carriers in total, picking a fight with Congress over Truman , and doing so now, seems wholly unnecessary and unproductive. It’s certainly not worth the effort and spent political capital to try – and likely fail – to free up less than $17 million in the next budget cycle. If anything, the entire exercise seems most likely to result in a strong rebuke from Congress in the form of additional funding and might potentially prompt additional legal measures that block the Pentagon from doing anything to threaten the Navy’s carrier plans in the future. We have seen this happen before in the ongoing fight between legislators and the U.S. Air Force over the future of the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. With so many contradictions and questions, there is also a possibility that this proposal isn’t even real. The Navy or the Pentagon might have decided it was in their interests to craft this proposal specifically to prompt the responses we’ve already from members of Congress. It seems quite possible, if not outright probable, that this tactic will preserve funding for Truman , and potentially other programs, that don’t make it into the upcoming budget request. The rollout of the Pentagon’s formal spending request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, as part of the annual President’s budget request, is set to occur until March 12, 2019 . But we do know that all the specific details of the proposal, so far, have come from unnamed sources. We also know that subsequent comments from members of Congress and their staffers, both on and off the record , clearly indicate that they were blindsided by the idea that Truman ‘s early retirement was even a possibility. All of this calls into question how concrete the plan is or was, if it exists in a formal, non-pre-decisional form at all. If it does end up in the Navy’s final budget proposal, no matter the original intentions, it seems most likely that the result will be for it to “shake the tree” and see what money falls down given how unlikely it is for the plan to survive the already growing outcry on Capitol Hill.

Truman ahead of schedule, a day after Vice President Mike Pence first revealed that the Administration was backing away from the plan during a tour of the ship. There has been growing opposition to the plan, especially among members of Congress, since it first emerged in February 2019. At the time, The War Zone laid out a detailed case for why the proposal was unlikely to proceed and this especially rapid decision to abandon it only further calls into question why the Trump Administration, the Pentagon, and the U.S. Navy proffered it up in the first place. Trump made the announcement about the new plan to proceed as planned with Truman ’s mid-life rehab process, technically referred to as a Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), via Tweet on May 1, 2019. The President framed the decision as one he had personally made and Pence had similarly described it this way in his own his comments to the ship’s crew on Apr. 30, 2019 , though it is unclear what actually led to the Trump Administration abandoning the proposal. “I am overriding the Decommission Order of the magnificent aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman , built in 1998 (fairly new), and considered one of the largest and finest in the world,” Trump Tweeted out. “It will be updated at a fraction of the cost of a new one (which also are being built)!” It is important to immediately note that there is no “decommission order” to rescind. The Trump Administration had formally proposed the plan in its own budget for the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year, which Congress looked guaranteed to oppose , and now Trump and the Pentagon appear to have abandoned the idea in the face of mounting pressure from Congress. In February 2019 , it first emerged that the Navy was looking to cancel Truman ’s RCOH, which would effectively lead to its early retirement sometime in the mid-2020s. If the rehab goes ahead as scheduled, the carrier will be laid up for four years between 2024 and 2028, but will then continue to serve through 2048. Canceling the RCOH would have reportedly freed up between $4 and $5.5 billion for the service to spend on other priorities or otherwise help offset the costs of other major development and acquisition programs over the coming years. This was later revised down to $3.4 billion . The USS Harry S. Truman ., USN The proposal to cut Truman ’s service life short almost immediately prompted a bi-partisan backlash on Capitol Hill. The biggest complaint, as Trump’s Tweet notes, has been that the carrier is relatively young and still has decades of service life left in it, both of which are true. The projected funds that the Navy would be free to spend in other ways also seems like a relative pittance. The $3.4 billion to keep Truman operational for another 25 years, for a full service life of around 50 years, is a bargain compared to the costs of buying a new Ford -class aircraft carrier over the same period. If the actual issues were a matter of overall operating costs and force structure, the RCOH would still have offered a cost-effective means of ensuring the carrier could remain in some form of ready reserve state or even serve in a more limited role as a training carrier. Not surprisingly, the announcement that the Trump Administration was reversing course was met with a raft of positive statements from Senators and Representatives who had advocated against the plan. The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN “So far, my subcommittee has received no further information about any formal revision to the budget request for 2020, or to the Navy’s long-range fleet inventory plans and Aircraft Carrier force structure reflecting this change in position,” Representative Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who is in charge of the House Armed Services Committee’s Seapower Subcommittee, said a statement . “I can only hope that we now have the Administration’s strong support as we prepare to mark up the 2020 defense authorization bill in the coming weeks and move ahead with our planned restoration of the refueling for the USS Harry S. Truman .” Still, by all indications, the debate over Truman ’s future seems have come to an end and played out in an almost identical manner to discussions about retiring the Nimitz -class carrier USS George Washington in 2014 under President Barack Obama, though it did so much faster in this case. The debate over Washington was wrapped up in a series of mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration, which led significant changes in U.S. military planning and force structure decisions. In the end, the Obama Administration’s fight with Congress over the carrier dragged out for nearly a year , whereas the decision regarding Truman survived just three months of public scrutiny. Given the experience with Washington , which involved a real issue of truncated budgets, questions remain about why the Trump Administration, the Pentagon, and the Navy all agreed to propose this plan in the first place when it looked almost certain to be dead on arrival in Congress and does not appear to have been a particularly necessary spending cut. Previous spending outlays had shown the Navy had planned to request less than $17 million in the 2020 Fiscal Year budget to support the RCOH, further highlighting the relatively small amount of money in question. The service’s latest 30-year shipbuilding plan , which includes notes on total fleet sizes and plans to decommission ships, and that the service released in March 2019, makes no specific mention of Truman at all, let alone a possible early retirement date and how much money would get saved in the process. Initial reports had also said that the Navy agreed to this plan in 2018 after consultations with then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and on the advice of Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), in exchange for approval for its block buy of two new Ford -class aircraft carriers. Regardless of what happens to Truman now, this purchase order has gone ahead, as Trump noted in his Tweet. The future Ford -class aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy under construction., Rob Ostermaier/The Daily Press via AP However, on Apr. 30, 2019, the same day that Mike Pence announced plans to abandon the proposal, U.S. Navy Admiral Bill Moran, the nominee to become the service’s next top officer, or Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), defended the proposal during a confirmation hearing in from the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said the Navy needed to free up the money from the RCOH to help fund other efforts, such as the development and procurement of new submarines and large drone ships . There was no apparent reference during the hearing to the previously reported deal to retire Truman in favor of buying two new Ford class carriers. In addition, the Navy has said that the Ford block buy will save approximately $4 billion in the coming years, which is one of the figures reported regarding how much the service would free up if it canceled Truman ’s RCOH. This raises a question about whether there has been some confusion about what procurement decisions would actually lead to these projected additional funds becoming available for other efforts. An entirely separate news report suggested that the push for Truman’s early retirement came from Mattis’ opposition to aircraft carriers in general, a view that now Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan purportedly shares. This does not explain why the Pentagon then approved the Ford block buy and is entirely out of sync with statements senior Department of Defense and Navy officials have made persistently over the years . The Navy, in particular, repeatedly complains about a “ carrier gap ” and the difficulty in meeting its Congressional mandate to have at least 11 flattops in service at all times. “We have for years evaluated the threats to our aircraft carriers and the other ships in the strike group to be able to deal with those [threats],” Admiral Moran said during his confirmation hearing , even as he defended Truman ’s early retirement, followed by an offer to provide classified briefings regarding efforts to improve the survivability and other capabilities of these ships. “The aircraft carrier is the most survivable airfield that we have today – anywhere. And we project it will remain that way well into the future.” U.S. Navy Admiral Bill Moran, presently Vice Chief of Naval Operations, at left in the green flight suit, shakes hands with a sailor during a visit to a base in Japan., USN All told, from the very beginning, the entire debate over Truman ’s future seems to have been more about a novel way to secure additional funding from Congress, rather than about cutting costs or shifting existing funds around. The proposal put legislators in a bind where they would either have had to defer funding for the programs the Navy says it needs in favor of continuing with the RCOH as planned, or fund both. It seems hard not to see this as anything but a deliberate decision on the part of the Pentagon and the Navy, and one that appears to have quickly prompted the actual desired result. “I won’t decline more money,” Admiral Moran deftly responded during his confirmation hearing when asked if he would welcome Congress finding the money for the priorities he had laid out, as well as Truman ’s RCOH. Still, in an era of record high U.S. defense spending, it remains entirely unclear why the Trump Administration would have felt it necessary to go this route in order to secure additional funding. $3.4 billion, the estimate of what the Navy expected to be able to reallocate over the course of multiple years , reflects less than one half of one percent of the proposed defense budget for just the 2020 Fiscal Year. The Navy does appear well on its way to “shaking the tree” for that extra money, but it’s hard to see how this process, and the political capital expended for no reason, was better than simply asking for the funding up front.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior Iranian official has threatened to seize a British oil tanker in retaliation for the United Kingdom’s boarding and seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar over suspected sanctions violations yesterday. The incident comes as Iran says it will begin enriching uranium in violation a controversial international agreement that the United Kingdom, along with France and Germany, have been struggling to salvage after the U.S. government pulled out last year . It also follows a spate of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and as tensions between the United States and Iran have pushed those two countries worryingly close to open conflict. Mohsen Rezaei , who is presently the Secretary of Iran’s Expediency Discernment Council, made the threat on Twitter on July 5, 2019. The Expediency Discernment Council serves as an advisory body to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and reportedly has powerful supervisory functions across the country’s government. Rezaei was also previously head of the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and may still be a member of that organization. The U.S. government has also blamed the IRGC for two separate sets of attacks on a total of six oil tankers between May and June 2019 . The IRGC also took responsibility for shooting down a U.S. Navy drone in June, which almost prompted U.S. military action against Iran. “If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities’ duty to seize a British oil tanker,” Rezaei wrote on Twitter . He also said that Iran would respond “without hesitation” to “bullying” from other countries. Royal Marines on the deck of Grace 1 on July 4, 2019., Crown Copyright Iran has already summoned the U.K. ambassador in Tehran to lodge a formal protest about the seizure of Grace 1 , which Iranian authorities have branded as illegal and a “form of piracy.” British authorities have, not surprisingly, dismissed this characterization of the situation. Approximately 30 Marines from 42 Commando, Royal Marines , assisted in the operation to take control of the tanker on July 4, 2019. A number of them rappeled onto the ship’s deck from a Royal Navy AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopter , while others, along with additional security forces personnel from Gibraltar, arrived on small boats. The War Zone just recently published an in-depth feature covering how these types of boarding operations get planned and executed, which you can read here . The exact chain of events that led to the mission remains curiously murky. British authorities have said they suspect Grace 1 of carrying Iranian oil bound for the Baniyas Refinery in Syria’s port city of Tartus. Baniyas is under European Union sanctions over Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his government’s actions during the country’s brutal civil war. However, Spain, which disputes British control over Gibraltar and does not recognize the waters around the territory as being under the control of the United Kingdom, has claimed that U.K. personnel seized the tanker at the request of the United States. The U.S. government has its own sanctions in place targeting all exports of Iranian oil to any destination, which has been a serious blow to Iran as oil sales are a major source of the country’s income. Spanish authorities say they are preparing to make their formal complaint about the incident, but over violation of what they say is their sovereign territory. Boats belonging British authorities in Gibraltar head out to support the seizure of the Grace 1 on July 4, 2019., Crown Copyright There are also reports that U.S. government did provide intelligence about the Grace 1 to the British to enable to seizure. On July 4, 2019, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton sent a tweet praising the operation, but also corroborated the British position that the mission was in response to E.U. rather than American sanctions. “Excellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace 1 laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions,” he wrote. “America & our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran & Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade.” It’s not clear why the Iranian tanker was even sailing past Gibraltar in the first place, as it would have been a much shorter route to sail to Syria from Iran by way of the Suez Canal. Some have also suggested that this circuitous route might have been supposed to help the tanker escape interdiction, but its not clear why this would have been the case. It seems much more likely that this had to do with reports in April 2019 that Egypt, which controls the Suez, had begun blocking access to Iranian tankers headed for Syrian ports. Grace 1 ‘s general legal status, by itself, is another issue. The ship still carries indicating that it is registered in Panama, despite Panamanian authorities saying they delisted it in May 2019 after the Panamanian National Security Council issued a notice saying that it “may be participating in terrorism financing, in support of the destabilizing activities of some regions led by terrorist groups.” A handout photo the U.K. Ministry of Defense released showing Grace 1 during the boarding and seizure operation. The ship is still marked as being flagged in Panama, despite this not having been the case since May., Crown Copyright Whether or not Iran decides to follow through on Rezaei’s tit-for-tat threat remains to be seen. It is certainly true that Iran, and the IRGC especially, routinely makes grandiose threats, or otherwise highlights its ability to do so, without following through . At the same time, Rezaei himself has a very notable history of speaking his mind, including reportedly telling then-Iranian Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini in 1988 that Iran could not win the war against Iraq. In 1997, he was formally ejected from the IRGC, purportedly, in part, over his indifference to perceived threats of a potential American attack. In 2009, he criticized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for questioning the Holocaust, saying the comments were “ not useful ” and threatened future rapprochement with the U.S. government. But it would also not be the first time Iran has seized a foreign commercial ship or directly retaliated against the United Kingdom. In 2015, the IRGC briefly took control of the Danish-owned container ship Maersk Tigris , which is flagged in the Marshall Islands, over a legal dispute . Just on July 4, the Maersk Line announced it would be adding a “war risk” surcharge to any shipments passing though the Persian Gulf owing to current regional tensions. In 2007, the IRGC also detained 15 members of the British Royal Navy in the Persian Gulf for nearly two weeks . The sailors, then assigned to the Type 22 HMS Cornwall , had been searching a merchant ship at the time. Iran claimed that they were in Iranian waters, while the British said the operation had been in Iraqi waters. This incident was somewhat reminiscent of the IRGC’s detention of a number of U.S. Navy sailors in the Persian Gulf in 2016 . Iran is also increasingly in a dispute with the United Kingdom and other European countries over the fate of the controversial deal over its nuclear program. The United States pulled out of this agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018, leaving the remaining parties to try and salvage it. Iran recently accused the United Kingdom, France, and Germany of failing to uphold their obligations and now says that it will begin enriching uranium to levels above the JCPOA’s limits, which threatens to upend the deal for good. The concern is that Iran growing its stockpiling of enriched uranium could reduce the time necessary to “break out” and build nuclear weapons should it decide to do so. On top of all this, the seizure of Grace 1 and Rezaei’s threat come at a time when tensions between the United States and Iran are at a recent high , which has raised concerns about potential risks to commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf and the general geopolitical situation across the Middle East. In May 2019 , four oil tankers suffered attacks in the Gulf of Oman off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The following month, attackers used limpet mines to damage two tankers in an area of the Gulf of Oman that is closer to Iranian waters. The United States has presented a steady flow of evidence tying Iran, or its proxies, to the second set of attacks, and U.S. officials blame the Iranians for the first incident, as well. Iran has strenuously denied involvement and no group has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. The IRGC did admit to shooting down a U.S. Navy drone in late June 2019 , though, which nearly led to U.S. strikes on Iranian targets. There are now reports that the U.S. government is looking to establish a new coalition in the region to both protect commercial shipping and monitor Iranian activity in case of further attacks. American officials, including President Donald Trump, have pointedly asked other countries to step up and contribute more to safeguarding freedom of navigation and maritime trade in the region. India has sent a contingent of naval vessels to the region for this purpose, but, so far, it is unclear if any other country has or is preparing to follow suit. The United Kingdom has officially denied reports in June that it was sending a contingent of Royal Marines to the region to help guard its shipping interests. For its part, Iran has said that the only way forward is for the U.S. government to ease its sanctions , something the Trump Administration is disinclined to do given its policy of “maximum pressure.” But, regardless of whether it was U.S. or E.U. sanctions that actually triggered the seizure of the Grace 1 , the incident does show that Iran is facing increasing pressure from more than just the United States. While Rezaei’s threat seems intended to stress to other countries that they face increased risks if they align themselves with U.S. government policies, Iran has to know that actually seizing foreign commercial ships could just as easily inflame international opinion against them. As his comments have in the past, Rezaei’s statement may actually reflect an increasingly contentious discussion within Iran about how best to proceed amid growing international pressure.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 12, 2020",This Is What Color Night Vision Looks Like And It Stands To Be A Game Changer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is absolutely no debate that increasingly compact night vision optics and cameras have fundamentally changed the nature of warfare, as well as law enforcement and a host of other activities. But as revolutionary as these systems have been, they have historically been limited to producing monochrome imagery that can make it difficult to determine many important details at even modest ranges. In recent years, however, there have been significant developments in technology that makes it possible to see in the dark and in full color, making it easier to quickly identify items of interest and drastically increasing a user’s overall situational awareness. For decades now , there has been steady research and development into what is commonly described as “color night vision.” In the past 10 years, a number of different manufacturers have begun to sell more practical systems on the commercial market and the technology is already in use in military and security applications , among others. Las Vegas-headquartered SPI Corporation’s X27 Osprey full motion video camera is a great example of how far the technology has come, providing impressive color imagery in very low-light-level conditions. It’s hard to believe that the videos below were shot at midnight in their respective locations. The first true passive night vision systems, which appeared in the 1960s, used an image intensification “tube” to capture any available photons of ambient light and then “energize” those particles. These excited light particles then go through this process multiple times. The resulting “image” then ends up projected onto what is effectively a small screen at the other end of the system, appearing much brighter to the human eye and thereby making the entire scene visible in low-light conditions. The 1974 U.S. Army video below offers a more in-depth overview of how image intensifying night vision works at its most basic level. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dpALpllG0l8 Decades of additional research mean that these systems are now able to amplify smaller amounts of light and create higher fidelity imagery. Today, the current generation of night vision optics are also able to faster and automatically account for changes in ambient light, preventing the user from getting blinded if things rapidly become brighter or losing the picture altogether, even briefly, if the available light drops. But the picture in most of the night visions systems in active use today is generally only available in monochrome, usually with a stereotypical green tinge. This is because the systems are simply not sensitive enough to capture enough light to amplify into a color picture in extremely low-light-level conditions. Think of this sort of like walking into a mostly darkened room. You might be able to identify some objects, but your brain can’t produce a vibrant color image. This traditional night vision imagery can make it difficult to isolate and identify particular details on a target to help positively identify it. In a military or law enforcement context, this is extremely important since it can make it hard to tell a threating individual from an innocent bystander or a truck with some odd cargo from a vehicle with a mounted weapon. It might even make it problematic to discriminate between friendly and hostile forces in the middle of a firefight. Many higher-end color night vision systems, such as the X27, as well as Canadian firm Lorex’s security cameras , dispense with the image intensification tube in favor of a highly sensitive, digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensor. These translate photons into electrons that an algorithm then decodes to produce a digital image. CMOS technology is commonly found in commercial digital cameras , as well, which have themselves steadily become more capable of taking cleaner pictures in low-light conditions. SPI says its specialized low-light-level system can amplify existing light more than 85,000 times its natural brightness. “Large pixel pitch sizes allow the chip to collect ultra extreme amounts of light and translate them photons into a clear clean bright image in very dark night scenes,” SPI says on its website . “The X27’s low light color technology utilizes specialty algorithms that allow the sensor to see in extreme low light environments traditionally unseen before.” The X27 can even show infrared marking and targeting lasers in color, allowing individuals to better discriminate between multiple targets rapidly. In principle, SPI’s CMOS sensor could work with other existing digital optics, as well. There is also a lower end to the technology, which involves simply adding filters to traditional image intensification systems, such as night vision goggles. ColorTAC’s CVA-14 is one such system. It is specifically designed to work with the AN/PVS-14 night vision monocular, which is in service in the U.S. military and elsewhere, both as a helmet-mounted system or as a weapon sight. The clip-on CVA-14 puts two rotating color filters in the front and the rear of the AN/PVS-14. Ambient light then passes through the system’s intensifier tube as normal, but gets spit out in such a way that the human brain is able to decode it as if it was in “near-true color.” A scene as seen through a standard AN/PVS-14, at left, versus one equipped with the CVA-14., ColorTAC True color night vision system still have a requirement for a certain amount of ambient light in order to function in color as infrared illuminators do not help bright an area dramatically even at close range. So these systems can’t work in total darkness without an additional source of visible light. One way to help mitigate this, at least in part, is by blending the image from a color night vision camera with the one from an infrared camera, thermal imager, or another type of optical sensor, each of which may be able to detect different details. These types of fused images have the potential to be even more detailed and high fidelity, allowing the user to determine highly specific features or even writing on objects in certain cases. Creating a self-contained multi-spectral optic with color night vision and multi-wavelength infrared capability might be another option. This doesn’t change the fact that color night vision already offers significant advantages, even if it won’t work in every single situation. Seeing in color is just what the human body is used to and so a typical individual can mentally process what they’re seeing faster with these systems. This more “natural” vision may help further reduce the change of a loss of situational awareness , vertigo , and other issues that traditional night vision goggles can sometimes cause, especially in airborne applications. This would also provide major benefits in the future if paired with distributed vision systems on aircraft or ground vehicles, such as the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , Israeli firm Elbit’s Iron Vision for tanks or Northrop Grumman’s Silent Watch for ships. The U.S. Army is already working on a way to blend together imagery from thermal weapon sights with the picture an individual soldier sees through their night vision goggles, which you can read about more here . A example of blended imagery from SCI, combining the feed from one of the firm’s X27 cameras with a thermal imaging system., SCI Corp Adding color night vision to the mix would allow pilots, vehicle drivers, mariners, and individual troops to get color night vision imagery projected straight onto helmet-mounted or wide area displays. Commercial entities and private citizens might use equipment to aid in flying or driving at night, as well. For military personnel, being able to call out targets or ask for positive identification from other nearby units based on colors in addition to other features can only help with “mental contrast,” too, speeding up and otherwise improving various targeting processes. Color night vision technology will likely only expand the overall potential of augmented reality systems on the battlefield and elsewhere as time goes on, in general. All told, color night vision is a game-changing additional capability on top of an already revolutionary development. The goal now is to continue making the technology practical, compact, increasingly high fidelity, and able to operate even in extremely low-light-level situations. It may not be long before the mental image we all have of military and law enforcement personnel conducting operations at night through the green haze of their night vision goggles becomes a thing of the past.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",Turkey Reportedly Hoarding Spare F-16 Parts As It Faces Sanctions Over S-400 Purchases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey has reportedly been stockpiling spare parts for its F-16 Viper fighter jets in order to head off possible U.S. sanctions after it takes delivery of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems, which the country’s President Recep Erdogan says is set to happen within days. The purchase has already put Turkey on a path to get kicked out of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program completely and it could potentially impact other U.S.-Turkish defense cooperation in the future. Bloomberg first reported the parts hoarding, citing two unnamed Turkish officials, on July 1, 2019. At present, Turkey has some 245 F-16C/Ds, which are a mix of Block 30, 40, and 50 variants, making it one of the largest operators of the type anywhere in the world. The effort has also included acquiring additional spares for other unspecified military systems beyond the Vipers. It is unclear what items Turkey has been buying specifically and from what sources, as well as when the shopping spree began, but U.S. government criticism of the S-400 deal has been growing steadily since Turkey first announced it in 2017 . The spat has been centered primarily on security concerns that the U.S. and other F-35 operators have about Turkey operating those aircraft and the S-400s. They fear this could expose sensitive details about the stealthy jet’s radar signature and other capabilities to the Kremlin. In June 2019 , the Pentagon released a detailed roadmap for how it planned to remove Turkey from all facets of the Joint Strike Fighter program within the next year unless it canceled the order for the Russian surface-to-air missile systems, something Erdogan has repeatedly refused to do. “The first batch of S-400s will be delivered in a week or 10 days,” the Turkish President said on July 1, 2019, according to the Haberturk newspaper. “I’ve clearly told this to Trump, Mr. Putin also said it.” One of the S-400 air defense system’s transporter-erector-launchers., Vitaly Kuzmin But there is the potential that the United States could enact additional sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA . Under this law, President Donald Trump’s Administration would have to choose a mix of five sanctions from a total of 12 options, which include things like sanctioning Turkish banks and other business entities and preventing Turkey from obtaining U.S. loans. Beyond that, there is the possibility that Congress could enact additional measures to censure Turkey, including with regards to military cooperation with the United States. Some legislators have been seeking to more permanently block Turkey from ever regaining access to the F-35 program. There have also been growing calls to remove U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. On June 10, 2019, lawmakers in the House of Representatives agreed to a non-binding resolution outlining a number of potential courses of action, which might impact other weapon system programs beyond the F-35. The first completed F-35A Joint Strike Fighter for Turkey at a rollout ceremony in June 2018., Anadolu Agency “In addition to the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter, Turkish defense acquisition programs that could be affected by sanctions include the Patriot air and missile defense system, CH-47F Chinook heavy lift helicopter, UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter, and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft,” the draft resolution reads . It is important to note that Turkey does not yet operate the Patriot, which the U.S. government has repeatedly offered as an alternative to other air defense systems, such as the S-400. It is also worth pointing out that the annual defense policy bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which became law last year, demanded that the Pentagon conduct an “assessment of impacts on other United States weapon systems and platforms operated jointly with the Republic of Turkey.” The weapon systems in question were the same ones mentioned in the June 2019 resolution, including Patriot. This assessment was due within 90 days, but the findings, or a summary thereof, have not become public. It is possible that the provisions of the Fiscal Year 2019 NDAA prompted Turkey to begin buying spare parts for its F-16s and other major U.S.-made military hardware. A Turkish UH-60 Black Hawk drops an inflatable raft during an exercise., Turkish Armed Forces Bloomberg ‘s sources also indicated that Turkish officials have become increasingly concerned about the potential for a broader U.S. arms embargo against their country akin to the one the United States enacted in 1975 . This was in response to Turkey’s invasion of northern Cyprus the year before, which was ostensibly aimed at protecting ethnic Turks after ethnic Greek Cypriots seized control of the country in a coup. The island nation has been divided ever since, though only Turkey recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The United States eventually ended the embargo against Turkey in 1978, but it took a severe toll on the Turkish military. Stockpiling parts now could give Turkey more flexibility to negotiate if any new U.S. sanctions turn out to be equally severe. Having parts in reserve would be especially critical for the F-16s, which are the Turkish Air Force’s most numerous and advanced combat aircraft and will continue to be so for years to come, especially in the absence of F-35 deliveries. Without these stockpiles, the Vipers could very quickly end up grounded, leaving Turkey in a particularly vulnerable position. It is possible that Turkey could keep a portion of the Vipers flying by cannibalizing other aircraft, something that has helped Venezuela keep its F-16s flying, albeit with degraded capabilities, despite an American embargo. This could be harder to do for Turkey’s more advanced variants, though. A Turkish F-16C Viper., Turkish Armed Forces Of course, the decision to enact such severe sanctions, or a full-on arms embargo, would represent a major shift in policy that could have serious ramifications beyond U.S.-Turkish relations. Other countries might begin to seek alternatives to U.S.-made weapon systems in order to avoid finding themselves in a similar situation in the future. In Turkey’s case, it could also push the country to more seriously consider joining Russia’s Su-57 advanced combat jet program as an alternative to the F-35, which, in turn, might further inflame tensions with the United States. It remains to be seen how and when the U.S. government might actually act beyond the Pentagon’s plans to eject Turkey from the F-35 program. “We’re looking at it,” Trump had told reporters ahead of a meeting with Erdogan on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Japan on June 29, 2019. “So, I have to tell you, he’s a NATO member, he’s somebody that I have become friendly with,” he continued, suggesting he would try to avoid any sanctions on Turkey. “And you have to treat people fairly. You understand that. You have to treat people fairly. And I don’t think he was treated fairly. I don’t think he was treated fairly.” President Donald Trump, at right, speaks to the press alongside Turkish President Recep Erdogan at the G-20 Summit on June 29, 2019., White House However, the Pentagon, the State Department, and members of Congress have all made clear that the risk of sanctions, including under CAASTA, remains very real. At the same time, though, the U.S. government looks to be trying to push doing so off until the very last moment with hopes of still finding some sort of deal, even as the prospect of doing so appears to be becoming increasingly remote. On June 30, 2019, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a prominent Trump confidant, said that the CAASTA provisions were only likely to kick in when Turkey “ activates ” the S-400s, that is to say when they become operational. Though Erdogan says that the S-400s will begin physically arriving in Turkey momentarily, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has said they will not be deployed and operational until sometime in October . When that happens, the U.S. government’s decisions regarding various sanctions may quickly become clearer. In the meantime, the Turkish military appears to be taking no chances to give it the best possible chance of riding out the situation with as few disruptions as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2019",China’s Reported Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile Test In The South China Sea Is A Big Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has reportedly carried out at least one anti-ship ballistic missile test in the hotly contested South China Sea as part of a larger exercise. If true, it would be the first time the Chinese military has carried out this kind of activity in this region that we know of and it would represent a significant escalation in that country’s already aggressive efforts to assert its claims over this highly strategic portion of the Pacific Ocean. NBC News was first to report the development, citing two unnamed U.S. officials, on July 1, 2019. NBC ‘s sources did not say what type of missile or missiles were involved or what type of targets they struck at the end of their flight. Neither the Chinese nor the U.S. government have officially confirmed the test, which reportedly occurred over the weekend. However, China did issue Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) for two specific areas in the South China Sea, warnings often associated with missile launches and military exercises. These NOTAMs were in effect between June 30 and July 1, 2019. One of the NOTAMs covered a wide area stretching from the Chinese island of Hainan to contested Paracel Island chain, including China’s outpost on Woody Island , while the other was a box was much further to the south, but north of the disputed Spratly Islands . Their respective positions suggested that Chinese forces had launched a missile from the mainland, with the first exclusion zone being in place in case the missile failed during its boost phase and fell into the ocean, and it then landed downrange in the Pacific Ocean. China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) has at least two ballistic missiles that reportedly have warheads with sufficient maneuverability to engage large, relatively slow-moving ships, such as aircraft carriers. These are the DF-21D medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and the DF-26 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM). In April 2018, there were reports, based on commercial satellite imagery , that suggested there was a previously unknown PLARF base on Hainan island, which would also fit with NBC ‘s report and the publicly available NOTAMs. Either DF-21Ds or DF-26s would have sufficient range to reach the Spratlys from Hainan. China is also in the process of developing shorter range anti-ship ballistic missiles, but these systems would lack the range necessary to hit targets in the South China Sea from the Chinese mainland. If China has fired DF-21Ds or DF-26s into the South China Sea near the Spratly Islands it would be the first known instance of the PLARF using either missile against a maritime target. The Chinese have previously fired ballistic missiles at broadly carrier-shaped fixed targets in the Gobi Desert. It is possible that this test was more general and was simply intended to demonstrate a basic ability to fire a missile from the Chinese mainland at a particular spot in the South China Sea. This could still provide important data for future test launches against more representative targets. An aircraft carrier-sized target in the Gobi desert with multiple craters from the impact of large missiles., Google Earth via The Federation of American Scientists This would also represent a logical progression from a missile exercise in January 2019 , in which PLARF DF-26 units mobilized on short notice in the Gobi Desert and Tibetan Plateau regions, explicitly in response to the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS McCampbell sailing through the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. This was clearly meant to show China’s ability to threaten hostile ships using ballistic missiles from sites safely within its interior. The PLARF did not actually fire any ballistic missiles in that instance, though. The video below from China’s state-run CCTV shows clips from the DF-26 exercise January 2019. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pdm2i-jVAWk This new anti-ship ballistic missile test could have been a similar response to the U.S. Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force conducting combined operations in the South China Sea earlier in June 2019. This notably involved both the American Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan , and her associated strike group, as well as the Japanese “helicopter destroyer” JS Izumo . In 2018, Japanese officials had finally admitted that they had designed the Izumo -class from the outset as aircraft carriers capable of supporting short takeoff and vertical landing-capable jets. Japan is now looking to fully convert the ships to accommodate F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . China has been a vocal critic of Japan’s efforts to increase its military capabilities and even potentially amend its pacifist constitution to allow the Japan Self-Defense Force to conduct more expansive military activities. The USS Ronald Reagan , in the background, sails alongside the JS Izumo in the South China Sea in June 2019., JMSDF In March 2019, the U.S. Navy’s amphibious assault ship USS Wasp had also arrived in the Philippines to take part in a major exercise carrying an unusually heavy load of F-35Bs. Wasp subsequently appeared off Scarborough Shoal , situated to the northeast of the Spratlys. China and the Philippines both claim ownership of the shoal and the waters around it, which has led to serious altercations in the past. Scarborough Shoal also forms one point of a “ strategic triangle ” China has been working to secure within the South China Sea in order to better assert its territorial claims. The other two points are Woody Island to the north and the Spratlys further south. Since 2014 , the Chinese have been steadily expanding and improving a large constellation of islands and man-made outposts throughout the South China Sea. At the same time, China has also been increasingly deploying surface-to-air and shore-based anti-ship missiles, among other military hardware , to these outposts, as part of a broader anti-access and area denial strategy. A map showing the China’s potential “strategic triangle” in the South China Sea, with Woody Island in the Paracel Islands to the northwest, Scarborough Shoal to the southeast of that, and the Spratly Islands to the south., Google Maps The ability to employ anti-ship ballistic missiles against targets in the South China Sea from the Chinese mainland only adds to these defensive layers. Tucked further inside China’s own territory, these weapons could be less vulnerable to pre-emptive or counter-strikes from any opponent during a crisis, too. Adding anti-ship ballistic missiles to China’s existing anti-ship cruise missiles defenses in the region would also make the full threat picture more disparate, making it more challenging for opponents to fully defend themselves. Spotting and detecting ballistic missiles, let alone trying to intercept them, is a very different affair from detecting and engaging low-flying air-breathing cruise missiles, a reality the U.S. military made abundantly clear in its most recent Missile Defense Review . Of course, it is important to note that there is still no indication that China has demonstrated the ability to hit a target representative of even a large moving ship, such as an aircraft carrier, with a ballistic missile, let alone do it reliably. It is similarly unclear whether the People’s Liberation Army has the sensor and communications networks to spot ships and then feed useful targeting information to PLARF units hundreds or even thousands of miles away. But the reported recent missile test in June 2019, as well as the DF-26 exercise earlier in the year, certainly show that the People’s Liberation Army is still interested in working to develop this capability, or at least making it appear this way. There have also been reports that the Chinese may be looking to develop air-launched anti-ship ballistic missiles for even greater flexibility. If nothing else, Beijing definitely has no interest in ceding any of its territorial claims in the South China Sea. A map of Chinese man-made outposts in the disputed Spratly Islands. , DOD In addition, the Chinese military’s deployment of new capabilities in and around the region has coincided with increasingly aggressive maritime patrols to force civilian and military vessels away from the areas that China claims. In September 2018 , the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 052C Luyang II -class destroyer Lanzhou almost collided with the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Decatur near Gaven Reefs in the Spratly Islands. The United States and China separately remain locked in what has been a particularly bitter trade war and the two countries have also seen increasing tensions over the status of Taiwan in recent months . Following a meeting on the sidelines of the recent G-20 summit in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to hold off on a new round of tariffs and restart negotiations to end the trade dispute. Trump has also moved to ease sanctions against Chinese telecommunications and consumer electronics giant Huawei, which has been a particularly tense trade issue for the two countries. But if it is true that the PLARF has started test firing ballistic missiles into the South China Sea, it would seem that however tensions may or may not be easing on the economic front, Beijing still sees no reason to back down with regards to expansive territorial claims in the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 21, 2021",This Gigapixel Photo Shows A Looming Security Presence During Inauguration,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every four years the massive security apparatus that protects Washington DC, from a network of surface-to-air missile systems to the Secret Service, to the Capitol Police gear up for one of America’s most celebrated and important political spectacles—the peaceful handover of executive power. Executing inauguration day safely is a gargantuan undertaking, especially in this age of rapidly morphing threats and extreme political polarization. It takes an army of dedicated and highly-skilled security professionals, and a ton of technology, to pull it off successfully—both of which are on display in this crazy Gigapixel image snapped just as Donald Trump was giving his inaugural speech on the steps of the Capitol. Beyond its extreme resolution ultra-wide angle, the image is incredible for a multitude of reasons. It tells so many little stories at one time—you can make out all the VIP attendees facing the camera, and the facial expressions of the crowd below, including where they were looking while the 45th President of the United States addressed the world for the first time. Beyond that you can see all the different pieces that make up the inauguration, from the military band to the media. You can even see where networks like CNN set up broadcast locations high above the Mall. Pennsylvania Avenue is also visible in the huge stitched image, which at the time was being prepped for the Presidential Motorcade to roll along it. It would be there that the first family would exit their armored cocoons and walk along the famous thoroughfare while waving to onlookers, all the while surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents. If you look hard enough, the image also tells at least a portion of the story of how such a high-profile, high-risk and highly-attended event like this goes off without a hitch. Scanning the crowd you can see a multitude of Secret Service agents planted in key locations. Uniformed law enforcement is also highly visible, even among the pre-screened masses. Maybe most impressive is what you see when you look up from the action below. The rooftops are dotted with security agents and electronic surveillance gear of all types. Pretty much every aerial or pole around the Mall, some of them temporary in nature, is covered in cameras and other electronic gear, some of which is not readily identifiable. When viewing the image at this level, it is an eye-watering testament to the degree of surveillance deployed for the event and around the Capital Mall in general—literally an army of eyes, and probably ears as well, either scanning the environment through lenses or electro-optical devices, all in an attempt to stop trouble before it starts. You can compare this image to the gigapan photo from Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009. As you can see, the presence of electronic surveillance has increased significantly over the last eight years. Just for fun, here’s another cool gigapan showing the White House and the west side of Washington DC from the top of the Washington Monument point-of-view. From this angle the complexity of the security environment surrounding the White House is pretty clear, and it underlines why the Secret Service has requested a mock-up of the White House for training purposes. Some hoped that a new Presidential Limousine, often referred to as “The Beast,” would be unveiled at this inauguration, as it has become something of a tradition over the last couple of decades to do so. Sadly that didn’t happen. As it turns out the new heavily armored executive transports will be unveiled a bit later in the year . Still, the time during inauguration day when the Presidential Motorcade is showcased , as well as the most visible show of force by the Secret Service, still had its own strangely exciting moment—well at least among some in the defense, security and even the conspiracy crowds, as well as on social media. , One of the agents assigned to the President’s car during the motorcade’s crawl down Pennsylvania Avenue struck some eagle-eyed viewers as peculiar. The agent, who looked like he was right from Hollywood central casting, with a bald head, chiseled features and piercing eyes, was seen holding his hands in the same somewhat odd position for very long periods of time as he made the long walk to the White House. , This combined with the man’s oversized trench coat made many think his arms and hands were actually prosthetics. In all honesty, at first it actually looked like that may be the case, although I just couldn’t believe it. After examining the video closely it is clear that this highly trained agent was just extremely consistent in his readiness posture, with has hands moving only occasionally to adjust his coat and reset themselves in the same position. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RhMiHhBD0jg The placement the man’s hands are seen in is often referred to as the “interview position” (or interview stance when the person is standing still) in tactical and law enforcement circles. It is designed to keep one’s hands at the ready above their gun belt while still looking unassuming but in control. In this case, the posture also helps keep the agent’s coat from blowing open, potentially brandishing what’s underneath. It can be assumed that a portion of the agents walking alongside the motorcade were sporting automatic rifles, such as short-barreled CAR-15s derivatives, or personal defense weapons (PDWs), such as the P90, under their oversized overcoats. As such, you can see why such a position would be ideal for the situation. Within a blink of an eye the agent could bring his weapon to bear on the bad guys, keeping them out of range and providing cover for the President to be evacuated safely by his personal detail. In the end the security balet that is a Presidential Inauguration is truly an amazingly well coordinated dance. From the F-16 pilot flying a combat air patrol high over the region, to the secret service agent checking the manhole covers on the street before the motorcade travels down it—not to mention all the intelligence agents that keep track on potential threats—everyone works together to make the event memorable for the right reasons. , As I have said many times before, the Secret Service in particular does a near superhuman job at keeping the President and those around him, including onlookers, safe from harm. Watching them work is just fascinating, they make it seem all too easy. Few other jobs are tasked with getting it right 100% of the time, or with such massive implications mixed with great risk. If anything, pictures like the Gigapixel image from Friday just give us a tiny glimpse into just how daunting a task they and the entire joint force that provides security for the Capital Region have before them. What interesting bits can you find in Friday’s Gigpixel image? Let’s see some screen grabs below in the comments section.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Trump’s Ridiculous Resort Lifestyle Is Literally Breaking The Secret Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles told USA Today that more than 1,000 of his agents, roughly a third of the non-uniformed force, have hit the federally mandated cap for salary and overtime allowances that was already expanded to last the entire year. In addition, long hours and seemingly endless deployments have taken their toll on the service’s agents and officers. They are overworked and their morale is low as there is no end in sight to the problem. Even as the Alles tries to hire his way out of the predicament over time, some of the agency’s most experienced personnel are choosing to find more agreeable work. Although the Secret Service has been over-extended for some time, one main reason the problem has morphed into a crisis level issue is President Trump’s insistence on traveling to one of his resorts in Florida, Virginia, or New Jersey on most weekends. The President’s four jet-set adult children also require protection as well, not just at home but also while traveling on constant trips abroad, many of which are to promote the Trump brand. AP Trump is on track to spend more on personal travel in one year than President Obama did in eight years. As of July 5th, Trump had spent roughly 30 percent of his time as President at his own resorts. That percentage has likely only increased since Trump’s 17 day vacation just wrapped up, which was mostly spent at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey, as well as a couple days at Trump Tower in New York City. Just protecting Trump Tower, the President’s official home, has been a massive and horrendously expensive operation, both for the federal government and for New York City. Some estimates have put the price at $212,000 per day , while other estimates have been much higher, especially while Trump’s wife and son were present at the 5th Avenue high-rise. Protecting Trump tower has been a huge expensive effort to begin with, yet alone his other properties he visits regularly. , AP Even with all his travels, amazingly Trump had not traveled past Iowa as President of the United States until last night when he visited Arizona for a “rally.” Still, aside from two trips overseas, all his previous travel had been around America’s east, either to a handful of campaign-like events or for “working holidays” at his properties. Trump’s days away from the White House really isn’t the main problem, it is the amount of locations Trump calls home. Usually a President has one home, which becomes a highly secured sanctuary of sorts, and they also take a long planned extended vacation elsewhere maybe twice a year. Weekend escapes are the reason Camp David exists—the famous Presidential pre-secured oasis of sorts. Camp David is operated by the Department of Navy and has year-round staff. Its facilities include hangars for the Presidential helicopters, a major command and control bunker, and most importantly, 200 acres of lodges, cabins, tennis courts, pools, as well as a whole slew of other activities, like clay shooting. It even has a single hole golf course. Located in the hills of Maryland just a helicopter flight away from the White House, it is the ideal place for the President to take a breath of fresh air, relax, and rejuvenate in private. President Obama used Camp David fairly frequently, but his predecessor, Bush 43 used it constantly. Here Obama is seen playing squirt guns with his family at Aspen Lodge’s massive swimming pool. A command bunker lies beneath the structure., White House Surely it sounds like heaven to most anyone, and the place is steeped in American history and the honor of Presidency no less, but for Donald Trump, Camp David is far less than those things. The President made this notorious quip to a reporter about his intentions of using the official Presidential retreat: “Camp David is very rustic. It’s nice, you’d like it… You know how long you’d like it? For about 30 minutes.” In roughly the first seven months in office, the President has been to Camp David twice. Once for a weekend, which may have more about understanding continuity of government operations nearby than showing true interest in the property, and just last weekend to meet with his national security team about Afghanistan. On last weekend’s trip to the facility, Trump didn’t even stay the night, instead flying from his Golf Club in Bedminster to Camp David at around 10am and returned back to Bedminster around 6pm that same day. The President and his family need round the clock protection, as well as other White House staffers., AP Protecting Trump’s four grown children also isn’t a cheap affair because their lifestyles see them travel around the globe promoting the Trump brand and vacationing at expensive locales and in costly hotels. Eric Trump, who runs the Trump Organization with his brother, traveled to Uruguay on business earlier this year, which cost the Secret Service almost $100,000 just for hotel rooms . Complicating things further, the Secret Service doesn’t just have to protect President Trump on a hotel floor or in a house when he travels to his properties, they have to protect large swathes, if not the entirety of the sprawling facilities, including the golf courses that Trump frequents privately when he is there. These are huge and complex security operations which include air, land, and in if nearby water like Mar-a-Lago, water elements. Sizable amounts of permanent infrastructure and manning has to be left in place at these locales to keep them secure and accessible to the President. This is a very expansive task. USA Today reports the agency has spent $60,000 in golf cart rentals alone for use at Trump’s properties since the inauguration. AP The situation has become so dire that Director Alles doesn’t know how he will pay his agents through the rest of the year. It may take lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap again for agents from $160,000 to $187,000. Congress already approved supplemental funding for the Secret Service to pay for hours worked over the last year as well and to help reimburse some of the local communities’ law enforcement expenditures racked up by Trump’s constant getaways. But even if the cap is raised again, the Secret Service may not be able to compensate roughly 130 experienced agents for hundreds of hours already worked. This may sound like serious money for agents, but the hours they are working are seen as unsustainable on a personal level. The Secret Service recently went through a period mired with numerous embarrassing scandals and firings, but morale even within the elite plain clothes protection units is said to be at an all time low, and the tempo of operations will likely lead to more agents leaving the service which will only exacerbate the overall issue. AP Alles doesn’t see the tempo letting up anytime soon either, so he plans on hiring his way out of the problem. He told USA Today that from its current size of roughly 6,800 agents and uniform officers, he wants to reach 7,600 by 2019 and 9,500 by 2025. Obviously, with such a large expansion planned in coming years, and with experienced members leaving due to morale and the agency’s personnel strain, quality control of its agents and officers will be a major issue. It takes time and money to train a Secret Service member, especially an agent, so the reality is that retaining the experienced people the service already has will be as important as adding new recruits over the coming years. What’s also troubling is that the Secret Service faces a slew of rapidly morphing threats , some of which they have never faced before, such as the danger drones pose to those they protect. And spending all this money on increased personnel makes it harder for the elite agency to acquire new capabilities and personnel trained specifically to help counter emerging threats, not to mention badly needed training aids and equipment . The heavily armed Counter Assault Team is always nearby when the President is traveling., AP What’s so upsetting about all this is that Trump’s weekend getaways are totally frivolous and already cause major concerns over his claims that he has separated himself from his businesses. Not just that but Trump himself pounded on President Obama incessantly for golfing and for taking vacations. He said he would do the opposite if he were elected on numerous occasions, even claiming he wouldn’t travel or even golf. These were not just some vacant policy attacks and reflective promises, they were incessant character attacks and personal promises to the American people, and Trump has total control over making good on his end of the bargain. His actions have proven to be so far divorced from his words that it would be totally comical if it weren’t so infuriating. Here is just a sampling of some of Trump’s tweets about Obama’s vacations and rounds of golf. When the topic came up in interviews over the years his statements were often even more aggressive.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2014 Obama usually golfed at Andrews AFB near Washington DC, not at clubs that take an Air Force One flight and hundreds of support personnel to access. As to the number of golf rounds each have played so far during their presidencies, Trump won’t allow reporters near him when he golfs, but clearly he has totally eclipsed the number of golf rounds Obama had played at this point during his time as Commander In Chief. One site, which tracks exactly these metrics , puts Trump at 23 rounds of Golf since taking the Oval Office, whereas Obama had 12 golf rounds under his belt. https://youtube.com/watch?v=LKsm-DIAkNs I personally could care less how many times the President plays golf. He needs to decompress and enjoy his life a bit in order to be an effective and well calculating leader. But having to fly to Palm Beach or New Jersey to play is ridiculous. And coming from a guy who did nothing but attack his predecessor for what he’s now doing to a far larger degree, breaks the hypocritical dam, and it is also breaking the Secret Service in the process. One of the temporary guard towers at Mar-A-Lago., AP But the frivolous fiscal waste that these trips represent doesn’t just manifest itself in Secret Service overtime or payments to local municipalities, it goes far beyond that. Just the airlift costs involved with these excursions is staggering and not seen by the average person. Air Force One is the USAF’s most expensive aircraft to operate, but it is just one facet in a much larger presidential transport mosaic. I stated the following in a previous piece on Air Force One and Donald Trump: “The truth is that when the President travels, regardless of the aircraft her or she is in, so do a pair of Marine One helicopters via C-17, and the Presidential motorcade via C-5 or a series of C-17s. This is for every stop, everywhere. If the Marine One helicopters are being used primarily instead of the motorcade, MV-22 Ospreys also either self-deploy to the location or get airlifted by heavy transport. On top of this, many other people associated with the White House and Secret Service fly commercial or on other government aircraft. A spare command and control aircraft, usually a C-20C, also is deployed to an airfield nearby. With all these moving parts, each leg of each mission costs many hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, just in air transport costs alone. When flying overseas, this aerial ballet turns into a flash mob, with an entire Air Force traveling alongside Air Force One. These aircraft include multiple C-5s, C-17s, MV-22s, VH-3Ds, VH-60Ns, C-20s, C-32s, C-37s and E-4Bs. Even E-6B Mercuries support these missions. Many of these aircraft are kept out of the public’s line of sight. International trips can cost many millions of dollars per-leg. So Air Force One, even with its brutally high operating costs, is just one piece in the larger—and much more costly—Presidential airlift puzzle.” Camp David is an ideal place for the President to frequent as it is already secured and just a helicopter flight away from the White House., AP It is estimated that each weekend trip to Mar-A-Lago costs $3.6M , and that number is likely far less than reality, as other variable and fixed costs associated with the location aren’t factored in. Nor are the decreased airframe lives of all the aircraft that are used for these “Special Airlift Missions.” For a guy that is adamant about cutting government overhead and especially waste, the idea that he is happily burning millions of dollars a weekend so that he can check on his properties and play golf is nausea inducing. So what can be done? Congress should attempt to regulate these overtly wasteful trips through the power of the purse if need be. That is very unlikely to happen with this congress of course, but it could happen after 2018. At the very least, Trump’s abuse of the assets at his fingertips should be used as a reason to pass legislation that limits, even to just a conservative degree, the private travel capacity available to any First Family. A fixed budget of some kind would be helpful. But really, it’s depressing and unfortunate we have to even go down such a legislative path in the first place. AP For Trump—a man who lived most of his adult life with a personal airliner at his beck and call—this may all seem to be acceptable and normal. But it isn’t. It’s absurd. And when he traveled privately he paid the bill, but that didn’t include hundreds of Secret Service agents, multiple C-17 and C-5 transport flights, the cost of operating Air Force One, and all the expenses of securing multiple luxury resorts and golf clubs with Trump’s brand plastered on them. Travel that maybe cost him $60k an outing is costing the American people millions. In the end, actions speak louder than words. For a guy who says he understands the little guy, loves law enforcement, and understands the value of a buck, all while slamming big government for being wasteful, he sure acts like he could care less about any of of those things by the way he travels. And the men and women of the Secret Service are paying the price personally for his absurd lifestyle more than anyone else. Simply put, it is the opposite of leading by example. Or as Trump would address the issue via tweet: “Major bait and switch! Look how this guy lives on our dime! And those poor Secret Service agents and their families!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 6, 2017",Trump’s Alarming Confusion Over Ballistic Missile Defense Surfaces Again In Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. By now it’s clear that President Donald Trump doesn’t understand America’s ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities. Time and time again he has made peculiar statements about the subject that illustrate a glaring lack of understanding of the topic. Many will rush to his defense saying that he ‘leaves the details to the generals,’ but that is a very concerning argument in itself as the real-world strategic decisions will be made the President alone, and having major misconceptions about America’s ability to defend itself—not to mention our allies—against a ballistic missile strike invites undue strategic risk and potentially devastatingly bad decision making. Early last October, talking to Sean Hannity, Trump claimed that America’s BMD system is 97 percent effective, stating “We have missiles that can knock out a missile in the air 97% of the time, and if you send two of ’em it’s going to get knocked down.” This statement was absurdly inaccurate and downright frightening. As we have discussed in detail before , America’s ICBM defenses are far from a reliable shield of any sort and rely on a rickety assortment of sea, ground, and space-based sensors, as well as various data links and kinetic weaponry, all working together on very short notice to accomplish their mission. Tests have largely occurred under far less than real world conditions, and making things worse, the system is widely untested against even small missile salvos. We have no idea where he got such an outrageously wrong figure from, or who inspired such high confidence in such a questionable system, but whatever the case may be, this is what he believes and that’s a major problem. Kim Jong Un, or “lil Rocket Man” as Trump calls him, inspects an HS-12 before its launch. Developed from the BM-25 Musudan missile, the HS-12 IRBM has become one of North Korea’s most menacing and capable missile types. , AP Then on November 5th, 2017 Japan Times reported that Trump said he “could not understand why a country of samurai warriors did not shoot down the missiles.” The missiles he was referring to were the Hwasong-12 Intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) that North Korea fired over Japan late last August. The statement, which the White House has not refuted, once again shows a critical misunderstanding of ballistic missile defense, and especially Japan’s ability to swat North Korean missiles down with ease. Although Japan does have five Aegis ballistic missile defense system equipped destroyers which are capable of firing SM-3 interceptors at short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles, one of these ships would have to have been sitting picket duty within the engaged envelope of the HS-12’s flight profile when it was fired. Not just that, but if one of these ships was in the area on missile defense duty, it would have needed standing orders to attempt a shoot down even if the missile was clearly just traversing Japanese territory, not headed on a trajectory to strike it. And even then, the speed and altitude that the HS-12 was flying at may have been outside the current SM-3’s engagement envelope. An improved interceptor with expanded engagement reach, the SM-3 Block IIA , is currently being developed by both the U.S. and Japan for this exact purpose. The Kongo is one of Japan’s handful of BMD capable destroyers. A sixth ship will gain the capability in 2018., USN With all this in mind it’s not exactly as if Japan chose to be cowardly and ignore North Korea’s provocative IRBM launches, and evoking the country’s warrior culture past was just childish and unfounded. Trump’s misunderstanding of ballistic missile defense in relation to Japan—and just in general—reared its head again yesterday during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Abe. During the presser, trump responded to a reporter’s question as such: “…I will say, if I could just take a piece of the Prime Minister’s answer—he will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States. He will easily shoot them out of the sky, just like we shot something out of the sky the other day in Saudi Arabia, as you saw. And that was a very rapidly moving missile shot out of the sky. That was a needle in the sky, and it was hit immediately and exploded without damage. So one of the things, I think, that’s very important is that the Prime Minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment, by far. He’ll be purchasing it from the United States. Whether it’s the F-35 fighter, which is the greatest in the world—total stealth—or whether it’s missiles of many different kinds, it’s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan and other countries that are likewise purchasing a lot of military equipment from us that, frankly, a year ago and two years ago were not.” Patriot batteries arrayed on the lawn of the Japanese Ministry of Defense in Tokyo. , AP The President is referencing the shoot down just a day before of a Burkan 2 medium-range ballistic missile fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. That missile was in fact intercepted by a PAC-3 Patriot battery, the same exact type of missile system capable of intercepting shorter-ranged ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight that was protecting the President and all of Tokyo while he was speaking those words. So he was touting a capability Japan already has in quite extensive numbers, and it is nowhere near capable of swatting down longer-range ballistic missiles or those transiting Japanese airspace during their mid-course phase of flight. AP We were one of the first to report that Japan is in the processing of procuring Aegis Ashore installations which will give them persistent land-based midcourse intercept capabilities against everything up to an IRBM class missile. These installations will likely feature the new SPY-6 radar array which will give them greater sensor fidelity and range than existing Aegis Ashore installations based around the SPY-1 radar array. Officials from Japan’s Ministry of Defense will be heading to Hawaii soon to check out the test SPY-6 radar site there before they finalize the deal. But none of this has to do with Saudi Arabia’s anti-ballistic capabilities which Japan already has, and the Kingdom is receiving the THAAD system , not Aegis Ashore, in the future. SPY-6 test Radar located in Hawaii. SPY-6 is slated to equip the next generation of Arleigh Burke Flight III destroyers as well as new Aegis Ashore sites. , Raytheon Nobody is saying that the President needs to be a weapon systems expert, but when it comes to missile defense it is critical that he or she comprehends the basic capability types, including their real-world limitations, and how they fit into a larger strategic picture. Just thinking that America is protected by some nearly impenetrable ballistic missile shield and that we can sell something similar to our allies will result in a poor understanding of the overall strategic equation in an entire region. Most importantly it will give a false sense of security to the worst person possible—the individual that will be making major policy and military calls—potentially on very short notice. Metaphorically speaking, throughout history, in many cases when a commander’s troops are equipped with heavy armor, that commander is likely to have them take more risks on the battlefield. But if that armor is far less effective than the commander understands it to be, what would seem like well balanced battle plan can end up being a massacre. The same applies in this case. When you think there is only a three percent chance an ICBM can hit the US, making risky foreign policy and military decisions in regards to the country with the ICBMs is simply more palatable. Patriot batteries have been deployed around Japanese territory consistently since tensions have flared between the Kim regime and the Trump administration., AP These chronic misstatements are also a credibility issue. Why delve into the details if in doing so you are always inaccurate? Whether this is a flaw that can be blamed on the President’s advisors or a personal one is immaterial, but the fact that it exists is undeniable. Hopefully someone will brief the President on the conceptual “rungs” of missile defense and what they really can and cannot do, or at the very least they will tell him to leave talk of these systems to someone who is informed enough to respond accurately without constantly embarrassing themselves and the country. In the end the cold hard truth is that when it comes to being a successful world leader in 2017, the details actually matter. And considering the White House just asked for $4B in emergency funds for more missile defense spending, demonstrating that the President actually understands any of this would probably be a good thing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 21, 2019","It’s Official, Turkey Is Getting Russia’s S-400 Air Defense System","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey has reportedly signed deal to co-produce the S-400 surface to air missile system with Russia. The plan has already provoked criticism from the country’s fellow NATO members and could further strain its relations with the alliance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made the announcement during a parliamentary meeting with other members of his Justice and Development Party, more commonly known by its acronym AKP, on July 25, 2017. Turkey and Russia have been negotiating the arrangement since November 2016 and Turkish officials reported these talks were in their “final stage” in April 2017. “We have now taken steps with Russia about this issue. Deals have been inked,” Erdoğan told the AKP MPs. “In God’s will, we will see S-400 missiles in our country and precede the process with joint production.” The S-400 Triumf is a road-mobile long-range surface to air missile system. Each self-propelled or semi-trailer-mounted launcher has four missiles, which have ranges up to 250 miles depending on the variant. Search and tracking radars, including those in the X- and L-bands, give the complete system the ability to spot and engage both short-range ballistic missiles and low-flying cruise missiles, according to the manufacturer Almaz-Antei. A 5P85SM2-01 launcher for the S-400 system., Vitaly Kuzmin Technology transfer and shared production have been core Turkish demands . As part of an overarching push for a self-sufficient domestic arms industry, Turkey has or is looking into production or co-production of fifth generation fighter jets and other military aircraft , tanks and self-propelled artillery , small arms , and more. We don’t know the final price tag for the proposed S-400 deal and with declines in Turkish defense spending – it only budgeted approximately 1.56 percent of its GDP to defense in 2016, according to NATO, compared to more than the desired two percent in 2009 – the country may eventually have to scale back any final purchases. It is also possible that the arrangement with Russia may ultimately include plans for a Turkish-specific derivative of the system, which NATO calls the SA-21 Growler, with unique features. All in all, the S-400’s capabilities make it a perfect anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) tool against enemy aircraft and missiles, which may worry both potential foes and friends, as Russia’s own missiles in Syria already have done. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ylEmQLBQokk “Why will it cause tension?” Erdoğan questioned at the AKP meeting. “A country should be in search for the ideal ways for its own security.” These particular remarks were almost surely pointed at U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Just days earlier, the American military’s top officer had rejected reports that Turkey was about to buy S-400 missiles and suggested it could be a problem if they did move ahead with the purchase. “There was a media report that was incorrect,” Dunford said at the Aspen Security Forum on July 22, 2017. “They have not bought the S-400 air defense system from Russia. That would be a concern, were they to do that, but they have not done that.” Ostensibly, American officials have been critical of the plan because the Russian system is not compatible with other NATO equipment and infrastructure. The alliance has various interoperability requirements for military gear in order to streamline operations among its members. A member state using non-standard equipment could potentially lead to command and control, logistical, or other problems during an actual conflict. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IwulIUWbDzI Erdoğan was quick to point out that Greece, another NATO member that his country has still had repeated skirmishes with over the past six decades, operates older Russian-made S-300 systems. What the Turkish leader failed to mention was that this only occurred because of his country’s near violent anger at Cyprus, which is not a member of the alliance, purchasing these weapons in the first place. Since 1974, Turkey has supported an otherwise unrecognized independent country on the island known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which stands in opposition to the predominantly Greek southern portion. As part of its agreement to defend the ethnically Turkish population, the government in Ankara had threatened a preemptive strike against the S-300 batteries after they arrived in 1997. Ultimately, Greece agreed to take the missiles in exchange for undisclosed military equipment and monetary compensation. Cyprus subsequently obtained less capable and shorter range Russian-made surface to air missile systems. To be fair, in 2015, Greece was reportedly looking to purchase new missiles and other services from Russia in order to keep its S-300 batteries operational. The bigger question in that case was whether Greece, hopping from one political crisis to another and suffering a severe budget shortfall, would be able to actually pay for the upgrade program. As of February 2017, those negotiations were reportedly still ongoing . MIM-23 HAWK missiles in a U.S. Army museum., Pi3.124 via Wikimedia Regardless, in Turkey’s case, the purchase seems to be wrapped up in a number of long-standing issues, the most important being the desire to develop a domestic production capability for a long-range air defense system, which the country desperately needs. Since the end of the Cold War, the Turkish military has only become more and more aware of its limited anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile defenses. As of 2016, the Turkish Air Force, which operates its short-, medium- and long-range surface to air missile systems was still using a mix of aging American MIM-23 HAWK and British Rapier systems , according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ The Military Balance for that year. It may still have had some number of even older MIM-14 Nike Hercules missiles at static sites. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xrqTPN5lo_U With only these limited defenses, since 1990, the government in Ankara has requested the deployment of NATO members and their surface-to-air missiles – mainly Patriot systems – on no less than three occasions in order to bolster its own defenses against regional threats. Between 1990 and 1991, American forces brought Patriot batteries to defend against possible Iraqi Scud attacks as part of Operations Anchor Guard and Ace Guard. In February 2003, ahead of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Pentagon agreed to repeat the move as part of Operation Display Deterrence. More recently, in 2013, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands all sent Patriots to Turkey as part of Operation Anatolian Protector. Turkish officials requested the deployment primarily over concerns about Syrian Scud missiles . Spanish forces ultimately took over the NATO Patriot missile mission in the country, but the U.S. military continues to operate a secretive long-range AN/TPY-2 radar site . At the same time, the country formally began looking to finally purchase its own such system as part of a competition known as the Turkish Air Force Long Range Air and Missile Defense System (T-LORAMIDS) program. Turkey quickly selected China’s FD-2000 , the export designation for the HQ-9 surface to air missile system, as the winner in 2013. The weapon and its associated radar and fire control systems are visually and functionally similar to the Russian S-300V. The HQ-9’s missile have a reported maximum range of approximately 120 miles and, paired with the right sensors, can supposedly act as a limited ballistic missile defense system. Chinese HQ-9 launchers during a parade in Beijing in 2015., AP As with the new decision to buy the S-400, the Chinese missile plan prompted the same concerns from NATO and the United States. U.S. defense contractor Raytheon had submitted the theater ballistic missile defense version of its Patriot system, known as Guidance Enhanced Missile-TBM or GEM-T, while European consortium Eurosam had submitted its Aster 30 . Raytheon reportedly lost out due to a inability or unwillingness to share the requisite amount of technology, while Eurosam’s option apparently proved too costly. Russia had also submitted the S-300 system, which would have been a close competitor to the FD-2000. “We have conveyed our serious concerns about the Turkish Government’s contract discussions with the U.S.-sanctioned company for a missile defense system that will not be interoperable within – with NATO systems or collective defense capabilities,” Marie Harf, then Deputy State Department Spokesperson, told reporters on Oct 7, 2013, echoing many of the U.S. government’s concerns and objections to the new S-400 deal. After nearly two years of immense pressure from the United States, Turkey yanked the FD-2000 deal in November 2015. Turkish President Erdoğan and other officials claimed the decision was so that the country could refocus resources on its own domestic development program. A year later, the country was in talks with the Russians about buying S-400. Given General Dunford’s comments in Apsen, the United States undoubtedly hopes that renewed pressure will kill this new deal, but it seems the American government’s opinion is less likely to change the Turkish position now than it did two years ago. The towed S-400 launcher in its firing position., Vitaly Kuzmin In November 2015, Turkish F-16 fighter jets had just shot down a Russian Su-24 attack plane over Syria it looked like the two countries might end up in larger skirmish. Russia was adamantly opposed to Turkey’s support for Turkmen rebels fighting the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Then in July 2016, the situation got stood on its head. Members of the Turkish military, including fighter pilots who reportedly tried to kill President Erdoğan as he flew to safety in a VIP jet, attempted to overthrow the government on the night of July 15-16, 2016. Erdoğan and his supporters quickly blamed the coup attempt on self-exiled preacher and one-time ally of the AKP Fethullah Gülen. The Turkish government swiftly set about purging tens of thousands of suspected “Gülenists” from the military, other parts of the government, and state-run universities. In addition, Turkish authorities demanded the United States turn over Gülen , who is still living in Pennsylvania and remains an outspoken critic of what many see as an increasingly dictatorial regime . U.S. officials say they would be happy to consider the formal extradition request , but that their Turkish counterparts have yet to provide conclusive evidence of Gülen involvement in the coup plot. The result has been a significant chill in U.S.-Turkey relations. Notably, in June 2017, U.S. authorities said they would charge members of Erdoğan security detail over what appeared to be a series of unprovoked attacks on individuals protesting the Turkish president outside the country’s Embassy in Washington, D.C. the month before. On top of that, as The War Zone has already reported in detail , Turkey’s concerns about ascendant Kurdish groups , which is sees as indistinguishable for domestic Kurdish terrorists, has only pushed it further away from the United States and closer to Russia. The U.S. military has gone so far as to deploy special operations forces to keep to peace between Turkish forces and their partners and Kurdish groups, which American officials see as an essential part of the fight against ISIS terrorists. In turn, the government in Ankara teamed up with its Russian and Iranian counterparts to devise a ceasefire and safe zone plan. The Kremlin revealed the basic parameters of the plan in May 2017 and the final arrangement remains elusive. Earlier in July 2017, American and Russian officials claimed they were working on their own deal to halt at least some of the fighting in Syria, which appeared to incorporate many elements of the earlier Russian-Iranian-Turkish concept. So far, it remains unclear what, if any parts of these plans have gone into effect. With the situation still so fluid, and reports of increasing fighting between Turkmen and Kurdish rebel groups, Turkey only continues to be disinclined to drop its demands for the Americans to largely cut off military aid to the Syrian Kurds. Erdoğan could potentially use the S-400 deal as diplomatic leverage, but authorities in Washington seem similar dead set in aiding Kurdish forces in Syria, who have so far proven to be the most capable and reliable in taking on ISIS. “We have already made clear that we will be in cooperation with countries and companies that would lend support to us throughout this process,” Turkish Undersecretary of Defense Industries Ismail Demir had already stressed to reporters back in 2016 . “We have said our doors are open and that we are willing to cooperate.” Given the country’s seemingly intractable differences with the United States over the Kurds, as well as the Turkish military’s clear need for its own long-range air defenses and the country’s desire to expand its self-sufficient defense industry, it seems likely Turkey will proceed with its plans to buy S-400 systems absent any more attractive offer.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are always fascinated with the seemingly never ending network of Department of Defense-related infrastructure that speckles the United States and especially those installations that are deemed surplus and auctioned off to citizens and corporations at a tiny fraction of their original construction cost. Even overseas, relatively pristine Cold War relics are still being sold off for pennies on the dollar. But regardless of price, it requires a lot of creativity and vision to turn something meant to fight World War III into something personally or commercially useful and attractive. Grist House Craft Brewery of Millvale, Pennsylvania seems to have the creative drive and a plan in place to do just this, deciding to open up their second location in a 70 year old Nike missile command center. Bob Batz of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that in just over four years, the Grist House team has outgrown their first location and has made the abandoned Nike Missile Master Direction Center their next location. The site is in Collier Township, Pennsylvania at one of the highest points in surrounding Allegheny County. It was home to U.S. Army Nike Ajax and Hercules surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery in the 1950s and 1960s. It’s worth noting that the Nike Hercules missile system could be armed with a nuclear warheads. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dNHIx9uDxk8 A number of radar systems have come and gone from the summit since its inception as well. Originally, the radar data from the Nike site was shared with the FAA and the USAF’s SAGE network . Today an FAA radar still sits at the center of the site surrounded by the once cluttered sensor and weapons platforms. This part of the site will remain in FAA hands. The large building to the left of the cluster of platforms and radar tower is the location of the disused Nike Missile Master Direction Center and the new home of the brewery ., Google Earth The Nike installation had the unique role defending nearby Pittsburgh, a cradle of American industry at the time, from Soviet bombardment if World War III had come. So we aren’t talking about a building designed for normal applications, but a large bunker structure that was built to fight during a nuclear conflict. The Missile Master Direction Center was the nerve center for the Pittsburgh Defense Area, which included about two dozen missile launch sites scattered around the city and its outlying suburbs. The building, once a command and control facility that will become the new location for Grist House Craft Brewing., Grist House Brewing The Missile Master Direction Center that will become Grist House Brewery is made up of extremely thick concrete walls that encase a whopping 55,000 square feet. The main floor will become a production center for the brewery. Two basement sub-levels, include a room that was copper-lined to protect mainframe computers from electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by nuclear detonations, will work as a giant barrel aging facility, taproom, and retail store. The destination brewery will include a large deck to take advantage of the views at the elevated locale as well as a dog park and other outdoor areas for people to enjoy the one-of-a-kind site. It’s not clear if the brewery will retain the helipad or not, but helicopter wine tours are becoming increasingly popular in some areas of the country. The facility was originally auctioned off in 2014 by the General Services Administration as part of a set of parcels that make up the Charles E. Kelly Support Facility that was still used by the Army Reserves up until around 2009, although it worked mainly as a storage and office site at the time. The extensive renovation on the facility has begun., Grist House Brewing The facility harkens back to a time when many locales in the United States were blanketed with an integrated air defense system supported by alert fighters and throngs of surface-to-air missiles. Those missiles and the infrastructure that supported them was absurdly advanced for their time , but eerily simple by today’s standards. Presently, only Washington, D.C. is ringed by radar-guided surface-to-air missiles, a largely unknown reality that you can read more about in this past feature of mine . So there you have it, another Cold War infrastructure relic that is really a diamond in the rough for the right user. We often hear of sites being sold off that are in remote locations, like missile silos or lighthouses, but this example goes to show you that there are still some gems to be had that are close to relatively urban areas. And what a draw they can be. There are breweries in most larger communities these days, but what brewery can allow prospective patrons to visit a Cold War command bunker atop a vista with breathtaking views? Grist House Brewing Good luck to the guys and gals at Grist House Brewing! Thanks for keeping a piece of our military history alive. Hopefully we can make it out there one day to have a cold one!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Star Wars Canyon, also known as the Jedi Transition or Rainbow Canyon , and the aviation photographers that trek there, have offered up some of the most stunning and interesting images and footage of military aircraft over the last half-decade. The variety of aircraft that blast through the chasm is one of the locale’s biggest attractions. Like fishing in some bizarre intercoastal waterway you truly never know what you might catch . In the case of pro photog Eric Larson, he recently caught a whale with one hell of an attitude. Fighter jets are the normal fare for Star Wars Canyon, but it also gets its share of propeller-driven aircraft and helicopters. It even gets larger aircraft like bombers and transports, but they always seem to take a far less aggressive and higher route towards the valley below. This wasn’t the case for a C-17A Globemaster III from Edwards AFB that took to the canyon in a manner unlike seemingly any other ‘heavy’ caught on camera in the canyon before. Eric Larson Eric Larson Eric Larson Eric describes his unique encounter with the C-17 as such: “I’ve been wanting to get up to Death Valley for fresh jet pics all year, but I’ve been working solidly and haven’t been able to make the trip since last December when the Dutch F-35s put on that epic show . So I’m up here for the week. I got to the ‘amphitheater’ and started keeping watch in the morning. A little after noon the sound of approaching jet engines got me up on my feet. I remember it because it was unusual in that the build-up of approaching jet noise was longer than usual. Then I saw a wing start to appear from behind a distant mountain. Then more wing. And more wing! At first, I didn’t comprehend what I was seeing, then the full C-17 came into view. It actually caught my breath and I just watched it for a couple heartbeats. Then I remembered to start shooting! I remember thinking how remarkable it was that it was already so low in the canyon. I’ve seen a C-17 at the canyon before, but usually they just pass over the top. This one was down in it a lready! The C-17 was crossing my line of sight from right-to-left at the canyon’s entrance, then it made a huge arcing turn toward me proceeding down the canyon—the pilot made a powerful turn, banking the aircraft up to nearly 90 degrees. I remember the lights were on and that made a significant impression. It was an awesome sight seeing a big jet like that maneuvering hard, lights on, coming straight at me! He continued the turn, got pointed down the canyon and passed by, the shutter on my Canon 1DX firing off at high-speed. It was so big and so close I had to rack the zoom out all the way on my telephoto lens to fit the whole thing in the frame! I remarked on Facebook later noting how it’s funny because I don’t have to crop in much on these C-17 pics. There was someone over on the saddle [another shooting location down the ridgeline] and we looked at each other and both put our arms up in the air! It was quite a sight!” That’s an understatement. I have seen a lot of C-17 low-level videos and photos, including of the intense stuff the Aussies do with their C-17s, but the only other instance that I have seen something like this was in a video from Mach Loop in the UK : Bravo on the amazing catch Eric, bravo!

U.S. Special Operations Command is planning to buy a small number of conversion kits from Swiss gun maker Sig Sauer to turn existing M4A1 carbines into new MCX Rattler personnel defense weapons, or PDWs.  This purchase is in response to the command’s nearly year-old requirement for a tiny assault rifle able to fire both .300 Blackout and 5.56x45mm rounds, which we at The War Zone were first to report . The U.S. Army, which is managing the contract on behalf of Special Operations Command (SOCOM), announced the plan on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s central contracting website, on Feb. 1, 2018. The proposed deal, which the service expects to finalize by the end of March 2018, will include 10 complete “MCX PDW” upper receiver groups in .300 Blackout and equal number of 5.56x45mm barrels. The notice and its attached documentation never specifically mention the Rattler trade name , but the caliber, 5.5-inch barrel length, and mention of a thin, side-folding “skeleton” buttstock are a perfect match for the design that Sig Sauer debuted at the annual SHOT Show trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada in January 2018. “Sample systems are needed quickly to be used in formal combat evaluations,” according to one document, outlining the Army’s justification for handing a contract directly to Sig Sauer without a formal competition. “The current requirement is for 10 kits that will be used in evaluations that will help shape future requirements that are anticipated to be competed in a full and open manner.” U.S. government rules and regulations require that any agency looking to issue this type of sole-source contract has to present a written argument to justify why it cannot take the time to go through a traditional process. Though the Army posted a copy of this document online, it redacted the estimated total value of the contract, as well as a number of other details. Sig Sauer’s MCX Rattler PDW with a variety of accessories, including a visible and infrared aiming device at the front, a non-magnifying optic, and back up iron sights., Sig Sauer The documents do not say what unit or units will be evaluating the weapons, but the kits will go to the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana. This facility routinely supports the research and development of new small arms systems for the SEALs , which sometimes filter down to special operations forces in other services. According to the documents, technicians at Crane will use existing M4A1 carbine lower receivers as the starting point to build the complete weapons. However, the conversion kits should also work without any issue on lowers from other AR-15 and M16-pattern weapons or derivatives, such as Heckler and Koch’s HK416 , which is becoming increasingly popular with U.S. special operations forces and the U.S. Marine Corps , if necessary. Like the HK416, the MCX series, including the Rattler, uses a physical gas piston to cycle the action rather than the AR-15/M16 series’ direct impingement system. The latter arrangement blows propellant gasses straight into the inner workings of the gun, which can cause particulate matter to build up and jam the gun unless the shooter makes sure to routinely clean their weapon. From the purchase order, it is also clear that whoever the special operators in question are, they’re interested in testing more than one potential PDW configuration, making use of the already modular nature of Sig Sauer’s MCX family. In addition to the Rattler’s ultra-lightweight buttstock, the deal would include 10 standard full-size versions. An MCX Rattler with its special, lightweight PDW stock folded to the side., Sig Sauer The evaluators will have access to a sound suppressor Sig Sauer has specially developed for the .300 Blackout round, well as the company’s SRD762 , which is available with a quick detach mounting system. The latter type works with a variety of different .30 caliber and smaller ammunition types, according to its website. The last major items in the order are Wilcox BOSS 300 non-magnifying optics, which are calibrated for the .300 Blackout’s ballistics, and Sig Sauer Juliet 4x magnifiers . With both system available and the magnifier on a quick detach mount, a special operator could easily go from having a sight ideal for close-quarters combat to one that gives them the ability to make accurate shots at longer distances. And though the purchase also includes barrels in 5.56x45mm, the .300 Blackout’s characteristics are very much at the core of the Rattler’s design and SOCOM’s requirements. Advanced Armament Corporation (AAC) first created the Blackout round in cooperation with Remington in the late 2000s. AAC goal was to design a new ammunition type for AR-15 and M16-type weapons and derivatives thereof that would be quiet, but still relatively accurate and powerful, even in a gun with an extremely short barrel and a sound suppressor. The 5.56x45mm round performs poorly out of short barrel firearms to begin with. AAC originally crafted two basic types of ammunition under the .300 Blackout moniker, the first being a supersonic 125 grain round that had similar ballistics to the Soviet 7.62x39mm cartridge, along with a much heavier 200 grain subsonic type specifically for firearms with sound suppressors. The market for .300 Blackout has since grown to the point that other manufacturers offer different loads with various combinations of bullets and powder charges, which offer different characteristics in certain conditions. Testing showed that an AR-15 in .300 Blackout with a 9” barrel produced the same muzzle energy as a standard 5.56x45mm M4A1 carbine with its 14.5-inch barrel, according to a 2012 AAC presentation . The company posited that a gun in .300 Blackout with a 9-inch barrel version would still be useful at a range of just over 480 yards while Colt’s 5.56x45mm M4 Commando , with an 11.5-inch barrel, is only reliably effective out to around 440 yards. A US Army Special Forces soldier with a short barrel 5.56x45mm M16-type gun., US Army The .300 Blackout cartridge do generally have heavier, slower-moving bullets than typical 5.56x45mm loads, highlighting that the ammunition might be best suited to the PDW role or other shorter-range combat. That larger projectiles also give the Blackout rounds better performance against harder cover, such as wood panels, car doors, and auto glass, which could easily send many lighter 5.56mm bullets off course or shatter them entirely. On top of that, since 5.56x45mm to .300 Blackout share the same case head and taper, its generally not difficult to switch from one to the other, which was a key part of SOCOM’s initial requirement . In AR-15 and M16-pattern guns it is as simple as swapping out the barrel. Magazines for one ammunition type will work for the other, as well. What all this means is that a PDW-type weapon in this caliber gives special operators a very useful tool in very confined spaces that also reasonably effective against enemy forces at longer ranges if the situation were to change suddenly. Sig Sauer has been heavily focusing on the idea of a large amount of firepower in a compact package in its marketing materiel for the Rattler and other MCX versions, which includes a series of four slick Hollywood-esque short films. The fourth of these, titled “Tango Down,” features fictional special operators working discreetly in stereotypical Middle Eastern setting armed with the PDW type. You can watch the full clip below. “You gotta understand that if anything bad happens, it’s going to be over with before anybody can help you,” the commander says at the mission briefing. “So, I need you to roll as heavy as you possibly can without blowing your cover.” As of 2015, U.S. special operations forces units were reportedly already using a larger version of the MCX in .300 Blackout, nicknamed the Black Mamba. That weapon, which SOCOM procured as part of its “Low Visibility Assault Weapon” program, had a nine-inch barrel, though, according to Guns of the Special Forces, 2001-2015 , by Leigh Neville . That prior experience may have given Sig Sauer an advantage, at least in this initial deal. AAC had already made a similar weapon, known as the Honey Badger , which seemed tailored to the SOCOM requirement for an ultra-compact assault rifle. Belgian gunmaker FN Herstal now offers a PDW-sized version of its SCAR series , which American special operators already use, but not in .300 Blackout. German firm Heckler and Koch has a version of its HK416 and HK 417 family in that caliber, the HK337 , but again with a nine-inch barrel that would be too long for SOCOM’s stated needs. There’s nothing to say that either of those companies couldn’t reconfigure those weapons to meet the parameters for the special operations PDW, though. The PDW version of FN’s SCAR family., Joseph Trevithick The Army makes it clear in the contracting documents that this small buy and the subsequent combat evaluation are intended only to provide information to help refine the existing requirements. At the same time, having a system already ready for large-scale production could put Sig Sauer in a good position to win that subsequent contract, too. “The United States Special Operations Command has identified an urgent operational need that is jeopardizing lives and safety as this new capability is being developed,” the Army’s justification says in no uncertain terms. “Only one respondent, Sig Sauer, has a PDW kit that is commercially available, meets the technical requirements of the sources sought, and is ready for delivery to conduct a combat evaluation in order to determine a solution for a M4A1 conversion kit.” Heckler and Koch’s HK337, a variant of the HK416/417 pattern in .300 Blackout., Heckler and Koch The contracting documents do not say how long the combat evaluation will last, but that it will come 60 to 90 days after the Army finalizes the deal. There’s also no clear timeline for how long it might take SOCOM to take whatever data it gathers and starts the formal competition. We at The War Zone will definitely be keeping our eyes out for news of those developments as the year goes on. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Here’s What Really Happened When Special Operators Tried To Break Through Trump’s Border Walls,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is still adamant about the need to move forward with his signature plans to build a new wall all along the U.S. border with Mexico. Critics have called into question how effective this obstacle will be , as well as its potentially exorbitant costs, while supporters say it absolutely necessary and that it will work, often citing reports that prototypes were able to keep out highly trained U.S. military special operators during testing. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, The War Zone has now obtained a highly redacted copy of the official report on those experiments, which, unsurprisingly, paints a more complicated and nuanced picture of the barriers’ possible capabilities. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) led the “Border Wall Mockup and Prototype Test,” which ran from Oct. 24 through Dec. 15, 2017. The testing regime included attempts to breach and scale the eight prototype walls, or representative sections thereof, as well as evaluations of how easy eight different prototype wall sections were to construct, assessments of their overall design, and surveys about how pleasing to the eye and how intimidating they looked. Earlier 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had handed out contracts, ranging in value between $300,000 and $500,000, for the prototypes, which are between 18 and 30 feet high and made from various materials, including concrete and metal . “The Mock-up and Prototype Test is part of a larger concept development phase to determine which design attributes most effectively and efficiently meet CBP’s operational requirements for the Border Wall Program as part of an overall Impedance and Denial (I&D) capability,” the report , which is dated Feb. 23, 2018, explains in its executive summary. “The results of the test were not intended to provide direct conclusions or pass/fail scoring .” The Associated Press was first to report on the tests in January 2018, citing information from what was likely a draft version of the report we have obtained that an unnamed source relayed to them. Versions of that story still carry headlines such as “Trump’s border wall prototypes pass tests by military special forces” and “Border Wall Models Thwart US Commandos In Tests.” For the breaching tests, which occurred between Nov. 28 and Dec. 16, 2017, CBP split personnel into four teams, each of which was responsible for trying to get through with two different breaching techniques. We don’t know the exact breakdown of the teams, but they included 10 individuals from CBP’s specialized Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC), 10 personnel from the U.S. Army’s 7th Special Forces Group , and two members of the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command ( MARSOC ). CBP did not turn these teams loose on the eight actual border wall prototypes, which remain standing at a site outside San Diego. Instead, the law enforcement and military personnel tried to break through representative mock-ups at a separate, unspecified location. Members of BORTAC during an unrelated training exercise., CBP Not unreasonably, censors redacted all information on the methods themselves, citing an exemption for law enforcement-related information. We do know that the testers were able to employ nearly 60 different tools and other pieces of equipment across the eight breaching experiments, but it’s not clear if they tried every tactic against all eight mock-ups. We also know that the first breaching technique, or BT-1, proved to be so ineffective that CBP removed it from the test points entirely. In each case, the breachers had to try to make hole in the wall within a set amount of time. A “breach” occurred when that gap reached a certain diameter, which is redacted in the report. We do know that each team had a measuring disc to determine whether or not they had made sufficient progress. Evaluators were on scene to collect additional information, such as how physically exhausting the task was for the individuals involved and whether that might be a deterrent. The three “major deviations” in the breaching phase of CBP’s 2017 Border Wall Mockup and Prototype Test. , CBP via FOIA There is no indication that any of the teams were able to breach any of the eight wall types using any single one of the eight methods available to them. At the same time, the report suggests that the teams only attempted to use each breaching method on a portion of the mock-ups that was as free of damage as possible and that a combination of techniques applied to the same area may have been enough to break through one or more the wall types. One test led a mock-up to suffer “compromised structural integrity” ahead of a subsequent experiment, according to CBP’s report. This, in turn, led to “unsafe conditions” and the cancellation of a portion of the testing program for that mock-up. A member of the 7th Special Forces Group uses a rotary saw to cut through an obstacle during an unrelated training exercise., US Army We also don’t know what the determining factors were in deciding how large the hole in the wall would have to be for CBP to consider it a breach. As we at The War Zone have noted before, the space necessary for a person to fit through is much different from that required for smugglers to simply pass packets of drugs or other contraband to individuals on the other side. In addition, the report confirms that the test personnel did not have access to explosives, vehicles, or other breaching methods. Breaching also only involved attempting to pierce through the wall directly, not tunnel under it . The scaling tests occurred almost concurrently, running from Nov. 28 to Dec. 16, 2017. In this instance, six BORTAC members and a lone individual from the 7th Special Forces Group tried to get over the eight prototype wall sections. Just over 20 pieces of equipment were available to these personnel for the tests. Again, citing security concerns, CBP redacted the specifics of each scaling method. However, “each prototype was attempted to be scaled with techniques appropriate for each design, as determined by the scaling experts,” according to the report. “Scaling techniques were developed prior to the test, and after the scaling experts were able to practice on the prototypes, the scaling techniques were modified as appropriate and additional techniques were developed.” As was the case with the breaching tests, the scaling experiments were all timed scenarios giving individuals a limited amount of time to get to the top. It is unclear whether or not each scaling technique involved a single person or a team, though the Associated Press’ report in January 2018 said no single individual was able to climb higher than 20 feet without assistance. A member of the 7th Special Forces Group prepares to rappel down a tower during an unrelated training exercise., US Army As such, it remains very possible that a determined team could ascend and descend, though it could take them a significant amount of time and could potentially make them vulnerable to patrolling law enforcement personnel. At the same time, as we have noted in the past , human traffickers especially might not be concerned about the safety of getting up and down from the wall, leaving individuals or small groups to weigh the risks of personal injury or being stranded in an inhospitable area along the border. In addition, neither the breaching nor the scaling tests took into account any other means of mitigating the barrier, such as attempting to smuggle people or contraband through established border checkpoints or via air or sea routes . Drug smugglers, in particular, have been experimenting with using a variety of methods to simply toss their goods over existing walls, too. CBP’s tests did not give BORTAC and U.S. military special operators a chance to try to build oversized air cannons and attempt to simply launch objects over the prototype barriers. A van-mounted air-cannon that Mexican authorities seized near the border with the United States in 2016., Policia Federal de Mexico via AP Of course, a wall made up of one or more of the different prototype construction methods is very likely to serve as a deterrent to those individuals who are simply seeking to cross the border and may fulfill that purpose just by presenting a particularly visually imposing barrier. CBP evaluators have recommended employing more than one particular type in order to have obstacles that are best matched to the particular terrain features in a given area. Unfortunately, we don’t know much about the specific construction and design benefits of the different wall designs, since CBP redacted the bulk of that information, include essentially of the basic requirements they had laid out. Their censors even removed most of the data on how 76 individuals, including 34 average residents of the greater the San Diego area, had rated how pleasing and threatening each of the eight prototype walls looked. These individuals were asked to rate factors the wall’s color hue, how smooth or rough its texture appeared, whether they liked any patterns in the design, and how the top of the wall prototype looked compared to the rest of it. They were then asked to provide similar rankings for whether the texture and the top design looked “appropriate” for an ominous barrier, how impenetrable it looked to the naked eye, and how well it provided general situational awareness. How does the hue and texture look to you?, CBP The last category has been important for the border patrol from an operational perspective. At least one of the prototypes includes a slatted bottom section that would allow law enforcement personnel to see through it and better spot individuals attempting to get through. But we have little idea how the people CBP surveyed responded. Censors redacted their final rankings of how appealing and intimidating they found the eight different structures, citing the FOIA’s (b)(7)(E) exemption . This allows the U.S. government to withhold information that “would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.” The redacted rankings of the eight border wall prototypes based on “attractive appearance” and “effective appearance.”, CBP via FOIA All this being said, whether or not the Trump Administration’s border wall project will even proceed remains to be seen. Members of Congress are still locked in a battle over funding for the project. President Trump has suggested he could seek to use U.S. military funding for the barrier, but there just isn’t enough money in the readily available portions of the Defense Department’s budget to pay for the construction, which could cost tens of billions of dollars in total, according to some estimates . What we can glean from the test report continues to raise additional questions about how effective any final wall might be in under various circumstances. But it also indicates that CBP would very likely conduct more rigorous and quantifiable testing to determine which designs might pass or fail various requirements if the project were to go ahead. CBP itself says that you shouldn’t draw any direct conclusions from these experiments, though, not even about whether the prototypes looked pretty, pretty scary, or both.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In one of its largest aerial operations over Syria in months, Israel launched strikes on a number of targets in that country. As usual, Syrian air defenses attempted to target the Israeli aircraft and standoff weapons without success. One of the surface-to-air missiles fired, which was most likely a Cold War-era S-200 (SA-5 Gammon), appears to have careened over Lebanon and across the stretch of the Mediterranean Sea that separates the partitioned island of Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean coast. It then slammed into a mountainside near a small village in the Turkish controlled portion of the island. The missile crashed roughly a dozen miles northeast of the Cypriot capital of Nicosia. According to reports, it exploded just before striking the ground, setting off a brush fire. Photos from the scene appear to show the burnt-out rear section of the large missile. Turkish Cypriot Foreign Minister Kudret Ozersay said the following in a statement on social media: “The first assessment is that a Russian-made missile, which was part of the air defense system that took place last night in the face of an air strike against Syria, completed its range and fell into our country after it missed… The pieces that fell to several different points prove that the missile exploded in the air before it crashed.” Syria is roughly 150 miles away from the impact area at its closest point, but the coastal areas near Tartus and Latakia, where Russia has a large presence, are not usually targeted by the Israeli Air Force. Southwestern Syria that borders with Lebanon, near the capital of Damascus, is. The closest point from Syrian territory in that area to the crash site is roughly 200 miles. This puts the S-200 at the very edge of its envelope, but what likely happened is Syrian air defense operators launched the missile ballistically—without acquiring a target—as part of a largely futile, but often practiced defensive tactic. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zYVswuqqq7s Israel actually intercepted another Syrian S-200 SAM fired in a similar manner in 2017 with the Israeli Defense Force’s newly operational Arrow 2 ballistic missile defense system . That system was activated by Israel’s missile defense surveillance radars due to the weapon’s parabolic trajectory. Regardless, firing off an S-200 without guidance could have sent it a very long distance as it wouldn’t have burnt off any energy to engage a target. Luckily, nobody was injured by the errant S-200. S-200. , David Birkas/Wikicommons Apparently, Israel hit targets near Damascus and near Homs during last night’s operation, with Syrian state media reporting that four were killed and 21 were injured in the strikes. Syria also says the strikes came from the Lebanese border, which is among the Israeli Air Force’s most common vectors of attack on Syrian targets. A video shot from the Lebanese coastline shows what appear to be the bright exhaust plumes of some sort of aerial vehicles roaring east towards Syria. Some have posited that these are cruise missiles launched from the sea. That is highly improbable. What is most likely being seen in the video are Israel F-16s popping-up from very low over the ocean to make a high-speed dash towards the Syrian border, with the fighters releasing their weapons just before crossing into Syrian airspace. The high-speed release gives the standoff weapons longer range and the pop-up flight profile offers Syrian air defenders little time to respond to the sudden attack. Lobbing some S-200s at the jets as they momentarily appear on radar operators’ scopes could very well have resulted in the incident on Cyprus. Isreal has stated that it has zero intention of stopping its air operations in Syria that primarily target weapons transfers from Iran to its Hezbollah proxies as well as other Iranian capabilities in the country.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 22, 2019",New AIM-260 Missiles Are So Secretive They Will Require A Custom Storage Bunker At Hill AFB,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Big news hit in late June that the USAF and the Navy have been well on their way to secretly developing an all-new beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile intended to replace the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The missile is officially called the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile, or JATM. The effort has been fast-tracked in order to counter rapid developments in long-range air-to-air missile capabilities among America’s peer state competitors and especially China . You can read all about this new missile in our recent article on it linked here , but Air Force budget documents dating back to March of 2019 appear to have been the first source to detail the program and underline just how important the Pentagon thinks the secrecy surrounding it is to national security. The USAF’s Fiscal Year 2020 military construction budget plan , dated March of 2019, details the need for $6.5M to build a “Joint Advanced Tactical Missile Storage Facility” at Hill AFB’s sprawling Site A weapons storage area. The document goes into detail about the facility and its justification, mentioning the AIM-260 by name. It states: This project is required to support the handling, inspection, and storing of the Airborne Intercept Missile (AIM)-260A Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM) assets. The AIM-260A JATM program is rapidly expanding, highly sensitive missile program developed jointly by the Air Force and Navy to countercurrent and projected potential adversary aircraft, and to maintain air superiority under any wartime scenario. Potential adversaries are modernizing and innovating, putting at risk America’s technological advantages in air and space. The AIM-260A JATM program is the number one air-delivered weapon priority for both the Air Force and the Navy; and out prioritizes other weapon system improvements and modernization efforts on any fielded aircraft. Because of the classified nature of this program, AIM 260A JATM assets cannot be housed in shared facilities with legacy munitions; and must be supported by a facility designed to meet specific operational requirements, and the stricter Special Access Program Facility security requirements. CURRENT SITUATION: There are currently insufficient numbers of suitable storage facilities on Air Force controlled land in Utah to support the obligated storage mission of this rapidly expanding program that is vital to the national security of the United States. The majority of existing facilities currently used to store legacy missile assets are WWII era Munitions Storage Magazines (MSM) or “Igloos” located in the munitions storage area of Hill AFB. These facilities were originally designed and constructed to store surplus artillery rounds and were slated for demolition due to their decrepit condition and due to the high cost to operate and maintain them. However, because of START treaty obligations, these facilities were refurbished, such that, they are now able to minimally provide a suitable environments to store a single ICBM booster each. None are available to be adapted to support the AIM-260A JATM storage mission. IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Without this projects [sic], the required rapid fielding of the AIM-260A JATM could be delayed and could put at risk our nation’s efforts to maintain air superiority advantages in highly contested environments. ADDITIONAL: This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Air Force Manual 32-1084 “Facility Requirements.” This project does not fall within or partly within the 100-year flood plain. A preliminary analysis of reasonable options for satisfying the requirement was done. Those options included renovation of existing facilities, use of DoD facilities at other bases, and new construction. The analysis indicated that new construction is the only options that will fully meet operational requirements. A formal economic analysis has been requested and will be approved prior to the president’s budget submission. Project Supporting Facilities exceed 25% of total project cost due to the extensive support work for earth covered facility. This design shall conform to criteria established in the Air Force Corporate Facilities Standards (AFCFS), the Installation Facilities Standards (IFS) [ifavailable], but will not employ a standard facility design because there is no AF standard facility design for this project and there is no applicable standard design from Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC). The description of the facility itself reads as such: Description of Proposed Construction: A 12,000 SF (1,115 SM) earth covered reinforced concrete tactical missile storage facility to have reinforced concrete footings, foundation, floor slap, and roof. Provide lightning protection, fire detection/suppression, intrusion detection, all required supporting facilities to fulfill mission requirements including: utilities, pavements, site improvements, and communication support. Facilities will be designed as permanent construction in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC)1-200-01. Sustainable principles, to include Life Cycle cost-effective practices, will be integrated into the design, development and construction of the project in accordance with UFC 1-200-02. This project will comply with DoD Antiterrorism/force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01.Air Conditioning: 30 Tons Hill AFB has a sprawling munitions storage area in its northwest corner., Google Earth The document is important for a number of reasons. First off, it is the first public description of the AIM-260 JATM program and its justification for existing that we know of and notes that it is a highly sensitive Special Access Program (SAP). It also points to the possibility of Hill AFB being among the first bases to field the AIM-260 and that the installation could also conduct testing related to its development. Beyond being the USAF’s premier operational F-35A base at this time, Hill AFB is home to live fire exercises such as the blandly named Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), which sees a constant stream of USAF fighter units deploy to the base to experience firing-off live air-to-air missiles at target drones. Because of the highly sensitive nature of this new weapon, which will have far greater range than the latest AIM-120D variant of the AMRAAM and could feature advanced capabilities, like a dual-mode seeker , it may remain more heavily classified than its predecessor even after it enters operational service. With this in mind, storing full-up live rounds in highly secure and purpose-built vault-like facilities at a handful of key bases may make some sense as opposed to dispersing them to fighter wings all over the U.S., and the planet, for that matter. Also of importance is the timeline stated in this document. This large storage facility is slated to be under construction now and finished by March of 2022. This fits perfectly with the present official timeline for fielding the weapon. The Air Force has stated that it hopes the missile will reach initial operational capability that year after beginning flight testing no later than 2021. Air Force F-22 Raptors and Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are set to be the first to carry the missiles, with all variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as potentially other platforms, following thereafter. In addition to likely testing at Hill AFB, there are also reports that JATM flight and potentially live-fire testing will also occur at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. This is not surprising given that Eglin is home to Air Force’s main Armament Directorate , the service’s central manager for the development of new aerial weapons, as well as the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Munitions Directorate . Details about the testing requirements also give a general sense about the AIM-260’s capabilities over the AMRAAM. “We’ve seen charts for the Air Force range requirements for Eglin Air Force Base showing circles for the test area for AMRAAM and the test area for the JATM,” Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of the War Zone, said on the Check 6 Podcast on June 27, 2019. “The AIM-260 missile has a range circle that’s roughly double the size of the AMRAAM circle.” USAF The construction plan, combined with the rest of this highly aggressive schedule for the AIM-260, also points to the development being quite far along already, despite having just begun in 2017. With this in mind, there is the distinct possibility that the JATM program is or has leveraged more than a decade of pre-existing development into potential AMRAAM replacements. Between 2005 and 2006, the Air Force and the Navy had started working on what was known as the Joint Dual-Role Air Dominance Missile ( JDRADM ), a single weapon to replace both the AIM-120 and the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). That program eventually evolved into the Next Generation Missile (NGM). In 2013, the Air Force that NGM was “ removed from the budget ” due to cost, but the curious framing suggested that the service might not have necessarily canceled it outright. A similar and equally secretive parallel effort known as Triple Target Terminator , or T-3, continued afterward, but there was little information on its progress. The advanced state of the JATM program and the AIM-260 suggests that the air-to-air components of NGM and T-3 at least informed the establishment of the JATM program, which has given rise to the new AIM-260. USAF The dual-use AGM-88 replacement seems to have taken a backseat to the development of the vastly improved AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER. This is set to be another impressive weapon, which The War Zone has covered in detail previously here and here . AARGM-ER is already evolving into a multi-purpose system, serving as the basis for the Air Force’s Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW), as well. The Air Force may still be eying the idea of a single weapon to replace its air-to-air and anti-radiation missiles. The service has made clear that the AIM-260 program is separate from the still-ongoing Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW) project, another secretive long-range air-to-air missile development effort. The War Zone ‘s initial analysis of the JATM program noted that giving the AIM-260 the ability to actively home in on a target’s emissions, such as the radar on an enemy aircraft, as the Air Force had envisioned with the JDRADM and NGM programs, could only increase the missile’s flexibility. It seems clear that the AIM-260 will have a similar form factor as the AIM-120 to directly take its place on the conformal stations, wingtip pylons, and in the tight confines of the internal weapons bays of the Pentagon’s numerous fighter aircraft. LREW seems more focused on creating an outsized very long-range air-to-air weapon that can be launched from external stores stations of heavy fighters and from bomber aircraft. An artist’s conception of the Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW)., USAF It still is possible that the AIM-260 could be part of a family of new air-to-air missiles that leverages shared components that can be modularly configured to meet various requirements. This could include the addition of different motor and booster sections, such as a two-stage LREW configured variant. Only time will answer these specific questions, but it seems glaringly clear that the Pentagon has finally come to terms with the fact that the AMRAAM is no longer the ‘longest stick’ in the air-to-air fight and that its next missile needs to be guarded against espionage attempts, regardless of the costs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2019",U.S. Launches Rare Strike On Al Qaeda In Western Syria Amid Shifting Regional Agenda,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though overshadowed by the curious case of a stray Syrian surface-to-air missile that missed attacking Israeli jets and flew out into the Mediterranean Sea only to crash in northern Cyprus overnight, the United States has confirmed that it also conducted a rare strike in western Syria targeting Al Qaeda-linked terrorists around the same time. This is the first such American strike in that part of Syria, at least that we know of , in some two years and the mission comes as the U.S. military reportedly continues to withdraw personnel from the eastern half of the country. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) issued a brief press release late on June 30, 2019, saying that it had targeted leaders of Al Qaeda in Syria, or AQ-S, at a training camp “near Aleppo Province.” Other reports placed the strike in the suburbs of the city of Aleppo, which is the capital of the province, though this remains unconfirmed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, told AFP that its sources had reported that six senior members of the Syrian Al Qaeda affiliate Huras Al Din, the majority of which were not Syrians, had died in the strike, along with a number of other militants. There does not appear to be any direct link between this strike and the Israeli strikes on targets in Syria further to the south that also occurred on June 30. “This operation targeted AQ-S operatives responsible for plotting external attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians,” CENTCOM’s statement read . “Northwest Syria remains a safe haven where AQ-S leaders actively coordinate terrorist activities, to include planning attacks throughout the region and in the West.” “With our allies and partners, we will continue to target Daesh and al-Qaida to prevent both groups from using Syria as a safe haven,” it continued. Daesh is another term used to refer to ISIS. A map highlighting Syria’s Aleppo Province, which sits along the Turkish border to the north., Google Maps CENTCOM’s statement did not specify what U.S. assets had conducted the strike. The operation was most likely a targeted air strike against the training camp. In the past, F-22 Raptor stealth fighters operating from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates had been the only manned aircraft actually penetrating into Western Syria at all, where the threat of Syrian air defenses , as well as those belonging to the country’s Russian and Iranian benefactors , are much more pronounced. Unmanned aircraft routinely fly in the area, too. The United States and Russia had agreed to a deconfliction arrangement that established a boundary line , effectively making western Syria a no-go zone for American forces, as well. Of course, forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, including those that the Russians and Iranians have supported , have violated this deal on numerous occasions. F-22s arrive at Al Udeid Air Base on June 27, 2019., USAF After a brief absence, F-22s returned to the Gulf region, this time to Al Udied Air Base in Qatar, on June 27, 2019 , so it is possible that those Raptors took part in the operation. Earlier in the year, the U.S. Air Force had also deployed stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters to Al Dhafra, which would have been another option for U.S. commanders deciding how to prosecute the strike. Stealth or non-stealthy aircraft could have launched stand-off weapons from Turkish air space or the Eastern Mediterranean, as well. CENTCOM’s official acknowledgment would point away from likelihood that aircraft, especially drones , from another government agency , such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), were involved in the strike. Another possibility, albeit more remote, is that the U.S. military targeted the training camp using High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) launchers firing guided artillery rockets from sites within Turkey. The United States has deployed HIMARS to Turkey to provide cross-border fire support in the past and has used the system for targeted strikes, as seen in the video below of one such operation in Afghanistan. The suburbs of Aleppo would be at the extreme edge of HIMARS’ range if the launchers were deployed to sites very close to the Syrian border. Regardless of the exact assets employed, the strike is still significant. In February 2017 , in what appears to be the last known U.S. operation of this kind in in northwestern Syria, an airstrike killed Abu Khayr Al Masri, Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader, in neighboring Idlib province, which is situated to the west of Aleppo. Idlib, which also borders Turkey, remains one of the largest strongholds for rebels and terrorists fighting Assad’s regime. It has since emerged that this air strike involved a highly specialized low-collateral damage version of the AGM-114 Hellfire missile, known as the AGM-114R9X, which has no explosive warhead and features a set of pop-out sword-like blades instead. It is still unclear whether the CIA or the shadowy Joint Special Operations Command , or both working together, were responsible for this targeted strike Al Masri. The U.S. military has never issued a statement regarding the operation. “Idlib is essentially the largest collection of al-Qaida affiliates in the world right now,” Michael Mulroy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, told a gathering at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, D.C., in April 2019. “We have very limited insights as to what’s going on.” Underscoring the complex and often convoluted nature of the conflict in Syria, as well as the actors within it, Huras Al Din only emerged in February 2018 after splitting from Hayat Tahrir Al Sham , or HTS. HTS, previously known as the Al Nusra Front , had broken away from Al Qaeda in late 2017 and has since presented itself as a more moderate entity, fighting alongside other Syrian factions against Assad. Huras Al Din itself may be in the middle of a schism and some of the individuals who reportedly died in this latest U.S. strike had apparently taken aim at other senior leaders within the group in recent weeks and threatened to form yet another splinter faction. This all also comes as the U.S. government insists that it is moving ahead with President Donald Trump’s plan to eventually withdraw all American forces from Syria. On June 28, 2019, Defense One reported that other members of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria were planning to deploy additional personnel to northeastern Syria to “backfill” departing U.S. forces. It remains unclear how many U.S. troops will remain in the country, where, and in what capacities, as well as how much American personnel will continue to support those activities from outside the country with air and artillery strikes , intelligence and surveillance assets , and logistical assistance . Jim Jeffery, presently the United States Special Representative for Syria Engagement and the Special Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIL, told Defense One : “The drawdown is continuing. The president is committed to maintaining a residual force for an indeterminate time as we continue this careful and responsible drawdown. But this drawdown was always only of American ground troops. Our expectation is the slack will be taken up by coalition forces – and we are getting a very encouraging response from them – and that we will continue to maintain our critically important air control and air operations over Northeast Syria, we will continue our ground presence at al-Tanf, and we will be ready to introduce forces to go after specific terrorist targets.” The June 30 strike on Huras Al Din, which may have killed six senior members of the group, would certainly be in line with Jeffery’s comment about remaining prepared to go after specific targets and could reflect the beginning of a shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict in Syria. The U.S. government’s regional attention is now much more firmly focused on Iran , where tensions have been steadily building for more than two months now. Almost two weeks ago, Iranian forces shot down a U.S. Navy drone, a major provocation that almost prompted U.S. military strikes . There is also the question of whether the strike may represent some sort of new agreement between the United States and Russia, the latter of which has remained categorically opposed to any American military actions in western Syria. The Syrian regime, which has branded all of the groups opposed to Assad as terrorists and also launched a new offensive with Russian support to reassert control of Idlib in April 2019 . Russian President Vladimir Putin’s personal spokesperson Dmitri Peskov has denied any formal cooperation, though Trump has, in the past, floated the idea of finding common ground with the Russians in Syria. Still, whether part of an actual formalized arrangement or not, the Syrians, as well as their allies, could easily see allowing U.S. strikes against Huras Al Din as being in service of the same immediate goal of suppressing militants in northwestern Syria. The Syrians and Russians will almost certainly cite U.S. military strikes on Al Qaeda-linked groups in the region to support of their own duplicitous narrative that Assad is only fighting terrorists in northwestern Syria. At the same time, he has also publicly called for Assad and his allies to exercise greater restraint in the latest offensive in Idlib. Reuters also reported in May 2019 that the U.S. government had also signed off on new deliveries of American-made weapons, including ever-popular TOW anti-tank guided missiles, to Turkish-backed groups fighting Assad, marking a separate U.S. shift away from primarily backing Kurdish groups in northern Syria. Trump had already tacitly endorsed Turkey and its local partners in announcing his decision to pull American forces from Syria. But whether or not the strike on the Huras Al Din actually marks the beginning of a new phase in U.S. military activity in Syria or not, it highlights the U.S. government’s continued willingness to conduct targeted strikes in northwestern Syria, despite threats from Assad and the Russians, against terrorists it sees as a direct threat to American interests.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 25, 2018",U.S. Air Force Is Planning Something Big in the Nevada Desert,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In June 2016, The War Zone ’s own Tyler Rogoway wrote an extensive and thought-provoking analysis of why the U.S. Air Force either had yet to show off a fleet of advanced, combat-capable unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), or didn’t have any at all. It’s a long but worthwhile read, especially since the service has just announced a massive and shadowy drone-related contract for work out in the Nevada desert. On April 6, 2017, as part of the Pentagon’s daily announcement of any contract awards worth over $7 million, the Air Force revealed a deal with URS Federal Services, Inc. for nearly two decades of work regarding unmanned aircraft. The official details are unusual, so feel free to read them yourself: URS Federal Services, Inc., Germantown, Maryland, has been awarded an estimated $3,600,000,000 indefinite-delivery/ indefinite-quantity contract with award fee and award term portions for remotely piloted aircraft services. Contractor will provide testing, tactics development, advanced training, Joint and Air Force urgent operational need missions. Work will be performed at Nevada Test and Training Range, Nevada; Creech Air Force Base, Nevada; and Tonopah Test Range Airfield, Nevada, and is expected to be complete by March 31, 2034. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with four offers received. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds in the amount of $2,875,894 are being obligated at the time of award. Air Force Test Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, is the contracting activity. (FA8240-17-D-4651). There’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s start right at the top. This contract with URS Federal Services is worth $3.6 billion, but the program, whatever it is, isn’t expected to end until the spring of 2034. That’s 17 years for those keeping score. The math works out to more than $210 million per year, on average, over that period or $17.5 million every month . That’s a big price tag for services. In 2013, the RAND Corporation estimated that it cost $435 million a year for the Air Force’s 20th Fighter Wing at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina to operate three squadrons of F-16C/D Vipers. This calculation included everything associated with flying the fighter jets, such as pay checks for military personnel and supporting contractors, fuel, depot-level repairs, as well as indirect support from the Wing’s other elements, including security forces guarding the flight line, civil engineers maintaining facilities, and basic utilities and supplies, such as electricity in the barracks and food in the chow halls. A similar analysis of the 187th Fighter Wing, a unit in the Alabama Air National Guard with just one squadron of Vipers, produced a final price tag of just $63.6 million. Boeing In short, the URS Federal Services’ contract could potentially cover the full costs of running multiple squadrons of pilotless planes for nearly two decades. And remember that this deal likely only pays for just a portion of the total cost of this project. So, while we don’t know what unmanned aircraft—singular or plural—the Maryland-based company will be helping test, the money involved here suggests there are quite a few of them. Of course, none of this is surprising. The Air Force and defense contractors both repeated hint at the existence of multiple top secret “black” military air and space projects. “We’re modernizing the Air Force, so you’ll see in the future new aircraft here on the ramps,” then Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said during a visit to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada in September 2016. “Then there are other things you also won’t see, because we like to have some surprises, also, for potential adversaries.” These comments were squarely in line with the Pentagon’s much-touted Third Offset Strategy , a high-technology master plan to push development of revolutionary weapons and associated systems to counter rapidly modernizing near peers. On top of that, the idea has been to produce solutions to future threats that don’t necessarily require a lot of manpower or developmental funding. A map of Nellis Air Force Base and its associated ranges, with Tonopah marked near the northwest corner., Finlay McWalter/Wikimedia But that 2016 trip to Nellis that seems especially relevant to this new arrangement with URS Federal Services. See, all of the sites mentioned in the contract announcement fall within or along the border of the base’s extended boundaries. The first of these, the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), is a massive 4,500 square mile practice space with 5,000 square miles of restricted airspace for military exercise. The area hosts the Air Force’s biggest annual mock combat events, including Red Flag . Inside the zone, fighters and attack aircraft can fire missiles, drop bombs, fly mock dogfights, and tackle surface-to-air missile threats among various other scenarios. Creech Air Force Base, the Air Force’s central hub for Predator, Reaper, and Sentinel operations, sits along the southern reaches of the NTTR, which is collocated with the National Test Site. And then there’s the matter of Tonopah Test Range and its associated airport. Regular readers of The War Zone are surely familiar with the Nevada test site’s history . Air Combat Command, the Air Force’s top warfighting command, owns the complex, but Sandia National Laboratory—which has the primary job of designing parts for nuclear weapons—technically administers the site. This obtuse arrangement and remote location make it a perfect place to test whole squadrons of shadowy aircraft and it has done so marvelously in the past. From 1984 until 1992, the base hosted the Air Force’s first operational stealth jets, Lockheed’s F-117.  Officially, the 4450th Tactical Group was situated at Nellis. The cover story was that the unit was flying A-7D Corsair II attack planes to test new tactics and equipment – sound familiar? An F-117 stealth jet., USAF In 2008, the Air Force officially retired the F-117s for good. However, the service kept a number of aircraft in so-called “Type 1000” storage at Tonopah, meaning crews had to keep them just serviceable enough to return to action in a relatively short period of time. For years afterward, there were numerous reports, along with photos and videos, indicating that at least a few of the jets were still actively flying, possibly for experimental purposes . As the stealth jets moved into storage, Tonopah became home to Lockheed’s secretive RQ-170 Sentinel . The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron had at approximately 20 of the bat-wing unmanned spy planes sitting at the desert airport until 2011. Then it moved to the Air Force’s main drone hub at Creech Air Force Base and set up a separate detachment at Vandenberg Air Force Base in neighboring California. 432d Operations Group, 432nd Wing organization as of 2011., USAF It is very possible that some sort of Sentinel operations still occur at Tonopah as well, but clearly it is the USAF’s chosen home for secretive aircraft that have moved from the developmental stages to an early operational one. Eventually, once the programs are declassified, the programs move to a more convenient home. In the F-117’s case, that was Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. For the RQ-170, it’s Creech and Vandenberg. Who’s running the program URS Federal Services will be supporting isn’t entirely clear, either. The Pentagon press release points to a confusing collection of units and bases. It says the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) awarded the contract, but adds that the specific contracting office was at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. AFTC’s headquarters is at Edwards Air Force Base in California and its website doesn’t mention a detachment at Hill, but it does has a strong connection to secretive aircraft projects and a long-standing relationship with Lockheed’s famous Skunk Works design group. A picture of an RQ-170, another previously “black” aircraft, on Guam, which the author first obtained via the Freedom of Information Act., USAF Since the April 2017 contract announcement specifically cites “joint” requirements, other services or the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) could be involved in the project. In its budget request for the 2016 fiscal year, SOCOM asked for approximately $20 million for a hangar at a classified location somewhere in the contiguous United States, which would be large enough to conceal multiple drones. Based on the type of facilities the line items described, the Air Force Special Operations Command seemed to want the structure for an unspecified test project. John Pike, director of the defense and security information website GlobalSecurity.org, agreed at the time that Tonopah was one possible location for the new, 36,000 square feet building. In addition, this budget proposal for the classified hangar came after work had already started on another massive hangar at the secretive Groom Lake test site, better known as Area 51, suggesting the two buildings were separate projects. It may turn out that the Air Force moved the bulk of the RQ-170s out of Tonopah to make room for another top secret, joint drone program. We have seen official details and other hints about various secretive Air Force aircraft projects since the Sentinels came into the light. In December 2013, veteran Aviation Week reporters Bill Sweetman and Amy Butler reported the existence of another flying-wing stealth drone, dubbed the RQ-180 . Six months later, Air Force Lieutenant General Robert Otto, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, made the unprecedented move to acknowledge the program publicly during a speech sponsored by the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. It took the service three years to cop to the existence of the Sentinel on the record. USAF In 2014, mysterious triangular planes appeared over Texas and Kansas. The next year, an Air Force report War Is Boring first obtained via the Freedom of Information Act suggested a still-unknown spy plane had already flown missions over the Pacific region two years earlier. You can read the relevant except above. Still, the details we know of URS Federal Services’ contract point to work on an entire operational concept based around something more like a more numerous UCAV fleet than a handful of “silver bullet” pilotless spy aircraft and suggests that these aircraft already exist. There’s no indication of weapon system research and development or procurement money involved in this “services” contract. The Air Force pulled almost $3 million out of a so-called “operations and maintenance” account (funds services generally set aside for things like payroll) to get URS Federal Services quickly off to work. Publicly, the Air Force has stutter-started and then canceled a number of such projects since the late 1990s as Rogoway’s piece details . Before dropping out in 2006, the Air Force had tested experimental armed unmanned aerial vehicles in partnership with the U.S. Navy under the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program. Six years later, the Air Force curiously shuttered another next-generation unmanned aircraft project, which it referred to as MQ-X, ostensibly aimed at producing a pilotless attacker. In the meantime, in response to Navy requirements, Northrop Grumman has built the revolutionary X-47B and proposed an improved X-47C variant, Boeing has flown a derivative of the X-45C —the last of the J-UCAS aircraft—called Phantom Ray , and Lockheed has shown artwork of an enlarged RQ-170 it calls Sea Ghost . An X-45A shows opens its bomb bay door during the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems program of the mid 2000s. The UCAV concept was proven to be extremely promising, then it just mysteriously disappeared. Today the USAF operates as if the technology does not exist., USAF All of this would seem to offer more hints of a “pocket UCAV force” like the one Rogoway posited in his earlier analysis. “You have to imagine that if there has been such an amazing outburst of programmatic creativity in the unclassified world, that there would have been at least as much friskiness on the classified side of the house,” Pike told me back in 2015, referring to years with a nearly endless stream of public drone prototypes and concepts. While there are just too many unknowns to be sure, given the history of the locations, the money involved, the time frame, and what we already know about separate developments, this contract suggests the Air Force is up to something big out in Nevada. We’ve already put in a Freedom of Information Act Request for documents related to the contract and we’ll be sure to follow up with any new details as we become aware of them. Update 4/12/2017: On April 11, 2017, the Air Force issued an official correction to their earlier notice as part of the Pentagon’s daily contract announcements, which said: CORRECTION: The $3,600,000,000 contract to URS Federal Services Inc. (FA8240-17-D-4651) that was announced on April 6, 2017, had the wrong contract type and statement of work. The contract type is actually a cost-plus-award-fee, indefinite-delivery requirements contract. The statement of work is range support services and not remotely piloted aircraft services as stated in the announcement. All other contract information is accurate. On that same day, we reached out to Hill Air Force Base’s public affairs office hoping to clarify the circumstances of this change. At the time of writing, we have not heard back. We are also continuing to pursue our FOIA request for the contracting documents. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces U.S. Air Force UCAVs Unmanned"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 23, 2020",Marines “Burned Out” Two Howitzer Barrels During the Raqqa Offensive,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps’ artillery support for U.S.-backed forces fighting in the Syrian city of Raqqa was reportedly so intense that units on the ground “burned out” the barrels on two of their M777 155mm howitzers during the effort to liberate the city, rendering them unsafe to use. The unprecedented volume of fire underscores the vital role the long range guns, as well as guided rockets and even mortars , have played in the campaign against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, something often overshadowed by withering air strikes against the terrorist group. U.S. Army Sergeant Major John Wayne Troxell, who presently serves as the senior enlisted adviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, gave this impressive detail to reporters on Oct. 30, 2017, according to Marine Corps Times . Troxell had recently returned earlier in the month from a trip to the Middle East that included four hours on the ground in or around Raqqa. “Every minute of every hour we were putting some kind of fire on ISIS in Raqqa, whether it was mortars, artillery, rockets, [High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems], Hellfires, armed drones, you name it,” Troxell said. “What we have seen is the minute we take the pressure off of ISIS they regenerate and come back in a hurry.” Troxell did not say how many rounds the Marines had fired from their howitzers specifically or over what time span. The U.S. military does not have an average barrel life for the M777, either, since a variety of factors can impact how fast the tube wears out. Firing heavier shells, using more propelling charge to hit targets at longer ranges, and environmental conditions can all impact the speed at which the barrels’ rifling and overall internal structure erodes, impacting both range and accuracy and ultimately making the weapons dangerous to use. The U.S. Army has a manual for calculating whether or not a unit should send the tube back to the depot for repair, but it is not available to the public. With a maximum range using regular ammunition of approximately nearly 20 miles, the Marines may have been firing every round with the highest allowable powder charge to keep themselves as far away from the actual combat as possible. In March 2016, a member of a Marine artillery unit died in Iraq after their fire base came under ISIS attack. We also don’t know how long it took the Marines in Syria to reach this breaking point. In March 2017, it emerged that the Corps had quietly deployed an artillery unit north of Raqqa, as the American-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), worked to clear ISIS from the surrounding areas . On May 16, 2017, though, the U.S. military publicly stated that a new Marine artillery unit was in Syria specifically to support the offensive into the city, which the terrorists had claimed as their de facto capital, though they did not say when it had arrived exactly. Marines unload 155mm ammunition at an artillery position in northern Syria in March 2017., USMC There’s a lot we still don’t know about the Raqqa campaign as a whole, where outside media and advocacy groups had little to no access and had to rely heavily on witness statements and official reports. There were concerns by July 2017, that the offensive had stalled in the face of heavy ISIS resistance and the terrorist group’s extensive use of tunnels and booby traps. There had already been a noticeable uptick in the aerial bombardment leading up to the initial assault, along with reported civilian casualties , as the fighting became more protracted. It still seems that air and artillery strikes, along with the increased presence of American special operations and conventional forces , were enough to break the stalemate, though some have suggested it could be a Pyrrhic victory since the city has suffered extensive damage since ISIS took control in 2013. A Marine somewhere in Syria watches as a 5-ton truck moves an M777 howitzer., USMC But even without knowing the specifics, Troxell’s comments speak to how important traditional tube artillery, as well as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS , and its 227mm guided rockets, have been in operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and their continued relevance to American military operations in general. Though often overshadowed by the air war, these ground weapons can be more versatile in many situations, something we at The War Zone have noted many times in the past. Properly positioned artillery units can often provide support much faster than calling for close air support , especially if no aircraft are already on station over the target area. Howitzers and rocket launchers can still fire in bad weather that might ground fixed wing combat aircraft or gunship helicopters, as well. And against point targets, the M777 combined with GPS-guided shells can provide just as precise support. Though there is a special precision guided 155mm round, the M982 Excalibur , official photos and video of Marines fighting ISIS have shown them using the M1156 Precision Guidance Kit. This unit slots into any 155mm shell where a normal fuze would go to quickly turn it into a precision munition. This system is simpler and cheaper than Excalibur, but is also less accurate. A round with the M1156 can hit, on average, within 100 feet of the target depending on how far away it is, while the M982 regularly strikes fewer than 20 feet from the point of impact that troops program into its guidance system. The responsiveness and precision of American artillery units has clearly been invaluable, especially in urban areas like Raqqa where ISIS fighters and friendly forces were extremely close together in areas where innocent bystanders might have also been present. In such a fluid situation, crews manning howitzers and rocket launchers might have been better positioned to adjust their fire rapidly to target militants as they fell back and took up new positions. The unprecedented use of the M777 in Iraq and Syria in particular might be part of why both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are looking to refit their guns with full-bore chrome-lined cannon tubes. In August 2017, the Army said that the Watervliet Arsenal in New York was working on a 100 of these new barrels for each service. The refitted howitzers will reportedly have almost 50 percent greater barrel life over weapons with the original all-steel types. The Marines first tested the modified design in 2016 and Watervliet expects there will be more orders in the future. “Given that there are more than 1,000 of these gun systems in the Army and Marine inventory,” George Roach, the product manager for the chrome barrel program at Watervliet, said in August 2017. “There is potential for the arsenal to receive more orders for full-bore chrome barrels as these orders only reflect about 20 percent of the inventory.” An worker at Watervliet arsenal removes 155mm cannon barrels from an industrial furnace after a heat-treating process has brought them to nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit., US Army Unfortunately, the Marines don’t expect to receive the first new barrels until 2019, “given the long lead time to procure raw stock materiel,” according to the Army. So units in Iraq or Syria probably won’t be seeing refitted howitzers any time soon. Hopefully, with ISIS fully on the defensive, the fighting will slow to the point where M777 crews can get replacement parts or guns – or new units can take over – before anyone burns out another barrel.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 15, 2018",Congress Demands Space-Based Missile Defense Weapons and Sensors No Matter What,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. lawmakers from the House and Senate have agreed on a final version of the approximately $716 billion defense spending bill for the 2019 fiscal year, which requires the U.S. military begin work on developing new warning satellites to spot incoming ballistic missiles and weapons to blow them up from space. The draft law requires the Missile Defense Agency to pursue these programs even if it argues against them in an up-coming ballistic missile defense strategy review, which might be setting the Pentagon up for a battle with Congress, but might also highlight the opinions of certain senior U.S. military leaders . Legislators announced they had agreed on a single version of the law , formally known as the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, on July 23, 2018. The House expects to put the measure to a vote by the end of the month and then send it to the Senate in August 2018. If it passes both chambers, then it would go to President Donald Trump to become law. Near the end of Subtitle E, the portion of the bill that covers dedicated missile defense efforts, are two separate sections, 1660C and 1660D. Their language is relatively sparse since they only serve to modify two portions of the previous National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal cycle. The impact of these changes, however, is anything but minor. In both cases, the draft law removes the following phrase “If consistent with the direction or recommendations of the Ballistic Missile Defense Review that commenced in 2017” from the existing law. The video below provides an overview of the U.S. military’s existing ballistic missile defense shield. This means the Pentagon is no longer allowed to wait until that report is ready to decide whether or not to begin working on putting sensors and weapons in space to defend against ballistic missile threats. In addition, the wording in the draft bill would prevent the Missile Defense Agency , which will be in charge of these projects, from halting this work even if the review recommends abandoning the space-based systems. Legislators look set to establish a fixed and aggressive schedule for these developments, as well. The sensors need to be deployed no later than the end of 2022, according to another change to the existing sections. Based on the existing language in the defense spending bill for the 2018 fiscal year, the lawmakers want to the Missile Defense Agency to come up with a plan to finish development of the space-based weapons to destroy incoming missiles within a decade and potentially start testing a prototype system in 2022, which would be when the sensors are supposed to go online. The space-based weapons will be “regionally focused.” That is to say, it will be positioned to respond to threats from only one specific part of the world, such as the area around Iran or North Korea . Iran’s Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missile, one of the country’s most advanced designs., AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi They will also be configured to destroy hostile missiles during their vulnerable boost phase right at the beginning of their flight. It’s worth noting that the U.S. military is already pursuing aerial boost phase intercept concepts, using either solid-state lasers mounted on high-flying drones and a physical kinetic weapon , as well. The goal for the space-based system is to achieve “an operational capability at the earliest practicable date,” according to the defense budget law for fiscal year 2018. Beyond offering an additional layer of defense, any boost phase intercept system also provides an additional deterrent quality, since it threatens to drop portions of the missile right back down on the country that launched it. Depending on the missile’s payload, this could include radioactive material from a nuclear warhead or chemical or biological agents. Even though we don’t know what the conclusions of the up-coming Ballistic Missile Defense Review might be, it seems easy to see how this language could put the U.S. military in a bind. Lawmakers are essentially telling it to disregard its own expert advice on space-based systems, no matter what it is. Even if the final report recommends pursuing some combination of sensors and weapons, the Missile Defense Agency won’t be able to act on those suggestions rather than following Congress’ direction. At most, it could try to follow both sets of guidance simultaneously. The change in the language reflects the clearly growing anxiety among legislators about the potential for ballistic missile attacks against the United States from various countries, especially North Korea . There was a flurry of North Korean developments in 2017, especially the debut of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which could potentially carry a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. This helped in no small way to push lawmakers to increase spending on ballistic missile defense that year and include the provisions for additional systems, such as the space-based systems, in the fiscal year 2018 defense budget bill in the first place. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest Congress and the Pentagon may actually be thinking along similar lines when it comes to missile defense in space. The two sides were in alignment on the growing importance of the ballistic missile defense shield in 2017, even if the Pentagon was reticent to divert additional resources to it from existing priorities, at least initially. This attitude has steadily changed. “There are not enough ships, there are not enough islands in the Pacific that radars can answer all of your sensor questions,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, in charge of U.S. Strategic Command, explained to reporters at a missile defense-related event the Association of the U.S. Army hosted in February 2018. “[The U.S. military is] going to have to go to space.” US Air Force General John Hyten, then head of Air Force Space Command, speaks at an event in 2016., USAF Hyten spoke specifically about the need to speed up development and fielding of the Midcourse Tracking Sensor, which will be able to track threats in the cold vacuum of space. At present, U.S. military surface- and space-based sensors primarily spot and track missiles during launch and again when the warheads they carry begin to come down at the other end of their flight trajectory. One of the existing sensors, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), may have some limited “cold body tracking” functionality, but not to the desired level. Really, the biggest limiting factors are the logistics and costs associated with deploying enough radars, which can have a relatively narrow field of view , and satellites to provide persistent coverage. Without a more robust capability, though, there is an ever more dangerous gap in the stream of information where traditional ballistic missiles have a perfect opportunity to deploy decoys or other countermeasures to throw off defenders. The existing combination of systems also has no effective means of monitoring the travel of hypersonic vehicles while they are briefly in space or as they careen through the upper atmosphere. You can read about these issues and the Midcourse Tracking Sensor in more detail here . At the same time, this clear need to have advanced anti-ballistic missile sensors in space, and improving U.S. military capabilities in space broadly , has revived discussions about putting actual weapons of some sort up there, too. In March 2018, Michael Griffin, the present Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, highlighted various possible weapons that could be well suited for space-based missile defense applications, especially various types of directed energy weapons, at the 2018 Directed Energy Summit, which private firm Booz Allen Hamilton hosted. “I’m going to be very welcoming of other approaches that may not have had a lot of focus in recent years or recent decades,” Griffin said . “I would urge us to keep a lot of arrows in our quiver as we go forward figuring out how we’re going to translate directed energy technologies into warfighting systems that are going to defend this country and our allies.” Michael Griffin, left, then administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shakes hands with then Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne in 2006., USAF Still, even if space-based defenses supporters in Congress and Pentagon find themselves in agreement, it is unlikely that there will be unanimous support for these projects throughout the legislature or the public at large. Ballistic missile defenses are already a controversial and often misunderstood topic, as we at The War Zone have previously examined in detail . Space-based weapons, whether they are advanced directed energy weapons or physical interceptors, have historically proven to be complex, expensive, and unreliable. Griffin probably knows this as well as anyone, having been a member of President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative . This program became derisively known as “ Star Wars ” and was associated with a host of technologies experts decried at the time as impractical , exorbitantly expensive , or both. The interception portion included space-based lasers, particle beams , railguns , and finally, an elaborate orbital weapon system known as “ Brilliant Pebbles .” An artists conception of a Brilliant Pebble interceptor, the front of which is the light detection and ranging (LIDAR) receiver camera, encased inside its “life jacket” satellite. On command, the satellite would split apart and the pebble would move to intercept the target missile., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory This final concept involved relatively small satellite-based kinetic interceptors that would be scattered throughout orbital space and activated as necessary. By 1990, the plan was to build 4,600 individual interceptors at a total cost of $55 billion – equal to more than $95 billion today. This didn’t include the funds necessary to support the “ Brilliant Eyes ” sensors that would have supported the complete system. In 1993, President Bill Clinton canceled the program and renamed the Strategic Defense Initiative as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization , the predecessor to today’s Missile Defense Agency. A quarter of a century later, the U.S. military seems to be ready to give this another shot and Congress seems eager to push it along. Technology has advanced considerably since the U.S. government scrapped Brilliant Pebbles, including with regards to solid-state lasers , high-power microwaves , and railguns . An artist’s conception of the pebble itself., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Regardless, it’s still unclear if there are any systems, and the sensors necessary to cue them in space, that have reached a place where space-based missile defense is feasible at a price that is practical. There’s also the question about whether the United States could deploy them, even with a limited regional focus , at a cost that doesn’t threaten to eat away at other defense spending priorities. It will be hard to get ever around the reality that it is and is likely to remain cheaper and simpler for any potential opponent to just build more missiles than it is to devise ways to intercept them. There will almost certainly be concerns about the militarization of space broadly , as well, especially since many of the weapons in question could potentially engage other types of targets beyond ballistic missiles. At present, the Outer Space Treaty bans signatories, including the United States, from placing nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in orbit, but has no such stipulations about conventional systems. The U.S. government has blocked subsequent efforts at the United Nations to fully outlaw the deployment of any space-based weapon. “There is a lot of [skepticism] about the technical feasibility and the cost, and those are valid concerns, those aren’t unrealistic concerns. We should always be worried about that,” General Hyten said in said in February 2018 at the Association of the U.S. Army event. “It has caused the department to continue to look at it and say: ’We are not quite ready, we need to study it a little more.’ But I think we are ready now.” With the language in the latest draft defense spending bill, Congress seems determined to find out as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2018",Royal Navy Will Retrofit Type 45 Destroyers To Keep Them From Breaking Down,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Defense contractor BAE Systems has secured a contract worth approximately $226 million to upgrade the diesel generators on board the U.K. Royal Navy’s six Type 45 destroyers . This is the second part of a two-phase program, called Project Napier, which aims to finally fix a long-standing reliability issue with the ships that could leave them stranded without any power and render them combat ineffective in the middle of a crisis. Under its part of Project Napier, also called the Power Improvement Project (PIP), BAE, together with subcontractors BMT Defense Services and Cammell Laird, will replace the two existing diesel generators on each Type 45, add a third one, and modify the high voltage systems on the ships to handle the additional power. This is on top of the Equipment Improvement Plan (EIP), in which Rolls-Royce is working to upgrade certain components of the destroyers’ gas turbines. The U.K. Ministry of Defense expects the first destroyer with all the new modifications will be ready by the end of 2021 and the entire the fleet will have received the upgrades by sometime in the early 2020s. “The PIP will ensure the fleet of highly sophisticated Type 45s can continue to be deployed successfully on operations around the globe, protecting the U.K.’s interests worldwide,” the country’s Ministry of Defense said in a statement. “Our aim is to rapidly restore command confidence in the power and propulsion system of the Type 45 fleet, demonstrate value for money, and safeguard vital skills for future generations of warship support,” David Mitchard, the Managing Director of BAE Systems Maritime Services, said in a separate press release. HMS Diamond , one of the Royal Navy’s six Type 45 destroyers., Crown Copyright When Mitchard talks about restoring confidence in the system, he’s referring to power generation problems that have plagued the Type 45s since the Royal Navy commission the lead ship, HMS Daring , in 2009. At the core of the issue is the design of the destroyer’s advanced integrated electric propulsion system . At present, the system uses a pair of Rolls-Royce WR-21 gas turbines and two Wärtsilä diesel generators to produce high voltage electric power, which then runs a pair of General Electric induction motors that propel the ship. Transformers also siphon off some of that power to run the ship’s various on board systems. One of the main benefits of this arrangement is that it can be relatively compact compared to traditional ship power plants, allowing for the electric motors to sit closer to the propellers, reducing the overall length necessary for the driveshaft. It also gives ship designers more freedom to arrange components with a hullform and situate them in ways that are better suited to routine maintenance and replacing entire components. The gas turbines on the Type 45s were also supposed to be significantly more efficient that previous designs, allowing for one turbine-and-generator pairing to power the ship during regular, non-combat activities. This in turn would reduce wear and tear and fuel requirements, and leading to lower operating costs overall. An overhead view of one of the Royal Navy’s Type 45s., Crown Copyright Unfortunately, the Type 45’s complete engine arrangement has proven to be inherently unreliable. The biggest issue doesn’t actually have to do with the generators or the electric motors, or even the design of the gas turbines, at all. The problem lies primarily with one additional component, called an intercooler-recuperator , on the gas turbines. This feature takes the heat the engine produces and uses it to improve the efficiency of the overall system. In redirecting that thermal energy, the setup actually helps keep other parts cool. The Northrop Grumman-designed device has been a weak link from the very beginning, breaking down on a regular basis . This in turn can cause the turbine to fail entirely. When that happens, the electrical load builds up in the attached generator, which at a certain point trips a failsafe mechanism, causing it to shut down, too. If this happens, the entire arrangement is no longer generating power. If both sets of turbines and generators fail, the ship no longer has any power at all for propulsion or to run vital systems, leaving it effectively dead in the water until engineers can fix the problem. This is bad enough during regular sailing, but it could be deadly in a combat situation or any other crisis. It is known that HMS Daring ’s engines broke down in 2010 and again in 2012 . HMS Daultless lost power during a training exercise in 2014. Then in 2016, ships had to tow HMS Duncan back to port just two days after she left. Tugs maneuver HMS Duncan through a canal in Cardiff in Wales in 2014., Crown Copyright These issues are not necessarily unique to the Type 45s. As a general rule, modern guided missile destroyers typically have significant power requirements on account of the need to run powerful air defense radars, sensor and combat management suites, and other missions systems. As such, the U.S. Navy encountered similar issues with its attempts to retrofit its Arleigh Burke -class destroyers with a similar hybrid electric drive that also featured three generators, with one being on standby in case of a failure. The two active generators could barely handle the strain of running the ship’s Aegis radar and powering the electric motors turning the drive shafts at the same time. “At that point you are a light switch flipping on away from winking out the whole ship,” a Navy official told Defense News’s David Larter . That American service has now scrapped plans to install the drives on 34 ships, leaving only USS Truxtun with the new propulsion system. But the design flaw in the intercoolers on the Type 45s was apparently a known issue even before the ships entered service. It was only supposed to occur primarily in operations in extremely warm climates and even then only produce problems gradually, giving the crew ample time to remediate the problems before a major break down occurred. “The WR-21 gas turbines were designed in extreme hot weather conditions to what we call ‘gracefully degrade’ in their performance, until you get to the point where it goes beyond the temperature at which they would operate,” Royal Navy Admiral Sir Philip Jones, who is First Sea Lord, the United Kingdom’s top naval officer, told members of the country’s parliament in 2016 . “We found that the resilience of the diesel generators and the WR-21 in the ship at the moment was not degrading gracefully; it was degrading catastrophically.” Jones defended the design decision by saying that it would have been “poor value-for-money” to buy ships designed to weather any temperature. But at the same time he added that the ships had trouble especially during the summer months in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, two areas where the Royal Navy routinely conducted operations when the ships first entered service and continues to do so today. First Sea Lord Royal Navy Admiral Sir Philip Jones., Andrew Milligan/PA Wire via AP The new generators and electrical systems will help prevent a total breakdown in the event of a turbine failure. Rolls-Royce is in the process of building an intercooler-recuperator that will be more reliable and successfully tested the first prototype system in 2017. The Royal Navy expects the full cost of both phases of the Project Napier upgrades to be more than $350 million. Improving the reliability of the Type 45s is a critical issue for the service, especially as it prepares to begin operations with its new super carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , which could occur as early as 2021. The aircraft carrier will already require significant escorts if the United Kingdom intend to operate in anything approaching a contested environment and even more so given that it is woefully lacking in defenses itself. Workers can reportedly perform the intercooler-recuperator modifications in four weeks, which is within the time frame of normal in-port maintenance availabilities, according to a report by Defense News . The generator work will be significantly more intensive, reportedly requiring technicians to physically cut holes into the ships’ hulls to get at the necessary components. The project already costs money the U.K. Ministry of Defense can barely afford to spend. In 2017, it emerged that it was considering a number of plans, including severe cuts to the Royal Navy’s amphibious capabilities , to try and help free up funds and sailors primarily for Queen Elizabeth . Any delays or other issues might lead to cost overruns with Project Napier that could further eat into resources that are already stretched thin . The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth ., Andrew Matthes-PA Wire/PA Images There might be more defense spending trimming still to come as the United Kingdom’s economy struggles as the country moves ahead with plans to leave the European Union, also known as the British Exit, or Brexit. In January 2018, the U.K. government put existing budget cuts on hold pending an independent review, in no small part because of outrage from members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s own Conservative Party over the proposals, but its unclear if they’ll be able to completely avoid these demands for more austerity in the end. “The program is dependent on the availability of ships to undertake the conversion, balanced against the Royal Navy’s standing and future operational commitments,” the U.K. Ministry of Defense said somewhat ominously in its official notice about the PIP contract. The issue, of course, is that without the upgrades, the Type 45s may not be able to meet those operational demands anyways. In December 2017, the Royal Navy admitted that all six of the destroyers were pierside for one reason or another. There are rumors that HMS Diamond , which returned to port in 2017 after suffering a propeller shaft failure, has effectively become a test ship for the turbine and generator upgrades, which could keep here out of action for months. HMS Diamond at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Portsmouth., Crown Copyright And unlike the services Type 23 frigates, which it plans to replace with a mixture of new Type 26 and 31e frigates , the Type 45s are expected to continue serving on for the foreseeable future. If they keep ending up in port for heavy maintenance, though, the ships may end up being available for the modifications whether the Royal Navy likes it or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 21, 2019","Israel Details Long Secret Raid On Syrian Nuclear Reactor, Says It’s Willing To Do It Again","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though there was never any real doubt, more than a decade later, the Israeli government has finally acknowledged that the country was responsible for destroying a secret Syrian nuclear reactor and declassified a number of details, along with video and images, about the intelligence process and the complex air strike itself. This decision seems to have been a response to a confluence of factors, including the present situation in Syria , renewed debate about Iran’s controversial nuclear program , and domestic political rivalries. On March 21, 2018, Israel lifted its gag order on official statements about the mission , officially called either Operation Orchard or Operation Soft Melody, but also referred to within the country’s military as Operation Outside the Box. We now know for sure that at least eight aircraft took part, including four F-15I “Ra’am” (Thunder) from the Israeli Air Force’s 69 Squadron and four F-16I “Sufa” (Storm) each from 119 and 253 Squadrons. On the night of Sept. 5-6, 2007, the planes streaked through Lebanon and across nearly the full length of Syria and dropped approximately 17 tons of precision guided bombs on the reactor building, nicknamed “Rubik’s Cube” or just “the Cube,” before heading north and departing the area via Turkish airspace. “The nuclear reactor being held by Assad would have had severe strategic implications on the entire Middle East,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in an official statement, according to Defense News. And given that the site was in a remote part of Syria’s still hotly contested eastern Deir ez-Zor Governorate , “the security implications of a nuclear reactor falling into the hands of [ISIS] or other extremist groups during the war in Syria are vast.” An intelligence puzzle The roots of the 2007 mission trace directly back to at least 2004, when Israel’s Mossad national intelligence agency and IDF military intelligence elements began picking up spotty reports about a potential Syrian nuclear program and foreign specialists helping with that effort. According to various Israeli and international media reports that have now emerged, the Israeli intelligence community spent the next year going back and forth about what to make of this information. A newly released image of one of the F-16Is that took part in the mission. Notice the jet only carriers the navigation pod of its LANTIRN system, with the targeting pod left off. This was likely because it delivered GPS guided weapons. , IDF There were indications that the Syrian government had been interested in acquiring nuclear weapons for decades, dating back to the regime of Hafez Al Assad. But long-time Syria analysts within the Israeli government reportedly questioned whether his son, Bashar Al Assad, who took over the country after his father’s death in 2000, would really push ahead with this project. This debate raged on even after satellite imagery revealed the existence of the Cube at Al Kibar in Eastern Syria in April 2006. There was nothing else near the building and though its obscure location seemed to clearly indicate a desire to hide it from prying eyes, there was little verified information about what was inside. The eventual construction of a pipeline further pointed to a cooling system for a nuclear reactor, but again there was no corroborating evidence. A grainy, low-resolution shot of the Cube at Al Kibar under construction., US Government The big break came in 2007, when Israeli agents obtained actual photographs of the reactor under construction inside the building and what appeared to be North Korean specialists working at the site. How this actually occurred is one of many details about how Israel first uncovered the Syrian nuclear project and the operation to destroy the facility that remain state secrets. However, a 2012 report in The New Yorker says this happened because of a glaring lapse in judgment by Ibrahim Othman, the head of the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission. On a trip to Vienna Austria in March 2007 to attend a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Board of Governors, Othman, for reasons that remain unclear, was carrying a laptop with the images and host of other highly sensitive information. Mossad agents reportedly broke into Othman’s Austrian home while the Syrian official had stepped out for one of the IAEA’s gatherings and scraped everything from his computer. An image of the Al Kibar reactor pit, which may have come from Ibrahim Othman’s computer., US Government “A team of Mossad agents succeeded in bringing the information in the way that it knows how. Other than that, I won’t elaborate,” former Mossad head Tamir Pardo said at a conference on March 21, 2018. “It was pure luck that this group of agents succeeded in bringing this information.” Pardo was at the gathering to honor the memory of his predecessor Meir Dagan, who was in charge of the spy agency as it gathered information on the Syrian reactor and in the lead up to the actual attack in 2007. Dagan died in 2016. A view of the actual Al Kibar reactor under construction., US Government A hidden reactor The new information confirmed without any doubt that the Syrians were building a nuclear reactor and that it was doing so with help from North Korea. In addition, the design mirrored the one at Yongbyon , which the North Koreans used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, strongly indicating its purpose was to support a larger weapons program. That information did not apparently make deciding what to do any easier, though. As Israeli intelligence agents and analysts had picked apart Syria’s nascent nuclear efforts, the country had found itself in a brief, but violent conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group that receives support from both Syria and Iran, in Lebanon . The fighting had exposed serious issues with the IDF’s readiness, shown Hezbollah to be a capable fighting force, and generally proven to be a debacle for a government led by an already unpopular Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Israeli authorities would subsequently release a damning review of the operation that bluntly described it as having failed to achieve any appreciable objectives. With this experience in mind, and IDF reforms still underway, there were serious questions about whether the country could counter to any retaliation from Syria, or even its proxies such as Hezbollah, in response to an attack on the reactor complex. Beyond that, Olmert had brought in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak to serve as his defense minister after reshuffling his cabinet in the aftermath of the conflict and the relationship between the two men did not turn out to be a positive one. Ehud Barak, left, and Ehud Olmert in 2008., Peer Grimm/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP To this day, the two former leaders offer contradictory accounts of how they ultimately arrived at the decision to blow up the reactor building. Though he expertly declined to name names, ex-Mossad chief Pardo said the success of the final operation was clouded by a “war of egos.” As a result, in the weeks prior to the strike, Israeli officials discuses a number of different options, including publicly outing Syria’s nuclear program, privately approaching Assad through intermediaries, or some type of military operation. They even met with then U.S. President George W. Bush and members of his administration on the matter, hoping the U.S. military might be able to take care of the matter and assume responsibility for the aftermath. The Bush administration, still smarting from intelligence failures with regards to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, declined to take part. The U.S. intelligence community agreed with their Israeli counterparts that the Cube was a covert nuclear reactor, but without any information about an active nuclear weapons program to go along with it, reportedly viewed it as a low priority issue. The Israelis disagreed. In 1981, then Prime Minister Menachem Begin had made it state policy that Israel would not allow any potential enemies to threaten the countries destruction with nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. That year, the IDF launched another successful mission to destroy Iraq’s nuclear reactor at Osirak, codenamed Operation Opera . Then Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin makes an address during a visit to the United States in 1978., USAF Planning the strike How to best launch the strike remained open for debate. The Israelis felt that giving Assad space to plausibly deny that the Cube was actually a North Korean-designed nuclear facility could help reduce the possibility of a response. A small, swift strike, would also limit the chances of the Syrians viewing the operation as the prelude to another all-out war. “I wasn’t worried about operational success of the attack, but about the danger of it triggering a war,” Israeli Air Force Major General Amos Yadlin, who was head of the IDF’s main military intelligence arm at the time and had actually been among the pilots who carried out the 1981 strike in Iraq. “Syria could have launched 100 missiles at us the following morning and we would have been in an entirely different situation.” An undated satellite image of the Cube., US Government Added to these concerns was the fact that the longer Israel spent trying to craft the perfect plan, the more likely it was that the Syrians would add actual nuclear fuel to the reactor and that it might become operational. If that happened, there would be the added risk that a strike might create a radiological disaster. There was also a danger that leaks in the press or elsewhere might reveal the extent of Israel’s knowledge about the Syrian nuclear program and prompt Assad to fortify the area with his best air defenses , making the operation even riskier. In the end, news that a U.S. journalist had begun asking questions about Syria’s reported work in this area pushed the Israeli government to approve the operation . Various images Israeli officials released along with declassifying the operation into Syria in 2007., IDF Much about the mission itself remains classified. The four F-15Is and four F-16Is carried various precision-guided bombs, including bunker busters . The decision to use this mix of aircraft, carrying what appears from official videos and images to be both laser- and GPS/INS-guided munitions, was to provide redundancy and flexibility in order to ensure that there would be enough ordnance to fully destroy the site and that the pilots could hit their mark regardless of any environmental or other factors. Laser-guided weapons are generally more precise, but clouds, dust, and other obscurants can block the beam and throw them off course. And though the F-15Is and F-16Is are optimized for long-range missions with conformal fuel tanks and underwing drop tanks, the task force did also include aerial refueling tankers . These aircraft likely orbited in the Mediterranean to help the jets make their final sprint home after leaving Turkish airspace. Another newly declassified official image from the operation, showing an F-16I with what appear to be two 2,000-pound-class bunker buster bombs. , IDF Many details remain classified But intelligence and electronic warfare assets , among others, would have had to play an essential part in both the mission planning and execution. There’s just a low chance that eight fourth generation Israeli jets without any low-observable features would have been able to zip across Syria, even at low altitudes, and then out through Turkey without either country being aware of it. Turkish authorities reportedly only knew the aircraft had exited by way of their country after some of the planes jettisoned their drop tanks. It was highly embarrassing for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who then still had good relations with Israel and had not gotten advance notice of the operation, and prompted an official apology from Prime Minister Olmert. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Villard/Pool/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP It is widely believed that Israel disrupted or disabled Syrian air defense and communication systems using a computer program known as Suter , which BAE Systems had first developed for the U.S. Air Force. Different versions of this system reportedly allow the user to monitor enemy radar information or even take control of those systems to actively misdirect or disable them. There are also reports that unmanned aircraft may have been involved in the mission. These drones could have surveilled the site in the lead up to the strike or helped provide bomb damage assessments afterwards to confirm the site’s total destruction. Whatever the case, the operation was successful, with pilots reportedly relaying the codeword “Arizona” across the radio to confirm the strike had destroyed the reactor site. Israeli authorities then issued the gag-order on details about the mission, even censuring Benjamin Netanyahu , who’s Likud party was then chief among the country’s political opposition, for releasing too much information. Netanyahu had implied to the press that he had been the one to push Olmert to action. Images the IDF released showing the cube before the strike, at left, and afterwards. These appear to be stills from video the F-15Is and F-16Is filmed during the operation., IDF Given what became known as the “ zone of denial ,” Assad was able to claim falsely that his air defenses had chased off the attackers, who had been unable to cause any substantial damage. It almost quickly became clear, however, that the almost certainly Israeli strike had leveled a covert nuclear reactor. IAEA investigations starting in 2008 provided public evidence that the Syrians had been running an undeclared nuclear program. Subsequent satellite imagery of Al Kibar showed Syrian authorities had first erected another structure to cover the remnants of the reactor site and had then dismantled much of the equipment before the area steadily fell into the hands of first the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front in 2012 and then came under ISIS control. U.S.-backed Arab and Kurdish forces now occupy much of Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Why declassify the operation now? That Israel’s connection to the strike was well established, if unofficially, and that there is no real question about the existence of Syria’s nuclear program or its connection to North Korea, does raise questions about why the country has decided to acknowledge this operation now. The most obvious reason would be to send a signal to Syria, Iran, and any other potential opponents that Israel remains able and willing to respond to such threats. “The message of the attack on the reactor in 2007 is that Israel will not accept the construction of a capability that threatens the existence of the State of Israel,” IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot said in a statement. “That was the message in ’81 [with the strike in Iraq]. That was the message in 2007. And that is the message to our enemies for the future.” You can watch IDF Chief of Staff Eisenkot’s full statement below: Israel might feel it is important to reiterate the Begin Doctrine given that Assad appears to be firmly in power in Syria, thanks almost entirely to his Russian and Iranian benefactors, even if it’s debatable how much control his regime actually exerts throughout much of the country. This stability, and the protection he’s afforded especially by Russia’s involvement in the country, definitely appears to have emboldened the Syrian military to continue its brutal and indiscriminate assaults in rebel-held areas. These operations continue to include chemical weapons despite very public threats from the United States and other countries . There are also reports about continuing and potentially increasing North Korean and Iranian connections to Syrian advanced weapons programs, including chemical agent and ballistic missile production. Beyond the immediate area, there is a very real possibility that the United States may abrogate the international deal with Iran over its nuclear program. As a candidate and President, Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the agreement, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and his administration took a newly hard line on the issue in 2017. President Donald Trump announced the US government’s new Iran policy in October 2017., Al Drago/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP The War Zone has already written in detail about the JCPOA and the debate surrounding its effectiveness, which you can find here . Whatever the deal’s actual merits, there is a real concern that without it, Iran could decide to push ahead with building nuclear weapons. Israel has reportedly actively considered striking Iranian nuclear sites in the past, but has previously acquiesced to U.S. government pressure not to do so unilaterally. The Trump administration could be far more accommodating if Israeli officials were to contemplate such an operation again in the future, especially if the Iran deal collapses. Releasing information about the 2007 strike could help Israel make sure the regime in Tehran understands that those threats are and remain credible. But there’s no real indication that there is any debate about Israel’s willingness to defend itself in this regard. Since Syria descended into civil war in 2011, Israeli aircraft have struck targets in the country, particularly those linked to Hezbollah, on multiple occasions . More recently, the Israeli Air Force has extended those strikes to include more regime targets, including those potentially full of Iranian or Iranian-backed forces. And in line with the Begin Doctrine, Israel has struck sites linked to Syria’s chemical weapons and other advanced weapons projects. An F-16I during a training exercise., IAF This doesn’t include operations further afield since 2007, either. In 2009, its jets reportedly flew all the way to Sudan in order to destroy arms bound for the Palestinian militant group Hamas. These sorts of operations have long been a core component of Israeli foreign policy and the ability to do so was driving force in the country’s push to transform its early F-15s into long-range, multi-role combat aircraft more than four decades ago. Four years after the mission to Osirak, Israel employed those jets to fly down the Mediterranean and attack the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s headquarters outside Tunis in Tunisia. And Israeli aircraft has conducted the operations in Syria despite threats from Assad and risks to its own personnel. In February 2018 , in response to an Iranian drone entering Israeli airspace from Syria, Israel launched air strikes that resulted in the loss of multiple aircraft to Syrian air defenses. An Israeli F-35I Adir., IAF An ongoing “war of egos” In actuality, domestic politics might be bigger driving force behind Israel’s decision to declassify details about the operation. On May 14, 2018, the country will celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding and the 2007 strike reflects one of the most important and successful foreign policy decisions the country has faced in the last 30 years. On top of that, the IDF might be keen to present its own version of the facts ahead of the publication of dueling memoirs from Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak, which are set to come out later in 2018. The two men continue to spar over their respective records and vehemently and publicly disagree about who had taken what position over the Syrian nuclear issue. This “war of egos” likely extends to Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now Israel’s Prime Minister, is a harsh critic of the Iran Deal, and happens to be under investigation for corruption . He is also considering calling snap elections , which some accuse him of using as way to deflect attention from the probes into his business dealings. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu., Albin Lohr-Jones/Sipa USA via AP “I am not sure it was right to release information about this operation now,” former Mossad Head Pardo said. “Maybe eight years ago, or maybe eight years from now.” Whatever the exact reasoning behind the release, it can only send yet another message to Israel’s potential opponents that it does remain very willing to launch complex and risk strikes in response to existential threats. It’s almost certain we will continue see more such Israeli operations in Syria, and potentially elsewhere, in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 28, 2018",Lockheed Is Proposing a Major ‘Triple Intelligence’ Upgrade for the U-2 Spy Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force seems to have effectively abandoned plans to retire its fleet of U-2S Dragon Lady spy planes in the near future. Now, amid especially high demands for strategic intelligence and concerns about a gap in aerial battlefield surveillance capabilities , Lockheed Martin is pitching proposals to give the iconic aircraft upgraded sensors and data links , as well as the ability to carry three different intelligence gathering systems all on the same mission. Our good friend Stephen Trimble , head of Flightglobal’s Americas Bureau, was first to get the new details after getting an exclusive tour of Lockheed Martin’s Site 2 hangar, part of the company’s facilities in Palmdale, California earlier in March 2018. Site 2 is home to the firm’s U-2 program and is where it performs heavy depot maintenance on the planes for the Air Force. As a rule, the service sends each U-2 to the facility for a full overhaul approximately every 4,800 flight hours. “My strategy is to put as much as we can within the [US military’s next six-year budget plan], because we’ve got room to grow,” Kyle Franklin, Lockheed Martin’s U-2 program manager, told FlightGlobal during the visit. This is a significantly different attitude than the company might have had even last year. Since 2011, the Air Force has gone back and forth on the idea of supplanting the Dragon Ladies with RQ-4 Global Hawk drones. As recently as 2016, the service still planned to retire the U-2S no later than 2020. A U-2S Dragon Lady., USAF Its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released in February 2018, suggests that this is unlikely to happen any time soon. The proposal includes funding for U-2S upgrades and sustainment through at least 2023. The Air Force even says it expects to grow the size of the fleet from 24 to 27 by the end of 2018, even though it says it will then retire one older aircraft by the end of the following year. As such, Lockheed Martin is very clearly expecting to be involved in the U-2 program for the foreseeable future. The centerpiece of the company’s latest push is a newly proposed “Tri-Intelligence” or “Tri-INT” configuration for the planes. An official chart showing the Air Force’s projected active component aircraft inventory between fiscal years 2017 and 2019., USAF This refers to an aircraft with three distinct sensor suites. These would be a multi-spectral camera, a radar imaging system, and a set of equipment to collect various different types signals. At present, the Dragon Ladies can only bring two of these three distinct capabilities along on a single mission. This typically consists of the Senior Glass signals intelligence suit in the fuselage and “Super Pods” under the wings, and either the Senior Year Electro Optical Reconnaissance System-2 (SYERS-2) or Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2 (ASARS-2) in the nose. You can read more about these different configurations here . A U-2S with the ASARS-2A in the nose and the full Senior Glass suite, as well as the Senior Span or Senior Spur data link on top., USAF The latest version of SYERS-2, the SYERS-2C, is a 10-band multi-spectral camera that has traditional electro-optical and infrared capabilities, but can also build images based on the electromagnetic signatures that different objects produce. The most up-to-date ASARS-2, the ASARS-2A, is a mechanically-scanned array radar that produces imagery based on the reflection of those waves. The full Senior Glass system is actually capable of collecting intelligence on a variety of very different signals. The Senior Spear equipment, which fits inside one of the aircraft’s two Super Pods can spot and monitor enemy communications. The Senior Ruby gear, which goes in the other pod, can locate and categorize hostile radar emissions. An antenna farm along the belly adds additional capabilities, which could include spying on different data streams and the ability to more accurately geo-locating the source of a transmission. Lockheed Martin’s Tri-INT arrangement would consolidate the signals intelligence systems into just one Super Pod, and potentially elsewhere along the fuselage, and fit a multi-spectral camera under the other wing. This could be the SYERS-2C, but the firm told FlightGlobal it would prefer to use United Technologies Aerospace Systems’ (UTAS) 10-band MS-177A , which sits inside a rotating turret and is therefore more flexible. Imagery from a SYERS-2-series camera system., UTAS Raytheon’s ASARS-2B would go in the nose. Though this radar shares a basic nomenclature with the older unit, it is essentially an all-new, active-electronically scanned array (AESA) design that scans faster and is more powerful and precise, producing better imagery, quicker. It also has a ground moving target indicator capability to track moving vehicles or potentially help the pilot refine their search area based on those tracks. The Air Force already plans to spend more than $215 million on development of ASARS-2B between 2019 and 2023. It is also in the process of adding the older seven-band MS-177 camera on the RQ-4 and wants to begin installing the improved A model, along with other upgrades to those unmanned aircraft, in the near future as well. Lockheed Martin could propose the Air Force expand its purchases of MS-177As to include additional units to go into upgraded U-2s. Imagery from a seven-band MS-177 multi-spectral camera camera., Northrop Grumman Lockheed Martin will still have to either develop or otherwise locate a compact signals intelligence suite that offers equal or better capabilities to Senior Glass to complete its proposed Tri-INT U-2S package. Lastly, the updated planes would feature additional and modernized data links, including multi-function advanced data links (MADL) or similar functionality to allow the Dragon Ladies to communicate with stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, which can themselves vacuum up an impressive amount of intelligence data, and B-2 Spirit bombers in near real time. Coupled with a device Lockheed Martin calls the “ Einstein Box ,” which acts as a gateway for various data streams, the high-flying spy planes could be able to fuse different information together and otherwise help provide other aircraft, personnel on the ground or at sea, or analysts back at base a more complex “picture” of the battlefield. Having a U-2S that could perform all these missions without having to shift configurations would make the aircraft significantly more flexible. It could potentially give the Air Force the ability to gather more intelligence, and of different varieties, per sortie and reduce the total number of aircraft and flying time required to acquire the same scope of information. Also, though it is an increasingly old platform, the U-2S continues to be able to use its ability to fly at altitudes above 70,000 feet, and its very advanced electronic warfare suite, to offer a capable defense against a variety of potential threats. Flying high, the aircraft can use a slanted flight pattern to peer into target areas with its long-range cameras and radars without having to expose themselves to the same level of danger as flying directly over them. As a result, according the FlightGlobal, the Air Force still feels the Dragon Ladies can perform in “marginally contested” environments. This helps explain, at least in part, why the service has become increasingly convinced it cannot replace the planes outright with the lower-flying and potentially more vulnerable Global Hawk drones. An RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, which the Air Force had expected for a time would replace the U-2S., Northrop Grumman All of this could make the Tri-INT U-2S a particularly attractive option for the Air Force, especially given the voracious appetite of American commanders for strategic intelligence around the world. Growing tensions with Russia , China , North Korea , and Iran , among others, have stretched already limited resources even further. “I don’t have enough [aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets] because there isn’t enough to go around,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, told members of Congress during a hearing on March 15, 2018. The senior officer specifically named the Air Force’s RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signals intelligence and WC-135 Constant Phoenix nuclear intelligence aircraft, as well the Navy’s P-3C patrol and EP-3E signals intelligence aircraft as “critical to intelligence collection” in his area of the world. It seems hard to imagine American commanders elsewhere, particularly in Africa , Europe , and the Middle East , would disagree. There’s no indication that this steady desire for more aerial intelligence is likely to decrease any time soon, either. Having both Tri-INT U-2S spy planes, as well as RQ-4s, wil give the Air Force additional and complimentary assets for long-range intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. And the Tri-INT Dragon Ladies could potentially fill other functions beyond just strategic intelligence, further increasing the flexibility of the relatively small fleet. An RQ-4 Global Hawk sits on the foreground as a TU-2S trainer lands in the background., USAF Perhaps most immediately, an improved U-2S aircraft could become another part of the Air Force’s multi-faceted approach to replacing the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control aircraft. At present, the Air Force’s plan is to supplant these planes with a mix of different manned and unmanned aircraft by 2023. The upgraded U-2S could offer another sensor node to feed information back to other battlefield management aircraft or ground exploitation control and intelligence exploitation elements, which could then analyze the information and pass it along to other elements as necessary. In particular, the ASARS-2B may be able to provide a similar type of functionality to the JSTARS’ electronically-scanned phased-array AN/APY-7 radar, but with the benefits of its AESA design and the Dragon Lady’s significantly higher operational ceiling. On top of that, the Einstein Box could allow the U-2S to act as a communications gateway, data fusion center, an relay akin to the Air Force’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft. In 2017, a Dragon Lady with the system performed exactly this mission in an experimental capacity during that year’s iteration of the annual Northern Edge exercise in Alaska. A U-2S with the “Einstein Box” fitted in the fuselage underneath the cockpit in 2015., Lockheed Martin The Tri-INT U-2S configuration could also serve as the starting place for further developments that add additional capabilities or further transform the Dragon Lady’s operating concepts. There is already a historical precedent for operating the aircraft in the maritime surveillance role and the Air Force has already employed the aircraft in a reconnaissance capacity in the Western Pacific thanks to its range and high-flying capabilities. The desire to monitor China’s expanding maritime forces, especially in the South China Sea , as well as enforce sanctions and a potential blockade against North Korea, will only further increase the demand for long range, persistent over-water surveillance capabilities . A further improved U-2 could provide a readily available and flexible platform for those missions. Over time and as new threats steadily make the U-2S increasingly more vulnerable, Lockheed Martin could exploit the aircraft’s existing modularity to add in advanced active defensive technologies , potentially including laser defense systems the Air Force is already working on for fighter and other aircraft. Lockheed itself is involved in that project , being responsible for the directed energy weapon system itself. The company could propose more radical changes to the aircraft, as well, and is presently under contract with the Missile Defense Agency to develop a high-flying, unmanned platform to carry an offensive laser weapon to potentially destroy ballistic missiles during their initial boost phase . Between 2014 and 2015, as it looked like the Air Force might retire the U-2, Lockheed Martin suggested it could build a pilot-optional version or a derivative with some low-observable features that uses as many existing components as possible. These are exactly these kinds of characteristics that have kept the U-2 going after more than six decades and avoid ending up in the Bone Yard on multiple occasions since 1969. With all this in mind, it seems increasingly clear that the Dragon Ladies still have a lot of life left in them still. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 27, 2019","All US Military Branches, Including The Coast Guard, Are Buying The Army’s New Pistol","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to firearms manufacturer Sig Sauer, its Modular Handgun System pistols for the U.S. Army looks set to become the standard sidearm across the U.S. military as a whole. However, serious questions remain about the weapons’ overall reliability, issues The War Zone was first to report , as well as the legality of more widespread use of hollow point ammunition that is likely to accompany the guns. Earlier in March 2018, Sig Sauer told Military.com that all the branches of the U.S. military, including the U.S. Coast Guard, were planning to purchase variants of the Modular Handgun System, or MHS. This followed that outlet’s earlier report that the U.S. Marine Corps had specifically ask for funds to the purchase 35,000 of the pistols in its 2019 fiscal year budget request. In January 2017, the Army handed the Swiss-headquartered gunmaker a contract worth up to $580 million for up to 195,000 guns, including full size M17 and compact M18 versions, as well as various parts and support services. The MHS pistols are all variants of the company’s commercial P320 design. “All services have been involved in MHS since its inception … and they have all committed to ordering guns,” Tom Taylor, Sig Sauer’s Executive Vice President for Sales and Chief Marketing Officer told Military.com in a statement. “The U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard all have orders that will be fielded starting later this year and early next year.” Taylor did not say what the value of these orders was, in part or in total, or how many pistols each service had committed to buy. The Marine Corps is the only service to have included any clear mention of MHS pistol purchases in its proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal cycle. The two Army Modular Handgun System pistols, the compact M18, left, and the full-size M17, right., US Army It’s also not clear if some of the Army’s 195,000 guns are actually slated to go to other branches of the U.S. military already. “The other military services, who were involved in the entire acquisition process including source selection, can also procure XM17/XM18 Modular Handgun Systems under the Army contract with Sig Sauer,” Debra Dawson, a spokesperson for the Army’s Program Executive Office Soldier, which is overseeing the MHS program, explained to Military.com . It is definitely true that all the services have been actively considering following the Army in acquiring the new pistols since the MHS program began in 2008. This project followed the failure of previous joint service handgun program called the Joint Combat Handgun . The desire for standardization makes perfect sense, especially when it comes to systems like handguns, which see widespread and varied use across different components of all the services. A common system inherently reduces the strain on maintenance and logistics chains and allows the different branches to reduce costs through large, bulk purchases of spare parts and ammunition. The goal of the MHS program was also to select a gun that could be reconfigured to some degree with relative ease or was otherwise available in a number of different subvariants that had high commonality in parts and basic controls. The latter part helps reduce training requirements since the manual of arms – the basic actions of firing the weapon, operating various features, and remediate jams or other malfunctions – remains the same regardless of the pistol’s exact configuration. An array of items issued to Army soldiers along with the M17 pistol, at center, including different polymer frames with different grip sizes at lower right, holsters and magazine pouches along the top, magazines of differing sizes below the gun, and the operator’s manual., US Army This was the same logic behind the rest of the U.S. military’s decision to adopt the Beretta M9 after the Army selected it as its standard service pistol in 1985.  These guns, in turn, were supposed to replace the iconic Colt M1911 series, which had been in service in some form or another since World War II. The problem, of course, was that the M9 program became mired in controversy, first because of alleged improprieties in the contracting process and then because of quality control issues. To try and counter the claims that it had unfairly favored Beretta’s entry, the Army even re-ran the competition, but Sig Sauer, who had protested the original results, refused to compete and Beretta won out again. The service then had to spend a significant amount to have the Italian gunmaker fix the pistols it had already supplied to prevent malfunctions that had sent more than a dozen people to the hospital with serious injuries . A US Marine loads an M9 pistol., USMC On top of that, it turned out that the different services, as well as various components within them, had a host of requirements the M9 simply could not satisfy. Its large size in particular made it unsuitable for any units with concealed carry requirements, prompting the Army to almost immediately adopt the compact Sig Sauer P228 as the M11 . Every service has since purchased small numbers of handguns to supplement or outright supplant the M9 in various roles. The Navy, thanks in no small part to the SEALs, had no less than 10 different pistols in inventory by 2016, plus other assorted “Cats & Dogs,” according to one briefing. A slide from an official 2016 US Navy briefing showing the pistols it had in service at that point, as well as other “Cats & Dogs.”, USN The Marines even bought modernized M1911s and now expects the MHS to replace those, its M9s, and a small number of Glocks that it just began issuing to various specialized units in 2017. It seems almost certain that there are a host of other types handguns sitting in armories across the services. There remains a very real chance that Sig Sauer’s pistols, somewhat ironically given the company’s previous history with the M9 program, could end up facing at least some of the same issues. According to a Pentagon report earlier in 2018, during Army tests, both the M17 and M18 experienced significant reliability issues, especially while using standard ball ammunition. You can read about these malfunctions in detail here . A US Marine trains with an M45A1 Close Quarters Battle Pistol, a modernized derivative of the M1911, in 2013., USMC Both PEO Soldier and Sig Sauer have defended the guns since then, saying they are “ confident ” in the pistols ability to perform adequately in the field. At the time of writing, though, the Army had not responded to our questions about whether it had fixed or was in the process of fixing the problems the Pentagon’s top test and evaluation office noted in its annual review. Perhaps more importantly, the service also did not respond to requests to explain what the legal rationale is behind issuing cartridges with hollow point bullets as the standard ammunition for the weapon. The Hague Convention of 1899 bans any bullet that has features that cause it to deliberately expand from combat use. While the United States has not signed or ratified the particular portion of the agreement dealing with expanding projectiles, it has historically followed its provisions nonetheless. MHS pistol magazines loaded with hollow pound rounds during a test., US Army The U.S. military has argued that it could use those rounds when there is a “ clear military necessity ” and some special operations forces already issue hollow point pistol rounds, as well as rifle cartridges with deliberately fragmenting bullets, with this justification in mind. However, it did not appear that this argument extended to regular use of hollow points and there is a concern that in using this ammunition routinely, the United States could open itself unnecessarily to accusations of war crimes. It’s also just not clear whether or not the MHS will truly have the flexibility to meet all the necessary operational requirements across the services, including continued concealed carry demands among internal law enforcement units and special operations forces. For years now, Glock pistols, the Glock 19 especially, have been a favorite among special operators in particular because of their slim profile . There is no indication that U.S. Special Operations Command plans to transition to the MHS entirely. A US Marine fires a Glock 19., USMC The Coast Guard will also present a potentially complicated case, as it occupies an obtuse bureaucratic position as a uniformed military service within the Department of Homeland Security. DHS has adopted the .40 Smith & Wesson, rather than the U.S. military standard 9mm, as the standard pistol caliber across its components, to include the Coast Guard. The Sig Sauer P320 can be readily rechambered for the .40 caliber round, which should make that less of an issue, but it will still reduce the commonality between the Coast Guard’s guns and those in other military branches. Unless other components of DHS decide to acquire versions of the Swiss pistol as well, it will also make it more difficult for them to source spare parts and other services through that department. A member of the US Coast Guard fires a .40 Smith and Wesson Sig Sauer P229, one of the pistols that service could replace with a variant of the MHS., USCG The Army and Sig Sauer, along with the other branches, will have to take these various issues into account in order to avoid the same pitfalls they experienced with the M9. Otherwise, the services could easily end up again with the same kind of unwieldy mix of guns that the MHS program was supposed to replace in the first place.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 3, 2024",Qatar Is Getting This Unique Amphibious ‘Mother Ship’ And Radar Picket Vessel Mash Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri has unveiled a model and artwork of a unique multi-role amphibious ship it is building for the Qatari Navy. Still in the grips of a simmering diplomatic spat with its neighbors , and under a physical and economic blockade, Qatar expects the vessel, along with four other Italian-made corvettes, will significantly expand its naval capabilities in the region. Fincantieri offered a closer look at the designs for the Qatari landing platform dock , or LPD, and corvettes at the Doha International Maritime Defense Exhibition & Conference, or DIMDEX, earlier in March 2018. In June 2016, Qatar signed the initial deal , then valued at between $4.5 and $5.6 billion, which also includes the purchase of two smaller patrol boats, before finalizing what had become a nearly $6 billion project in August 2017. Work on all seven ships is supposed to begin by the end of 2018. Fincantieri says it plans to deliver the first corvette by 2021 and the rest of the ships, including the LPD, within a six year period. The deal also includes 10 years of support services for the corvettes and five for the amphibious ship and the smaller patrol boats. The LPD is the clear centerpiece of the purchases and is a derivative of the Fincantieri’s Enhanced San Giusto design, itself based on San Giusto the company built for the Italian Navy as an expanded version of the older San Giorgio -class . The Italian company has already sold one of these ships to Algeria, where it has entered service as the Kalaat Béni Abbès . Algeria’s Kalaat Béni Abbès , which is similar in design to the LPD that Fincantieri is building for Qatar., USN Qatar’s variant, which will displace approximately 8,800 tons with a full combat load, will be unique, though, with an L-band Kronos Power Shield radar . Another Italian firm, Leonardo, is building this system, which the Italian Navy is planning to install on its own future amphibious assault ship. The video below gives a good overview of the planned capabilities for Qatar’s new LPD, as well as the other ships it is purchasing from Italy. The Kronos Power Shield is an L-band active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar that uses highly energy efficient gallium-nitride-based technology to remain both thin and compact, but still be powerful and accurate. They system can rapidly switch between broad, 360-degree area search and more focused tracking modes. There is also a “fence” functionality able to track short- and medium range ballistic missiles, but only in a very limited envelope. Leonardo says that the complete 430-square foot array offers a typical maximum search range of between approximately 930 and 1,240 miles, though this would be dependent on a host of environmental factors and the nature of the targets in question. The model Fincantieri showed of the ship at DIMDEX indicated that it would also have a secondary three dimensional search radar. This could be the same European Multifunction Phased Array Radar ( EMPAR ) found on the Kalaat Béni Abbès or a different unit. The Algerian ship also features an advanced electronic warfare suite, which would further help detect and categorize potential threats, as well as jam or otherwise disrupt them, and the Qatari variant is likely to have similar capabilities. These systems will all feed into Leonardo’s Athena combat management system and would allow the ship to engage a wide variety of targets with its 16 Aster 30 surface-to-air missiles in two French-designed eight-cell Sylver vertical launch system (VLS) arrays. The European missile consortium MBDA says that the latest versions of the missile can engage slow- and fast-moving aircraft and supersonic, low-flying cruise missiles, as well as offering a limited ballistic missile defense capability. The firm is in the process of developing a new version specifically for ballistic missile defense, as well. Range for the Aster 30 is stated to be roughly 70 miles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HfV3XsMaBLw Enrico Bonetti, Fincantieri’s Senior Vice President for Naval Vessels, told Navy Recognition that the LPD would also act as a “mother ship” to provide long-range targeting information for the four smaller corvettes, each of which will had a displacement 3,250 tons when carrying a full combat load. Those ships will have their own radars and 16 Aster 30 missiles, as well. The LPD and the corvettes will both feature a 76mm rapid fire main gun and Sylena Mk 2 decoy launchers to defend against incoming anti-ship missiles, as well as various automatic cannon for local defense. Each corvette will have a launcher for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles for additional close-in protection. An artist’s conception of one of the new corvettes for Qatar’s Navy., Fincantieri But the Qatari LPD will be much more than just a floating sensor node and air defense picket ship. It will have the same flight deck as the Algerian Kalaat Béni Abbès , with two landing spots for either light or medium helicopters and will almost certainly serve as a platform for some of the 12 navalized NHIndustries NH90 helicopters the Qatari Navy is set to receive sometime between 2022 and 2025 . The Arabian Gulf nation also announced that it would purchase those helicopters, along with 16 standard NH90 transports, at DIMDEX. The ship may eventually be able to carry up to five NH90s on board, but Fincantieri will have to reconfigure the elevator and below-deck hangar design to accommodate the larger helicopters on Qatar’s variant. There’s nothing to suggest that this would necessarily be difficult to do, but at present, these features on the Enhanced San Giusto are more or less tailored to the much smaller Leonardo Super Lynx and the model the company showed at DIMDEX had the existing, narrow elevator design. Depending on how Qatar decides to field them, the NH90s could act as transports, medical evacuation aircraft, or even fill a limited anti-ship role carrying the Marte anti-ship missile. In this latter configuration, they could complement the corvettes, which will carry MM40 Exocet anti-ship missiles, as well as other Qatari navy fast attack craft armed with those same missiles. As an amphibious ship, it will be able to launch and recover three landing craft capable of carrying tanks and troops. The vessel also features a large rear ramp to allow the rapid loading and offloading of personnel and vehicles in a more established port setting. It will also be able to support other auxiliary ships and boats, including small special operations craft . An Italian Navy NH90 carrying a Marte anti-ship missile., MBDA As such, this specially configured LPD begins to appear more as a small, multi-mission sea base. This broader functionality could be even more pronounced if the vessel retains the same 60-bed hospital ward and operating theaters as Kalaat Béni Abbès , allowing it to serve as a small hospital ship and help reduce the number of casualties during sustained operations, too. In total the vessel will be able to accommodate roughly 550 people, with about 150 of that complement being the ship’s crew and the rest being made up of embarked amphibious troops as well as air wing and other personnel. Amphibious type ships are growing in popularity broadly in no small part because of their inherent flexibility of their design and their ability to fill a variety of combat and peacetime roles, including supporting responses to natural disasters and other humanitarian crises. Qatar is hardly alone in the Middle East in looking to add this type of capability to its Navy. In 2015, Egypt purchased a pair of French Mistral -class amphibious assault ships, originally bound for Russia , and Saudi Arabia has reportedly explored the possibility of buying similar ships in the past . Egypt’s Mistral -class ENS Anwar El Sadat , David Boyer/SIPA USA via AP For Qatar, though, the new LPD and the associated corvettes will dramatically increase its maritime punch, which at present consist of much smaller patrol and fast attack craft focused largely on coastal defense. These new forces could conceivably provide robust surface and air defense coverage throughout the entire Persian Gulf, disrupting potential enemy movements or at least putting additional challenges in their path. With the range of the LPD’s main radar, it could also extend the detection and targeting capabilities of the country’s ground-based air defenses ashore, which include American-made Patriot PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) batteries. Though limited, the Aster 30’s ability to perform as a ballistic missile defense weapon could also be important given the increasing proliferation of these weapons throughout the region. Iran in particular is steadily increasing its arsenal of short- and medium-range designs, as well as providing technical assistance to its regional partners in countries, such as Syria and Yemen . In response, Saudi Arabia could begin looking to expand its own missile forces , possibly even with nuclear warheads if Iranian authorities continue to pursue their controversial nuclear program, and its a trend that will almost certainly continue to spread in the near future. Beyond their use as defensive tools, the ships, especially the LPD, could also give Qatar sensors with the ability to peer into the territory of potential opponents, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), giving it more ways to monitor potentially hostile military air and surface activities on a regular basis. The Saudi Navy is also set to significantly increase its own capabilities, through the addition four frigates from American defense contractor Lockheed Martin, along with smaller patrol boats and improved infrastructure, which you can read about in detail here . Though the three countries are all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council regional bloc, in June 2017, the Saudis led a number of their partners, including the UAE and Egypt, to sever ties with Qatar , in no small part over the latter country’s ties with Iran . The parties remain locked in a bitter dispute, which has seen various countries cut off or limit their political and economic interaction with Qatar. At the same time, Qatari authorities have moved to bolster their military capabilities and expand relations with other countries in and around the region, chiefly Turkey . The Kalaat Béni Abbès at one of Fincantieri’s shipyards., Fincantieri Qatar claims that those efforts mean the Saudi-led blockade has failed in its objectives to pressure it into accepting a wide range of demands, including cutting off its relationship with Iran. At the same time, there are still significant questions about whether the Qatari government or military can sustain the country’s massive military buildup, either in terms of overall costs or requirements for added manpower. Though it appears that Qatar can afford to at least buy the equipment for its rapidly growing military, the latter question may become serious and immediate concern. The Qatari military claims a force size of more than 100,000 individuals , but only between 10 and 30 percent of that total is on active duty, with the rest being conscript reserves. Perhaps more importantly, the country has a limited pool from which to pull additional personnel. Of the country’s population of more than 2 million, only between 10 and 25 percent on average are actually citizens, with the rest being foreign nationals. This fact has reportedly forced the country to become increasingly reliant on outside military contractors . So, while there’s no denying the Italian-made LPD and corvettes could give Qatar an impressive defense boost, it will also have to make sure it has the personnel and other resources in place to ensure it can get the most out of the ships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2018",Have Mercy! The US Navy Now Wants To Retire One Of Its Two Hospital Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Faced with growing difficulties sustaining and modernizing its existing fleet , the need to address the underlying issues behind a spate of deadly accidents and other controversies , and a desire to increase the total number of ships in its inventory, the U.S. Navy has many different priorities to balance when it put together its latest budget request. But at least one part of its new, broad plans, includes a decision to retire one of its two unique hospital ships, possibly as early as the end of 2019, a move that has already rankled some members of Congress. At present, the Navy has two large hospital ships, the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort , which it received in 1986 and 1987 respectively. Converted from oil tankers, each of the nearly 900-foot long ships displaces more than 69,500 tons and has a crew of more than 1,200 individuals when operating at full capacity. Both are part of Military Sealift Command , the service’s hybrid military-civilian logistics and support arm, which is itself under the operational control of U.S. Transportation Command, or TRANSCOM. “I’m a big fan of hospital ships, because I love the fact that we can help injured and ill [service] members,” U.S. Air Force General Darren McDew, head of TRANSCOM, told legislators during a hearing on March 8, 2018. This position immediately seemed to clash with the Navy’s plan to put Mecry or Comfort in mothballs sometime over the next 18 months. USN It’s undeniable that the ships provide the U.S. military with an impressive capability. Their primary mission is to support expeditionary operations, especially U.S. Marine and Army amphibious operations, as well as naval surface task forces. Those forces may have their own organic medical elements, but lack the ability to provide more specialized or intensive care or are otherwise operating far removed from appropriate facilities. Maneuver combat elements would certainly be unable to provide anywhere close to the services at Mercy and Comfort can and definitely not at anywhere near the same scale. Each of the two ships can accommodate 1,000 patients in total, including 80 in intensive care. There is a landing pad amidships so helicopters can rapidly deliver casualties and there is a hangar area to embark Seahawk helicopters as well. Sailors help load patients from USNS Comfort onto an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter in order to move them to a hospital ashore in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in October 2017., USN The ships are designed to be stable enough for surgeons to perform their delicate work in any of 12 operating rooms. There are a host of other specialized facilities, including burn wards and dental suites. Medical staff on board have laboratory, MRI and x-ray equipment to diagnose patients and there is a blood bank and oxygen generating plant. The two vessels even have their own morgue to securely store the dead in a dignified manner if necessary. Without these hospital ships nearby, U.S. forces on land or afloat could have to rely on far less capable mobile field hospitals or the ability to rush seriously wounded individuals, likely via aircraft, to more established facilities far away. Having to airlift personnel to larger hospitals, such as the United States’ Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, a major American medical hub overseas, requires significant resources, and considering a whole region may be a combat zone, it may not be possible at all. A scene aboard USNS Comfort during a training exercise involving a simulated mass influx of casualties onto the ship., USN “I’ll tell you, for every one hospital ship we’re short, we’re going to have a requirement for 479 air-refueling tankers,” General McDew told lawmakers. That notional tanker force reflects what it would take to support the amount of medical evacuation aircraft it would take to handle the same number of casualties as Mercy or Comfort . It also potentially increases the time it might take for an individual to reach a properly equipped treatment facility. This could easily be a matter of life and death , especially in regards to trauma care. Medical professionals often refer to the “ golden hour ,” which refers the understanding that individuals have the best chance for surviving serious, potentially life-threatening injuries, and do so without any complications or lasting effects, if they can receive adequate care within 60 minutes. And though there is a debate about whether or not the firm 60-minute rule actually makes a difference, it is a truism that getting patients treated as fast as possible generally improves their chances for a full recovery. The video below gives an overview of the facilities available on board both Mercy and Comfort . Both ships deployed to the Middle East during the first Gulf War between 1990 and 1991. Mercy reprised that role during the opening stages of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Beyond their combat mission, Mercy and Comfort a serve important secondary roles as an on-call tool to respond to natural disasters and other crises involving mass casualties, at home and abroad. One of the two ships have been on hand to aid in disaster relief efforts in the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the continental United States, among others locations. Most recently, Comfort deployed to Puerto Rico following the devastating Hurricane Maria in September 2017. And in the same way an aircraft carrier represents a clear and visible display of America’s ability to project combat capability, the big, white hospital ships show off the country’s best humanitarian qualities. This sort of “ soft power ” can be a valuable tool for advancing U.S. interests abroad. So, in addition to being on call for military operations and other contingencies, the Mercy , with its home port in San Diego, California, has routinely taken part in the Navy’s Pacific Partnership cruises. These involve various American military ships making stops in various allied and partner nations across the Western Pacific civic and other humanitarian assistance activities, including providing free medical care in remote or otherwise under-served areas. Members of foreign military forces, non-governmental organizations and volunteers also take part. From its home port at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, Comfort has performed similar missions in the Western Hemisphere. Members of the Australian Air Force take pictures of the Fijian Police Band from the railing of USNS Mercy as the ship enters the island nation’s Port of Suva during a Pacific Partnership cruise in 2015., USN “I was recently in Djibouti and noticed that the Chinese actually had a hospital ship in port over there , and they’re delivering services,” Austin Scott, a Republic Representative from Georgia said in defense of keeping both ships in service at the hearing on March 8, 2018. “For the U.S. to pull back on that soft power side, I think it’s just a – I think it’s a strategic mistake for us.” But while they have proven their worth in many instances and offer unique military and diplomatic benefits, that capability doesn’t come cheap. In its 2019 fiscal year budget proposal, the Navy asked for just over $120 million to sustain both ships and their on board facilities, a figure equal to three percent of what the service expects to spend in total operating on maintaining its nearly 300 other ships, including 11 aircraft carriers. In its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, the Navy says it will be able to save more than $23 million just by having Mercy operate at a so-called “reduced operating status,” or ROS, for 150 of the year’s 365 days. USNS Mercy sits anchored and illuminated off the coast of Vietnam in 2016., USN However, putting the ship into ROS leaves it with a skeleton crew of just 70 individuals, less than a tenth of its full compliment. This means it would take significant time and effort to get the ship to full operating status if necessarily in an emergency, which in turn calls into question whether it’s beneficial to keep it in this condition at all. Though long-standing, the debate about how difficult it can be to deploy these ships became particularly pronounced when it took Comfort two weeks to get ready and sail to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck in September 2017. The storm caused significant damage and knocked out power across the island, limiting the ability of existing hospitals to function properly. Apparent confusion about how to best utilize the ship kept it off shore for another three weeks. During that period, the ship took in just a few dozen patients , all of whom had to find a way to hop a helicopter or boat ride out to the ship. When it finally did pull into the Port of San Jose, nearly 40 days after leaving its home port, the patients flooded into its facilities. USNS Comfort docked in Puerto Rico’s Port of San Jose in November 2011., Andre Kang/GDA via AP Even then, though, there are concerns about the relatively high costs of that treatment. The costs associated with Mercy and Comfort can translate to per patient treatment costs ranging from $10,000 to more than $30,000 during certain missions. For comparison between March 2014 and December 2015, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), a non-governmental humanitarian aid agency also known as Doctors Without Borders, spent approximately $12,400 per patient while helping to contain the West African Ebola epidemic. In addition, it’s worth noting that MSF’s effort in that case required atypical and significant expenditures on secure facilities, protective gear, and other specialized equipment due to the particularly virulent nature virus in question. The total cost covered distributed operations across three countries, including more than a dozen individual management centers to identify and quarantine sick individuals, as well. Neither Mercy nor Comfort supported the American military’s response to this epidemic , which relied heavily on medical units ashore operating similarly secure clinics and laboratories, as well as specialized contractor-operated aircraft . Still, the cost to keep both Mercy and Comfort on active duty is the price one pays for having that kind of unique capability. With the possible exception of China, no other navy in the world operates hospital ships with anywhere near the same capacity. The sole Chinese Type 920 hospital ship, a converted cruise ship with a similar dual military and civic-action role – taking on the names Daishan Dao and Peace Ark during war and peace respectively – can still only accommodate 600 patients in total, far less than its American counterparts. China’s Type 920 hospital ship., USN And having just one ship in service could dramatically reduce the ability the Navy’s ability to deploy this capability where and when it might be most necessary. Having one ship on each coast adds important flexibility and having a pair of them at all simply improves the chances that at least one will be operational in a crisis. “If the requirement is two, we have to have two or either we have to be screaming loudly,” Representative Trent Kelly, a Republican from Mississippi, who also brought up Comfort’s deployment after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said at the hearing in March 2018. “We have an obligation to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, and also the civilians across this world… Because there will come a time when we need that [hospital ship capability] and we need to always be ready.” Considering the Pentagon’s strategic pivot towards the Pacific region, where the “tyranny of distance” will be a major tactical barrier to overcome, and where highly dispersed “maneuver warfare” operations will be the name of the game, putting soldiers thousands of miles from traditional medical facilities, the Congressman’s words seem especially relevant. USN Additionally, considering the Navy is building huge mobile sea bases with such dispersed operations in mind, it seems that there would be no more relevant a naval capability to go along with such a strategy than large hospital ships—ones that during a time of war could service a region where brick and mortar hospital facilities simply do not exist. With all this in mind, it seems that the decision to largely retire one of these vessels is extremely nearsighted, counter-intuitive to the Navy’s future battle doctrine and could have horrible consequences should an war erupt. Ultimately, Congress will have the final say about whether or not to approve the Navy’s plans in the defense budget for the 2019 fiscal year. They’ll have to decide whether or not having both Mercy and Comfort on active duty is truly worth the cost. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 25, 2019",American General In Syria Confirms US Forces Killed Hundreds Of Russians In Massive Battle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. general appears to have confirmed that hundreds of Russians fought – and died – in a major battle against American forces and their local counterparts in Syria. More importantly, U.S. Army Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, director of operations for the main U.S. military task force in charge of operations in Iraq and Syria, said he feared the situation could have escalated into an all-out conflict with Russia, something we at The War Zone have warned repeatedly is becoming a worryingly realistic possibility . Braga gave the surprisingly candid account of what had happened to NBC’s Richard Engel , who traveled with the general to visit the exact site of the incident in Syria and to see what the U.S. military was doing to improve its defensive posture. The skirmish occurred on Feb. 7, 2018 when forces aligned with Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad, backed by Russian mercenaries from a shadowy company called Wagner, which are possibly under the direct control of the Kremlin, launched an attack on U.S. forces and members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a predominately Kurdish group, in eastern Syria. The opposing force consisted of tanks and heavy artillery. After a massive American counter-attack involving air and artillery strikes beat back the opposing troops, reports emerged afterwards suggesting that as many as 200 Russians had died in the engagement, which you can read more about in detail here and here . The initial attack “led to immediate phone conversations with the Russians to inquire what was going on, to cease this if they had any knowledge of this,” Braga told Engel. The Russians responded by saying “those are not our forces and at that time it was confusing,” the general added. Based on the segments of the interview that NBC has released so far, Braga does not specifically say the Russian government ordered the operation or otherwise had any direct involvement in it. He does, however, clearly say the U.S. government believes it killed a significant number of Russian nationals during the battle and unequivocally says he was concerned that the situation could have spiraled into a much more serious conflagration. A U.S. general w @CJTFOIR in northeastern #Syria describes the night that pro-regime fighters & Russian mercenaries attacked an American base here — the largest assault on U.S. forces since they entered the conflict. @RichardEngel is on the ground. More tonight on @NBCNightlyNews pic.twitter.com/5c7LBc8VTy — On Assignment with Richard Engel (@OARichardEngel) March 15, 2018 “There have been reports that two to three hundred of the Russian force was killed. Is that accurate?” Engel asked him in the interview. “We’ve seen that in open reports as well and that’s I would say close to our estimates as well,” Braga responded. “Were you worried during this firefight, during this battle that this could have become sort of real war with Russia?” Engel continued. “Absolutely concerned and that’s why, again, I had a professional dialogue with our [Russian] counterparts throughout the night,” the general told him. Braga’s comments are of a significant different tenor from previous remarks from U.S. military and other government officials, including Secretary of Defense James Mattis, offered in the days and weeks following the incident. Mattis in particular repeatedly deflected and downplayed the presence of Russian mercenaries and the potentially serious implications of their involvement, especially as a proxy for the Kremlin itself. Yet, on multiple occasions he described the idea that Russia would have had a direct hand in the incident as “ perplexing ,” despite months of publicly increasing tensions between the two countries over the situation in the region, including already worrying aerial confrontations . The Russian government has, of course, denied any involvement, saying that there might have been just five “presumably Russian citizens” who died in the fighting, and deflecting accusations that it played any part in the incident with unfounded claims and conspiracy theories . US Secretary of Defense James Mattis., Chris Kleponis/Sipa USA via AP While we don’t know what the reason for the shift in tone might be, Braga’s new interview with NBC does follow a fiery speech from Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 1, 2018, in which he unveiled a host of new strategic weapons and implicitly threatened the United State and its allies. It also comes after a high-profile poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in the United Kingdom, which both the U.K. and American governments say was a Kremlin-ordered assassination attempt. The interviews release also comes amid U.S. government reports of Russia-based cyber attacks on U.S. public and private institutions, including elements of the country’s electric grid and political processes , all in the run-up to the 2018 U.S. mid-term congressional elections. The United States continues to investigate the extent if Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, though the U.S. Intelligence Community says it has little doubt that the Kremlin tried to interfere with those polls. Putin, who is almost certain to win a fourth term as Russia’s president a controversial election in polls just days away, appears to have increasingly turned to proxy forces in Syria, such as the Wagner forces, in order to better avoid criticism at home and abroad. In December 2017, he triumphantly toured the region and declared total victory in Syria during a stopover in that country . Russian President Vladimir Putin shares a laugh with staff at the Almazov National Medical Research Center in St. Petersburg during a visit in March 2018., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP There had been reports of growing Russian casualties in Syria, which could have given rhetorical ammunition to his braver political opponents . Just earlier in March 2018, a Russian Air Force An-26 transport plane crashed near the Kremlin’s outpost in the western Syrian governorate of Latakia, killing all 32 individuals on board. There has been little additional information about this incident, with Russia said was not the result of enemy action. Back in the eastern portion of the country, Braga seems to fear that another Russian-backed attack could easily come in the future. “I don’t think that’s healthy for de-escalation,” he told NBC’s Engel, referring to the pro-Syrian forces still situated very close to American and SDF positions. Whatever happens, there seems to be growing evidence that the two sides may already be in the midst of a low-level conflict, or least an uneasy standoff, whether they’re actively fighting each other or not.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 18, 2019",U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter Crashes in Iraq Near the Syrian Border (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still thin, but there are emerging reports that a U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk combat search and rescue helicopter has crashed near the city of Al Qaim in Iraq’s Anbar Governorate, which sits right on that country’s border with Syria, killing all seven individuals on board. If confirmed, this could be the United States’ first fatal helicopter since it began operations in the region against ISIS in 2014. Initial reports suggest the helicopter suffered an accident rather than getting shot down. The very first reports that the aircraft in question was a CH-47 Chinook or a variant thereof appear to have been in error. The main U.S. task force leading the international coalition fighting ISIS in the region has so far declined to identify the type of aircraft or who it belonged to and said it was still working to determine the cause of the incident. HH-60G crew and PJs in action., Tyler Rogoway The area around Al Qaim in Iraq and the city of Al Bukamal on the opposite side of the border in Syria has been the site of fighting in the past, including a reported helicopter-borne assault against ISIS on the Syrian side in 2016. More recently, the Iraqi government has been working to clear remnants of the terrorist group out of Western Anbar in general . U.S. conventional and special operations forces , as well as members of the American led coalition, continue to support Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish elements in those operations. So it would not necessarily be surprising for American helicopters to be in the area for any number of reasons . The U.S. Air Force has HH-60G Pave Hawks forward deployed at various locations in the region, including a site in neighboring Turkey. It is possible that the aircraft suffered some sort mishap as the result of either mechanical fault or human error. Helicopters can have difficulty operating in extremely hot temperatures, which can cause a sudden loss of lift, and in sandy and dusty conditions where the crew might lose spacial awareness, conditions that are common in Anbar. There have also been increasing concerns about potential threats to helicopters from terrorists and other militants in the region who have access to shoulder-fired man-portable surface-to-air missiles, commonly known as MANPADS , and automatic cannons, and heavy machine guns, all of which can be dangerous to low- and slow-flying aircraft. The a recent Pentagon report that it released earlier in 2018 revealed the U.S. Army had been having difficulties adding additional defenses to its own UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters , among other types of aircraft. The USAF is finally working towards replacing the tired HH-60G Pave Hawks with a new Black Hawk variant, the HH-60W , but none of these new helicopters have been delivered yet. The incident comes just a day after the US Navy lost a Super Hornet while on approach to NAS Key West, killing both crew onboard. Once again, these details could change as more information becomes available. We will be updating the page throughout the evening. UPDATE: 11:30pm PST— We still have no hard reports regarding the status of those onboard, but we do know that seven souls were flying on the helicopter during a mission heading into eastern Syria. The outlook looks grim with multiple sources reporting that fatalities are expected. Update: 3/16/2018 8:30am PST- The top U.S. military task force in charge of operations in Syria and Iraq has sadly confirmed that all seven individuals aboard the HH-60G perished in the crash. According to an official statement, the crew of a second Pave Hawk flying together were the ones to first to report the crash and a quick reaction force including both American and Iraqi personnel subsequently secured the site. The full press release is available below. There remains no indication that enemy forces brought the helicopter down and the mishap may have been the result of it hitting an overhead powerline in the the dark. Wire strikes are a significant danger for low-flying helicopters, especially at night. We will continue to update or follow-up as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2019","USAF Says It Could Speed Up Buying Light Attack Aircraft, But Doesn’t Have an Actual Plan","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Air Force plods along with its light attack aircraft experiment, commonly known as OA-X, the service is reportedly looking for ways to speed up the process and begin buying actual airplanes. At the same time, senior officials have given somewhat contradictory descriptions of the project’s present status and, more importantly, have indicated that there are still no formal requirements in place for this type of aircraft . On March 14, 2018, during a hearing before the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson told members of Congress that it might be possible to reprogram funds in order to speed up purchases of light attack aircraft. The month before , she had revealed plans to set aside $2.4 billion in spending over the next five years for the program, but this wouldn’t begin until at least the 2020 fiscal year. “The challenge I’ve given [the team] is: ‘I’m not going to specify how you do this. I want you to tell me the best option for how to go do it given that . . . I want this as quickly as [possible],” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, Jr., the top uniformed military deputy in Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, told Aviation Week in separate interview earlier in March 2018. “The sky is the limit.” Bunch said the service was exploring ways to move OA-X from an experimental demonstration into a procurement plan as early as some time in 2019. It is possible that the Air Force could use one of many rapid purchasing mechanisms to either issue a sole-source contract to its preferred manufacturer or establish some sort of other partnership with them following its next round of light attack aircraft tests, which are now set to run between May and July 2018 at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. At present, the Air Force has said only Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine and SNC and Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano will take part in those experiments. Using any of those tools could invite protests from other companies hoping to sell their particular plane to the U.S. Air Force. A heavily politicized contract dispute helped scuttle the service’s last attempt to purchase light attack aircraft and nearly tanked a companion program to supply A-29s to Afghanistan . But at an event the private Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute hosted on March 14, 2018, U.S. Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, head of Air Force Materiel Command, seemed to offer a different view . She said that the service just wanted to be prepared to contemplate buying any light attack aircraft when it drafted its proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year and that the 2020 timeframe still seemed most likely. She also suggested her own novel approach to potentially speed up the project, saying that the Air Force might want to actually embrace “ throw-away culture ” and buy only a small number of light attack aircraft with plans to operate them just for a short period before purchasing another, new fleet. According to her, at least in theory, this might help reduce costs since the service wouldn’t have to spend money to establish a more robust logistics and sustainment pipeline to support the planes. It’s not clear how viable that plan would actually be, since it could easily require significant funds to hire contractors to help support the aircraft during any actual operations. It would almost certainly end up forcing the Air Force to source at least some amount of spare parts and other necessary supplies straight from the manufacturer, potentially in small batches at a high cost. There are notable examples at home and abroad of similar concepts leading to serious problems and low availability of the systems in question and Pawlikowski herself said that she wasn’t necessarily aware of an instance in which such an arrangement had actually worked out in the past. A pair of AT-6 Wolverine demonstrators., Textron It’s also unclear why the Air Force would even need to consider using such as convoluted and potentially risky approach with regards to a future light attack aircraft. The service already has well established sustainment chains for the T-6 Texan II trainer, from which Textron derived the AT-6, and the A-29, which it already operates in order to help train allied pilots. The bigger issue, as it has been for some time now, seems to be that the Air Force continues to be unable to reach a consensus about purchasing light attack aircraft. This is despite there being a large body of evidence to support the idea that these aircraft could provide a low-cost alternative to high-performance aircraft in low threat environments, freeing those other aircraft up for missions that actually require their high-speed and advanced capabilities, a concept The War Zone has described in detail in the past. As yet, there is no indication that the Air Force has approved formal requirements for an OA-X type aircraft or sought to have the Pentagon’s Joint Requirements Oversight Council validate those needs, two steps critical for establishing a formal procurement program. General Pawlikowski warned that the project risked falling into the so-called “ Valley of Death ,” a term used to describe programs that get stuck in a perpetual experimental phase and never seem to go anywhere, often ending up cancelled. Lieutenant General Bunch seemed to echo similar concerns in his interview with Aviation Week. An A-29 Super Tucano assigned to the US Air Force’s 81st Fighter Squadron., USAF “What I don’t want to do is go buy airplanes and have them sitting on the ramp, so we’ve got to sync everything up,” he said. “I can’t just flip a switch and go buy the airplanes. We’ve really got to understand the concept of operations.” All of this continues to prompt questions about how committed the Air Force truly is to the project, despite its repeated public support for the concept. In her remarks, Pawlikowski called the latest light attack experiment “a great success” and “our first attempt on that scale” to put a commercial-of-the-shelf aircraft of that type into service quickly. This, of course, isn’t true. In 2009, the Air Force began laying the groundwork for the purchase of approximately 100 such aircraft as part of what it called the Light Attack / Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program. It formally cancelled that effort in February 2012, ostensibly due to a budget crunch resulting from caps on defense spending in the 2011 Budget Control Act, a process known as sequestration. Even if it hadn’t already run through this exact process once before, the service would still have a mountain of experience over the past decade of developing and procuring light attack aircraft. Just in March 2018, the Air Force awarded Orbital ATK a contract worth more than $86 million for AC-208 Eliminators, a light attack aircraft based on the Cessna Caravan , all of which will go to Afghanistan’s Air Force. Orbital ATK’s AC-208 Eliminator, which the US Air Force has begun buying on behalf of Afghanistan’s Air Force., Orbital ATK It could also leverage similar knowledge from programs that other services have run in the same time frame. As we at The War Zone have noted before , the latest OA-X experiments are the sixth time various branches of the U.S. military, including the Air Force, have specifically tested the AT-6, the A-29, or both aircraft at once since 2007. None of this is to suggest that it isn’t a laudable for the Air Force to want to speed up the light attack program. At the same time, though, it is hard to understand how that would be at all possible when it can’t seem to make up its mind about what it might want the planes to do or how many it might actually buy, issues that are themselves difficult to comprehend given the service’s own expansive knowledge base on the topic. Whether the service is deliberately slow-rolling the process or not, it will need to address these more fundamental issues before pushing ahead with any purchases, or risk ending up with aircraft, no matter how potentially useful, that it still has no real capacity to employ.

At that point, it will begin replacing all of the remaining variants of the weapon, which have kiloton-class yields, still in service – the B61-3, -4, -7, and -11 – as well as separate stocks of B83 Mod 1 bombs , which have a much larger megaton-class yield. B83-1 is an improved version of that bomb, which first entered service in 1983. President Barack Obama’s Administration in the previous NPR had said that the U.S. military could safely retire the B83-1s before the B61-12s arrived, a position President Donald Trump’s Administration apparently does not share. The B61-12 has been in development since at least 2011 and will be the first in the series to feature a precision guidance capability. They will have a GPS and inertial navigation system (INS)-directed tail kit and strakes along the weapon’s main body similar in form and function to those on conventional Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) bombs. The weapon’s thermonuclear warhead will reportedly have a maximum yield of approximately 50 kilotons, but personnel on the ground will almost certainly be able to further reduce that using a so-called “dial-a-yield” feature that effectively limits the extent of the nuclear reaction in the “physics package” at the warhead’s core when the weapon detonates. Some older B61s have settings as low as 0.3 kilotons – 50 times less powerful than Little Boy , the bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan in 1945. A prototype B61-12 body with the GPS-guided tail kit., USAF The primary delivery systems for these weapons will be the existing B-2 Spirit and future B-21 Raider stealth bombers . These aircraft have the necessary low-observable and other protective features to successfully penetrate into high risk areas , potentially full of advanced fighter aircraft and networked air defenses, to drop the relatively short-range bombs onto their targets. The B-52, which will serve for decades to come, lost its nuclear gravity bomb capability due to its vulnerability to air defenses. In addition, the U.S. military will continue to forward deploy a smaller number of the weapons at various sites in Europe as a potential weapon for American and allied “dual-capable” combat aircraft, such as the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagles, F-16 Vipers and eventually its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters , as well as other tactical jets belonging to NATO . There have also been discussions about re-establishing stockpiles of these weapons in East Asia in light of growing threats from North Korea. The U.S. military expects to finish production of the B61-12s – which experts believe will total between 400 and 500 bombs – and replacing the existing types by the end of 2024, at which point, this series of bombs will have been in service for more than 55 years. The United States first started work on the weapons in 1961 as a result of the need for a new, more aerodynamic nuclear bomb that was better suited for use on then new high-performance jet aircraft, some of which were capable of reaching supersonic speeds. Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, which the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) oversees today, built the first prototypes, initially known as TX-61s, in 1963. Difficulties during the engineering design phase meant the first B61-0s did not enter full-scale production until five years later. Over the next decade, U.S. nuclear engineers steadily improved the capability, reliability, and safety of the design. All of the B61s came in two basic flavors, “strategic” versions for larger city-size targets and “tactical” variants for smaller site and even potentially for battlefield use against enemy troop concentrations, with the only real differences being in the available, selectable yields. Since most of the exact information is classified, open sources often disagree, but what follows is based on our best accounting of the information available. An infographic showing historic and active nuclear weapons the US military has had in service since the 1940s, including the B61 family., NNSA The original B61-0 and -1 weapons had “strategic” yields ranging from 10 to 300 kilotons. The B61-1 reportedly differed from the first version mainly in that it lacked any sort of Permissive Action Link , or PAL. PALs are, broadly, safety devices to prevent unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon, the exact specifics of which are classified. However, the U.S. government has developed broad and publicly available categories for the devices. The 500 B61-0s had a “Category B” device, which consisted of electromechanical switches that would function and arm the weapon only if an individual put in the appropriate four-digit code. On aircraft, the crew could do this in flight using a wired connection to the bomb, allowing units to launch aircraft with live weapons in a contingency, but with the added safeguard of not arming them until receiving an actual order to proceed with a strike. A seperate control panel, seen in the video below, controlled other functions, including height of burst and delay in detonation. The latter feature, coupled with a parachute or ballute retarding systems, could allow a low- and fast-flying combat aircraft to “lay down” the bomb and still safely escape the blast area. It’s not entirely clear why the B61-1 lacked the PAL safety feature, but it may have had to do with the fact that some of the 700 of these weapons went into stockpiles set aside for NATO allies to use in a crisis. U.S. and allied leaders may have determined the need for American personnel to get the codes and then pass them along to third party crews would have been too time consuming a process to make for a credible deterrent capability. Whatever the case, every subsequently bomb had some type of PAL, as well as a manual “command disable” system that crews on the ground could use to disarm the weapon completely in an emergency. Afterwards, the bomb would be largely useless until specialized personnel reactivated it at a depot. Although it’s still debated if this feature could stop a well resourced state or entity from putting the nuke to use if they had considerable time. The 235 B61-2s, tactical variants with yields ranging from 10 to 150 kilotons, featured a Category D PAL. This device required a six-digit code, which an operator only had one chance to enter correctly before the system locked up, and could accept multiple code sequences that would either set the weapon to a “safe” training mode or deliberately disable it if necessary. The B61-3 and -4 had Category F PALs, the most advanced type, which do allow for multiple attempts, but use a 12-digit code sequence. These devices also link those codes to the desired yield, allowing crews to set that in flight. An B61 bomb “shape” with no warhead or other critical components now in a museum., Dave Bezaire via Flickr The two weapons were also the first to use an insensitive explosive in the warhead, necessary to kickstart the nuclear reaction. This made the charges less likely to explode and potentially cause the weapon to function inadvertently in the event of an accident. Though both bombs were tactical variants, the B61-3 featured eight separate yield settings – 0.3, 1.5, 5, 10, 45, 60, 80, or 170 kilotons. The B61-4 had few options, ranging from 0.3 to 50 kilotons. The United States built nearly 550 and 700 B61-3 and -4 bombs, respectively. The B61-5 had the same yield as the B61-1, but added a Category D PAL. These 265 bombs were also the first to incorporate Enhanced Nuclear Detonation Safety (ENDS) features that better protected the bombs from physical shocks, extreme temperatures, electromagnetic interference, and any other “abnormal conditions.” At its most basic, an ENDS set up isolates the portions of the warhead that are essential for its functioning inside a shell that keeps out any unwanted “energy.” DoD It’s not clear, but it appears that the United States refitted many older weapons with those features afterwards, as well. Whatever the case, the B61-5 represented one of the last “new” versions of the bomb. With the exception of the B61-10, all of the subsequent versions were upgrades of existing bombs. The B61-0 was to serve as the basis for first the B61-6 and then the B61-9, which would have Category D and F PALs respectively, but the U.S. government canceled those projects. Plans to rebuild the older Mod 2s and 5s as the B61-8 using warheads with insensitive explosives similarly did not come to pass. A B61 family tree with red crosses indicating variants that were either out of service or otherwise never existed to begin with as of 2014., Hans Kristensen/FAS In the 1980s, the remaining 600 B61-1s did get Category D PALs and warheads with ENDS and insensitive explosives, becoming B61-7s. These strategic weapons also had slightly increased maximum yields of approximately 340-360 kilotons. The B61-10 is something of an oddball. When the U.S. military was developing the Pershing II tactical short-range ballistic missile, it determined that this weapon would be more useful on a European battlefield against the Soviet Union and its allies if it had a lower yield than the older Pershing I . American weapons designers decided to modify the warhead from the B61-4, resulting in the W85 , which had selectable yields from 5 to 50 kilotons. But in 1987, the United States and the Soviets signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , which banned the Pershing II. Not wanting to waste the perfectly good warheads for those missiles and since they were already based on the one inside the B61, the U.S. government rebuilt them into 215 B61-10s, with yields ranging from 0.3 to 80 kilotons and a Category F PAL. US Army Pershing II missiles., DOD The most recent operational variant, the B61-11 , entered service in 1997 and is the first to dramatically differ in form, as well as function. The U.S. military treats this version as a combination tactical and strategic bomb even though it’s based on the B61-7 and reportedly has a single, maximum yield of approximately 340-400 kilotons. The bigger difference, though, is that it has a significantly reinforced shell, possibly with a depleted uranium penetrating nose section, a delay fuzing system, and a booster rocket motor in the rear, all so it can break into deeply buried, hardened facilities. There are less than 100 of these bombs in existence, according to publicly available data, and the United States more or less built them with one specific target in mind. In 1996, Russia finished work on its Kosvinsky Kamen bunker, part its so-called “ continuity of government ” plans to protect senior leadership in the event of a nuclear strike or other major emergency. Similar in concept and reportedly similarly—if not better—protected than the U.S. military’s Cheyenne Mountain Complex or Site R, also known Raven Rock , the Kremlin built it specifically to be hardened against nuclear weapons going off up above. The B61-11’s job was to put even those defenses beyond reach in what would likely already be an apocalyptic scenario. Before the B61-11, the United States planned to use a much less elegant approach when it came to nuclear bunker busting, relying on aging B53 bombs , a design dating back to 1958 for this purpose. These 12-foot long, 4-foot wide, nearly 9,000 pound weapons would have used the sheer explosive power of their 9 megaton yield to create massive craters and crush underground targets. The U.S. government also explored using a modified B83-1, with its 1.2 megaton yield, for the role before deciding on the modified B61. Workers at the Pantex Plant maneuver a B53 bomb slated for dismantlement in 2011., NNSA Now, the U.S. military says the future B61-12’s precision guidance coupled with this low-yield warhead, which will also produces less radioactive fallout, will make these weapons more flexible and suitable for a wider range of contingencies than any of the existing types. It will still be just a modified B61-4 at its core, possibly even using the same basic physics package, though the design may also end up cannibalizing parts from the B61-3s, -7s, and -11s as they head off to the specialized Pantex Plant in Texas for dismantlement. The new bombs  will apparently even allow it to replace existing bunker-buster B61-11s, though its not entirely clear how and the U.S. military has been especially tight-lipped on this particular point. Test footage has shown the weapon is able to at least embed its entire length into the ground, but if it does use the B61-4 shell, it won’t have any of the -11’s added penetrating features. In 2014, former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz, speaking at event at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, D.C., described the weapon’s precision guidance as being key to the weapon’s bunker-busting capabilities, since the bomb would be able to focus its blast more acutely onto a target. The B61-11’s penetrating features and particularly high-yield were, at least in part, to help offset its inherent inaccuracy as an unguided weapon, but would still be significant more capable in breaking through to underground facilities that a bomb without any sort of deliberately hardened casing . “The B83-1 and B61-11 gravity bombs can hold at risk a variety of protected targets,” the NPR makes clear, though. “As a result, both will be retained in the stockpile, at least until there is sufficient confidence in the B61-12 gravity bomb that will be available in 2020.” Whatever its bunker-busting capabilities actually are, critics have warned that the various improvements and expanded capabilities the B61-12 offers may also make the U.S. government feel the weapons are more “ usable ” and increase the likelihood of a nuclear exchange. The United States notably does not have a “no first use” policy with regards to nuclear weapons and reserves the right to use them in response to non-nuclear strikes in certain circumstances, which you can read more about in detail here and here . The B61-12 has also been controversial because of its cost. Just in 2012, the official cost estimates for the surged from $4 billion to $10 billion. This figure did not include the funds necessary to develop the tail kit – another $1.2 billion at the time – or other components. If it takes at least 400 of the weapons to adequately replace the four existing types, this means each individual 700-pound bomb will be literally worth more than its weight in gold . Part of that seems to be a product of the decision to use the old B61-4s as the basis for the new bombs. Though the United States built nearly 700 of them, it only has around 200 in active stockpiles. To make up the difference, the U.S. government will have to dig out another 200 to 300 of the weapons and make sure they’re in safe, working order before it even begins to upgrade them into the new B61-12 configuration. An infographic describing what components the B61-12 may take from older bombs. The left circles in the bomb are the main portion of the warhead, with the right circles and space in between indicating other components., Hans Kristensen/FAS All of this has prompted experts to question the actual necessity of the weapon, especially in context of the U.S. military’s other nuclear modernization efforts and conventional weapons plans and with so few aircraft expected to serve as delivery systems and in such limited context. On top of the B61-12, the U.S. Air Force is in the process of developing a new nuclear-capable, air-launched cruise missile and is buying more massive, conventional, precision-guided bunker buster bombs that only the B-2 and potentially the B-21 will be able to carry. Those weapons will be capable of holding hardened targets, such as enemy’s buried command and control facilities, strategic weapons sites, and bunkers for their senior military and civilian leadership, at risk, too, but they aren’t as capable of a penetrating nuclear warhead. Of course, it’s equally worth pointing out that a B-2 or B-21 bomber could be able to carry many more B61-12s than nuclear-tipped Long Range Stand Off cruise missiles or conventional GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs. As such, an individual aircraft with the nuclear bombs could potentially strike more targets in a single sortie. B61-12 mounted on an F-15E., DoD In addition, American commanders can still decide recall bombers carrying gravity bombs even late in their mission, giving them more time to respond to changing circumstances or new information, making this combination perhaps the most flexible nuclear weapon system the United States has at its disposal. Whether or not this justifies the B61-12 costs remains open for debate. The issue of whether or not it remains useful to forward deploy B61s of any type at bases in Europe is a separate and complicated question that is much more related to the political proclivities of America’s NATO allies than the actual capabilities of the weapons. We at The War Zone have previously discussed those matters in detail, which you can find here and here . But at least at present, the United States remains committed to maintain a stockpile of B61 gravity bombs for decades to come. And if it continues with the plan laid out in the latest NPR, by the end of the 2020s, they could easily be among the oldest nuclear weapons, as least when it comes to their physics package, that the U.S. military still has in active service.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Marine Corps Is Finished With Its Long-Troubled Lightweight 120mm Mortar Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has completely removed 120mm mortars from its combat units, along with the small trucks and other components that make up the full Expeditionary Fire Support System , or EFSS. The service is now looking to refocus at least some of the funds and other resources from that program into additional or new precision artillery systems . U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Michael Butler, the Indirect Fire Capabilities Integration officer within the service’s Combat Development and Integration office, itself part of the larger Marine Corps Combat Development Command, made the announcement at a conference in the United Kingdom earlier in March 2018, according to report by Jane’s 360 . The Marines first revealed the plan to ditch the 120mm mortars, also known as M327s, and their associated kit, in December 2017 . “We made that decision to divest of it, and we’re going to move that money into some other area, probably into the precision fires area,” Lieutenant General Robert Walsh, head of Marine Corps Combat Development Command, had told Military.com at the time. “So programs that we see as not as viable, this [program objective memorandum] development that we’re doing right now is to really look at those areas critically and see what can we divest of to free money up to modernize.” Lieutenant Colonel Butler told the March 2018 gathering in the United Kingdom that the Marines Corps’ Basic School would still employ the weapons to train new personnel in the procedures for calling in and providing fire support until the service had expended the remaining ammunition stockpiles. The Marines’ high explosive, smoke, illumination, and inert training rounds aren’t compatible with the U.S. Army’s 120mm mortars, so the only other options would be to transfer them to a foreign partner using similar weapons, place them in indefinite storage, or destroy them. Among the major factors that contributed to the decision to remove the system from active use were reportedly the difficult in loading the EFSS into the Marine Corps’ MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the overall reliability of the 4×4 M1162 truck, which tows the M327, and its companion M1163, responsible for pulling the M1164 ammunition trailer. The problems with these vehicles, which are both variants of the General Dynamics Growler, are relatively long-standing issues. Though the Marine Corps specifically purchased the Growler family, which also includes the M1161 fast attack variant, to offer a vehicle that could fit inside an Osprey, that aircraft’s main cabin is still an extremely constrained space . The loading procedures for the EFSS either involves backing it up the tilt-rotor’s rear ramp so that Marines can drive it straight off when they arrive at their destination or using the M1162 to push it into the aircraft’s main cabin. Either method can be a time consuming process that could either slow down the movement of an entire force or delay the arrival of the mortars, leaving forces on the battlefield temporarily without that critical fire support. Marines load an M1162 and an M327 mortar onto an MV-22 Osprey during a training exercise., USMC All of this in many ways defeats the stated purpose of the system, which is supposed to provide longer-range fire support than 60mm and 81mm infantry mortars, but in a more mobile and flexible package than the Marine Corps’ larger 155mm M777 howitzers or truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems ( HIMARS ). On top of that, it takes multiple Ospreys to carry the entire EFSS, as well as additional trips to keep up a ready supply of ammunition. The M1164 trailer carries just 30 additional 120mm rounds. The Growlers themselves have been controversial since General Dynamics, in cooperation with the smaller American Growler, Inc., won the Marine Corps’ contract for the internally transportable vehicles in 2004. The service selected the vehicles in no small part because they were a derivative of a commercially available design, which was supposed to help keep costs down. A view from inside an Osprey as Marines load an EFSS mortar system, showing the limited room to maneuver., USMC The exact opposite happened as the Marines demanded the addition of various military style features and a special pneumatic suspension system to raise and lower the vehicle’s height so that the trucks could fit inside the Osprey. Testing between 2005 and 2007 exposed a host of additional performance issues that required fixes, as well. From an initial unit cost for any of the Growler variants of approximately $94,000, this price tag ballooned to an average of $209,000 in 2008. As a result, the overall cost of each individual complete EFSS similarly soared from $579,000 to over $1 million. Even the Marines seemed nonplussed when they finally began fielding the system in 2009 – more than a decade after they first began developing the mortars. With its lack of armor protection, “you can’t run it up the highway in an urban area such as Iraq,” John Garner, then the Marine Corps’ program manager for the Growlers, told The Washington Post in 2009. “It is up to unit commanders who receive them as to whether they will take them when deployed abroad.” In higher risk areas, Marines have often dispensed with the Growlers as the prime mover for the M327 mortars. Instead, they have employed larger and better protected vehicles, such as the Oshkosh M-ATV mine-resistant truck. An US Marine Corps  M-ATV tows an M327 mortar in Afghanistan in 2011., USMC At the same time, the Marine Corps’ specific demands for a weapon like the EFSS have steadily become less pronounced. When the service began work on the mortars the only other ground-based heavy fire support option it had was the 155mm M198 howitzer . In 2005, it began to replace those weapons with the significantly lighter and more mobile M777. That same year the service also began to receive the HIMARS. As well as having dramatically longer range compared to the EFSS, both of those systems can now fire precision guided munitions. The Marine Corps had been working with Raytheon to develop a GPS-guided 120mm round for the M327, which would also be rocket-assisted, improving the weapon’s maximum range from five to 10 miles. This would still be less than half that of an M777 firing the GPS-guided Excalibur shell and a fifth of that of a HIMARS launching 227mm guided artillery rockets. The M777 and HIMARS have visibly changed the calculus for the Marines, as well as the U.S. Army , who have both employed these weapons to great effect in recent years, especially against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In both countries, Marines rapidly deployed artillery units to support distributed, expeditionary operations in cooperation with both U.S. conventional and special operations forces and local partners. The fire support they provided was essential in the efforts to eject the terrorists from the main hubs in the Iraqi city of Mosul and their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa . It seems likely that at least some of the funds the Marines previously allocated to the EFSS will now go into expanding and improving these other artillery elements, including development of new guided rounds that can still work in the absence of a GPS connection . The Marines and the Army are also already working together to extend the range of the M777 . With all this in mind, it’s not surprising that the EFSS ended up on the chopping block. But that also doesn’t mean the Marines have necessarily lost interest in lighter-weight long-range weapon system that can fit inside an Osprey and directly accompany its forces in the initial stages of an assault, where they might otherwise be detached from other air, naval, or ground artillery assets. A truck-mounted HIMARS launcher., USMC In October 2017, U.S. Marine Corps Major General David Coffman, who is presently the U.S. Navy’s director for expeditionary warfare, said he was interested in the idea of a weapon that could combine the long-range precision capabilities of HIMARS in a compact package akin to the EFSS. It’s not clear whether he knew at the time that the mortars were on their way out. “I don’t know what’s in the art of the possible, physics-wise, to get a vehicle that can withstand the recoil of rockets firing, and be a stable enough platform, and still be light enough to be lifted in a helicopter, and all that.” the general told Military.com. “So I don’t know what industry can do, whether that’s possible or not … [but] that’s what we need.” That plan will have to overcome many of the same issues that the EFSS experienced, especially when it comes to being able to cram itself into an MV-22. Whatever happens with that concept, and with other precision artillery developments, the Marines will undoubtedly be keen to avoid a repeat of their experience with the 120mm mortars.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 8, 2019","The Air Force May Have Retired The Predator, But It was the Army That Blazed Its Trail","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has officially retired the MQ-1 Predator , which had come to be an icon of important if often controversial impact in how American prosecutes war around the world. But often lost in the discussions of how the drone changed the face of warfare, both in the air and on the ground , is its early history with an entirely different service, the U.S. Army. The program officially began in January 1994 as a so-called “Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration,” or ACTD, to explore the potential of a long-endurance, medium-altitude unmanned aircraft. For more than two years, the U.S. military’s only operational Predators, originally known as RQ-1s, were attached to a unique and obscure Army unit called the Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) situated in Orlando, Florida. And though a Joint Program Office that included representatives from all the U.S. military services managed this effort in cooperation with the Pentagon’s Defense Reconnaissance Office (DARO), the Army dominated the project overall. Before the Air Force took control in September 1996, that service “had no significant involvement in the ACTD process other than sending one pilot to fly the air vehicle,” according to Dr. Thomas Ehrhard’s official 2010 monograph Air Force UAVs: The Secret History . At first glance, it might seem odd for the Army, focused on ground operations, to have been so proactive in the Predator’s early history, but it is less so when one considers the service’s contemporary history. By 1994, it had spent the better part of the last three decades both preparing to fight a large-scale conventional conflict in Europe against the Soviet Union, supporting quasi-covert counter-insurgency operations against Communist rebels in Latin America, and becoming increasingly involved in the War on Drugs at home and abroad. An early RQ-1 Predator., USAF Then in 1991, it had helped eject Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and crushed Iraq’s military in the first Gulf War. But during that conflict, Iraqi forces had still been able to use mobile transporter-erector-launchers, or TELs, along decoys and other tactics, to rapidly move Scud short-range ballistic missiles around and launch them into neighboring countries with virtual impunity. “There is no technical evidence that a single TEL was actually destroyed during the war,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Mark Kipphut noted in research report that the service re-published as an official monograph in 2003. “Iraqi launch operations never stopped.” So the service had long had clear and demonstrable requirements for persistent aerial surveillance capabilities, particularly to help monitor enemy movements and direct air and artillery strikes, all in support of friendly operations on the ground. These same realities, combined with its then relatively recent experience of hunting guerrilla forces in Southeast Asia , had led the Army to begin laying the groundwork for Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) all the way back 1985. That year, the service established what it then called the U.S. Army Echelon Above Corps Aviation Company at the Naval Air Engineering Center, Lakehurst in New Jersey . This unit was supposed to form a single home for various aerial intelligence gathering platforms, including the RG-8A powered glider, which you can read more about here , and a drone project nicknamed Gray Wolf , with its primary focus being on ongoing operations in Latin America. One of the Army’s RG-8A powered glider., US Army via FOIA Gray Wolf – not to be confused with the Air Force’s new project of the same name – was the name given to a small number of Development Sciences R4E-40 Sky Eye drones, which could carry early generation electro-optical or infrared video cameras or traditional 35mm cameras. Though relatively advanced for their time and able to fly pre-programmed routes, these unmanned aircraft needed to be within 80 miles of the ground control station to receive commands or send back video in near-real time. In the late 1980s, the Army had also helped DARPA test the capabilities of Leading Systems, Inc.’s Amber drone, which offered significant more range, could fly at a much higher altitude, and for much longer periods than older systems such as the Sky Eye. Amber evolved into the Gnat-750 , which in turn served as the basis for the Predator. In 1990, General Atomics purchased Leading Systems, becoming the name most associated with the iconic unmanned aerial vehicle. One of Predator’s most important enhancements over the early designs was the addition of a two-way satellite datalink. This allowed operators on the ground to directly control the aircraft throughout its mission and get video, imagery, and other information in near-real time, even at extended ranges. With its own prior experience with unmanned aircraft, the Predator was in many ways a natural fit for Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity), even though it was primarily flying manned surveillance aircraft, including specialized versions of the four engine de Havilland Canada DHC-7 and twin-engine Beechcraft King Air ,  when the drones first arrived in 1994. Army Warrant Officers with backgrounds flying helicopters joined a smaller number of Navy reserve aviators with intelligence experience to form the initial cadre of pilots, along with the single individual from the Air Force. A US Army EO-5C aircraft, based on the de Havilland DHC-7, similar to the O-5A and EO-5B that the Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) operated in the 1990s., US Army Formal training on the Predator did not start until October 1994 and ran through January 1995. For the next year, though, the Army-led team showed off the new drone as an important capability for both conventional and other more specialized operations. Between February and March 1995, the unmanned aircraft flew simulated border patrol and counter-drug missions in and around the United States. Then, in April, the pilotless planes headed to Fort Bliss, Texas to take part in a routine air and missile defense drill nicknamed Roving Sands . There they practiced hunting for mock Scuds, demonstrating their ability to potentially help the U.S. military avoid the debacle it had experienced in Iraq four years earlier. With the Predators working together with other aerial intelligence assets, including U-2 spy planes , friendly forces were able to destroy 85 percent of the simulated ballistic launchers during the exercise. US Army troops, playing the role of the opposing force, set up an actual captured Scud transporter-erector-launcher during the Roving Sands exercise in 1997., DOD In June 1995, foreshadowing things to come, Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) demoed the Predator to the secretive Joint Special Operations Command and other special operations forces. There is little information available about what those flights involvement, but they almost certainly would have shown the drone’s value as a tool to help hunt terrorists. Lastly in 1995, the Predators flew together with one of the U.S. Customs Service P-3 Orions on more mock border patrol and counter-narcotics operations and then took part in an unspecified Navy Carrier Strike Group’s Composite Training Unit Exercise . The Navy elements in the program likely coordinated that latter demonstration, which foreshadowed the service’s still ongoing on-again-off-again relationship with unmanned carrier aviation . US Customs and Border Protection P-3 Orions. The US Customs Service operated these aircraft until 2003, at which time the US government merged that organization with various others to form CBP., CBP But most importantly, civil conflict was raging in the Balkans and the Predators presented an ideal way to monitor the situation in support of internationally-backed observer and peacekeeping missions. In 1993, the Pentagon has initiated a crash program to purchase a pair of the older Gnat-750s for this mission, but the process dragged out and the U.S. military eventually turned those drones over to the Central Intelligence Agency. CIA did deploy them for missions over Bosnia and Herzegovina from to a base in neighboring Albania in February 1994, but had difficulty with their line-of-sight control systems. Attempts to use an old RG-8A powered glider as a radio relay only made the situation more complicated and at least one of the Gnat-750s crashed during the operation. So, from July and October 1995, the Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) sent a joint service team to fly the Predators over the region instead in support Operation Deliberate Force . This mission involved a broader aerial campaign against Bosnian Serb forces, which had attacked U.N.-designated safe areas and committed major atrocities, including the infamous massacres of thousands of ethnic Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica and Markale . The video below is from a press conference during Operation Deliberate Force that includes strike footage. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xoSFcFEsux4 In November 1995, the warring parties began negotiating what became known as the Dayton Accords , a U.S.-backed agreement that formally ended the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A NATO-led force subsequently deployed to the country to help enforce the settlement . In March 1996, the drones from Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity), along with another Army-led group, which also contained Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel, returned to the region to support that peacekeeping effort as part of Operation Joint Endeavor . Separately, elements of the unit took other Predators to explore the possibility of a submerged submarine controlling or otherwise communicating with the drone, another demonstration that we unfortunately know little about but that the Navy members of the program almost certainly organized. However, by that time and after some amount of bureaucratic wrangling, the Pentagon had already decided to shift final control of the Predators to the Air Force once the ACTD program ended. The formal handover came in September 1996, when the Air Force’s 11th Reconnaissance Squadron took over the drones and the mission in the Balkans entirely. Under that service’s new leadership, the aircraft would evolve from just a surveillance platform into the multi-purpose MQ-1 armed reconnaissance asset. By the end of 1997, the Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) had ceased to exist, as well, with the 204th Military Intelligence Battalion taking over much of its duties. The service never quite forgot about its experience with the Predator, though, and in 2003, it procured three Improved Gnats, or I-Gnats, from General Atomics for operations in Iraq. A General Atomics I-Gnat., General Atomics. Also known as the RQ-1L, these aircraft are a sort of hybrid between the Gnat and the Predator, using the former’s line-of-sight control system and other central components, but tucked inside a Predator fuselage with a more powerful Rotax 912 or turbocharged 914 engine at the rear. The finicky radio links again proved to be unreliable and in March 2005 one of the drones lost contact with the ground control station while flying at between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, spun out of control, and smashed into the ground in a ball of fire, according to an accident report we at The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. So, in 2005, the Army hired General Atomics to build the service a more capable design . Two years later it also created a new unit very similar to the old Military Intelligence Battalion (Low Intensity) specifically to conduct persistent aerial surveillance operations in Iraq to help both spot insurgents planting deadly roadside bombs and monitor their movements, developing so-called “ patterns of life ” in order to trace them back to their workshops. That organization was known formally as the U.S. Army Composite Aerial Operations Activity and more commonly referred to as Task Force Observe, Detect, Identify, and Neutralize ( TF ODIN ). As with its predecessor, it operated a mix of modified Beechcraft King Airs and unmanned aircraft, including the RQ-7 Shadow and pre-production versions of the new pilotless plane from General Atomics, called the Warrior Alpha. The Army eventually stood up a second, similar unit in Afghanistan in 2008. In 2009, more than a decade after losing control of the Predators to the Air Force, the Army began fielding its own replacements in earnest. The final production aircraft, the MQ-1C Gray Eagle , is similar visually to the Predator, but is actually something of another hybrid design that shares more with the larger MQ-9 Reaper, including a strengthened main wing with the ability to carrying AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and other stores on four pylons. A US Army MQ-1C carrying a wide-area persistent surveillance system under its wings., US Army Since then, it has been steadily adding Gray Eagle drones into all of its combat aviation brigades to provide the required persistent battlefield surveillance capability it first identified more than 20 years before, but now with the added ability to strike at the targets it finds directly. And in something of another twist of fate, there is a distinct possibility that the Predator may actually continue to serve the U.S. military, but with the other two services that had originally took part in the program, the Navy and Marine Corps . When all is said and done, the MQ-1 may actually turn out to be the joint service aircraft that the Pentagon had originally envisioned, a process that began in large part thanks to the Army.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 6, 2018",A Poisoned Spy and Threats of US Strikes in Syria Send Tensions With Russia Skyrocketing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has fired his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson just as an attempt on the life a former Russian intelligence officer living in the United Kingdom, coupled with the suggestion that the U.S. military might launch new strikes against Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad , have dramatically escalated tensions between the Kremlin and the United States and its allies. Russia has denied any involvement in the assassination plot, which reportedly involved a chemical agent, and has advanced a new conspiracy theory about the source of separate chemical weapon attacks in Syria, threatening to respond in kind if its partners in that country come under attack. This latest downturn in the Russian government’s relations with the United States and other Western countries began with the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the British city of Salisbury on March 4, 2018. Authorities in the United Kingdom subsequently said that they had a high level of confidence that the Kremlin, or third parties acting directly on its behalf, were responsible for the attempted murders. More than 20 other individuals suffered ill effects , as well, in what the U.K. government has called a “ brazen and reckless ” attack and military chemical weapons defense teams had to help secure and decontaminate various sites. At the time of writing, both Skripals remain in critical condition. Spy games in the United Kingdom “Either this was a direct act by the Russian State against our country,” U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May told members of the country’s parliament in a public address on March 12, 2018. “Or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others.” Skripal, who had previously been a member of the Russian military’s Main Intelligence Directorate , or GRU, went to prison in 2006 on charges of espionage. The U.K. government requested he be included in a 2010 multi-national spy swap in exchange for a group of Russian agents that the United States had arrested, seeming to confirm his conviction for working as a double agent for Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service , or MI6. U.K. first responders in hazmat suits walk away after having placed a protective tent over a bench that may have been contaminated after the attack on the Skripals in Salisbury., Andrew Matthews/PA Wire/Press Association via AP At the center of May’s accusation appears to be the U.K. government’s determination that Skripal and his daughter, who had been visiting him from Moscow at the time, had been the victims of an attack using one of a group of chemical agents known collectively as Novichok . This Russian name translates broadly to “newcomer” in English. First developed under the Soviet Union, these are organophosphate nerve agents that operate in the same basic way as better known chemical weapons such as Sarin or VX . The compounds inhibit normal muscle function, preventing the body’s nervous system from talking properly to other organs, causing victims to suffocate to death or suffer cardiac arrest because they can’t control their breathing or their heart rate. The Novichok family is reportedly significantly more lethal, but safer to handle, especially when in a binary form where two distinct compounds have to mix first to create the lethal substance. Soviet scientists began work on the agents in the 1970s specifically to defeat NATO protective gear and detection equipment. However, that work then apparently continued right up until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and possibly after, with the additional goal of circumventing the Chemical Weapons Convention by using precursor chemicals that that agreement does not regulate or monitor. The treaty, to which Russia is party, entered force in 1997, but was the product of decades of prior arms control negotiations. U.K. military personnel cover a police car that ended up contaminated after attempted assassination of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury., Andrew Matthews/PA Wire/Press Association via AP Prime Minister May also cited Russia’s history of state-sponsored assassinations, particularly against former intelligence agents, as further linking the Kremlin to the incident. Notably, in 2006, former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko died in London after receiving a lethal dose of the radioactive isotope polonium-210 . The United Kingdom holds Russia responsible for that assassination, as well, and experts and observers widely believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the deaths of a number of other defectors , political opponents , and media critics at home and abroad. The U.K. government has demanded an official response from Russian authorities on the matter by the end of March 13, 2018. If not, May said she would call for unspecified “extensive measures” against the Kremlin, which could reportedly include new sanctions, revoking broadcasting licenses for certain Russian media outlets , or even cyber attacks against the Russian government. “Should there be no credible response, we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom,” she added. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May gives her update on the Skripal incident to the country’s parliament on March 12, 2018., Press Association via AP Escalating tensions over Syria This was an especially strong ultimatum given that the United Kingdom is a member of NATO , which includes a collective security clause that could compel other members to also engage in any response. It also came on the same day that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley threatened future American military action in response to Syrian government chemical weapon attacks and again questioned whether the Russians were incapable of influencing Assad and his regime or complicit in its atrocities. “Today, we must ask whether Russia can no longer influence the Assad regime to stop the horrific destruction of hospitals, medical clinics, and ambulances. To stop dropping chemical weapons on villages,” Haley said in her remarks to the U.N. Security Council on March 12, 2018. “We also warn any nation that is determined to impose its will through chemical attacks and inhuman suffering, most especially the outlaw Syrian regime: the United States remains prepared to act if we must.” US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley., Albin Lohr-Jones/Sipa USA via AP Since February 2018, Assad, backed by its Russian and Iranian allies, has been making a new and brutal push to recapture rebel-held suburbs of the capital Damascus. The fighting in and around Eastern Ghouta has been particularly pronounced and there have been reports of new Syrian government-launched chemical weapon attacks. Ghouta was the target of a major indiscriminate chemical weapons strike in 2013, as well, and there have been sporadic reports of additional incidents in the same area since then . Internationally-backed pauses in the fighting have allowed aid convoys to reach civilians trapped by the fighting, but attempts to broker broader ceasefires to ease their suffering have largely failed to produce real results. Those deals left open large loopholes that allowed the Syrian government and its benefactors to continue operations against “terrorists,” which is how Assad and his partners describe any and all groups opposed to the regime in Damascus. Under a Russian-brokered deal in 2013, Syria was supposed to have turned over its stockpiles of agents and precursor chemicals to international inspectors. By all indications , Assad has flouted that agreement and continues to produce and employ chemical weapons, despite being a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. A punitive U.S. military response would hardly be unheard of, with President Donald Trump ordering just such a strike on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base in April 2017 in response to the infamous chemical weapons attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the Syria’s northwestern Idlib Governorate. The Trump administration has made similar threats since then, with Secretary of Defense James Mattis saying it was “ill advised” for the Syrian government to “go back to violating the chemical convention” in February 2018 . However, none of these recent warnings has led to further strikes, at least so far. International aid workers in Eastern Ghouta after delivering aid during a brief pause in the fighting in March 2018., Samer Bouidani/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Russian denials Unsurprisingly, Russia denies any involvement in either the attempt on the Skripals’ lives or in chemical weapon use in Syria, either directly or indirectly. The Kremlin has, following an almost standardized pattern we at The War Zone have already detailed in depth , sought to deflect, misdirect, misinform, and otherwise muddy the waters surrounding both of these issues. Citing Russia’s rights under the Chemical Weapons Convention, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has demanded access to the samples the U.K. government says show the presence of a Novichok agent. Signatories to the treaty are allowed to review evidence against them if another party believes they have violated the terms of the agreement. Though its hard to imagine Russian authorities would willingly implicate themselves if they did have a chance to examine the chemical residues, Russia’s top diplomat has used this opportunity to imply that it is actually the United Kingdom that is failing to meet its obligations. “We’ve made a statement to dismiss this as nonsense. We have nothing to do with this,” he said . “Russia is not guilty and it is prepared to cooperate in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, if the United Kingdom takes the trouble of complying with its international legal obligations under the same document.” Russian state and quasi-state media were also quick to insinuate that “ traitors ” such as Skripal cultivated all sorts of enemies beyond the Kremlin and therefore it was impossible to link the assassination attempt to Russian authorities. Lavrov, in turn, was quick to put the blame for any misinformation and rumors on the British press and other Western media, without directly challenging any of the publicly known details beyond his blanket denial. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik  via AP On top of that, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described May’s statement to Parliament specifically as a “ circus show ” and implied the U.K. authorities were both actively manipulating a deliberate media furor over the incident and may have poisoned Skripal themselves in order to paint Russia as an aggressor, yet another unsupported conspiracy theory. With regards to Syria, the Russian government took things a step further, accusing rebels and the civilian volunteer group known as the White Helmets of coordinating with the United States to stage fake chemical attacks in order to provide an excuse for U.S. military action. There is already a long-standing but unfounded conspiracy theory that the White Helmets are actually terrorists who routinely fabricate atrocities to sway public opinion against Assad and his regime. “According to reports, after the false flag attack, the U.S. plans to accuse the Syrian government troops of using chemical weapons, and to provide the world community with the so-called ‘evidence’ of the alleged mass death of civilians at the hands of the Syrian government and Russia supporting it,” Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov said, according to state-run outlet Sputnik. “This has been confirmed by the discovery of a laboratory for the production of chemical weapons in the village of Aftris, which was liberated from terrorists,” and the capture of video equipment and satellite transmitters, Gerasimov added. The Russian general also threatened a response in kind against American forces and their partners in Syria, which the Kremlin and Assad both insist are operating illegally in the country, if the U.S. military did launch another punitive strike. Later on March 13, 2018, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, called Gerasimov to discuss “issues of mutual concern,” which appeared to be an attempt to de-escalate those particular tensions, though the exact details of the conversation remain private. Beyond this particular set of comments, Gerasimov is the name most commonly associated with Russia’s new hybrid warfare concepts , which include a heavy emphasis on information warfare . His statements are typical of increasingly textbook claims that seek to deflect attention from Russian transgressions by depicting countries like the United States as the actual threat and responsible for even more serious atrocities. As already noted , the United States has already acted in response to one Syrian government chemical attack and has repeatedly made threats to do so again since then without following through. Regardless, there is nothing to suggest there is any actual foundation to this new conspiracy theory. Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov, Viktor Tolochko/Sputnik via AP Worrying uncertainty It’s not entirely clear how these escalating tensions between Russia and the United Kingdom and the United States will play out now, though. It is highly unlikely that the Kremlin would outright admit they attempted to murder Skripal with a chemical agent in violation of an international agreement, even though senior Russian officials have all but made clear that this is the case. “Those who serve us with poison will eventually swallow it and poison themselves,” Putin himself said of Skripal earlier in March 2018. Putin, who is up for re-election as Russia’s president in a matter of days, appears intent on demonstrating his ability to make these wildly provocative moves with impunity and it would follow an already worrying pattern. In February 2018, Putin reportedly gave at least tacit approval for an offensive by Kremlin-linked mercenaries and Syrian militia into areas that American troops and their Kurdish partners occupied in Syria, which prompted a massive U.S. military counter-attack . Russian authorities have, of course, publicly denied any involvement in that incident despite growing evidence to the contrary. Russian President Vladimir Putin., Aleksey Nikolskyi/Sputnik  via AP Then, in an interview with NBC’s Megyn Kelly earlier in March 2018, the Russian leader also again brushed off accusations that his government deliberately interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election. In his newest response to those accusations, Putin, who has previously suggested that “patriotic” Russians may have launched cyber attacks and information warfare campaigns to influence the poll on their own accord, disgustingly suggested that Russian Jews or various ethnic minorities could have been responsible, too. And despite U.K. Prime Minister May’s demand that Russia explain itself over the Skripals or face the repercussions, the U.S. government has so far been unable to present a united front in support of one of its most important allies. On May 12, 2018, top White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders declined to specifically name Russia as the likely culprit in the assassination attempt in response to a reporter’s question, only stating that the U.S. government stood behind its counterparts in the United Kingdom. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, however, issued a much more pointed statement , not only naming Russian authorities, but lambasting them over the incident. “There is never a justification for this type of attack – the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation – and we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior,” he said. Former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson., US Department of State Political upheaval in the United States Unfortunately, long-standing tensions between Trump and Tillerson came to a head on March 13, 2018, when the president unceremoniously announced he had fired his top diplomat via Twitter. It remains unclear whether or not Tillerson knew his fate beforehand and whether he was fired for his Russia comments or if he made his stern remarks because of his impending departure. Trump personally sees Russian meddling in the 2016 election and accusations that his campaign may have coordinated at some level with Putin’s agents as questioning the legitimacy of his presidency. As such, he has repeatedly sought to downplay these assessments, despite the mounting evidence . This, along with the new cabinet shuffle, could easily impact the U.S. government’s response to these growing challenges from the Kremlin. That being said, Trump has said he will seek to have Central Intelligence Agency director Mike Pompeo take over as Secretary of State, which may not necessarily offer a change from Tillerson’s stance toward Russia. Pompeo, who is known for being a national security hawk who is often in favor of military action, has gone on the record to reiterate the U.S. Intelligence Community’s assessment that the Russian government did attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. He has also publicly warned that the Kremlin is likely planning a similar campaign to try and sway the results of the 2018 mid-term elections. CIA Director and expected US Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo., Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Trump, however, clearly believes that Pompeo is more likely than Tillerson to share his opinions broadly. “We’re getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want,” the president told reporters on March 13, 2018. He also said that it “sounds to me like it would be Russia” in regards to the Skripal assassination attempt based on the available evidence and reportedly called Prime Minister May to offer his full support. Whatever the Trump Administration’s actual positions are, firing America’s top diplomat the day before a major treaty ally says it may initiate a serious response to what it asserts was a foreign attack on its soil can only further complicate what will already be a major foreign policy test for the Trump Administration. We can only hope that despite this upheaval, the U.S. government will be able to rise to the challenge and stand by its friends abroad in the face of an increasingly bold and assertive Russia.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After years of fighting limited conflicts, the U.S. military is reorienting itself to be better prepared for a potential traditional high-end conflict against a nation state adversary with renewed investments in heavy equipment, including armored vehicles and artillery . At the same time, a recent training exercise highlights the fact that any such future fight in Europe, where the most likely opponent would be an increasingly aggressive Russia , will still require a broad mix of capabilities, including special operations forces working together with local forces to harass enemy troops and prevent hostile commandos from infiltrating into friendly areas . Earlier in March 2018, Special Operations Command, Europe (SOCEUR), which oversees American special operations forces activities in and around the continent, posted a series of images from an exercise in Germany nicknamed Allied Spirit VIII. They show Special Forces soldiers from the U.S. Army National Guard’s 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) working together with members of the Lithuanian National Defense Volunteer Forces, also known as the Krašto Apsaugos Savanorių Pajėgos or KASP. The tactics on display reflect a guerrilla warfare playbook straight out of a Cold War movie such as Red Dawn . Armed with rifles and light machine guns, as well as training versions of the AT4 recoilless rifle, a single-shot disposable derivative of the famous 84mm Carl Gustaf , and the FIM-92 Stinger man-portable surface-to-air missile system, or MANPADS, the groups ambushed mock enemy convoys and low-flying aircraft during the exercise. Using a combination of Humvees and civilian vehicles , the teams also appears to have conducted scout and reconnaissance type missions to monitor the movements of the simulated opposing force. It’s not entirely clear, but some of the KASP personnel may have taken on the role of the aggressors, as well. None of this is necessarily out of the ordinary. Among U.S. special operations forces’ main missions are training and advising friendly security forces, known formally as Foreign Internal Defense , and fighting behind enemy lines with local forces against hostile governments or occupying forces, operations the Pentagon collectively refers to as Unconventional Warfare . A member Lithuania’s KASP carrying an AT4 anti-tank weapon among other equipment at the JMRC in Germany., US Army But it is notable that these personnel took part in an otherwise conventional exercise such as Allied Spirit VIII, which had the primary objective of giving NATO allies an opportunity to practice working together on a large scale , with an eye toward defending the alliance’s eastern flanks, especially those along the Russian border. Between Jan. 15 and Feb. 5, 2018, approximately 4,100 troops from the United States, Albania, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom ran through a number of different scenarios at the U.S.-run Joint Multinational Readiness Center in the German municipality of Hohenfels. A KASP member takes cover behind a US military Humvee while preparing to fire an AT4 at vehicle belonging to the simulated opposing force. , US Army It was also the first time the leadership of NATO’s still young Multinational Division North-East (MND-NE) has had a chance to practice running a large scale operation. This headquarters oversees rotating alliance forces operating in the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Poland. “We need to train,” Czech Republic Army Brigadier General Karel Rehka, the commander of the exercise, told U.S. Army reporters, “if we’re going to fight, most likely we’ll fight as an alliance, so training with multiple nations is ideal to prepare for that.” A map showing the breakdown of MND-NE’s four rotating multi-national battle groups as of February 2017., NATO Adding in the American special operators and KASP is a tacit admission of the important part special operations forces and reserve territorial defense units might play in any future European conflict. The Baltic States especially have concerns about the potential for a Russian push into their territory and the ability of the alliance to respond fast enough to blunt such an offensive. In February 2016, the RAND Corporation, a private think tank with strong ties to the U.S. government, dropped a bombshell report that concluded Russian troops, backed by heavy armor and artillery, could seize the capitals of Estonia and Latvia, both of which sit less than 150 miles from the border with Russia, within three days. In the same simulation, NATO allies further south had trouble mobilizing and getting into position quickly. KASP troops and American Special Forces soldiers keep watch as other personnel unload from civilian vehicles during Allied Spirit VIII., US Army These types of assessments led in no small part to the creation of MND-NE as part of what the North Atlantic alliance calls its “ Enhanced Forward Presence .” It’s also prompted additional special operations forces activity, including other unconventional warfare exercises and the establishment of pre-positioned facilities and other resources to support these operations in an actual conflict. The Pentagon’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year includes more than $59 million for stockpiles of equipment in Europe to support rapid deployments of special operators and more than $36 million to improve base areas to support the movement of those personnel and supplies, as well as nearly $56 million to step up cooperation with friendly special operations forces in central and eastern Europe. A US Army Special Forces soldier working with KASP troops talks on a radio from a concealed position., US Army In a real crisis, given the relatively constrained environment of the Baltic States, NATO special operations forces and local troops in that region could easily find themselves forced into conducting a limited guerrilla war against more heavily armed invaders. Roving teams of American special operators and members of groups like the KASP could be essential in delaying an enemy force long enough to give other alliance members the time they need to mount an effective counter-attack. With weapons such as the AT4 and the FIM-92, they could already be a highly mobile and credible threat to a conventional enemy, able to extract a painful price from heavily armed opponents. These groups could easily use light vehicles, including civilian types, to add additional firepower in the form of guided anti-tank missiles and heavy machine guns, as well as using hand-held laser designators and advanced communications gear to call in precision air and artillery strikes. KASP personnel man a light machine gun position during the exercise., US Army In recent years, these potential capabilities of light forces outfitted with these types of weapons have been on full display in various hotspots around the world, from Ukraine to Syria. Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists used MANPADS to great effect against government aircraft and Syrian rebels shot down a Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack jet earlier in 2018 . In Iraq, Syria, and Yemen , rebels and terrorists alike have become increasingly proficient in using guided anti-tank missiles to blow up not only armored vehicles , but fortified positions, exposed troops , and other ground targets, including landed helicopters . And though the prospect of an actual conflict between NATO and official Russian troops may seem remains relatively remote, there is still a very real potential for some form of active fighting, especially one involving the Kremlin’s proxies . In 2014, Russia employed unmarked troops to seize control of Ukraine’s Crimea region and subsequently began actively supporting a separatist insurgency in that country’s eastern regions in the name of defending ethnic Russians. One of the KASP personnel aims a Stinger MANPADS trainer at a helicopter., US Army The Baltic States, which were part of the Soviet Union until 1990-1991, all have large Russian populations. Estonia in particular has already seen a number of very real and worrying incidents, including what experts believe was a Kremlin-sponsored cyber attack on the country’s government and major private business in 2007 and the abduction of an Estonia intelligence officer in 2014. More recently, American troops in the region and elsewhere have also fallen victim to what appear to be Russian cyber attacks , targeting individuals and their families personally, and information warfare campaigns spreading misinformation and disinformation about their activities. On top of that, KASP actually already has a history of resisting Russian control. After Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, what was then known as the National Defense Volunteer Service helped block an attempt by authorities in Moscow to reassert control in the capital Vilnius and prevented military reinforcements from Russia from crossing the border. A US Special Forces soldier uses night vision goggles to survey the situation while talking on a radio during Allied Spirit VIII., US Army The organization is clearly ready to fight to block any future Russian or other foreign intervention again, but now with the help of American special operators and other NATO forces.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2019",India Wants to Link Its Rebooted Fighter Jet Tender to Future Stealth Fighter Development,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indian Air Force reportedly is set to formally reboot its plans to purchase nearly 115 fighter jets within weeks, but it may tie any final contract to a demand that it also receive technical assistance for its domestic fifth generation fighter project. This decision would seem to confirm ongoing reports that India is not happy with the progress of its existing stealth fighter deal with Russia, might again give Lockheed Martin an upper hand since it is already building the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and could just further complicate the already protracted attempts to get any new aircraft. On March 11, 2018, The Hindustan Times reported that India would begin sending out official requests for information to companies looking to submit bids on the fighter jet tender by the first week of April. In February 2018, it emerged that the India Air Force would halt an existing plan to buy 114 single-engine fighter jets and rewrite the requirements to open the deal up to twin-engine designs, as well. The revised deal will now include the winning firm to transfer potentially sensitive technology to support the Indian military’s fifth generation fighter program, known as the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). “We have asked the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) to prepare a list of technologies they need help with for the AMCA,” the unnamed individual told The Hindustan Times . “There will be clear clause on the transfer of those technologies in the contract.” India’s efforts to procure new fighter jets have already been a saga spanning more than decade. This new tender will be the third formal attempt to purchase the aircraft since 2007. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has been officially working on the AMCA project since 2010, with a goal of having a flying prototype by 2025. A model of the planned ACMA in 2009., Johnxxx9 via Wikimedia With immediate contract field now open to both single- and twin-engine designs, the competition will most likely including American manufacturers Boeing and Lockheed Martin with their F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-16IN Viper respectively, the French Dassault Rafale , the Eurofighter Typhoon , Sweden’s Saab Gripen-E , and at least one Russian aircraft, such as a variant of the MiG-35 Fulcrum-F or Su-35 Flanker-E . The F-16IN appeared to have the lead over the Gripen-E in the previous-single engine tender. As we had noted in the past , there were a number of good reasons why a twin-engine design might turn out to be the new favorite. Most importantly, the Indian Air Force is already buying 36 Rafales . French authorities have been pushing India to begin negotiating a new deal for a second tranche of 36 more jets, but so far India has not made any official announcement about any additional purchases. A French Dassault Rafale., USAF The French jet and the F/A-18E/F are also emerging as the front-runners in an Indian Navy competition to purchase new fighter jets for its presently planned fleet of short-takeoff but arrested recovery (STOBAR) aircraft carriers, as well as the catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) types it wants to build in the future. If both services were to operate the same aircraft, or variants with a high commonality in basic components and mission systems, this could cut logistics and sustainment expenses and offset the typically higher costs of twin-engine aircraft compared to single-engine types. As such, it looked initially that Boeing and Dassault had the most to gain from the changes to the Indian tender. But the inclusion of the stealth fighter technology transfer requirement could change the calculus yet again. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet., USN If nothing else, this could be a signal that India will be less inclined to consider any offering from Russia. The Indians and the Russians have been working together on fifth generation fighter jet development for some time, there have been repeated reports that the Indian Air Force is frustrated with the lack of results from the Su-57 stealth fighter project and more recently there has been the suggestion that authorities in New Delhi might finally scrap that work altogether. It was possible that the Kremlin’s otherwise curious decision to send a pair of its prototype jets to Syria in February 2018 was in part to try and demonstrate more significant progress with that program. Of the remaining likely contenders, only some are actively working on low-observable aircraft. Not all of them are doing so at the same level or are developing a fifth generation fighter specifically. A pre-production Su-57 stealth fighter., Aktug Ates via Wikimedia Boeing has been working on some limited low-observable upgrade options for the Super Hornet , as well the latest models of its F-15 Eagle , such as fully-enclosed weapons pods or conformal add-on bays . This level of technological knowhow may not be enough satisfy the DRDO’s desire for broader help with the ACMA. While Dassault has been working on stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), European aviation consortium Airbus – which supports production of the Typhoon in various countries – has been the firm more actively working on France’s future fifth generation fighter project. Regardless, French stealth fighter and UCAV programs are also in partnership with Germany and the United Kingdom , respectively, which could add another hurdle in sharing any appropriate technical information with the Indians. Saab has been quietly working on the Swedish Air Force’s Flygsystem 2020 stealth fighter project for at least a decade now, but the exact status of that development is unclear. In 2013, the company did sign a deal to support Turkey’s fifth generation TFX project . A scale model of the Generic Future Fighter , a product of a partnership between  Saab and Sweden’s Linköping University, which is serving as a starting point for the Flygsystem 2020 design., Linköping University Lockheed Martin is the only competitor actively producing a fifth generation fighter jet, the F-35, which could give it a leg up again in the competition. The Maryland-headquartered company had already made a particularly appealing pitch in the last iteration of the competition, stating that if its F-16IN won, it would establish a joint production line with Indian manufacturing conglomerate Tata to build jets for the Indian Air Force and use that same domestic assembly line to churn out additional aircraft for export elsewhere. On top of that, it said it would consider working with Tata to build Viper components even if the contract fell through. It is conceivable that the firm might now propose a new deal wherein India buys conventional F-35As for the Indian Air Force and gets additional help with the ACMA. Lockheed Martin might then also offer the short and vertical takeoff capable F-35B or carrier-focused C models as options for the Indian Navy’s tender. The U.S. government will have to approve any deal involving an American company and this might be a more complicated procedure with regards to the sensitive technology in the F-35. American authorities will have to gauge whether or not they believe it is in the country’s best interests to give India access to and details about low-observable design features and manufacturing processes, as well as advanced avionics, radars, sensor systems, data links, computer networks, and other mission systems. However, President Donald Trump and his administration have shown much greater willingness to explore selling Joint Strike Fighters more broadly, including to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia , already. The administration has also looked to bolster its ties with India in general, making the country a centerpiece of its new Afghanistan and South Asian policy goals. It’s not hard to imagine Lockheed Martin getting approval for a deal to sell dozens of F-35A, B, and C models to the Indian government, which could potentially help in further driving down the plane’s unit costs, which is a major goal for the U.S. military. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF But India may not be as interested in buying any foreign stealth fighter as it is in getting assistance for the domestic ACMA. In February 2018, there were reports that Indian authorities had requested a classified briefing on the Joint Strike Fighter, but the next month Indian Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa publicly denied those claims . This episode followed a Press Trust of India report in January 2018 that suggested Lockheed Martin was considering establishing a production line for the F-35 in India. The company subsequently said that report has misstated remarks from one of its executives and added that there were no plans to build even a less expansive final assembly and checkout facility, or FACO, in the country. At present there are FACOs in Italy and Japan supporting the international Joint Strike Fighter program. And even if India were to receive U.S. government approval to purchase the F-35 and pursue that option, it’s not clear what kind of technological information Lockheed Martin might truly be willing to transfer in the end and to what degree. Most importantly, as it stands now, with the exception of Israel , all the countries taking part in the Joint Strike Fighter project have found themselves linked in large part to a multi-national logistics and information chain thanks to the jet’s on board computer brain, called the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). A US Marine Corps F-35B., USN This has already prompted concerns in a number of countries about how much sensitive data the jets are collecting and potentially sending to Lockheed Martin or the U.S. government or if they might be shut off from software updates or other critical data in an emergency. At the same time, even when working with the U.S. military, Lockheed Martin has been especially keen to keep control over as much of its proprietary network architecture as possible. The U.S. military has similarly shared concerns about whether or not this level of connectivity puts the United States’ own capabilities at risk. Foreign computer networks may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks and espionage or could be deliberately linked to systems that might feed information on to hostile nations. Turkey, for instance, wants to connect its future F-35s to the rest of its integrated air defense net, which will eventually include Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. Similar considerations could easily apply to requests for technology transfer from any other entrant into the revised Indian fighter competition. In turn, it seems very likely that linking both requirements together could easily slow down the overall process, even after India picks a winning design, due to the need for complex negotiations. The Indian purchase of just 36 Rafale jets for the country’s air force experienced significant delays due to disputes over technology transfer and local production and that deal remains clouded in controversy . All of this comes as the Indian Air Force is increasingly in desperate need of new fighter jets, whether they be advanced fourth generation or stealthy fifth generation designs. Since 2001 , the service has made it clear that it has a standing requirement for more than 100 aircraft to replace a host of aging types that are increasingly literally falling out of the sky . Indian Air Force official try to keep bystanders away from the a crashed MiG-27 combat jet in 2016. , Sipa via AP India is also facing increasing challenges from China, which is expanding its influence in Asia and elsewhere around the world , as well as the need to provide a credible defense against long-time rival Pakistan . According to The Hindustan Times , China has approximately 60 squadrons of combat aircraft, while Pakistan has 25. The Indian government has said that, in order to counter those potential threats and perform other necessary missions, the Indian Air Force needs at least 42 squadrons of combat aircraft itself. At present, it has 31, down from 33 in 2017, and that number is almost certain to continue to drop dramatically over the next decade unless something changes. It’s seems increasingly clear that India cannot afford to wait much longer to acquire additional aircraft. And whether or not it will be able to rely on a domestic project, even with foreign assistance, to produce a stealth fighter design in a timely manner isn’t guaranteed, either. Fifth generation fighter jet programs have historically shown themselves to be exceptionally costly and time consuming , even for manufacturers with histories of building stealthy aircraft . India’s own effort to develop a much less complex indigenous fourth generation type, the Tejas , has been beset by both technical and bureaucratic hurdles. That aircraft, as it exists now, has largely failed to meet expectations despite more than two decades of work, with the Indian Navy rejecting the idea of buying a carrier based version of it outright. As it stands now, India is clearly pushing ahead with its desire to use this fighter jet tender to help expand its on domestic production military aviation capacity and capabilities. At a certain point, it may have to temper those goals with the increasingly pressing need for capable combat aircraft, but its not clear whether that would do anything to get past the country’s otherwise historically dysfunctional or erratic procurement process.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 8, 2019",Turkey To Add Ukrainian Active Defenses To Its German and U.S. Tanks Operating In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey is racing to add active protection systems to its tanks as its armored units continue to suffer losses at the hands Kurdish rebels . But with relations strained between Turkish authorities and many of their traditional partners , including the United States, Israel, and Germany, the government in Ankara has now turned to a Ukrainian firm to help supply the new defensive equipment. According to a report by Defense Update , the Turkish government recently put out an urgent request for 120 complete active protection systems to go on M60A3, M60T , and Leopard 2A4 tanks . In response, Turkish defense contractor Aselsan obtained a license from Ukraine’s Microtek to produce a version of their Zaslon-L system, which it calls the Akkor Pulat. Aselsan’s own Akkor system is still in development after nearly a decade of work. In February 2018, Turkey’s Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said that Microtek was still finishing testing of the Zaslon-L in Ukraine. Afterwards, Aselsan will begin working to integrate the system onto Turkish tanks. It’s not clear how long it will take before the first tanks with an operational active protection system will reach units in the field. The 120 systems will only cover a small portion of the country’s more than 600 American-made M60A3s and upgraded M60Ts and more than 300 German-built Leopard 2A4s, as well. They will likely go to tanks Turkey has committed to its intervention in Syria or has deployed on domestic operations against Kurdish militants. A pair of Turkish Leopard 2A4 tanks., Turkish Armed Forces Turkey appears to have chosen the Ukrainian setup in no small part because it represents a relatively easy to install option. Zaslon-L is a so-called “hard-kill” system that consists of a number of countermeasure modules and the necessary cables to connect them to a central control unit. Each one of the modules is a self-contained unit, with both a radar sensor to detect incoming anti-tank rockets or guided missiles and a high explosive fragmentation charge to neutralize them before they hit the vehicle. Microtek says the system can have as many modules as a customer deems appropriate, but Aselsan says the Akkor Pulat variant will have six in total, one facing forward, another pointing backwards, and two on each side of the tank. An artists rendition of the Akkor Pulat active protection system, with the modules highlighted in red, on an M60T tank. The graphic shows the system defeating a Russian-made 9M133 Kornet anti-tank guided missile., Aselsan Turkish tankers, who are presently facing opponents armed with Russian, Iranian, and American-made anti-tank guided missiles in Syria, are no doubt eager to get this added defensive suite. Kurdish fighters have claimed to have damaged or destroyed a number of M60s and Leopard 2A4s since Turkey’s intervention in the far northwestern Afrin region began in January 2018 . https://youtube.com/watch?v=84Xg87AY2po It’s not the first time Turkey’s armored formations have run into trouble in Syria, either. In 2016, the country launched another foray into Syria, but further to the east, engaging both Kurdish groups and ISIS. The terrorist group claimed to have destroyed between eight and 10 Turkish tanks over the course of that operation. Guided anti-tank missiles and shoulder-fired unguided anti-tank weapons are only continuing to proliferate more widely among nation state and non-state actors in general. Newer weapons, such as Russia’s RPG-30 , are now incorporating features to try and defeat present generation active protection systems, as well. But the Akkor Pulat’s relatively simplicity and ease of installation will likely come at the cost of reduced effectiveness compared to other active protection systems on the market. Each module can engage just one projectile, which would leave the front and rear aspects vulnerable after a single use or to an attack involving multiple rockets or missiles. Microtek designed the units to be disposable, which means crews will need to replace a module in its entirety after it detonates, something that could be difficult to do in the field. The original, full-size Zaslon system uses reloadable modules with two countermeasure charges each. The video below shows the features of Microtek’s standard Zaslon system and the company’s separate Duplet explosive reactive armor suite. Turkey already plans to add additional defensive measures to its tanks in addition to Akkor Pulat, which could help mitigate some of these limitations. According to Defense Update, Turkish tanks may also get explosive reactive armor to blow up incoming rockets and missiles, stand-off bar or slat armor to detonate them prematurely, or automatic smoke grenade launchers to obscure the tank against enemy personnel using optically aimed and guided weapons. Unfortunately, none of this will change the fact that the cylindrical explosive charges are also dangerous to any who happens to be within 1,300 feet when they detonate. This means that the Akkor Pulat might be able to protect the tank, but poses a real danger to any nearby friendly infantry or innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. The video below shows tests of the Zaslon active protection system, giving a good sense of how violently the countermeasures explode. Those escorting troops are essential to helping protect the tank from getting ambushed or otherwise overwhelmed, especially in dense urban areas. The vehicle’s crew can use the control box to turn off certain modules to reduce the hazard the system poses to friendly forces, but would leave those areas without any added protection as a result. This has long been an inherent issue with hard-kill active protection systems and one that has historically limited the more widespread adoption of these types of defenses. But Turkey might not have a lot of other options, though. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s increasingly authoritarian nature , including a massive crackdown against political opponents following an attempted coup in 2016 , along with the country’s increasingly assertive foreign policy had caused an increasing rift with traditional allies, including fellow NATO members the United States and Germany. The government in Ankara has also seen steadily strained relations with Israel, another long-time partner. This has increasingly closed off Turkey’s access to defense contractors in those countries, including Israel’s Rafael and Germany’s Rheinmetall , both of whom make advanced active protection systems with multiple sensors, failsafes, and other safety features. The U.S. Army is now buying Rafael’s Trophy system for its own M1 Abrams tanks , a major vote of confidence in that system. In January 2018, the German government announced it would consider delaying allowing Turkey to send its Leopard 2A4s back to the manufacturer to recieve upgrades , including improved protection against mines and improvised explosive devices. This did not come to pass, however, likely in part due to Turkey’s decision to release a Turkish-German journalist Deniz Yücel, who it had arrested on charges of spreading propaganda and inciting hatred after he had criticized Erdoğan and his government. It’s still somewhat curious that Turkey decided to partner with a Ukrainian supplier when shopping for active protection systems given Turkey’s growing ties with Russia . The Kremlin is actively supporting a separatist insurgency fighting the government in Kiev and is illegally occupying Ukraine’s Crimea region despite international censure. We don’t know whether or not Turkish authorities considered purchasing the Russian Arena hard-kill active protection system before selecting a locally-made version of Zaslon-L. Though typically found on Russian-made tanks, manufacturer KBM does offer an export-oriented Arena-E variant that would theoretically work on any armored vehicle. However the Turkish government’s final decision was made, some of the country’s American and German tanks fighting in Syria look set to get a Ukrainian-designed active protection system in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 22, 2019",US Special Operators Want a Super Vehicle They Can Disguise As Different Civilian Trucks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To give special operators’ a better option when they need to move around discreetly in foreign locales , U.S. Special Operations Command has purchased hundreds of modified commercial pickups and sport utility vehicles over the years.  But with multiple different types from different manufacturers in service, this fleet has become increasingly complicated and expensive to maintain and now the command wants new, standardized vehicles that have a James Bond-esque ability to imitate to looks and sounds of the existing trucks. In February 2018, representatives from the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) program office that oversees special operations vehicle development and procurement sat down with contractors to explain what they were looking for and get feedback about its proposed performance specifications for what they’re officially calling the Purpose Built Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle, or PB-NSCV . The Pentagon’s top special operations headquarters is hoping to hold a “vehicle rodeo” in early 2019, issue a formal request for proposals by the end of that year, and select a final design to replace some of its more than 500 existing vehicles in 2020. An existing $170 million contract to support the present fleet will end in 2023. Having a purpose-built design “may allow a portion of the fleet to satisfy the more strict mission requirements (payload, rugged mission profile, durability),” a briefing, which SOCOM subsequently released on the U.S. government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps , explained. It also might offer “the potential to reduce cost on the rest of the NSCV fleet by not requiring every vehicle to meet the broad mission requirements.” At present, special operators have access to a mix of Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux, and Land Cruiser 79-series pickups, as well as Land Cruiser 76, 78, and 200-series sport utility vehicles (SUVs). The various types offer a flexible set of options with different load carrying capacities and levels of armor. A US Army Special Forces soldier observers as soldiers from Burkina Faso practice stopping a suspicious vehicle and detaining the occupants during a training exercise. American special operators use modified commercial trucks, based on vehicles like the this Toyota Land Cruiser, for their own operations., US Army This diversity is also due to the fact that certain types are more prevalent than others in different regions of the world where special operators might be working. Toyota Hilux and Land Cruiser types, for instance, are commonplace in Africa and the Middle East, but less so in Europe. But it’s also increasingly a logistical nightmare that is costly to maintain. Original and modified parts from one of SOCOM’s Toyota aren’t necessarily interchangeable with those on a Ford and vice versa. Two different model year trucks within the same series – say a 2010 Toyota Land Cruiser and a 2016 one – might not even share all their components. The command already appears to have been trying to simply the situation somewhat by eliminating a number of older Nissan trucks. Now SOCOM is proposing a novel solution that sounds like something out of action movie or G.I. Joe play set. The new PB-NSCV will have a standard chassis and drive train with a 10 to 15 year life cycle, greatly streamlining routine maintenance and more intensive overhauls and the logistics chain. The vehicle’s body, however, will be able to accept “interchangeable skins” to make it look like a Ranger or a Land Cruiser as necessary. A slide from the PB-NSCV industry day briefing giving a broad look at the proposed concept., SOCOM The kits need to be able to transform the base truck into at least a Ford Ranger or a Toyota Hilux Vigo, but hopefully will be able to mimic the lines of a Toyota Land Cruiser 200, as well. Contractors would supply these panels and other components in crates that units could use to reconfigure their trucks at forward operating bases and more established facilities. SOCOM says the effect has to be good enough that the vehicle will be essentially indistinguishable from their commercial counterparts to observers standing approximately 330 feet away while it’s traveling at a nominal speed of 35 miles an hour. It also can’t sound like a military truck is hiding underneath while it’s idling, though the command admits it hasn’t figured out yet how it plans to test these acoustic signatures. Beyond that the new chassis and drive trains will offer improved performance over the present modified commercial designs, which could expand their capabilities and allow them to perform more demanding missions. The purpose-built vehicles will have greatly increased payload capacity and overall weight limits in order to better handle added armor, weapons, and other gear without a significant loss of performance. The proposed PB-NSCV will have a curb weight of no more than 9,500 pounds, but be able to support a full gross weight of at least 12,500 pounds. For comparison, a new double cab Toyota Hilux straight off the dealership lot has a standard gross weight of less than 6,500 pounds and a payload capacity of around 2,300 pounds, for a combined weight of approximately 8,800 pounds. A typical commercial standard Toyota Hilux double cab pickup., Toyota SOCOM also wants the trucks to be able to fit inside one of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s MH-47 Chinook helicopters in at least a stripped down state. The hope is that contractors will be able to meet this requirement with a vehicle at its gross weight, but the command acknowledged in its briefing that the aircraft’s physical constraints could make that a difficult proposition. There is a separate demand that special operators be able to sling load the PB-NSCV underneath a Chinook or a Sikorsky H-53 pattern helicopter, such as the Marine Corps’ CH-53E Super Stallion or its future CH-53K King Stallion . It’ll have to fit inside a C-130-size airlifter, too. The goal is to bake in a certain level of modularity into the design so that units can install certain features and otherwise upgrade specialized gear as necessary, instead of costly fleet-wide modification programs, as well. Common mission equipment on these vehicles can include encrypted military communications systems, devices to jam remote detonated improvised explosive devices, and radio direction finding and other compact signal intelligence suites to help spot and track enemy movements via their radio and cell phone signals. As far as firepower goes, the PB-NSCV will have provisions for either a mounted .50 caliber M2 machine gun or possibly even a remote weapon station, the latter of which would allow personnel to fire this main weapon from within the vehicle and not necessarily have to expose themselves to enemy fire. Pickup truck variants will have a another mount in the rear bed that can accept various 7.62mm and 5.56mm light machine guns. US special operators with a modified Land Cruiser pickup truck in Syria in 2016., DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images All told, the proposed vehicle does sound impressive, especially if it can truly mimic the look of existing commercial trucks. But it also does raise the question of whether or not the basic idea of a “purpose built” yet “non-standard” design is a cost effective option or a truly viable alternative. The challenging requirements, especially the need to readily imitate existing vehicles, could easily result in an expensive baseline vehicle. This is before one takes into account the added expense of buying and pre-positioning the alternate body kits and other equipment at locations around the world, as well as the likely necessary licensing fees to Ford and Toyota so defense contractors can build those components in the first place. It is not at all clear that this would automatically offer a cheaper option when compared to specially modifying commercial-off-the-shelf trucks. On top of that, in question and answer sessions that followed the main briefing in February 2018, various contractors in attendance highlighted potential issues with the “blendability” requirements. They noted that it would be near impossible to hide all of the military-style features – including specialized infrared headlights and blackout turn signals for nighttime operations – that SOCOM wants to have on the trucks. Many of those same issues already apply to the command’s existing fleet, which is supposed to provide a “low visibility” means of operating in “politically or operationally constrained” environments, according to a separate 2017 SOCOM briefing . Those trucks are often covered in antennas and other equipment, sport large machine guns, and carry heavily armed special operators. Another US special operations Land Cruiser in Syria in 2016, with a large mounted weapon, making it hard to imagine that anyone would mistake it for a civilian vehicle., DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images There is a growing debate over the exact value of these vehicles in general, especially in light of a terrorist ambush in Niger in October 2017 that killed four U.S. Army soldiers. Those individuals had been traveling in these modified trucks at the time as part of a larger convoy that included Nigerien security forces. Helmet camera footage from the event, which the terrorist group Islamic State in the Greater Sahara recently released online, indicates that the trucks afforded little protection during the ensuing battle. It’s still not clear if heavier vehicles, such as an up-armored Humvee or a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) truck would have necessarily changed the outcome of the incident, which reportedly involved dozens of enemy fighters in their own trucks and armed with heavy machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. In 2016, a Jordanian soldier murdered three American special operators at an entry checkpoint to a facility in that country. In that incident, the U.S. personnel were again traveling in Hilux pickups at the time. That being said, a heavier, more obviously military vehicle is unlikely to be appropriate in all situations and in many cases could actually raise the risks to American personnel operating abroad by making them and their routine movements more visible to potential enemies. Regularly using MRAPs or other similar trucks could potentially have a destabilizing political impact in certain areas, as well, giving the impression of a major American intervention, or even an invasion, rather reflecting the actual more limited training and advisory deployments. A special-operations specific version of the MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV), known as the M1245, which is among the heavier, better protected vehicles available to American special operators., USMC We have already seen an example of the need for this flexibility during the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, where US special operations forces have employed both up-armored Humvees and MRAP-type vehicles in certain situations. However, they have also been seen riding in modified pickups and SUVs, special lightweight battle buggies , and small all-terrain vehicles . Still, the requirements for the PB-NSCV seem to be at least somewhat of an acknowledgment that the capabilities of the present fleet are indeed limited in certain cases and there is a need for additional capabilities. It will be interesting to see what concepts contractors will be able to come up with that outwardly present the look and feel of a regular civilian pickup truck, but conceal a specialized military vehicle.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",Norway Says Russian Aircraft Ran Mock Attacks On A Secretive Radar Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of the Norway’s main military intelligence arm says his agency has watched as Russian military aircraft flew a number of simulated attacks on key military installations in his country and NATO warships in the region . The incidents offer yet more evidence that the Kremlin is taking an increasingly aggressive stance toward the Western alliance and that it is looking for ways harass it and its other European partners that don’t run the risk setting off an actual conflict. Norwegian Air Force Lieutenant General Morten Haga Lunde, who is now in charge of the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), also known as the Etterretningstjenesten or E-tjenesten , gave details about three separate incidents in 2017 in an annual speech to the Oslo Military Society on March 5, 2018. Neither Norwegian authorities nor NATO officials appear to have previously disclosed the threatening looking flights toward a shadowy radar facility in the town of Vardø along the Barents Sea, a flotilla of NATO ships in the Norwegian Sea, and various military facilities near the city of Bodø in northern Norway. “Less than a year ago, on March 24th, Russian bombers were flying tactical flights towards the intelligence service’s installations in Vardø,” Haga Lunde said, according to a report by The Independent Barents Observer. “The bombers were conducting offensive profiles before they returned to bases on Kola.” The intelligence official said nine planes in total had taken part in the apparent exercise, but did not say what type of Russian bombers he was referring to in this case or how close they got to Norwegian air space before turning around. Russia’s Olenya Air Base on the Kola Peninsula is home to Tu-22M Backfire bombers, but also serves as a staging location for Tu-95 Bears. A Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber., Dmitriy Pichugin via Wikimedia That the Russians would choose the Vardø radar installation as a target for a training exercise, though, isn’t necessarily surprising. The site and its Globus II array , which Raytheon originally built for the U.S. Air Force, are shrouded in secrecy. Officially, the radar’s job is to monitor air and space activity, as well as collect data for research and development purposes. An old Raytheon website, however, said the X-band system, also known as the AN/FPS-129 Have Stare, had a specific capability to gather intelligence about ballistic missile launches. The company subsequently pulled that profile page down, reportedly at the behest of the U.S. military. A screenshot of Raytheon’s now offline profile page on the AN/FPS-129 Have Stare radar., Raytheon via the Center for Arms Control, Energy and Environmental Studies This has led some to suggest that Globus II’s main job is actually to serve as a sensor node in NATO’s ballistic missile defense shield, tracking missiles and potentially cuing sea- or land-based interceptors, such as the Aegis and Aegis Ashore missile defense systems the U.S. military is working to establish in Europe. The Kremlin routinely complains these systems are aimed at neutralizing their strategic capabilities, despite the fact that they are simply not able to challenge Russia’s nuclear deterrent. There is also a possibility that the radar is more pointedly gathering intelligence on nearby Russian military activity, serves as a cover for a separate electronic intelligence system, or both. The array by itself could have the range and power to “peer inside” Russia and closely monitor military movements or gather information about missile tests depending on the location of the launch sites and flight trajectories. If it wasn’t for the secretive military base behind it, Vardø would just be another Norwegian fishing village. The white randome to the right houses the Globus II radar., Michael Narten/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP In 2000, a storm ripped off the randome and showed the array was pointing at Russia, but Norwegian officials claimed it was a coincidence. In 2016, Norway announced it would begin building a new array, commonly referred to as Globus III, and that it expected the construction would be finished in 2020. Either as a ballistic missile defense sensor or an intelligence gathering outpost, during any potential conflict, Vardø would likely be an important target for Russian forces to neutralize as quickly as possible. It might help explain why Russia positioned Iskander-M nuclear-capable short-range ballistic missiles in the Pechnega valley, within 10 miles of the Norwegian border and well within range of the radar site, during the massive Zapad-2017 exercises – another piece of information Haga Lunde revealed during his speech. An Iskander-M transporter-erector-launcher moving its two short-range ballistic missiles into their firing position., Vitaly Kuzmin The Kremlin insists that those drills, which it holds every four years with Belarus and includes thousands of troops, are for defensive purposes only. However, the large scale exercises appear to simulate a major conflict against a high-end opponent, such as NATO and its other European partners, including non-member states along Russia’s borders, such as Finland and Sweden. In October 2017 , reports emerged that the Russians had jammed cell phone and GPS networks in Scandinavia and the Baltic region during Zapad-2017. Responding to those reports, Norway’s E-tjenesten confirmed GPS outages had occurred in and around the country’s borders and that the source of the interference came from Russia, but the agency also said they did not believe the Russians had deliberately targeted any states in particular with the apparent test of their growing capabilities in this regard. But Lieutenant General Haga Lunde said that incidents involving Russia hadn’t been limited to areas near Norway’s borders with Russia. In May 2017, a dozen Russian combat aircraft, including Tu-22M Backfire bombers, Su-34 Fullback multi-role combat jets, MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors, and Su-24 Fencer strike planes, flew from bases in the Kola Peninsula and appeared to set up for attack runs on NATO ships conducting an exercise in the Norwegian Sea much further to the west. According to the Barents Observer, Haga Lunde did not specify what NATO drills he was referring to, but the date he mentioned matched up with the EASTLANT 17 naval exercise. EASTLANT 17 was a German-led, Norwegian hosted anti-submarine training event that also included the U.S. Navy. Submarines from each country took part, providing realistic targets for surface warships and maritime patrol planes to practice hunting, while giving those crews and opportunity to test their own skills. The US Navy’s Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Leyte Gulf , at left, sails with German and Norwegian ships and submarines during EASTLANT 17, USN Later in May 2017, another nine unspecified Russian aircraft reportedly appeared near the city of Bodø, Haga Lunde said. At the time, NATO air forces, along with aircraft from Sweden and Finland, were conducting a major aerial drill called Arctic Challenge . This was the biggest air warfare exercise in Western Europe in 2017, involving more than 100 aircraft from 12 nations in total. The incident prompted the Norwegian Air Force to scramble F-16 Viper fighter jets to intercept the Russians . There is no indication that Russian aircraft got close enough to directly interfere with Norwegian military or NATO activities or create an otherwise dangerous situation. But the incidents do represent an increase in general tensions between Russia and its neighbors in Scandinavia, as well as NATO more broadly, and tit-for-tat responses from the Kremlin since 2014. A Norwegian F-16 Viper fighter jet takes off from Bodø Air Base during Arctic Challenge 2017., Norwegian Armed Forces In that year, Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region and began actively supporting separatists fighting the government in Kiev, prompting condemnation from NATO members and other countries around the world. That criticism has only grown as a result of Russia’s support for Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad. International waters and airspace in and around the Baltic Sea and Black Sea , where NATO members and their partners often come into contact with Russian forces, have similarly seen heightened tensions. This largely indirect harassment of foreign military activities, along with other hybrid warfare campaigns , such as spreading disinformation and executing cyber attacks on foreign military personnel and political institutions , are becoming hallmarks of Russia’s increasingly assertive foreign policy. These approaches all offer the Kremlin relatively low-risk means to challenge its opponents in ways that are unlikely to provoke an actual war. They also muddy the waters and distract from Russia’s own transgressions. At the same time, Russian officials, and the country’s President Vladimir Putin in particular, seem more of the opinion than ever that the United States, the rest of NATO, and their partners are threat. In a fiery speech on March 1, 2018, Putin publicly unveiled a host of “invincible” strategic weapons and made a number of veiled threats toward the United States and the rest of Russia’s international opponents. As such, unfortunately, it seems unlikely that the incidents Lieutenant General Haga Lunde described will come to an end any time soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2019",Navy to Slash Legacy F/A-18 Hornet Fleet To Prop Up Beleaguered USMC Squadrons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has revealed that it will send 136 older F/A-18A-D Hornets to the boneyard to serve as parts donors for other jets, which it will eventually turn over to the Marine Corps. At the same time, the service is buying more F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and has hired Boeing to begin overhauling and upgrading existing Super Hornets to the new Block III configuration . On March 6, 2018, Defense News reported that the Navy had approved plans to strike the F/A-18A-D Hornets from the rolls over a period spanning between the 2017 and 2020 fiscal years. Based on data from the service’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released in February 2018, and our own analysis, the service had around 270 of these variants, also known collectively as Legacy Hornets, in inventory, as of Jan. 1, 2018. This includes including jets assigned to training, test, and reserve squadrons and the Blue Angels demonstration team . Two separate reviews in 2017 “determined that 136 aircraft could be authorized for strike because their effective life was consumed and would require significant repair,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant Lauren Chatmas, a service spokesperson, told Defense News. “The decision was based upon readiness risk of existing F/A-18A-D inventory, long term operational costs versus gain in capability, and the potential to improve USMC [U.S. Marine Corps] readiness by transferring best of breed aircraft to the USMC.” Under this plan, the Navy will then take parts from the retired aircraft to support the remaining planes until such time as it replaces them with newer F/A-18E/Fs. The service expects that four squadrons will get Super Hornets by the end of 2019, but it didn’t disclose which units were in line for the new aircraft. A US Navy F/A-18C Hornet assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron Eight Three (VFA-83) lands on the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in 2015, USN Chatmas explained to Defense News that the service expects this process will save it almost $125 million in the 2019 fiscal year and more than $850 million across its five-year budget outlay. The costs to operate the Legacy Hornets, some of which first entered service in the 1980s , have steadily grown over the years, especially with those jets now long out of production. The Navy’s plan will also hopefully help the Marines improve the abysmal availability rates of their own Legacy Hornets. The Navy will eventually send the Legacy Hornets with the most life left in them to the Marine Corps as it takes delivery of new Super Hornets. Per the Marine Corps’ 2018 Aviation Plan , it has almost 180 F/A-18A-Ds spread out across active, reserve, and training squadrons. According to previous reports, there are another approximately 100 aircraft “ out of reporting ” and undergoing heavy maintenance. But as of February 2017, more than half of the Marine Corps F/A-18A-Ds reportedly weren’t airworthy at all , let alone mission ready, on average. In 2016, the service had taken 30 Legacy Hornets that had been sitting in the main U.S. military aircraft boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and returned them to active service, a costly and time consuming process. That same year, it became so desperate it even raided a museum for other necessary components to keep its jets going. An F/A-18C Hornet from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Three One Two (VMFA-312) on board the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2017., USN This is something of a self-manufactured problem . At present, the Marines plan to transition straight from the F/A-18A-D to the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, without purchasing Super Hornets in the interim. Unfortunately, developmental trouble and other delays have slowed the process of getting the stealthy fighter jets into service. The Marines don’t expect to be able to retire their last Legacy Hornets until at least 2030, meaning it will have to find ways to keep those jets flying in the meantime. The hand-me-downs could be a major boon to the Marines. Depending on whether or not the Navy has to complete strip the retired aircraft of useful components, those donor airframes could continue to support Marine Corps Hornets, as well. The deciding factor will be how fast the Navy can transition its own units and get the Legacy Hornets to Marine squadrons. The Navy, on the other hand, does expect to operate a mixed fighter jet force of F/A-18E/Fs and its variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35C, for the foreseeable future, something that seems unlikely to change given its plans for the Legacy Hornets. The service actually wants to buy more Super Hornets – 110 in total – than Joint Strike Fighters between the 2019 and 2023 fiscal years. A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet., Boeing The Navy is also putting the F/A-18E/Fs it already has through an extensive overhaul and modernization project. This includes a service life extension program and an upgrade project to bring the jets up to a new Block III standard . The service life extension update will give each Super Hornet at least 3,000 extra flight hours, raising each aircraft’s total life expectancy to 9,000 flight hours. The manufacturer, Boeing, says the improvements may allow the jets to fly even longer and will keep them operational for another 10 to 15 years. On March 1, 2018, the Chicago-headquartered plane maker announced that it had received the first contract, worth up to $73 million, to begin overhauling four Navy F/A-18E/F aircraft at its plant in St. Louis, Missouri. The company says it will open a production line at its San Antonio, Texas plant specifically for this program in 2019. Boeing will combine this traditional service life extension work with the Block III upgrades, as well, to try and streamline the process overall. The new configuration will include infrared search and track capability, conformal fuel tanks , updated electronic warfare systems, a larger widescreen cockpit display, an improved mission computer, and data links with greater capacity to send and receive information. An artist’s conception of a two-seat Block III Super Hornet, including the conformal fuel tanks., Boeing The infrared search and track system will complement the jet’s already powerful AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array radar, giving the pilot additional tools to spot enemies at extended ranges. Conformal fuel tanks will help boost the aircraft’s overall range without the need for drop tanks, allowing it to carry more weapons or other stores across those distances. As we at The War Zone have explored in depth before , combined with the improved electronic defenses, data links, and other mission systems, the new jets will be even more capable, even when operating in potentially higher threat environments, together with other Navy assets or those from other U.S. military services or foreign allies. There is also talk about adding other upgrades to the Super Hornets, including some limited stealthy features, such as a fully enclosed weapons pod , and a more powerful, fuel efficient engine , but these updates are unlikely to be part of the final Block III configuration. Boeing says the combined upgrade process will take approximately 18 months per aircraft at the start, but that they hope to trim that down to 12 months as the facilities at San Antonio come on line and they work through any residual issues. The first four airframes will serve as an important trial run and both Boeing and the Navy have been working together since 2017 to get a better understanding of exactly what the process will entail. The two parties are eager not to repeat the issues they experienced with an earlier service life extension effort for older F/A-18C/D Hornets that started in 2012. That project suffered extensive delays as a product of trying to do the work as an extension of normal, but less intensive depot-level maintenance. The program hit a number of unexpected issues, including discovering more extensive structure wear and tear and corrosion than expected, as contractors actually began pulling the planes apart. In 2017, the Navy even supplied two Super Hornets with very high flight hours to Boeing to help the company understand what it might see when it began overhauling the jets. It also gave the firm a chance to see whether the jets had help up according to its existing predictions, which it had developed through modeling, simulation, and physical torture testing of various components. One of the two Super Hornets the Navy sent to Boeing, that the company stripped down to better understand what it could expect during future upgrade work., Boeing “We have not found any significant indications beyond what we were expecting,” Mark Sears, Boeing’s director of the service life modification program, told USNI News in October 2017. “In fact, in some areas we found significantly less than what we were expecting.” However, some Super Hornets will likely have to go through the process in multiple phases or “waves,” which could extend the overall time it takes to get fully modernized jets back in service. The full service life extension kits won’t be ready until 2022 or 2023, meaning that jets in need of the new parts before then will only get a partial update and then will have to go back to the factory for additional modifications at a later date. It’s not clear how many of its more than 540 F/A-18E/Fs the Navy will ultimately put through the upgrade program. Boeing says it will also be delivering future Hornets in the Block III configuration, which might reduce some of the more immediate demands for updated planes. Whatever the final figures and aircraft configurations might look like, and over what time frames, the Navy does appear to be steadily trimming back its fleet of Legacy Hornets in favor of more capable Super Hornets. If all goes according to plan, this could also help the Marine Corps Hornet squadrons remain mission capable until it can acquire sufficient numbers of F-35Bs.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian An-26 transport aircraft has crashed while on approach to land at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria’s western Latakia governorate. Details surrounding the circumstances are still emerging, but none of the 26 passengers or six flight crew survived. According to statements from the Russian Ministry of Defense , the crash occurred at 7:00 AM, Eastern Standard Time, or 3:00 PM local time in Moscow. The twin engine An-26 hit the ground approximately 550 yards short of the runway. Beyond the 32 individuals on board, it is not clear if the aircraft was carrying any cargo. We also don’t know who the passengers were and whether they were military personnel or civilian officials. In September 2017, another An-26 brought members of the press to the base. “According to preliminary information, a technical problem could have been the cause of the crash.” the Russian Ministry of Defense said, according to state-run news outlet TASS . “According to reports from the scene, no fire was delivered against the plane.” Though there is no information yet to suggest that this wasn’t an accident, it is important to remember that Khmeimim has come under increasing attack since the beginning of 2018, including being subject to a mass drone attack . Video and images of the base routinely appear on social media, including recent footage of a pair of Su-57 stealth fighters arriving in February 2018 , indicating that individuals can get relatively close to the perimeter. Concerns about nearby rebels being able to shoot down slow-flying aircraft reportedly led the Russians to employ fighter jets as “ heat traps ” to help safeguard President Vladimir Putin’s Tu-214PU presidential transport during his visit to the country in December 2017. Syria rebels did manage to shoot down an Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft in February 2018, reportedly using a short-range man-portable, shoulder-fired surface to air missile, commonly called MANPADS, as well. The Russians have, without supplying any evidence, accused countries opposed to the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, such as the United States and Saudi Arabia , of directly sending these types of weapons to opposition forces or terrorist groups in the past. There’s is nothing to independently suggest this is the case, either. This incident also comes almost three months after Putin declared total victory over terrorists in Syria and promised a major withdrawal of Russian forces from the country, which does not appear to have materialized . He may now have turned to shadowy Kremlin-linked mercenaries to try and distance the Russian government from ongoing active operations in the country, having reportedly approved a plan for those forces to lead pro-Assad militia in an assault on U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in eastern Syria. That operation prompted a devastating American counterattack that blunted the attack . Putin is also vying for a third term as Russia’s president. The controversial, if largely predetermined poll is set for March 18, 2018. We will update this post as more info comes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2019",A Tornado Left the USAF With Only One Active E-4B “Doomsday Plane” for Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New details have emerged about the damage a tornado dealt to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska in 2017, a storm that left only one the U.S. Air Force’s E-4B Nightwatch airborne command centers operational for three months. The incident only further highlights the service’s push to modernize the vital nuclear command and control aircraft, a still evolving plan that could eventually lead to a new aircraft that would also replace the C-32A “Air Force Two” executive transports charged with carrying the Vice President and other senior officials and U.S. Navy’s E-6B Mercury airborne command posts. On June 16, 2017, an EF-1 tornado – defined as a cyclone producing winds between 86 and 110 miles per hour and capable of flipping mobile homes and breaking windows – touched down at Offut, causing almost $20 million in damage in total. This included a more than $8 million bill just to repair both of the E-4Bs, also known as National Airborne Operations Centers (NAOC), which were at the base at the time, according to the Omaha World-Herald . The Air Force has four of the aircraft in total, and, as we reported at the time , Boeing was overhauling a third aircraft at its depot in San Antonio, Texas, leaving the fourth as the only one on active duty at a still undisclosed base. “It was almost the worst possible path,” Colonel Dave Norton, head of the 55th Wing Mission Support Group told the World-Herald . “It’s remarkable that no one was hurt.” The Air Force’s highly specialized 55th Wing is the service’s main unit at the base, which is also home to U.S. Strategic Command, the Pentagon’s headquarters in charge of America’s nuclear arsenal. Squadrons assigned to the 55th fly the E-4B, as well as various RC-135 spy planes , the OC-135 Open Skies surveillance aircraft, and the WC-135 Constant Phoenix nuclear reconnaissance platform. Personnel at Offutt Air Force Base move an E-4B Nightwatch command and control aircraft out of a hangar., USAF The Nightwatch’s primary mission is to safely carry the National Command Authorities and enable to them to order a nuclear strike or other major military operation in response to a crisis. They are also available to assist the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during major natural disasters, to transport the Secretary of Defense and their staff during overseas trips, and to shadow the VC-25A “Air Force One” carrying the President of the United States during foreign visits. In each case, the aircraft is on call to provide important command and control and communications relay functions. Though thankfully the base’s staff escaped the incident unharmed, the Wing’s aircraft, including eight RC-135s, were not so lucky. The two NAOC aircraft found themselves in a particularly bad situation. Initially fearing a hailstorm, the 55th’s personnel had moved the aircraft into a hangar. Though the shelter was not big enough to fully cover the huge E-4Bs, which are heavily modified Boeing 747-200 airliners, this would have at least protected the cockpit, wings, engines, and various randomes and antennas arrayed along the aircrafts’ fuselage. It’s worth noting that despite being home to these aircraft, there is no hangar at Offutt big enough to fully shield them from this kind of storm. The base is well within what is known as “ Tornado Alley ” and routinely runs Tornado National Disaster Rehearsal Exercises (NDRE). To fully protect the E-4s and other specialized planes from any damage, they would likely have had to evacuate to another base, a procedure that requires some amount of time and planning and isn’t always practical, as is obvious from this particular incident. A map showing “Tornado Alley” and the weather patterns that contribute to it., Dan Craggs via Wikimedia When the tornado hit in June 2017, the wind turned the planes’ exposed tails into giant sails, pushing the more than 350,000 pound aircraft around with ease, smacking them into other objects inside the hangar. It was also enough to yank open the already ajar 30,000 pound hangar, exposing everything to the elements outside. “The biggest thing was the noise,” Master Sergeant Ken Parker, a member of the 595th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron who was the superintendent on duty in charge of the facilities at the time, told the World-Herald . “It was deafening.” The storm drove one of the four engine jets into a maintenance stand, punching a hole into its nose. One of the planes ended up leaking fuel from a wing tank, creating a hazardous situation that base firefighters were thankfully able to contain. We still don’t know the full extent of the damage, but apparently it could have been even worse. Master Sergeant Parker, along with Technical Sergeants Olivia Fernandez and Walter Scott, all received commendation medals for their quick thinking before the tornado hit. They risked their lives, ran from where they had taken shelter in a nearby hallway, and removed retaining pins that locked the nose gear in place on both E-4Bs, before returning to safety. An E-4B Nightwatch aircraft., USAF “If (the nose gear) wouldn’t have been allowed to move freely, it could have collapsed,” Parker explained. “The team went in the hangar and tried to save the airplane as best we could.” The damage still sidelined the planes for 11 weeks. The 595th Maintenance Squadron won Air Force Global Strike Command’s annual “Maintenance Effectiveness Award” for their efforts to get those planes, as well as the storm-battered RC-135s, back in service as quickly as possible. Though the Air Force clearly did an impressive job in getting the aircraft flying again, the incident only further underscores the increasing difficulties in sustaining the small and aging E-4B fleet. Boeing introduced its 747-200 in the 1970s and has not produced the aircraft in decades. At the same time, airlines have already divested these earlier Jumbo Jets as operating costs and maintenance demands have steadily increased over the years and many have stopped flying 747-type planes altogether. The Air Force is also facing the prospect of needing to replace four Boeing 757 airliner-based C-32A Air Force Two specialized transport planes. These aircraft, which though far less capable than the 747-200-based VC-25A Air Force Ones that shuttle the President around, still have significant command and control capabilities and are another component in the U.S. government’s aforementioned continuity protocols. A C-32A “Air Force Two” executive transport., Tyler Rogoway On top of that, the service has been looking for ways to collaborate with the U.S. Navy, which is already developing a plan to replace its 16 E-6B Mercury nuclear command and control planes, which use a heavily modified Boeing 707 airliner airframe, even though those aircraft will remain in service until at least 2038. The planes share some functionality with the E-4Bs, notably in their ability to coordinate the release of America’s nuclear weapons for strikes during a crisis. As we at The War Zone have already noted in the past , having a single platform capable of performing these different roles could greatly improve the flexibility of critical nuclear and other executive command and control functions compared to the existing arrangement. A common, more modern airframe would also help reduce operating and maintenance costs. The Navy already flies the Boeing 737-based P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane and the Air Force is hoping to begin receiving Boeing 767-based KC-46 aerial tankers soon, both of which could serve as potential base for a new command and control aircraft. The Chicago-headquartered planemaker’s 777 and 787 aircraft might options, as well, but neither is in military service and it could cost a significant amount to develop and implement a suitable conversion plan for either type. In addition, they are larger and could require more extensive facilities to support them on the ground, further raising costs. A stretched 737-based aircraft would probably still be too small to adequately fill the role of the existing E-4B, C-32A, and E-6B aircraft, potentially making a 767-based platform an even more attractive choice. The Air Force has already demonstrated that the KC-46 might be able to withstand the electromagnetic pulses from a nuclear weapon going off in its existing configuration, which would be a critical capability for any new airborne command and control aircraft. Right now, the Air Force and the Navy are still developing the full requirements and time frame for when a common aircraft might begin to enter service. In President Donald Trump’s first defense budget request, for the 2018 fiscal year, there were plans to set at least $6 million aside to look study options to replace the E-4Bs and the C-32As with a single new platform. There was another, separate multi-million dollar proposal to examine the possibility of finding one type of aircraft to perform the functions of both the E-4B and the E-6B, which the Air Force has begun tentatively referring to as the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC). The Trump Administration’s second proposed defense budget , covering the 2019 fiscal cycle, asks for nearly $18 million to continue both of those so-called “analysis of alternatives.” It does not indicate when either the Air Force or the Navy might arrive at a final decision about how to proceed, or how long it might take after that for them to move through the necessary contracting processes to procure any actual planes. Though this is still a relatively small amount of funding for this project, the Air Force’s budget outlay indicates that the service understands that it needs to move fast if it wants to find a common platform. The budget proposal says the service will ask for nearly $20 million for the SAOC alone in the 2020 fiscal year and then more than $100 million in each of the next three budget cycles. Money for the C-32A replacement project does remain relatively level during that same period, but with a note that the Air Force will continue to “explore commonality and standardization of subsystems and airframes” with the SAOC aircraft. The service could potentially fold the two funding streams together if it more formally consolidates the development and procurement plans. The primary goal appears to be to replace all three aircraft no later than 2040. A common platform could easily enter service incrementally and replace the older E-4B and C-32A aircraft first, with additional planes then arriving to take the place of the newer E-6Bs. An E-6B Mercury command and control aircraft., DOD In the meantime, these aircraft will have to continue to perform their various critical functions. The C-32As are in the midst of a broad upgrade program that should extend their service beyond the aircraft’s original 25-year service life, which they will hit in 2023. The Air Force and the Navy are also continuing to move ahead with scheduled upgrades to the E-6Bs, which will improve their data sharing capacity , command and control capabilities, and additional defenses against both electronic warfare and cyber attacks . In October 2017 , Lockheed Martin and Rockwell Collins both received major contracts – more than $80 and $76 million respectively – to develop prototypes of these new mission systems as part of the Airborne Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R) program. The Air Force is running the project and will eventually select a single contractor to produce and install the equipment. But “we’re only 20 years from 2038, so if you’re going to build large aircraft with huge command and control [requirements], you have to start thinking about those things right now,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of STRATCOM, head already said in March 2017 . “That’s what the Navy is starting to do, I’ve requested they start looking at defining what comes next.” Those command and control requirements, which are essential to the U.S. military’s nuclear deterrent capabilities and the United States’ ability to respond to catastrophic scenarios of all types, only appear to be increasingly important. Increased tensions with North Korea have raised concerns about a potential nuclear strike on the United States to their highest point in decades and Russia recently announced that it is working on a slew of strategic super weapons primarily aimed at breaking through any future U.S. missile defenses . With the two services already looking into what it might take to get a single plane that meets their various needs, we could easily start seeing proposals from Boeing or other manufacturers sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 4, 2019",Iran Claims It Turned a Sidewinder Into a “New” Anti-Tank Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , or IRGC, has unveiled what it says is a “new” combination anti-tank and short-range surface-to-air missile. From the available images and video, it appears the weapon is actually just a modified AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile, which could be an indicator of local ingenuity, a lack of readily available alternatives, or a little of both. IRGC Commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari and IRGC Ground Force Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour got a look at the missile, along with other new military developments, at a ceremony on Feb. 28, 2018. The weapon is somewhat confusing called the “Azarakhsh” – a Farsi word that variously translates to lightning, thunder, and thunderbolt – which is also the name the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company gave to a locally produced modification to or derivative of the Northrop F-5E Tiger II jet combat aircraft. The IRGC says it will arm helicopters and ground-based launchers with the weapon, but did not offer any additional information. It’s not clear how much of the Azarakhsh is new and how much the IRGC may have taken from older AIM-9 missiles, either directly or in basic design. Though the missile on display had a new, bare metal front end, which typically houses the seeker and warhead, the control fins appeared to be identical to those on the AIM-9J, N, and P models. The rest of the weapon looks entirely the same as a standard Sidewinder. The IRGC claims the Azarakhsh missile weighs about 155 pounds, is approximately 122 inches long, has a top speed of 1,230 miles per hour, and a range of just greater than 6 miles. If those figures are accurate, this would make it lighter, but longer than the AIM-9J, N, or P models, as well slower and with a shorter range than those air-to-air weapons . https://youtube.com/watch?v=a7iIk3jep4E The IRGC said the missile had a “thermographic” guidance method, which could mean an infrared homing system similar to the original Sidewinder or a seeker more akin to weapons such as the AGM-65 Maverick missile, whereby the operator can see through the camera in the weapon’s nose to find and lock on to the target. Either way, the seeker does appear to be different from the one on the original missile, which would make sense since those systems would be nearly 40 years old at the very youngest and could easily be unsupportable if they’re still functional at all. Depending on the exact sensitivity of the system, it could have some capability to engage relatively low- or slow-flying aircraft, such as helicopters or small drones, and vehicles that give off a suitable heat signature. The IRGC did not claim the missile had any additional features to defeat defensive systems, such as decoy flares or directional infrared countermeasures , that could make it more capable in an anti-aircraft role. The Iranian news reports did not give any information about the Azarakhsh’s warhead, but it’s difficult to develop a system that is equally effective against both armored and aerial targets. It is possible that the weapon has a dual purpose configuration that includes a shaped charge to defeat armor with a surrounding layer that breaks apart into deadly shrapnel in order to damage less well protected targets, but this would still be most useful in an air-to-ground role. But adapting the AIM-9 to these roles could still offer a cost-effective means of adding some sort of additional anti-armor and air defense capabilities to IRGC helicopters and ground units. According to data the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has collected , Iran purchased or otherwise received nearly 2,000 AIM-9J and P models from the United States between 1971 and 1979. An F-4C Phantom of the Hawaii Air National Guard with two AIM-9P Sidewinders on its wing, showing the missile’s distinctive forward fin shape., US National Archives In 1979, a revolt unseated the regime of U.S. ally Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and revolutionaries took dozens of American hostage , prompting the United States to sever ties with the country. It’s not clear how many of those missiles Iran may have already expended, either during the course of the Iran-Iraq War between 1980 and 1988 or in training exercises before, during, or after that conflict. Using the Sidewinder as the basis for Azarakhsh makes a certain amount of sense, though. The Sidewinder has long presented a platform that could be adapted to more roles than just air-to-air combat. In the 1960s, the U.S. Navy explored turning the missiles into air-to-ground weapons, resulting in the AGM-87A Focus . Then, in the 1980s, the service modified a number of AIM-9C semi-active radar-homing variants into AIM-122A Sidearm anti-radiation missiles to destroy enemy radars on the ground. The U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps also adopted another variant, the MIM-72 , as a short-range surface-to-air missile. Those two services employed the weapons on towed and tracked launchers. A US Army Chaparral tracked short-range air defense system with four MIM-72 missiles., US Army With regards to the air-launched Sidearms, the U.S. Marine Corps AH-1 Super Cobra helicopters became the primary launch platforms, which may have in part informed the Iranian decision to modify their own AIM-9s. Iran still operates a number of AH-1J International Cobras that the country acquired during the reign of the Shah. It has since upgraded these attack helicopters and refers to them as the Panha 2091 or Toufan . It’s not clear how much a weapon like Azarakhsh might expand the capabilities of those helicopters, though. They can already carry an Iranian copy of the American TOW wire-guided anti-tank missile , which is, somewhat confusingly, called Toophan . The Misagh-2 , a short-range infrared anti-aircraft missile that Iran may have derived in part from the Chinese QW-1 Vanguard man-portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile, is reportedly another armament option. It might, however, offer an important added capability for other helicopter types, including the Mi-17, for which Iran has more limited guided weapon options. A US Marine Corps Super Cobra carries a Sidearm during a test in 1981., USN Iran does not appear to necessarily be wanting in ground-based short-range air defense systems, either, though the American MIM-72 may have again provided some inspiration for turning old Sidewinders into short-range surface-to-air missiles. In addition to having a number of older types still in limited service, the country has already produced copies of the Chinese HQ-7 radio command guided missile system and has purchased a more limited number of more modern Russian Tor surface-to-air and Pantsir-S1 combination surface-to-air and gun systems. But for Iran, which remains subject to significant international sanctions and continues to have limited options when it comes to purchasing more advanced weapons abroad, it might be worth the effort to be able to squeeze any additional capability out of a stockpile of aging missiles, especially ones that are becoming steadily less useful in their original role. Older models of Sidewinders would also be a relatively easy design to reverse engineer and being producing domestically. An Iranian Toufan attack helicopter, a updated version of the AH-1J International Cobra, which may carry the Azarakhsh missile in the future., Atarod2003 via Wikimedia It wouldn’t be the first time Iran has looked to repurpose older American made designs into new roles or reverse engineer them for local production. During the Iran-Iraq War, the Iranians turned both RIM-66 Standard and MIM-23 HAWK missiles surface-to-air missiles into air-to-air weapons. More recently, the country has also built ground-launched derivatives of the RIM-66, called the Sayyad-2 . In addition, given recent economic turmoil in the country, which contributed to an unprecedented outpouring popular discontent with the ruling regime around the beginning of 2018, Azarakhsh might also offer a much more cost effective option compared to buying or otherwise building all new anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. It might also offer a system that the country can more readily put into serial production. The Iranian Sayyad-2, a ground-launched derivative of the US-made RIM-66 Standard naval surface-to-air missile., Iran MoD It’s also entirely possible that the IRGC ceremony was simply a show for propaganda purposes. Iran routinely puts weapons on display that it boasts are both all-new and entirely a product of domestic research and development, which are instead obvious copies of foreign weapons . These displays are meant to communicate that Iran continues to advance its military capabilities in spite of sanctions and threats from opponents, such as the United States and Israel. Observers often note that many of the more “high-tech” weapons the country presents to the public are clearly of dubious capability , if it appears that they work at all . That being said, Iran has proven it has a defense industrial base that can produce at least dated but workable weapon systems. Though it does not appear to have any of the advanced features of its American predecessor, the Iranians did build a flyable drone based on the shape of the RQ-170 Sentinel stealthy unmanned aircraft and send it into Israeli territory from a base in Syria, touching off a brief skirmish in which Syrian air defenders managed to shoot down an Israeli Air Force F-16I multi-role fighter jet. It remains to be seen whether the Azarakhsh turns out to be anything other than a prop, but as the United States has already shown itself, the Sidewinder can definitely serve as a good starting point for new missiles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",U.S. Has Been Secretly Watching Russia’s Nuclear-Powered Cruise Missiles Crash and Burn,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following Russian claims that it is developing a new nuclear-powered cruise missile , there are reports that the U.S. government has been actively spying on this work and that some or all of the test flights have failed. This, in turn, raises questions about the safety and viability of such a weapon, as well as why American officials would keep this knowledge a secret. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin publicly announced the as yet unnamed missile in an annual speech on March 1, 2018. The Kremlin says it successfully tested one of the weapons near the end of 2017 and released video footage claiming to show the launch and it in flight. So far, Russian authorities have not released any other significant details about the weapon’s configuration or capabilities, though Putin implied that the final design would be broadly similar in size and shape to the existing, conventionally-powered Kh-101 cruise missile . At the most basic conceptual level, the weapon could conceivably reach supersonic speeds, fly at very low altitudes, and have effectively unlimited range thanks to its nuclear powerplant, allowing it to hit targets anywhere in the world with little warning and dodge anti-missile defenses . But shortly after Putin’s address, CNN, in a story citing an anonymous U.S. government official, cast doubt on the possibility that this weapon was anywhere near operational . That individual added that the “United States had observed a small number of Russian tests of its nuclear-powered cruise missile and seen them all crash.” Fox News said its own sources indicated the same thing, that the weapon was in the research and development phase and that at least one had crashed during testing in the arctic. The suggestion the U.S. government has been aware of this development program for any period of time, but kept that information secret, is notable in of itself. American officials have often shared knowledge publicly , even if only in broad terms , about other similar Russian advanced weapon projects , especially to make the case for increased spending on ways to directly or indirectly counter those weapons . In a routine press conference on March 1, 2018 , top Pentagon spokesperson Dana White declined to comment on the record about whether or not any of the weapon systems Putin announced were operational. She did, however, insist that none of them were new. “These – these weapons that – that are discussed have been in development a very long time,” she said. “Our [new] Nuclear Posture Review takes all of this into account.” President Donald Trump’s Administration’s new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which it officially released in February 2018, mentions Russia’s hypersonic boost glide vehicle development, as well as its nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed unmanned undersea vehicle project, commonly known as Kanyon or Status-6 . There is no discussion of a nuclear-powered cruise missile. The Pentagon included this chart in the public version of the new Nuclear Posture Review, which it released in February 2018. It does not mention a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile program., DOD An unclassified report on worldwide cruise and ballistic missile programs that the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center released in June 2017 makes no mention of a nuclear-powered cruise missile either. It does discuss Russia’s work on a hypersonic boost glide vehicle. It’s even more curious that the United States would have chosen to stay silent if it was aware of failed flight tests involving the prototype missiles. They would, by definition, have to carry a nuclear reactor, and any accidents could pose health and environmental risks, not just for Russian civilians, but potentially for residents in other nearby countries, as well. Given heightened tensions between the two countries over a wide array of different issues , including compliance with strategic arms control agreements , one has to imagine that this would have given the U.S. government an excellent opportunity to further criticize the Kremlin’s general attitude toward its own people and its neighbors. And the U.S. government is well aware of the potential hazards of nuclear-powered engine designs, having experimented with these systems extensively in the 1960s. The U.S. Air Force had even explored the possibility of developing a Supersonic Low Altitude Missile (SLAM) with a nuclear-powered ramjet that sounds very similar in basic concept to the weapon the Russians say they are now developing. https://youtube.com/watch?v=w_SCuPId8KA The United States subsequently concluded that while the engines technically worked, they simply did not offer a practical means of powering a ground- or air-launched weapon and could have provoked an arms race with the Russians. To make the reactors small, light, and cheap enough to ride inside a notional expendable missile, the prototype reactors lacked protective shielding and emanated dangerous levels of radiation. The proposed weapon, which never progressed to the prototype stage, would still have been 13 feet high at its tallest point and 52 feet long, nearly as high as and longer than an F-16 Viper fighter jet . In flight, the engine would have left a trail of radioactive byproducts in its wake, potentially contaminating any area it flew over, enemy-controlled or not. The scientists and engineers behind the project suggested that this could have been a terrifying added feature rather than a flaw. To be fair, reactor technology has significantly improved since the SLAM project ended in 1964. On top of that, Russia has invested significant manpower and resources into development of smaller nuclear power sources to help support expanding civil and military activities near and above the Arctic Circle , though there are significant concerns about whether these systems are reliable and safe. But it doesn’t change the fact that a nuclear-powered cruise missile will be carrying some amount of radioactive material and that the Russians almost certainly do not expect it to survive the trip, even when it works properly. It’s worth noting that what the U.S. government has recorded as “crashes” may be flight tests the Russians have deemed successful. Russia would have to test the weapons repeatedly in order to prove the design is reliable, especially as testing matures and the prototypes’ flight envelopes expand. One of the prototype nuclear ramjets that United States tested in the 1960s., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory And if Russia has completed any test of a functional prototype system, albeit without a live nuclear warhead, this means it has almost certainly deliberately smashed a live nuclear reactor into the ground or the sea at high speed. The very idea of doing this, even for tests purposes, helps explain why the United States never actually flew a prototype aircraft or missile using nuclear propulsion. As such, Russian flight tests of the weapon, successful or not, might offer one explanation about reported spikes in the amount of radioactive iodine-131 in the atmosphere appearing to originate from Russia’s northwestern Kola Peninsula on the Barents Sea in February 2017. This isotope is among the dozens of radionuclides that the Department of Energy recorded as being a byproduct from nuclear engine tests at the Nevada Test Site between 1959 and 1969. Around the time of this reported radiation release in Europe, the U.S. Air Force deployed one of its limited number of WC-135W Constant Phoenix aircraft to the region . These aircraft carry specialized equipment collect air samples in order to detect signs of possible nuclear activity. On Feb. 20, 2017, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors compliance with the 1996 treaty of the same name, subsequently issued a statement saying that it had not detected any elevated levels of iodine-131 “in the past several months.” “If a nuclear test were to take place that releases I-131 it would also be expected to release many other radioactive isotopes.” One of the US Air Force’s WC-135W Constant Phoenix aircraft., USAF One would also expect a nuclear ramjet to produce a wider array of nuclear byproducts, but it might do so at levels far too small for sensors set up to look for nuclear explosions to detect. According to the Department of Energy, the experimental Tory IIC nuclear ramjet released less than 1,000 Curies of radiation during a five-minute test in 1964. If that rate had remained constant, even if that engine had run for 24 hours straight, it would have produced less than one percent of the the typical radioactivity associated with the detonation of a one kiloton nuclear weapon. The Air Force also subsequently denied that WC-135 mission had anything to do with any increase in iodine-131 in the atmosphere and said that it had scheduled the deployment well before those reports emerged. “We just need to make sure that we’re getting the background and knowing what’s happening around the world and what changes are happening in the atmosphere,” U.S. Air Force’s Colonel Jonathan VanNoord, Director of Operations for the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), told Stars and Stripes in March 2017. Still, AFTAC is a particularly secretive organization that officially exists primarily to monitor whether countries that have ratified the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty are abiding by the terms of that agreement . It also helps gather intelligence about other nuclear tests and also helps gather information after atomic accidents . And since it already appears that the U.S. government’s knowledge of the nuclear-powered cruise missile program is itself classified, there would be no way VanNoord could have admitted his crews were hunting for signs of the weapon. In September and October 2017, there were reports of increased levels of radioactive ruthenium-106, also tracing back to Russia. This isotope is now among those the Department of Energy linked to its own nuclear engine work, but those tests did produce ruthenium-103 and -105. Experts suggested this incident could have been a leak from the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing facility. A map that French nuclear safety institute IRSN released in November 2017 showing a spike in the levels of ruthenium-106, with the darker spots indicating a greater increase compared to normal levels. Russia is shaded in dark gray., IRSN With all this in mind, it remains unclear why the U.S. government has held back in exposing this project, but they may have been waiting for a more opportune moment. Unlike other systems , its not as clear cut whether the nuclear-powered cruise missile violates existing U.S.-Russia arms control agreements, such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF . That agreement bans Russia and the United States from building production land-based cruise missiles that have ranges between 310 and 3,100 miles. Its not obvious how the treaty would necessarily apply to a missile with unlimited range. At the same time, the INF does not explicitly prohibit research and development of land-based cruise missiles that would otherwise violate its terms, a loophole the United States itself has announced its intention to exploit . The U.S. government could be trying to gather enough data to more conclusively demonstrate that the Kremlin released dangerous amounts of radiation with these experiments, too. Russia may not have actually test flown the prototype missile with a nuclear reactor on board, using a surrogate conventional engine arrangement instead, though this is unlikely. This would be the only reasonable way for the Russians to launch the weapon without any possibility of releasing of radioactive material, but it would also largely defeat the purpose of such tests. But now that the existence of the program is out in the open, we may soon see more Russian boasts about its capability and American criticisms regarding its safety. Programming note: Our analysis of the air-launched hypersonic missile revealed by Putin during his speech is up and can be found here . It turns out that the mysterious weapon is far more familiar than most probably think. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air-Launched Hypersonic Missiles"
Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 19, 2018",Russia Admits Su-57s Were In Syria But Claims They Left After Just Two Days,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a week of silence from the Kremlin, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has officially confirmed the country did send two Su-57 stealth fighters to its Khmeimim Air Base in Syria’s western Latakia governorate. But based on his statements, the deployment was even more unusual than we had previously understood, reportedly lasting just two days. Shoigu shared details about the apparently brief mission with reporters on March 1, 2018 following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual state-of-the-nation address, which included major announcements about the country’s strategic deterrent capabilities. Russia’s top defense official said only two of the stealth jets had gone to Syria, denying reports that there might have been up to four in the country, and that they completed a number of evaluations, including an unspecified “combat trial.” “I can say that the trials were success and the planes returned home a week ago,” Shoigu said. “There were two planes escorted by flying laboratories and test beds monitoring the parameters of weapons work.” It’s not clear what test and evaluation aircraft he might have been referring to in this case. Video of the Su-57s arriving Khmeimim first appeared on social media on Feb. 21, 2018. Subsequently reports said that an A-50U Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft, as well as four Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jets and four Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft had also arrived at the same time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dan8gd2XS9Q We don’t know if Shoigu’s comments about a “combat trial” meant the Su-57s were engaged in any actual operations in Syria against militants fighting the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. There are less than a dozen pre-production examples of the stealth jets, also known as T-50s, and we don’t know how functional the mission systems might be from aircraft to aircraft. It’s pretty hard to imagine how it would be worthwhile to deploy a pair of largely experimental jets to Syria just for them to stay for 48 hours. The claim that the Russians could have accomplished any meaningful trials in such a short period time, especially combat related ones, are dubious at best. The deployment, which The War Zone has been following very closely, was never announced. Initial word of it came via video popping up on social media of the fighters arriving, with satellite imagery emerging shortly after confirming the deployment. Only one video has appeared supposedly showing an Su-57s operating from the base, but beyond that the Su-57s operations in and around Syria remain a mystery. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iSQBDMbbfos The Russian Defense Minister seemed to deny satellite images of the two aircraft, including one of them parked side by side at Khmeimim along with other aircraft, were even legitimate. “As for the photos which were published, I don’t know where they came from… The planes were inside hangars all the time [when parked]… I can state that now is not the year of 1995 and such planes are never located side by side.” The tight confines of Russia’s tactical fighter apron at its Syrian base is well documented and has even been cause for concern as an indirect attack could potentially light off a chain reaction. Munitions are also often stored nearby in the open. Around the beginning of 2018, rebels began launching mass drone attacks on the base, as well as Russia’s naval base in Syria’s coastal city of Tartus, and reportedly caused significant damage , possibly in part due to the tightly packed parking situation. Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu., Grigory Sysoev/Sputnik  via AP In February 2018, the Russians began erecting some revetments around individual jets, which would help prevent damage to one aircraft from setting off secondary explosions. Another  satellite image of one of the Su-57s at Khmeimim appeared to show a full set of barriers surrounding the jet on all sides. Even more curious, the first imagery that appeared online was dated Feb. 23, 2018, which would have been two days after the aircraft arrived in Syria. Additional video reportedly of the jets flying in Syria also emerged on the web on Feb. 26, 2018, though its not clear when it when it was taken. Shoigu may not have counted the day they arrived, but this detail plus the subsequent footage call into question just how long the aircraft were actually in the country. All told, much about the reasoning behind the deployment remains unclear. It initially looked like the Russians had intended to showcase the Su-57’s actual capabilities, to partners and potential opponents alike, after years of setbacks and shrinking purchase orders . “We are buying Su-57 jets for test combat use. First stage state trials are over,” Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov had proudly declared on Feb. 8, 2018. “This year, we will sign a contract for the first batch of 12 Su-57 fighter jets for the Armed Forces.” There was also talk about a potential interaction between the jets and U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, which would have been a historic aerial meetup. U.S. government and other foreign officials suggested the presence of the Russian jets was a worrisome development. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor refuels somewhere over the Middle East in November 2017., USAF “It’s one thing to do the counter-air mission with a long lookout in front of you, it’s different to do when everyone’s tightly packed in there,” U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command had told reporters at the Air Force Association’s Air Warfare Symposium, on Feb. 23, 2018, though he admitted he hadn’t seen the reports about the Su-57s. “Certainly, the higher the complexity and the higher the technology … it raises the level of complexity for the crews to deal with.” But, we are being led to believe that the deployment ended almost as quickly as it began, which seems difficult to comperehend. Of course, as we have seen many times in the past , just because the Russians withdraw personnel or equipment from Syria doesn’t mean it won’t be headed back to the country soon. Judging by the peculiar statements made by Defense Minister Shoigu, the dearth of official statements otherwise, and the validity of such a truncated stop in war zone, or lack thereof, it’s very possible, if not somewhat probably, that the aircraft actually have yet to return to Russia at all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",Laser McLazerface? Kremlin Crowdsourcing Names For Putin’s New Super Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin says the country is well on its way to building an “invincible” arsenal of nuclear and other advanced weaponry, but there is at least one problem the Kremlin still needs to fix. The country’s future nuclear-powered cruise missile, nuclear-armed undersea drone, and point-defense laser don’t have catchy names yet. But now you can go online and offer your own suggestions! Hours after Putin’s annual state-of-the-nation address in Moscow on March 1, 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defense switched on a web portal where you can submit suggested monikers for any of the three new weapon systems. At the time of writing, the site only asks for an Email address as means of identification, but not knowing who might be collecting that information on the other end, we’re a bit loathe to try it out ourselves. It’s not clear if there is an existing convention for the names Russians have given to the strategic weapons. The RT-2 and RS-12 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and many of their derivatives, bear the name “Topol,” or poplar tree , which is possibly a visual reference. The still-in-development RS-26 is called the “Rubezh,” meaning limit or boundary. The Russians dubbed the larger RS-28 , which will enter service around 2021, the “Sarmat,” after the ancient Sarmatians. Some of the country’s smaller conventional systems do have more uniform naming schemes, such as anti-ship missiles, which have all received stone names in the past, such as Granite , Onyx , and Basalt . A Russian road-mobile RT-2PM2 “Topol-M” ICBM, the name of which translates to “poplar tree.”, Vitaly Kuzmin But without any other apparent means of filtering submissions, though, the Russians might end up with more than they bargained for.  Certain groupings on the internet have repeatedly found ways to manipulate these sorts of contests. Famously – or infamously, depending on how you might look at it – in 2009, late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert asked his audience to vote for “Colbert” in an online contest to choose the name for NASA’s Node 3 module for the International Space Station (ISS). Colbert surged to the top and other groups followed suit to try and get NASA to pick their own joke names. The space shuttle Endeavor maneuvers Tranquility into position for astronauts to attach it to the International Space Station in 2010., NASA NASA eventually rejected the submission, naming the module Tranquility. The U.S. space agency still honored the comedian by crafting a clever name for a treadmill astronauts would use on the ISS to exercise, calling it the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or COLBERT . A similar situation occurred again in 2016, when the United Kingdom’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) announced it too would hold an open online poll to name a new research vessel. In that instance, Boaty McBoatface became the favorite, prompting a scandal that involved the country’s government. NERC eventually named the ship after famed naturalist and television personality Sir David Attenborough, but still gave the joke name to an unmanned underwater research vehicle . An artist’s conception of the future RRS Sir David Attenborough ., Rolls-Royce Despite the obvious lessons, these public polls keep happening, with predictable results. In January 2018, a new controversy erupted in Australia after authorities in New South Wales announced one of six new ferries would actually get the name Ferry McFerryface . Reports later suggested that they had deliberately chosen the name as a joke at the expense of more serious monikers. But Putin was probably thinking about the U.S. Air Force’s contest to name the B-21 stealth bomber when he first suggested there could be a popular contest to name the weapon systems during his speech. In September 2016, the service announced it would call the B-21 the Raider, in honor of the Doolittle Raiders who bombed Japan early in World War II to avenge the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. That contest was only open to members of the Air Force and it still could not escape joke submissions. Using the Freedom of Information Act, I, along with others, secured the full list of rejected names shortly after the official announcement. The list included a number of variations on the Boaty McBoatface theme, including Bomber McBombface. There were dozens of others, including Baconator , Badasswhoopass, Zoomfist, Chuck Norris , and Rainbow Dash . Just some of the names members of the Air Force suggested for the B-21., USAF via FOIA Some individuals used the form to express their discontent with Air Force’s priorities, writing in suggestions such as “YouThinkWeWastedMoneyOnTheF35,hahahahahaha!!!” and “Do We Really Have The Funding For This.” Particularly poignant was “THIS is why we can’t have nice stuff at the Deid,” a reference to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which at the time had notoriously poor living conditions . It’s seems unlikely that the Russia will ever release the names it rejects, especially if anyone dares to use them to make jokes at the government or Putin’s expense. But it’s hard to believe someone hasn’t already proffered up “Missile McMissileface,” “Droney McDroneface,” and “Laser McLaserface,” as suggestions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 19, 2018",Here’s The Six Super Weapons Putin Unveiled During Fiery Address,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In an impassioned state-of-nation address before Russian lawmakers and other senior government officials, accompanied by video footage and computer generated graphics, Russia’s President Vladimir has claimed his country is working on a host of new nuclear and other advanced weapons , including a nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile with effectively unlimited range. These developments are ostensibly in response to American missile defense programs and can only further inflame already heightened tensions between the Kremlin and the U.S. government over various arms control agreements . Putin made his remarks at the Manezh Central Exhibition Hall near the Kremlin on March 1, 2018. Some lawmakers smiled and cheered as he detailed the various weapon development programs. These included the cruise missile with a nuclear engine, as well as the publicly known RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the previously unacknowledged nuclear-tipped Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle and Kanyon or Status-6 nuclear-armed unmanned undersea vehicle, a possibly dual-purpose nuclear and conventional air-launched hypersonic cruise missile called Kinzhal, and a short-range directed-energy system visually similar to the U.S. Navy’s own AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System . “No one has listened to us,” Putin declared. “You listen to us now.” A nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range The most eye-catching of the announcements is clearly the as yet unnamed nuclear-powered cruise missile. The basic concept is hardly new, but depending on how functional and reliable the final design might be, it could be a potentially game-changing development. Though we  don’t know how the Russians plan to configure this missile, in the 1960s, the U.S. Air Force explored a similar idea with the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile , or SLAM. This weapon employed a nuclear-powered ramjet along with conventional rocket boosters to kickstart the system. Once at the appropriate speed, the engine would blow air over the reactor, which could have enough fuel to operate for weeks or months on end, and then force it out of an exhaust nozzle to produce thrust. In theory, this system allows for almost unlimited range. A computer generated graphic accompanying Putin’s announcement showed the missile plotting a course from Russia into the Atlantic, flying around South America’s Cape Horn, and then continuing on to strike what appeared to be a target in Hawaii. Cruising at high speed on a circuitous route at extremely low altitude, the missile could potentially avoid surface- and space-based early warning systems and missile defense interceptors . With a two-way data link, operators could potentially modify its course in flight to further confuse an opponent or actively counter any attempts to shoot the weapon down. The American SLAM concept also involved a design carrying multiple nuclear warheads that it could drop on different targets along the way, but it is not clear whether the Russian system includes any features that allow it to strike at more than one location. A grainy screen grab that may show the nuclear-powered cruise missile in flight., via Channel One Russia “No one in the world has anything like that,” Putin said. “It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.” The main problem with nuclear propulsion systems is safety and environmental hazards. To be small enough to reasonably fit inside a missile, the nuclear ramjet the United States developed for SLAM and other projects had no shielding to contain dangerous radiation. The exhaust plume also contained unspent fissile material that would have contaminated any area, enemy controlled or not, that it passed over on its way to the target. Putin suggested tests of the propulsion system had occurred in 2017, but there was no indication of whether this had been in flight or on the ground and under what conditions. An actual, but grainy video accompanied this portion of his announcement, but it was unclear whether or not this was actually a prototype of the cruise missile. Nuclear-armed Hypersonic boost glide vehicles In addition, the Russian president publicly unveiled a nuclear hypersonic boost glide vehicle called Avangard, which he said would go on the future RS-26 Rubezh ICBM. Weapons of this type follow a very different flight trajectory within the atmosphere, can make rapid course changes, and have different signatures compared to traditional ICBMs, which could make them harder for sensors and defense systems to spot and engage . Their speed, faster than Mach 6, means an enemy has dramatically less time to react than with conventional inter-atmospheric craft, that is even if they do detect the incoming weapon at all. Putin said Avangard can reach speeds up to 20 times the speed of sound, hitting its targets “like a meteorite, like a fireball.” A graphic that accompanied Putin’s speech showing how a hypersonic boost glide vehicle could dodge surface- and space-based sensors and missile interceptors to reach its target unscathed., via Channel One Russia This makes these systems ideal for no- or short-notice strikes against critical items, such as enemy strategic capabilities, air and missile defenses, and command and control facilities, as well as potentially fleeting targets, including military or civilian leadership. In September 2017, the Russians said they had tested an RS-12M Topol missile with an “ advanced combat payload ,” which could have been an Avangard prototype, and you can read more broadly about the potential capabilities of such a weapon here . A more capable heavy ICBM This hypersonic boost vehicle has also long been among the many rumored capabilities of the up-coming RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, which has been publicly in development since 2014 and the Russians expect it to enter service by 2021. This system, which NATO also calls the SS-X-30 Satan 2, will replace the older R-36M or SS-18 Satan as Russia’s primary silo-based ICBM. The RS-28 is reportedly significant faster than the older R-36M and will carry multiple warheads of some form, each capable of independent movement. Beyond the possible use of hypersonic boost glide vehicle warheads, other reports have suggested it might have a fractional orbital bombardment capability, in which the re-entry vehicles enter low earth orbit briefly and “go cold,” making it hard to track their onward progress before they come hurtling down on a target. Another possibility is an independent post-boost vehicle (IPBV) arrangement, which Russia may have tested in October 2017 on an existing RS-24 Yars ICBM and which you can read about more in detail here . Whatever the case, the computer generated depiction of Sarmat menacingly showed a number of independent warheads falling onto Florida. Warheads from an SS-28 fall onto Florida in a computer generated presentation accompanying Putin’s speech., via Channel One Russia A nuclear-armed underwater drone In addition, Putin publicly announced Russia has been working on a nuclear-armed unmanned undersea vehicle . There have been a number of reports of both of these weapons being in development for years, but without any clear official confirmation. The craft, which Putin says has no official name as yet, but which observers have referred to as Kanyon and Status-6 since information about the system first leaked out in 2015 , is a completely different approach to avoiding missile defenses. Launched from a submarine well off shore, the underwater drone then makes it ways to the target area, avoiding any sensor networks or other defenses, before detonating its reportedly dirty warhead, causing significant immediate damage and lasting contamination. A computer generated presentation about the vehicle shows a modified Oscar II class submarine carrying a pair of the unmanned submarines in a special forward compartment. Putin suggest the drone would be “100 times smaller” than traditional submarines and therefore be especially difficult to detect. It would also be able to travel at “extreme depths” and at speeds that “greatly exceeds the speed of all submarines, up-to-date torpedoes and all types of high-speed surface ships,” making it even harder for an opponent to spot and intercept it before it reached the target area. A computer-generated depiction of the nuclear-armed unmanned undersea vehicle emerging from its hangar on a modified Oscar II class submarine., via Channel One Russia Previous reports, as well as accompanying video, suggest the weapons are large, though, which might necessitate a new, specialized mothership . The same video presentation paired with Putin’s discussion of this system appeared to show a more conventional torpedo, but its not clear if this is supposed to be stand-in for the nuclear-armed drone or if that craft might launch those weapons itself once it gets closer to the target. There is the suggestion that this unmanned undersea vehicle may have a nuclear powerplant, as well, which could conceivably allow submarine carrying it to launch it from almost anywhere in the world. The Russians appear to envision the system as a means of targeting task forces of surface warships – all of the computer-generated examples were clearly based on American designs – including aircraft carrier strike groups, as well as naval bases and ports.

It is not clear whether or not that jet is the primary launch platform or if this system is nuclear capable. It reportedly has a range of approximately 1,250 miles and a top speed of more than 10 times the speed of sound. According to the Russian president, units in the country’s Southern Military District , which borders Ukraine and the Black Sea , have deployed the missiles operationally. Russia had previously claimed it was working on a hypersonic anti-ship missile called Zircon and computer generated graphics during Putin’s speech showed Kinzhal attacking surface warships, though it also reportedly has a land-attack capability. It’s unclear how the two weapons might be related, if at all, but Kinzhal could simply be an air-launched derivative of the sea-launched Zircon. A screen capture of the video showing a MiG-31 Foxhound carrying the Kinzhal hypersonic cruise missile., via Channel One Russia In general, these types of weapons typically use a rocket motor to kickstart an air-breathing engine of some kind to push them to at least Mach 6, making them harder for existing land- and space-based sensors to spot. Already capable of potentially making rapid course corrections and otherwise flying erratically, the weapon’s speed could make it very difficult for most existing surface- and airborne radars to track in order to cue an interceptor or other close-in defense system. As with the hypersonic boost glide vehicles, this means these missiles could be a game-changing capability, giving Russian jets the ability to launch no- or short-notice strikes at long distance against enemy ships or land-based targets. In what appears to be its primary role, it would be a major threat to American aircraft carriers or other warships, which do not have any defenses against such a weapon at present. And again, this capability would be perfect for hitting time-sensitive targets, letting the Kremlin shrinking the time it takes to turn actionable intelligence into an actual response and strike its opponents before they can move to another, possibly less vulnerable location. Coming after all of these systems, the truck-mounted laser cannon looks far less impressive, but its still an important development. As a point defense system, this directed energy weapon could be helpful for defeating various existing and emerging threats, particularly small drones . Earlier in the year, Russian bases in Syria found themselves on the receiving end of mass drone attacks , which is exactly the kind of scenario in which a mobile laser might be an valuable addition to other air defense and electronic warfare systems. It’s an indication that Russia is actually investing its limited resources in advancing its capability in this area, as well, even if recent reports of a work on a new anti-satellite laser system fitted on a still notional high-altitude aircraft sound particularly fanciful. A screen capture showing the short-range laser defense system Putin also talked about during his speech., via Channel One Russia A display of Russian strength “I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,” Putin said in his March 2018 speech. “You have failed to contain Russia.” The “unilateral advantages” Putin was referring to are almost certainly the U.S. military’s missile defense programs , which include basing Aegis Ashore ground-launched ballistic missile interceptor sites in Europe. The United States has repeatedly denied that any part of its ballistic missile defense shield presents a challenge to the deterrent capabilities of large nuclear powers, such as Russia or China, and that they are instead focused on defending against smaller actors, such as North Korea and Iran. Whatever the intent, American ballistic missile defense shield is simply not capable of negating Russia’s nuclear deterrent. The “unlawful sanctions” in question are the economic restrictions the United States and other countries, especially in Western Europe, imposed on Russia in the wake of its unilateral and illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . The U.S. government in particular has expanded those measures in response to Russian involvement in the simmering conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region , its support for Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad , and its interference in the 2016 American presidential election . The United States and Russia have increasingly sparred over these issues, which has had a cascading impact on various arms control agreements, which we at The War Zone have examined in depth on multiple occasions . The two countries have been locked particularly tense rhetoric over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , which limits the kind of land-based missiles, nuclear or otherwise, that both sides can develop and put into service. Russian President Vladimir Putin stands in front of a huge Russian flag emblazoned with the country’s crest ahead of his speech on March 1, 2018., Michael Klimentyev / Sputnik  via AP You can watch a full video of Putin’s speech, in Russian, but which also shows the various accompanying media, below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2NW_mfBPUyM Tensions with the United States It is well understood that Russia is in violation of the INF, while the Kremlin says the U.S. military has been working toward the same end with its land-based missile launchers in Poland and Romania . Putin notably did not mention the SSC-8 ground-launched nuclear cruise missile, which the United States says violates the terms of the INF, but which the Kremlin has never publicly acknowledged as existing at all. Now the United States has publicly threatened its own treaty-breaking missile development in response and included plans for a new sea-launched nuclear cruise missile with a low-yield nuclear warhead in its latest Nuclear Posture Review (NRP). Senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense James Mattis, have suggested an offer to abandon this development program might be a useful bargaining chip in future arms control negotiations. “We will interpret any use of nuclear weapons against Russia and its allies no matter how powerful they are, of low, medium or any other yield, as a nuclear attack,” Putin said, directly responding to the NPR’s proposed development of more “flexible” low-yield nuclear weapons . “It will trigger an immediate answer with all the consequences stemming from it. No one should have any doubts about it.” This flurry of new missile developments could easily change the calculus again. There are already reports that a forthcoming U.S. military review of its missile defense posture might make it official policy that those systems are, in fact, targeted, at least in part, at Russia and China . Speaking after the event, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu implied that American allies, both in Europe and Asia , and possibly elsewhere , should be reconsidering whether they want to invest in American-made missile defenses. “I don’t know why they would now buy such an ‘umbrella’ [that is full of holes],” Shoigu said, specifically in reference to South Korean and Japanese missile defense plans . Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, right, and President Putin at an event in December 2017 to honor Russian military personnel who took part in the fighting in Syria., Grigory Sysoev/Sputnik  via AP There is, as always , an important question about whether or not Russia and its fluctuating economy can sustain the development of these various advanced weapon systems. Sanctions and a continued slump in the global price of oil already forced the country to make significant cuts to defense spending in 2017, including cancelling plans to reboot its train-mounted IBCM program . It’s also not clear how much of Putin’s charged rhetoric is driven by the fact that he is running for re-election as Russia’s president. Though experts and observers widely believe he will easily win in a less than free and fair election in later in March 2018, opposition politicians and political groups have launched significant protests and continue to challenge and criticize his leadership. “You will have to assess that new reality and become convinced that what I was said today isn’t a bluff,” Putin noted. “It’s not a bluff, you trust me.” It remains to be seen just how far Russia proceeds with the various projects, especially the nuclear-powered cruise missile. It’s reasonable to be skeptical that Russia has the resources to follow through with its plans, but even if only one or two of these systems come to fruition, they could be immensely destabilizing. If nothing else, the announcements are another worrying indicator Russia’s increasingly assertive foreign policy and growing tensions between the Kremlin and the U.S. government.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 2, 2019",Did Trump’s Much Touted Border Wall Prototypes Really Stop US Navy SEALs?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has secured an important legal victory regarding his signature plans for a new wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, amid reports the prototype barriers are so good that elite U.S. special operations forces could not get through or over them. However, those tests may have had a relatively limited scope and the proposed multi-billion dollar bulwarks aren’t supposed to prevent smugglers from digging tunnels, flying or otherwise launching illicit materials over the boundary, or using alternate routes to avoid them altogether. On Feb. 27, 2018, Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California – who Trump had previously declared was unfairly biased against him personally in relation to a civil case – ruled that the Trump Administration had the authority to waive environmental protections and other regulations and begin building the barriers. Trump, who has made the new wall a centerpiece of his hard line push against illegal immigration and drug smuggling, will reportedly visit a test site in San Diego, California in March 2018, to select a winning design . In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) awarded contracts, worth between $300,000 and $500,000, to five different companies for prototype wall sections between 18 and 30 feet high and made of concrete or other materials . Congress has yet to approve or allocate any actual funding for the project. “I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved,” Trump, who has repeatedly criticized legislators for not providing funding for his pet project, Tweeted out on Feb. 28, 2018. “OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!” Trump’s supporters also took the opportunity to voice continued support for the project. “The interesting part about that is that the [U.S. Army] Special Forces operatives and members of our Navy SEAL community were asked to try and breach the wall prototypes and they could not do it,” Townhall.com editor and Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich said on Feb. 28, 2018. Pavlich was referring to reports in January 2018 that unspecified U.S. special operations forces and specialized teams from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), possibly either from that agency’s Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) or Border Patrol, Search, Trauma and Rescue (BORSTAR) elements, had been unable to defeat the prototypes over the course of a three week evaluation. What she did not mention, though, was that this evaluation appears to have been extremely limited in scope and that there is no readily available information about the exact test parameters. According to The Associated Press , the personnel involved were unable to breach the barriers using jackhammers, saws, blow torches, and “other tools.” It is not clear whether or not the testers failed to reach a pre-determined threshold for how large a hole they had to create or were unable to make any reasonable opening at all. There is also no indication that the tests involved the use of caustic chemicals, explosives , mobile battering rams or reinforced vehicles , or any other more novel solutions. While human traffickers would need to be able to get a person through, their definition of what a safe opening looks like might be very different from the parameters in these structured tests. Other smugglers might only need to create a hole large enough to pass packages of drugs and other contraband to individuals on the other side, too. The video below shows a typical explosive breaching charge in action. And though the tests reportedly concluded that the highly trained military and law enforcement personnel could not scale the barriers, this appears to be based on the fact that they could not climb and descend without assistance. Individuals were able to get on top of barriers, including the ones that met the 30 foot high objective requirement, but could not get down with assistance on the other side. We don’t know whether or not this had to do in any way with established safety protocols. Again, human traffickers are not well known for their empathy toward the individuals they’re trying to sneak across the border and might have less concerns about getting them down on the other side safely. Similarly, they could employ teams on the other side to assist in getting people down, though the process might be time consuming enough to make them more vulnerable to patrolling law enforcement agents. Drug smugglers, who often face the prospect that organized crime groups might harm them or their loved ones if they fail, or end up as unwilling drug mules in the first place, might be less inclined to make the same risk assessments, as well. There’s no indication that these individuals would necessarily have to climb down at all, since they could simply drop illicit cargo on the other side. But even if it’s true that the walls present an insurmountable vertical barrier, the tests did not examine whether it would be possible to get around them by tunneling , using ultra-light aircraft , or employing a catapults , air cannon , or other means of propelling items across. Criminals have already used these methods to defeat existing walls along the U.S.-Mexico border and would likely turn to them increasingly in the face of any new barriers. Readily available small quad- and hex-copter style drones are also becoming increasingly common drug smuggling tools. A modified van with a drug-launching cannon that Mexican Federal Police seized in 2016., Policía Federal de México via AP In May 2017, the Government Accountability Office released a report assessing that the DHS could do more to address both subterranean and aerial smuggling. According to the Congressional watchdog, the various arms of DHS had uncovered nearly 70 cross-border tunnels and were aware of more than 530 “ultralight aircraft incursions,” between 2010 and 2016. “DHS has not established comprehensive standard operating procedures for addressing cross-border tunnels, and we found that relevant officials were not aware of all DHS systems or offices with tunnel information,” GAO reported. “DHS has not assessed and documented how all of the alternative ultralight aircraft technical solutions it is considering will fully address operational requirements or the costs and benefits associated with these different solutions.” CBP seized this drug-carrying paraglider ultra-light aircraft after it crossed the US-Mexico border., CBP via GAO Perhaps more importantly, the same report also noted that smugglers continued to use small boats in order to avoid the existing border security measures on land altogether. Criminals have employed a wide range of watercraft, including fishing boats and private recreational vessels, as well as relatively advanced quasi-submarine semi-submersible designs . Any existing or new walls won’t prevent smugglers from attempting to simply trying to conceal their cargoes as they move through established border checkpoints. CBP routinely released pictures of vehicles it has seized full of drugs, or even people, crammed inside the engine compartments, wheel wells, tires, or seat cushions. US Customs and Border protection released this picture of a man they found hidden inside the rear seat of a pickup truck during a search at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego, California., CBP The tests showed that the experimental walls are “doing the job that they’re supposed to do,” Townhall.com’s Pavlich said on Fox News. But, at least from what we know so far, the reality appears to be more nuanced. The barriers are definitely capable of stopping individuals from easily crossing from one side to the other and it will likely be just one part of a larger border security apparatus. It’s still not clear much how much more of a barrier they present over existing U.S. border walls and fencing, which can vary in size and scope. They seem best suited to defeating small groups of migrants looking to get into the United States illegally overland without any significant assistance. There’s less evidence to suggest they’ll present a serious impediment to drug smugglers. These criminal enterprises have already invested considerable energy in finding ways to avoid walls entirely. The Trump Administration is reportedly seeking at least $18 billion for the new border wall project. Additional and more rigorous testing would help truly determine whether or not they would offer a good return on that investment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2020",DARPA Wants to Use Fish and Other Sea Life to Track Enemy Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. military’s top research arm, is looking into whether it might be possible to exploit fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms as unwitting sensors to spot and track submarines and other underwater threats. The idea is create a low cost means of persistently monitoring naval activity beneath the waves across a wide area, but it could be hard to get the sea life to reliably perform their new jobs as discreet undersea spies. DARPA first announced this project, which it calls the Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors , or PALS, earlier in February 2018. The month before it had unveiled a broader concept for an “ Ocean of Things ,” which would also incorporate a large number of small, low cost, and environmentally friendly sensor nodes, either on the sea bed or floating up above, to monitor ship and submarine movements, as well as gather data about changing environmental conditions and other scientific information. “The U.S. Navy’s current approach to detecting and monitoring underwater vehicles is hardware-centric and resource intensive,” Lori Adornato, the PALS program manager, said in an official statement. “If we can tap into the innate sensing capabilities of living organisms that are ubiquitous in the oceans, we can extend our ability to track adversary activity and do so discreetly, on a persistent basis, and with enough precision to characterize the size and type of adversary vehicles.” At the most basic level, DARPA envisions developing a system that records marine animal activity, or the sounds they produce, and decodes that data to determine whether they’re just swimming along as normal or dodging an enemy submarine. This would not require actually implanting or otherwise “modifying” any fish or crustaceans. This is how DARPA envisions the basic concept of its “Ocean of Things.”, DARPA “Our ideal scenario for PALS is to leverage a wide range of native marine organisms, with no need to train, house, or modify them in any way, which would open up this type of sensing to many locations,” Adornato added. DARPA notes that marine animals are otherwise already equipped, thanks to millions of years of evolution, to have the “equipment” necessary to monitor their own environment. Beyond just being able to see, touch, and hear potential prey or threats, they can often detect more subtle electro-magnetic and chemical changes to their surroundings. This could all make the system more cost effective, since the U.S. military would only need to establish a network to collect the relevant information, categorize it, and transmit it onward to wherever it might need to go. DARPA’s goal is for each of those nodes to be able to monitor fish and other sea life more than 500 yards away and to be able to reliably discern between routine and abnormal movements and sounds. It’s ambitious, but PALS could offer a novel solution to the U.S. Navy’s very real problem of trying to adequately monitor the movements of potentially hostile submarines or underwater drones across broad areas, especially in the Pacific Ocean. Advanced diesel-electric subs with air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology are only becoming more common and affordable, even to smaller countries. AIP systems let conventional submarines sail more quietly and remain underwater for extended periods of time, offering capabilities closer to that of nuclear submarines, but without the costs and other factors associated with those boats. Among America’s potential near-peer opponents, China actively pursuing expanded submarine capabilities , including both nuclear and AIP-equipped submarines . At the same time, the country is looking to improve its own abilities to track American submarines in the Pacific through underwater sensor networks . A Chinese Type 091 nuclear powered submarine in 2009., Qiao Tianfu/Color China Photo/AP Russia is also slowly adding advanced diesel-electric submarines as it overhauls its existing fleet , while North Korea is steadily growing its own capabilities in this regard to potentially include designs capable of firing nuclear-armed ballistic missiles . Russia and China are also pushing their boats on the open market , and North Korea often collaborates with other potential opponents of America, all of which could put advanced designs into the hands of smaller, regional adversaries. To handle these emerging threats, the Navy is already exploring the potential of using long-endurance unmanned surface craft to scour the open ocean semi-autonomously for threats. Unfortunately, existing unmanned undersea vehicles operating with limited human interaction far from friendly forces have proven vulnerable to harassment and capture. Forward deployed ships , manned aircraft , and drones , all offer additional maritime surveillance capabilities, but require significant manpower and logistical resources , as well as often complicated basing agreements with host countries. It is possible that the Navy could look to link those more traditional assets with a working PALS system in the future in order to extend their capabilities. This in turn could help them narrow their search area or make it more difficult for a hostile submarine to elude its pursuers after an initiation detection. But leveraging sea life has the potential to eliminate many of those considerations entirely. Unfortunately, PALS’ objectives are likely to be easier said than done. A US Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane., USN This is hardly the first time the U.S. military, including DARPA and its predecessor organizations , have investigated the possibility of employing local fauna to spot and track enemies with limited human interaction. Those past projects have almost universally failed to produce the results. The biggest issue is that without some sort of control mechanism, animals are, well, animals. They can behave unexpectedly or erratically and their basic habits can change as they age or in response to broader changing environmental factors . The same species of fish or invertebrate might not even manifest the same characteristics in different areas of the ocean, a problem that emerged in a previous Navy program to turn whale songs into a covert communications tool . Any sensor system collecting information about them will have to account for these things in order to avoid routinely sending back false positives. DARPA will need to run a wide array of tests with various species just build an initial dataset of the kind of responses it can expect when a submarine or other man-made underwater object passes by those creatures. It’s a lot of potential clutter for any system to try and parse through quickly. Advances in artificial intelligence might be able to help speed up the process of identifying patterns of activity and correlating them into actionable information in the future, something the U.S. military is working on already as a way to help sift through bulk intelligence imagery. US Navy sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS John S. McCain sailors monitor underwater objects using the ship’s sonar., USN This lack of readily uniform results has stymied a number of earlier animal-based military projects, including the U.S. Army’s attempts to develop what it called “ instrumented biosensors ” during the Vietnam War. The basic idea was to build a hand-held device full of insects that would become agitated when they became exposed to air with traces of human sweat or waste. The operator would listen for increased buzzing or clicking through a set of headphones. The plan was to use the units to detect ambushers and as “people sniffers” to track insurgents hiding in dense jungle environments. Needless to say, it didn’t work. The bugs didn’t always respond when the researchers hoped they would, or, more problematically, just did so in response to being shaken around as soldiers carried the prototype systems. As living organisms, they also had normal rest and activity schedules that meant they would regularly stop “working” entirely for extended periods of time. A low quality scan showing one of the Army’s Vietnam War-era bug-powered people sniffers., US Army DARPA has left open the possibility of “modifying” fish or other sea creatures with some additional equipment, such as miniaturized sensors, to help improve the reliability of any such system. This could easily prove politically controversial and the Navy already routinely fields criticism from environmental advocates that its operations, especially the use of active sonar , endanger whales and other aquatic animals. Doing so would also likely limit the cost saving aspects of PALS, since it would require capturing the animals, installing the necessary components, and releasing them back into the wild. To make the system work at all, the U.S. military will already need to deploy and maintain the sensor net to process and transmit the data. It would also limit the life forms that the U.S. military would be able to use at all. “DARPA expressly forbids the inclusion of endangered species and intelligent mammals, such as dolphins and whales, from researchers’ proposals on the PALS program,” Jared Adams, a spokesperson for the agency, told Defense News. The Navy does use dolphins and sea lions to help hunt for underwater hazards and other items of interest, but in conjunction with human handlers. If DARPA can find a way to make PALS practical and reliable, it could definitely be a boon for the Navy’s ability to locate potentially hostile submarines and other undersea threats. Unfortunately, past experience shows that there are already a number of challenges the project will have to overcome first.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",This Is The USAF’s “Safer” Carbon Fiber Bomb That’s Also Extraordinarily Expensive,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the third year in a row, the U.S. Air Force is asking for funds to buy a small number of bombs with special carbon fiber shells that make them less likely to endanger friendly forces, cause collateral damage, and accidentally kill civilians. It’s an increasingly important tool for the service to have, but it has yet to start buying them in bulk, likely in part because they’re amazingly expensive. In the Air Force’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released earlier in February 2018 , the service asked for a little more than $8 million to buy just 70 of the 500-pound class carbon fiber BLU-129/Bs, also known as the Very Low Collateral Damage Weapon, or VLCDW. At that price, each one costs more than $116,000, or at least 40 times more than the regular 500-pound class BLU-111/B high explosive bomb and more than five times the cost of even the service’s new 2,000-pound class BLU-137/B bunker buster . This figure doesn’t include the cost of precision guidance kits or specialized fuzes either. In spite of that price tag, the basic concept behind the weapon is relatively simple. When the bomb explodes, the carbon fiber body vaporizes, producing no shrapnel that might end up flying far away from the point of detonation, injuring innocent civilians or unnecessarily damaging private property. This is effectively the opposite of the Air Force’s new cast ductile iron bombs , which have their own special shell that is supposed to fragment uniformly for maximum damage across a broad area. Those weapons are supposed to offer a safer alternative to cluster bombs , leaving no unexploded bomblets behind, but would still be quite threatening to anyone caught in its wide blast radius. An inert carbon fiber body for the BLU-129/B bomb., Joseph Trevithick Precision guidance can help reduce unintended damage, too, but it doesn’t do anything to limit the effects of a weapon once it explodes. According to the Air Force’s budget documents, the weapon is three times less likely than a standard 500-pound class high explosive bomb to cause damage to anything but the intended target. It’s also a significant improvement over the previous BLU-126/B Low Collateral Damage Bomb, or LCDB, which was simply a regular steel cased BLU-111/B, but with less explosive filler. The Air Force fields the bomb in just one configuration, combined with a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-guidance kit and the service refers to the complete system as the GBU-38(V)5/B. Ground crews will often assemble the weapons with air burst fuzes with DSU-33/B proximity sensor, which detonate the bomb at a preset height above the ground. Since its not designed to penetrate reinforced materials or create a cloud of deadly shrapnel, in any configuration, the bomb’s blast radius is relatively contained, making it less useful against hardened targets or enemy forces spread out across a wide area . But the weapons are ideal for engaging hostile forces situated dangerously close to friendly troops or innocent civilians, especially those who are either entirely exposed or have no overhead cover. They’re particularly useful for operations in dense urban environments and the Air Force has already employed them against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and against the Taliban and other militants in Afghanistan. The Air Force, as well as other U.S. military services, have also been developing smaller guided munitions that allow for more precision targeting with less risk to nearby friendly forces or civilians. Of course, by virtue of their size, those weapons also generally lack the destructive power of larger bombs. Depending on the exact situation, a weapon such as the BLU-129/B might offer a sorely needed compromise when targeting specific terrorists or small groups of militants. The bombs are also apparently a feat of engineering and materials science that the Air Force crafted together the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a Department of Energy research center better known for designing nuclear weapons . Since 1985, Energy has had a formal relationship with the Department of Defense to make those same resources available for conventional weapons development. Personnel at LLNL use a special machine to wrap carbon fiber filament to produce cases for prototype BLU-129/B bombs., LLNL And while carbon fiber is a well understood materiel, the scientists and engineers who developed the BLU-129/B had to craft a complex shell that was rigid enough to survive flying attached to a fast moving combat aircraft, falling thousands of feet, and then potentially breaking through a barrier such as the roof of a typical building, but would still produce no fragments when the bomb exploded. A special multiphase blast (MBX) explosive filler helps ensure that the casing disintegrates completely. To help speed up the project, which began in 2010, personnel at LLNL heavily utilized supercomputer-powered models and simulations to determine how the bomb’s case would react to various stresses in order to determine whether it would function properly. According to an article in the March 2013 issue of laboratory’s internal Science & Technology Review magazine, scientists and engineers did 95 percent of the design work through modeling rather than physical testing and prototyping. “In the ‘old’ days, we would build a prototype, test it, and revamp it based on the results,” Kip Hamilton, the project manager for the bomb at LLNL said in an interview for article. “Our advanced modeling and simulation capabilities reduce the time needed to determine the final design specifications for munitions.” LLNL also said it designed the prototype weapons from the beginning with an eye toward mass production. Unfortunately, after the better part of a decade and despite the weapon’s obvious utility, this still hasn’t happened. A complete GBU-31(V)5/B JDAM with the BLU-129/B bomb., USAF In each budget request since the 2016 fiscal year, the Air Force has asked for the same amount, a little more than $8 million, to buy 70 of the bombs. In January 2017, the service cut a one-time fixed-price deal with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to build up to 500 of the carbon fiber bodies over an indefinite period. According to the latest budget request for fiscal year 2019, the Air Force is still trying to determine how many BLU-129/Bs it should keep on hand at any one time in general. In the meantime, it says it is only buying just enough to meet stated operational demands. One has to wonder whether the limited stockpile of the weapons to begin with, combined with their exorbitant cost, might make units flying missions over Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan less likely to use them or ask for more, though, even when they might be useful . The fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, in particular, involved major aerial campaigns over cities, such as the terrorist group’s de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, where the carbon fiber bombs might have helped mitigate the reportedly significant numbers of civilian casualties. Inversely, it is possible that there might be more demand if there were more of the bombs available. Larger purchases would likely help drive down the high unit price, at least to some degree, as well. The video below shows a U.S.-led coalition air strike on a building in Raqqa, Syria in 2015, which gives a good sense of the effects of using standard high explosive bombs in an urban environment. “The way wars are fought now is vastly different than it was even 15 years ago,” Hamilton said in 2013. “More consideration is given to protecting warfighters in close proximity to targets and to civilians not engaged in the fight.” These statements have only become more pronounced since then in an age of cell phone cameras and the internet. Any errant shrapnel can quickly become a major propaganda tool and give ammunition to both actual enemy forces, as well as other critics, including opposing governments elsewhere in the world. Battles inside built up areas full of both enemy forces and regular people caught up in the fighting are also likely to become increasingly more common as time goes on and as global populations grow and urbanization expands around the world. The Pentagon as a whole is increasingly becoming more concerned by the prospect of future conflicts that take place in part inside “megacities,” which it defines as cohesive population centers with 10 million or more inhabitants. Though they’re unlikely to ever replace all bombs in all situations, having options like the BLU-129/B, or a cheaper, more usable alternative, will be an important capability for the Air Force going forward. Hopefully, they’ll be able to find a way to bring the costs down and do so quickly. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 10, 2019",White House’s Claim That Trump Cut Cost Of Final Air Force One Deal Just Doesn’t Add Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The White House is crediting President Donald Trump with personally negotiating down the price of two new specialized presidential aircraft , which will become the future Air Force Ones, by nearly $1.5 billion. Though this is something the president has long said he would do, the claims are highly suspect, with the supposedly reduced price tag being exactly the same as the Air Force’s well established official estimates, with the cuts only being possible thanks to an entirely unexplained increase of more than a billion dollars to the the program’s total cost. Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley and other White House spokespersons disclosed the “new” $3.9 billion deal to various outlets on Feb. 27, 2018. This final price tag includes the U.S. Air Force’s purchase of a pair of Boeing 748-8i airliners and the costs associated with having that company make substantial modifications in line with a series of unique and complex inter-agency requirements, which will harden the airframe and its various mission systems against a variety of attacks, including electromagnetic pulses from nuclear detonations. “President Trump has reached an informal deal with Boeing on a fixed price contract for the new Air Force One Program,” Gidley told Fox News . “Thanks to the president’s negotiations, the contract will save the taxpayers more than $1.4 billion.” In December 2016, then President Elect Trump famously Tweeted out that the Air Force One replacement program’s costs were “out of control” and that the U.S. government should “cancel [the] order!” In February 2017 , he claimed he had been able to trim $1 billion from the project’s total price, which he himself had repeatedly said was around $4 billion. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 The White House now says Trump had bad information about the total price, which it says had climbed over $5 billion. However, Gidley and the other spokespersons offered no details about how they had calculated this new figure or otherwise explaining how or why this dramatic and sudden cost increase occurred at all. As of 2016 , the Air Force had laid out plans to spend approximately $3 billion between the 2015 and 2021 fiscal years on the Air Force One replacement program. A Politifact analysis of the available details in December 2016 determined the actual total was likely around $3.8 billion, including research and development and other ancillary costs. In December 2016, Defense One reported that Boeing had reportedly informally offered the president four different possible courses of action to help cut costs. The White House reportedly rejected all of those proposals, which ranging in price from $2.28 billion to $4.2 billion. Not surprisingly, the Air Force’s estimate for the total price of the new Air Force Ones remains effectively unchanged , at around $3 billion, in its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal cycle. The budget documents also confirms that the service has already spent around $1 billion on the project, giving the project an overall price of, you guessed it, approximately $4 billion. President Donald Trump waves from the door of one of the Air Force’s two VC-25A Air Force One jets., Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP Since 2009, the Air Force has been actively working to replace the existing pair of heavily modified 747-200B-based VC-25A Air Force One presidential aircraft, which have served as the president’s primary means of travel since 1991. It is possible that new requirements could have emerged, especially in the realms of space and cyberspace , and drove the costs up, but if this is the case, the official Air Force budget requirements do not reflect it in any way. At the same time, the service has already announced a number of cost cutting initiatives over the the past few years. The Air Force eliminated a number of the aircraft’s planned features in a broad review of the program, cutting around $500 million from the project’s cost, but did so before Trump won the 2016 presidential election. This included an immensely short-sighted decision to eliminate the mid-air refueling capability from the new jets. The VC-25A has that feature specifically so the president and his closest advisers can remain airborne and away from danger for a protracted period of time during a major crisis. Its core to the aircraft’s ability to play its part in the larger “ continuity of government ” plans, which exist to make sure the U.S. government continues to function adequately no matter what might happen, including a nuclear exchange. There were also reports that the new Air Force Ones could use a cheaper commercial grade environmental control system , which again seems like a decision that needlessly increases risks, though its not clear if that decision came before or after Trump entered office. The existing VC-25As almost certainly have more robust air filtration and recycling systems, among other features, in order to better protect against chemical and biological agents and nuclear fallout. According to Defense One , there may have been unspecified cuts to the aircraft’s power generation capabilities, which in turn could have an impact on its ability to carry certain mission systems or run them adequately at all times. One of the Air Force’s 747-based E-4B Nightwatch command and control aircraft refuels in mid-air. The VC-25As have a similar configuration., USAF After learning about the decision to remove the mid-air refueling capability became public in 2017, members of Congress subsequently suggested that they might demand the Air Force reintroduce that capability to its list of Air Force One requirements as part of future defense budgets. Legislators could similarly decide to add in funding specifically for other features, as well. Again, this could turn into an especially costly endeavor depending on how far along the other modifications to the 747-8is might have already progressed. The Air Force had also previously announced plans to buy 747-8i Jumbo Jet aircraft Boeing that had already built, but not delivered to a now defunct Russian airline in order to try and save costs. However, using those orphaned Jumbo Jets could end up costing the Air Force more in the long run, because Boeing did not build them from the ground up to accommodate all the necessary and complex modifications, both to the basic airframe and its on board systems. These specialized capabilities by their nature come with high costs. In January 2018, the Air Force announced it had hired Boeing to build two new eight-compartment refrigerators for the galleys on the existing Air Force Ones, which have to be able to keep approximately 3,000 meals fresh for weeks at a time in order to be able to sustain dozens and potentially hundreds of passengers in an emergency. Those units together cost nearly $24 million . None of this has apparently changed the Air Force’s standing cost estimates, though, which have not delineated between plans to use newly built or existing non-delivered aircraft. At no point has the Air Force ever indicated that the program’s costs significantly increased across the board or did so by $1 billion or more specifically. But if the White House’s claim is inaccurate, Boeing doesn’t appear inclined to be the one to bring it up. As reports of the cost-cutting began to appear, the company Tweeted out a message of support, though it deftly avoiding giving any actual dollar amount. “Boeing is proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American Presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to  taxpayers,” the company posted on Twitter. “President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people.” Boeing is proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American Presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers. President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people. pic.twitter.com/m0HtGfXVlv — The Boeing Company (@Boeing) February 27, 2018 Boeing has already been coy about the program’s costs, especially the price the U.S. government is getting on the base 747-8is, which it says it needs to keep confidential because it still sells the aircraft commercially. List prices suggest the airliners run around $350 million apiece in a typical commercial configuration, but that is in no way representative of the costs associated with turning them into flying White Houses. The Chicago-based planemaker’s apparent support for Trump’s cost-cutting claim represents a steadily changing in the relationship between the company and the president, who had been highly critical of the company, including accusing it of sending jobs overseas, especially to China , both as a candidate and after taking office. The two have apparently since made up, though, and Trump now routinely touts Boeing military and commercial aircraft during press conferences and other speeches. Air Force One touches down in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. , Ramon “Tonito” Zayas / GFR Media/GDA via AP This is hardly the first time we’ve seen this sort of dance between a defense contractor the president. Lockheed Martin similarly lent weight to Trump’s inaccurate claim that he personally shaved hundreds of millions of dollars from the price of buying more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in February 2017. This minor victory was enough to turn the president, who had also declared the F-35 program was “out of control,” into an ardent supporter of the project. There is growing evidence he may actually believe the stealthy planes are literally invisible . The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has previously noted this dramatic change of heart, writing : It is pretty clear Trump has been personally spoon-fed the F-35 brochure from LockMart and the program office. Without any point of reference, it all must seem pretty wondrous. Oh and the program he was so critical of during his campaign is now magically fixed because he made a phone call. Totally ridiculous to the point that its downright insulting. And really, nothing of this has to do with the jet itself, just a new slathering of politics that surrounds it. To be honest, I had high hopes that Trump could spur systemic change within the DoD’s procurement process. Those hopes have faded rapidly over the last three months. It seems that he is far more interested in selectively intervening in a few high-profile programs he has interest in so that he can claim fake victories and gloat about them endlessly to the press, and the defense industry is happy to oblige him if it means funding certainty and a strong order book. As Trump would put it: “sad.” These changes in tone now from companies who appear eager to placate the president, both in order to avoid a Twitter rant that might send stock prices plummeting and to more easily secure future deals, continue to border on the farcical. It’s even more embarrassing when the facts so readily appear to contradict these positive pronouncements. And even if the White House’s figures turn out to be accurate, a cost saving of a billion and a half dollars is a drop in the bucket in the context of President Trump’s new, largest ever proposed base defense budget. The Air Force One replacement program’s total $4 billion cost, which is spread out across at least another five years, represents just over one half of one percent of the defense spending request for the 2019 fiscal year alone. And since the White House says its Air Force One announcement stems from an informal deal, it’s not immediately clear whether or not it might not change again by the time the Air Force and Boeing actually formalize the plan. Suggesting Trump has succeeded in getting the costs of the new Air Force Ones down may give him another brief political victory, but as it stands now the basic numbers just don’t line up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 15, 2019",USAF Getting ‘Cast Ductile Iron Bomb’ Cluster Munition Replacement Despite Policy Change,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite the U.S. military’s recent decision to push off plans to abandon certain cluster munitions, the U.S. Air Force still wants to buy a new set of bombs that provide similar effects without the danger of leaving unexploded bomblets scattered around the battlefield. Instead, these new weapons use a cast ductile iron shell to produce a cloud of deadly, but inert shrapnel that can cut through enemy personnel, as well as light structures and vehicles, across wider area than previous, standard high-explosive bombs. On Feb. 22, 2018, the U.S. Air Force posted a notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps, asking for information from contractors about their ability to produce between 250 and 1,500 BLU-136/B 2,000-pound class cast ductile iron bomb warheads every year for at least the next four years. The service’s budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released earlier in February 2018 , included a request for nearly $85 million to purchase both the BLU-136/B and the 500-pound class BLU-134/B, also known as the Next Generation Area Attack Weapon (NGAAW) Increments II and I respectively. The Air Force first began actively developing these two bombs in 2014 as part of the Improved Lethality Warhead (ILW) program. The basic principle behind the BLU-134/B and BLU-136/B is relatively simple. Unlike the steel, which the Air Force uses for the bodies on its typical high explosive bombs, cast ductile iron is more brittle and therefore more likely to fragment in a more uniform manner, especially with the help of pre-scored seams on the inside of the shell. At the same time, its high graphite content makes it stronger than regular cast iron and better suited to the shock, vibration, and other environmental conditions that bombs experience when combat aircraft carry them aloft and drop them onto a target. Otherwise, the bombs use the same explosive filler as existing high explosive bombs. The first prototype BLU-134/Bs were actually known as the BLU-111D/B, with the main difference being the new casing. Airmen work to assemble a number of 500-pound class GBU-38/B JDAMs. The BLU-134/B cast ductile iron bomb could become a new warhead option for these GPS-guided weapons., USAF To further improve their effectiveness, the final BLU-134/Bs and -136/Bs have a special height-of-burst sensor-enabled fuze that pilots can set during a mission from inside the cockpit. This allows them to fine tune just how far above the ground the bomb will explode, which has a direct impact on how high and wide an area the shrapnel covers. By using standard bomb shapes, the Air Force will be able to combine both weapons with existing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-guidance and Paveway II and III-series laser-guidance kits to create new precision guided weapons. The bombs will be able to work with dual mode Laser JDAM and Paveway-type kits, as well. This standardization means that it should be relatively easy for the Air Force to integrate the weapons onto current and future combat aircraft, even stealthy jets such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35A Joint Strike Fighter that feature fully enclosed weapons bays with very firm size constraints. As such, other branches of the U.S. military might be inclined to join the project to acquire the bombs, or additional variants thereof, for their own use, too. A pair of dual mode GBU-49/B Paveway IIs under the wing of a MQ-9 Reaper drone. These 500-pound class bombs typically use the BLU-111/B warhead, but could use the new BLU-134/B cast ductile iron bomb., USAF This commonality and backwards compatibility is all by design. The Air Force initiated the project originally to meet Pentagon-wide plans to develop alternatives to existing cluster munitions. Then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates kicked off this initiative under President George W. Bush in June 2008. The goal was to eliminate any cluster bomb or artillery shell bomblets that failed on average more than one percent of the time by Jan. 1, 2019. This policy shift came in response to the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), an international treaty to which the United States is not party, that bans certain types of cluster munitions on the grounds that they pose a particularly indiscriminate and lasting threat to innocent civilians, especially as a result of their tendency to malfunction and leave unexploded ordnance behind. Cast ductile iron bombs met the Pentagon’s goal by eliminating the need for those submunitions, and their complicated, miniaturized operating mechanisms, entirely. Since defense contractors had well established manufacturing processes and facilities to build cast ductile iron bodies for inert training bombs , it also presented a particularly cost-effective alternative. The only problem is that the fragmentation pattern from one of these new weapons simply cannot cover the same area as a cluster bomb, even with the ability to change the height of burst on the fly. The fragments also cannot defeat heavy armor or zero in on a particular target, both features of the Air Force’s CBU-105/B Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) anti-armor cluster bomb and its infrared homing BLU-108/B Sensor Fuzed Munitions (SFMs), which the service keeps in inventory specifically to help defeat large formations of enemy tanks and other armored vehicles. A display cutaway model of a CBU-105/B Sensor Fuzed Weapon with one of its BLU-108/B Sensor Fuzed Munitions in front to the left in its fully deployed configuration., Texcoco via Wikimedia The larger BLU-136/B was supposed to help mitigate these issues to some degree. Combat aircraft could simply employ additional bombs to adequately destroy targets in a particular area, too, but it wouldn’t do anything to improve the weapon’s effectiveness against more heavily armored targets. These limitations, among other factors, which you can read about in depth here , led the U.S. military to reverse the course of its cluster munitions plans in December 2017. Though the new policy did not change the overall goal of eliminating such weapons with a greater than one percent failure rate at some point in the future, it did delay the implementation of the Pentagon’s self-imposed ban indefinitely and loosen existing rules on what weapons were acceptable for combat use and when. The video below shows the BLU-108/B smart submunitions from CBU-105/Bs striking a mock convoy during a training exercise. Regardless, the Air Force remains committed to the cast ductile bomb, which definitely could offer benefits in a wide array of situations, even if cluster munitions remain in U.S. military inventory. The ability to set the fuze in flight gives pilots more flexibility to use the weapons, even in constrained environments, such as dense urban areas in very particular scenarios, whereas an actual cluster bomb would present far too much of a danger to friendly forces or innocent bystanders. With a low burst height setting, a precision-guided 500-pound or even 250-pound class cast ductile iron might be able to better clear a mass of enemy troops on foot or in light vehicles from a particular area, while leaving tertiary structures relatively unscathed. The Air Force has already expressed an interested in a lightweight version of the warhead as an option for the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), a GPS-guided glide bomb with short-range stand-off attack capability, which could offer additional highly localized anti-personnel capabilities. A similar lighter weight variant could go into the future dual mode GBU-53/B SDB II . An airman inspects a special rack holding four GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs on an F-15E Strike Eagle. The Air Force has expressed an interest in a cast ductile iron warhead for these weapons., USAF Combining the bombs like the BLU-134/B and -136/B with a more complex targeting system that can assign multiple impact points and fuze burst heights at once might give pilots the ability to even better mimic the effects of a cluster munitions when those weapons are otherwise inappropriate for tactical or political reasons. This might allow them to mix effects, too, such as using a standard bomb to blast a hole in the roof of building and then dropping a cast ductile iron bomb inside for maximum damage, something that would be impossible to do reliably with a traditional cluster bomb. Another possibility could be to employ a bunker buster on a more hardened structure and then to catch personnel fleeing out into the open with a burst of shrapnel. The video below shows a U.S. military air strike on Mosul, Iraq in 2016 involving multiple bombs impacting in rapid succession. Using cast ductile iron bombs in this matter might produce effects similar to a traditional cluster munition over a wider area. Cast ductile iron bombs could be particularly appealing to foreign allies and partners who have signed up to the CCM, but still have a need for an area effect bomb. On the other hand, it might be just as good an option for U.S. government-facilitated sales to countries with poor track records of avoiding collateral damage with traditional cluster munitions. The Air Force’s February 2018 request for information regarding the BLU-136/B specifically notes that the production totals could include bombs set aside for foreign military sales cases. So, while the U.S. military now plans to keep cluster munitions for the time being, the cast ductile iron bomb still looks set to become an important additional capability for the Air Force, as well as potentially other branches of the American military and foreign allies and partners.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",US Eyes Adding Nuclear Cruise Missiles to Zumwalt Stealth Destroyers As Well As Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force General John Hyten , head of U.S. Strategic Command, has suggested he’s interested in arming a variety of ships with a new nuclear-tipped cruise missile, including the stealthy Zumwalt -class destroyers , as well as guided missile submarines, or SSGNs, and attack subs . This only renews concerns about whether or not a potential opponent might then dangerously mistake a conventional missile barrage for the start of a nuclear exchange and the possibility that the weapons could make it more likely that the United States would launch a nuclear strike in general. According to a recent report by Military.com , Hyten made his comments in a speech and while taking subsequent questions during a gathering at the National Defense University’s Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 16, 2018. Earlier in February 2018, President Donald Trump’s Administration released a new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) that called for development of nuclear sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM), as well as modifying some existing Trident D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) with lower yield nuclear warheads, both ostensibly to offer a “flexible” response to an adversaries own “limited” nuclear strikes. “It’s important to know that the NPR, when it talks about the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile, does not say ‘Submarine-Launched Cruise Missile,’” Hyten said in his keynote address, according to Military.com. “We want to look at a number of options [when it comes to ships carrying the SLCM] – everything from surface DDG 1000s [ Zumwalt class-destroyers] into submarines, different types of submarines.” The possibility of arming the Zumwalts with the new nuclear armed cruise missile would be a logistic extension of the U.S. Navy’s previously announced desire to have those ships focus on stand-off attacks against enemy ships and targets ashore. The destroyers could conceivably leverage their low-observable characteristics to be able to better position themselves, even in high threat areas, for a flexible nuclear strike during a crisis. The USS Zumwalt ., USN But, at present, the Navy only expects to receive three of these advanced ships and it remains unclear just how inclined the service might ever be to deploy them for actual high-intensity combat missions. There is a distinct possibility that the future Zumwalt Squadron One will end up focused more on research and development and other experimental activities owing to the limited number of the destroyers. The United States did previously field a nuclear-armed version of the Tomahawk, known as the TLAM-N, aboard Navy surface ships, as well as submarines, in the past. U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the Navy to begin placing those weapons in storage in 1991, where they remained until President Barack Obama’s Administration removed them from inventory altogether. It’s not entirely clear whether or not the Navy would look to deploy the missiles on other surface vessels, but it is possible that the service could also add them as an option for the Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and Ticonderoga -class cruisers . This could offer a way to more visibly demonstrate the United States’ extended deterrent capabilities during periods of increased tensions or an actual crisis, but without having to actually fire a weapon, similar to the kind of signaling the U.S. Air Force can do through routine or snap bomber deployments to forward areas. The plans to arm the Zumwalts with these weapons would already appear to contradict some previous Pentagon statements, though. In announcing the new NPR on Feb. 2, 2018, Under Secretary of Defense For Policy John Rood never once used the phrase “sea-launched cruise missile” and instead referred to the notional weapon exclusively as a “submarine-launched cruise missile” six times . Though this could simply have been Rood misstating the definition of the SLCM acronym, it did appear at the time to strongly imply that the plan was almost entirely focused on developing a new low yield option for U.S. submarines. Whatever the case, the more important part of Hyten’s remarks is reiterating that the new nuclear SLCM could end up on various types of submarines. At present, the Navy’s nuclear-capable submarine force consists entirely of 14 Ohio -class ballistic missile submarines , or SSBNs, which carry Trident D-5s nuclear ballistic missiles. Those boats represent the naval component of the U.S. military’s nuclear triad, which also includes land-based nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and long-range bombers that can carry nuclear cruise missiles and gravity bombs. The Ohio -class SSBNs could potentially use their torpedo tubes to launch the nuclear SLCM or the Navy could give them the ability to fire the missiles vertically from modified missile tubes. New Columbia -class SSBNs are also already under construction to replace Ohio -class SSBNs, but similarly could fire the the SLCMs from their torpedo tubes or from modified missile tubes. But considering that these boats have the job of disappearing far out to sea while on strategic nuclear patrols, this is highly unlikely to occur. Instead, the mission of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles to sea will likely fall on other U.S. Navy submarine force communities. The service already has four converted Ohio -class SSGNs that exclusively 154 conventional Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles, or TLAMs . In addition it has a growing number of Virginia -class attack submarines, as well as later model Los Angeles -class boats, both of which can already carry a dozen conventional TLAMs in vertical launch tubes and can employ torpedo tube-launched versions of the missile as well. Later, extended versions of the Virginia-class will also get new multi-purpose Virginia Payload Modules that will allow them to hold dozens more TLAMs. A torpedo tube-launched variant of the new nuclear SLCM could be an option for the Navy’s secretive Seawolf -class attack submarines, as well. Two of these ships routinely deploy on shadowy missions to the increasingly contested Arctic region , while the third boat, the USS Jimmy Carter , is reportedly set aside for high-risk underwater spy missions . The Virginia -class submarine USS John Warner with one of its Virginia Payload Modules, each of which can hold six TLAMs, open during its commissioning ceremony in 2015., USN “That’s what the president’s budget has requested of us – to go look at those platforms,” Hyten said at the National Defense University. “We’re going to walk down that path.” But as we at The War Zone have noted before , the core concepts of a nuclear SLCM are deeply worrisome. The biggest issue is that it would be difficult, if not impossible for a potential enemy to determine the difference between nuclear or conventional cruise missile strikes within what would almost certainly be an already short decision making window to begin with. The United States does not have a “no first use” policy with regards to nuclear weapons meaning that it could already potentially launch a nuclear strike in response to an opponents non-nuclear actions and without any other obvious warning. Unlike ICBMs or even SLBMs, which have large infrared plumes at the time of launch and more readily appear on radar, cruise missiles can already be difficult to detect and classify, too. In order to make it more survivable against improving enemy air and missile defenses and their associated long-range sensors , a new nuclear-armed SLCM could have low-observable features that would make it even more difficult to spot. All of this would only shorten the amount of time an opponent might have to try and determine whether a strike was nuclear or conventional and how to respond. Adversaries might feel they have to treat any cruise missile barrage as an incoming nuclear threat by default in order to feel more confident in their own nuclear deterrent or other, possibly asymmetric second-strike capabilities. This, in turn, could make it more difficult for the United States to employ sea-based cruise missile strikes, something it does routinely , without risking a major escalation. And depending on which classes of submarines eventually gain the capability to launch the new SLCM, it could easily compel potential opponents to consider all American submarines as possible nuclear threats and prompt an arms race to field comparable systems and other countermeasures . The subsequent need for the United States to come up with its own counter-countermeasures could be a costly and further destabilizing endeavor. The Trump Administration’s NPR insists both the low-yield SLBM and the new nuclear SLCM are both necessary in order to ensure the United States has a means of responding to a limited hostile nuclear strike or other major attack it decides warrants a nuclear response. At the same time, though, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies have not been unable to definitively explain why the previous posture could not adequately deter those threats through fear of massive nuclear retaliation. This in turn raises concerns about whether or not the presence of low-yield nuclear weapons raises the potential for the United States to actually use them in a crisis, something the U.S. military adamantly denies. “If you’re saying that having low-yield nuclear weapons does not lower the threshold for use, then you’re essentially saying there’s no difference between using a low-yield and a high-yield weapon,” Alexandra Bell, the senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation and a former senior State Department official, told HuffPost News in January 2018. “If you’re saying adamantly in here that this won’t change our current posture choices, it basically negates your reason to have this [low-yield] capability in the first place.” Sailors from the submarine tender USS Frank Cable lower a TLAM into one of the launch tubes on the Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Oklahoma City . , USN It’s not clear when, or even if, the U.S. military will begin to develop or actually field this new nuclear SLCM, either. The Pentagon’s budget request for the 2019 fiscal year only includes a small amount of funding to study what it would take to craft such a weapon and have it ready for service sometime in the next seven to 10 years. This raises additional questions about why the Pentagon is so actively signaling its interest in this weapon at all. There is the possibility that the U.S. government is looking to looking to use the plan as a negotiation tactic to prompt potential adversaries, chiefly Russia, into abandoning their own new and destabilizing nuclear weapons, including those that outright violate existing arms control agreements. “I don’t want to say in advance of a negotiation and undercut our negotiators’ position [by saying] what we would or would not do,” U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told members of Congress during a hearing on Feb. 6, 2018 when asked about whether he would consider halting the SLCM developing in exchange for concessions for Russia regarding its treaty-busting nuclear land-based cruise missile . “I believe we have to give our negotiators something with which to negotiate.” US Secretary of Defense James Mattis., Chris Kleponis/Sipa USA via AP As we at The War Zone have explored in depth in the past, there’s no guarantee that this course of action will produce the desired results. This public emphasis on the SLCM, and other low yield options, could just as easily reinforce the Kremlin’s opinion that it needs its expanding and diverse nuclear options to retain a credible deterrent against the United States. When he announced that American ships and submarines would no longer carry the TLAM-N during routine operations, President Bush acknowledged many of these issues. He specifically said that placing those missiles in storage, as well as removing a variety of other low-yield nuclear weapons from deployed locations abroad and other nuclear arms control measures, improved stability and reduced the likelihood of a nuclear exchange. “This new force will be versatile, able to respond around the world to challenges, old and new,” he said in his speech to the American people on Sept. 27, 1991. “We can enhance stability and actually reduce the risk of nuclear war.” If the U.S. government’s threshold for using nuclear weapons remains unchanged, it’s hard to understand how the basic structure of America’s nuclear triad is any less flexible than it was nearly three decades ago or how any benefits of a new nuclear SLCM outweigh the added risks and high costs any more now than they did then.

A U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler recently made it back to base after suffering a terrifying mid-air mishap, which left its two-person crew flying blind and frostbitten after the aircraft’s environment control system failed in part thanks to a pair of high-tech wrist watches.  The incident occurred just over a year after the canopy on another one of the electronic warfare planes exploded in a bizarre over-pressurization incident and as the service continues to struggle to find exactly what’s causing persistent reports of “hypoxia-like” symptoms across the F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and Growler fleets. Defense News was first to report this new incident, which occurred approximately 60 miles south of Seattle, Washington. The EA-18G, assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9), was flying at approximately 25,000 feet on a mission from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, between Seattle and Vancouver BC, when the cockpit temperature plummeted to -30 degrees Fahrenheit. The broken environmental control system (ECS) also let in a fine mist of liquid, which then froze, coating the inside of the canopy and vital flight instruments in an opaque sheen of ice. The ECS consists of a number of sub-components that are supposed to work together to manage oxygen flow to the crew, as well as cockpit pressure and temperature. Despite using up all of their emergency oxygen supply, the crew was able to wend its way its way back to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island with help from air traffic controllers on the ground and their smart watches. In July 2017, Navy Hornet, Super Hornet, and Growler pilots each got a $450 Garmin Fenix 3 wristwatch , which can measure air pressure and altitude and display an individual’s course heading. The service issued the watches in order to provide a backup alert mechanism in case the ECS’ on-board oxygen generation system, or OBOGS, malfunctioned and cockpit pressure dropped to unsafe levels and the aircraft’s built-in safety mechanisms and warning systems also failed. The Navy had not publicly stated that it could serve as a improvised navigational aid in an emergency. The video below gives a basic overview of the Fenix 3’s navigation functions. They eventually got the aircraft back to base and safety on the ground. Both the pilot and the electronic warfare officer suffered severe frostbite, including blisters and burns on their hands, according to an official report Defense News obtained. It’s not clear if there were any other injuries. However, “one of the aircrew is already back in a flight status. The other is not yet back in a flight status but is expected to make a complete recovery,” U.S. Navy Commander Ron Flanders, a spokesperson for Naval Air Forces, told Defense News. “The mishap is under investigation. I cannot comment further.” An US Navy EA-18G Growler., USN This is reportedly the first time this particular type of failure has ever occurred on one of the Navy’s EA-18G. It’s not the first time the ECS on a Growler has failed spectacularly, though. In December 2016, the system in another Growler at Whidbey Island, assigned to Electronic Attack Squadron One Three Two (VAQ-132), also known as the “Scorpions,” malfunctioned. In this instance, the cockpit pressure spiked , leave one crew member with collapsed lungs and the other with a traumatic brain injury. The malfunction also blew out the plexiglass canopy and sent shards flying in all directions. “The scene was unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed,” U.S. Navy Commander Jon Crawford, head of VAQ-132, told local reporters at the time. “Some of the stuff…yeah…a little horrific.” A Navy deck crewman wipes down an EA-18G., USN Thankfully this all happened while the aircraft was on the ground. Both the pilot and electronic warfare officer survived the harrowing incident, thanks in part to the timely intervention of two U.S. Air Force Reserve pararescuemen from the 304th Rescue Squadron, who happened to be on base at the time. Again, the Navy said this was the first instance of that particular type of failure on any of its EA-18Gs, but the service has had trouble nailing down exactly what went wrong. The combination of the cold Washington state weather and the ground crew having sprayed the aircraft down shortly before the mission might have contributed to the mishap. A faulty safety valve could have been another factor. But the Navy’s Hornet, Super Hornet and Growler crews might not take much comfort in the possibility that these two particular accidents may have been unique and isolated. The Growler’s ECS, as well as related systems on the service’s Hornets and Super Hornets, have been a well known and persistent source of trouble. A test fixture the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Altitude Lab uses to test breathing apparatuses and OBOGS systems., USN The ECS, and more specifically the OBOGS portion, has been a contributing factor in approximately a quarter of all so-called “physiological episodes,” or PE, that Navy and Marine aviators have reported while flying Super Hornets and Growlers and that number is said to be higher in older Hornets, according to Defense News’ report. PEs are generally instances where an individual suffers one or more serious physiological symptoms, such as severe headaches, blurred vision, confusion, or disorientation, or even temporarily blacks out. Though it is often difficult for medical professionals to definitively diagnose the cause after the fact, these are all signs of hypoxia , a dangerous drop or complete lack of oxygen to the brain, which can be fatal on its own, as well as just especially dangerous for a pilot flying a high performance jet at hundreds of miles per hour. The reason why the remaining pilots and electronic warfare officers have experienced hypoxia-like symptoms remains unexplained, which has become increasingly worrisome as reported instances have shot up in recent years. Between May 2010 and October 2015, there were 297 known PEs across crews flying Navy and Marine Corps Hornets and Super Hornets. In 2016 alone there were 125 incidents among individuals in Hornets, Super Hornets, and Growlers. Investigations have cited OBOGS failures as a major factor in crashes that have killed at least four naval aviators. Similar OBOGS problems have cropped up in the service’s T-45 Goshawk trainer fleet , as well, with instructors staging a near mutinous protest over the issue in 2017. Hypoxia-like symptoms have also become a major problem for other aircraft across the U.S. military. Air Force pilots flying the F-35A Joint Strike Fighters , A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft, and turboprop T-6 Texan II trainers have suffered all suffer PEs, as well. The T-6s remain grounded, though the service hopes to have them flying again, with some unspecified restrictions , by the end of February 2018. A US Navy T-45A Goshawk trainer, another type of aircraft that has suffered serious problems with its OBOGS., USN So far, the Navy has still been unable to conclusively identify the root causes and has turned to a number of improvised measures, such as the Garmin watches. As of January 2018, the service had installed new oxygen monitors on 163 of the T-45s to alert crews to dangerous drops in the flow of air and record data about those malfunctions for further analysis. But after the Navy announced in January 2018 that it would give Rear Admiral Sara Joyner a new job at the Pentagon after less than as head of its Physiological Episodes Action Team, some members of Congress raised more questions about how seriously the service might be taking the issue. Legislators lambasted Navy and Air Force officials over the issue at a hearing in February 2018. “This has got to be fixed. I don’t have confidence that we’re getting nearer to that,” Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said. “This would seem to be something that needs to be done quickly and expeditiously. This should not be a research project. This should be a fix-it project.” The Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force already know that ignoring the issue isn’t an option, but the root causes of the problems remain elusive. In the meantime, it doesn’t seem like a bad idea to give more aviators new wristwatches.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 10, 2018",USAF’s New Ground Tracking Radar Plan Desperately Needs Stealthy Flying Sensor Trucks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it will pursue a “distributed” combination of existing manned and unmanned aircraft with new sensors and other equipment as the replacement for old E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System battlefield management command and control aircraft, or JSTARS. But its seems increasingly clear that the service will need to add a new low-observable sensor node to this mix if it realistically expects to be able to extend the reach of those surveillance capabilities into heavily defended areas, especially during any potential large-scale high-end conflict , especially against a near-peer opponent such as Russia or China . The Air Force had previously planned to “recapitalize” the E-8C’s ground surveillance and command and control functions into a smaller, more modern airframe with improved radars and communications equipment. With its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released earlier in February 2018, it formally announced it would scrap that plan in favor of mix of upgraded E-3 airborne early warning and control planes, high-flying RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft, and medium-altitude MQ-9 Reaper drones . To support this new concept, seven E-3s will receive improved sensors, as well as updated communications gear and data links to be able to better share a variety of information with other aircraft and troops on the ground. The Block 40 Global Hawks will also get improved connectivity so they can distribute data from their own multi-purpose radars, which can operate in a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) mode, in near real time. Lastly, some Reapers will get a new GMTI-capable radar. “If that’s the solution, it won’t survive,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said of the earlier concept of supplanting the E-8C with a modified business jet type aircraft in a speech at the Air Force Association’s annual Air Warfare Symposium on Feb. 22, 2018. “We think we presented something that can help us in a highly contested environment.” An E-3 Sentry, one of the mix of platforms the US Air Force says it will use to replace the E-8C JSTARS., USAF It’s not clear, however, how the E-3, which uses an airframe based on the 1950s-era Boeing 707 airliner just like the E-8C, or the relatively low- and slow-flying MQ-9 in particular would be any more survivable than a militarized bizjet in an a high threat situation full of advanced combat aircraft and integrated air defenses with cuing from various long-range ground, air, and even space-based sensors . The RQ-4 might be able to use altitude to its advantage, but it can’t fly as high as the venerable U-2 Dragon Lady manned spy plane, which was itself already increasingly vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles by the 1960s. So it’s not necessarily surprising that some of the service’s senior leaders have already begun publicly questioning whether this mix of platforms will be sufficient for a future near-peer conflict. In September 2017, as it became steadily clearer that the Air Force would cancel its JSTARs replacement project, U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, the service’s primary warfighting arm, outlined the basic underlying problem at the Air Force Association’s main annual gathering in Washington D.C. “The question really is, how long do we continue to fund the GMTI capability in the classic way we’ve done it: with an integrated platform that has a sensor and air battle managers onboard?” he asked rhetorically. “How much of our threat environment in the future will allow us to do that?” In talking with reporters during a roundtable at the Air Warfare Symposium on Feb. 22, 2018, Holmes pointedly and unambiguously said the MQ-9 specifically would not be able to penetrate into heavily defended areas during a high-intensity conflict, according to Air Force Magazine . It “depends on whether you’re going to use the MQ-9 against a great power or … the way we’ve been using it … in a permissive environment,” the general added in response to a question about whether there was a need for a more survivable, and potentially stealthy, replacement for the Reaper. An MQ-9 Reaper in Afghanistan with the Gorgon Stare wide-area persistent surveillance camera system. One of the easiest ways to add a GMTI-capable radar to the drone would be in a similar, podded configuration., USAF The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has already explored this issue in depth , noting that the Air Force appeared to be moving toward developing a new, low-observable platform – or using a classified system it already has – to act as an important sensor node as part of a distributed “system or systems” to support the battlefield management and command and control mission, also referred to as BMC2. Such an aircraft could be manned, unmanned, or even a pilot-optional design and would use its systems to gather battlefield intelligence in high threat areas near or forward of the front lines, all the while relaying that information back to other aircraft or ground command centers with the ability to process it and pass it along to other units. This would hardly be the first time the Air Force has looked into this type of aircraft. In the 1970s, the service was proved the concept was viable during the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX) program, which used Northrop’s Tacit Blue stealth demonstrator , equipped with a special low probability of intercept radar that reduced the chances the enemy would detect the aircraft, to explore the idea of low observable platform that could operate for long periods in heavily defended areas and spot and track enemy forces. That heavily classified project ran in parallel to the public Pave Mover radar program, which eventually evolved into the main sensor on the E-8C. A view of the underside of the Tactic Blue stealth demonstrator., USAF/Northrop/Public Domain The Air Force has already disclosed the existence of Lockheed Martin’s RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone and experts widely believe the service has since acquired a larger, higher-flying, and more capable low-observable unmanned aircraft from Northrop Grumman, commonly referred to as the RQ-180 . Both aircraft likely carry radars with both synthetic aperture imaging and GMTI functionality or have the option to do so as necessary. At the tactical level, this type of sensor is particularly well suited to persistent surveillance missions to record “patterns of life” of particular individuals or groups of individuals to help determine the best time to strike them or conduct a physical raid. One or more Sentinels performed that task covertly over Pakistan in the lead up to the operation that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. But a larger stealthy sensor platform able to carry a larger, more powerful radar could offer much more capability than that, conducting long-endurance missions to collect radar imagery and other data, monitoring enemy movements across a wide area deep inside hostile territory with a low likelihood of detection. This in turn could give air and ground commanders a much better picture of the overall battlefield and an opponent’s activities, even in denied areas. The up-coming B-21 Raider stealth bomber’s high-altitude design points to the possibility that it could function as a penetrating sensor node in addition to its primary strike mission , too. It could also serve as a more survivable link between stealthy drones and other aircraft or troops on the ground compared to the existing bizjet-based E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft or the BACN-equipped EQ-4B Global Hawk drone, but those capabilities are likely to come well after the first Raiders enter service in or around 2025. There are almost certainly other manned or unmanned low-observable aircraft in the classified space that might be able to perform some of these battlefield functions in the near- or mid-term time frames, too. An E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node aircraft., BACN The new or improved sensors and data links the Air Force develops for its existing mix of platforms could easily end up on any future low-observable sensor platform, as well. General Holmes already indicated that this might be possible with the GMTI-capable radar Northrop Grumman has been working on as part of the now dead JSTARS replacement effort. “That radar is kind of a modular radar,” he said at the Air Warfare Symposium, according to Defense News . “It’s built on taking modules and adding them together. So I think there may be uses for that radar.” The Northrop Grumman video below from 2012 depicts its plans for a new, modular radar system for the JSTARS aircraft. Northrop Grumman had designed the original JSTARS radar system and continues to be a leader in these types of ground surveillance sensors. The company is already developing a Long Range Radar , or LRR, to either supplement or supplant its AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER) for the U.S. Army . Both of these systems are fast-scanning active electronically scanned array units with synthetic aperture imaging and GMTI capabilities. Either would be a good fit for the Air Force’s present plans to add an unspecified “dismount radar” to the MQ-9. However, none of these are low probability of intercept optimized radars, which would be essential for an aircraft operating in a low observable configuration. Of course, it is very possible that Northrop Grumman, or another defense contractor, has already developed an more appropriate sensor for the RQ-170, RQ-180, or other classified platforms that it could use as a starting point or port over as is to any new stealth platform. Again, there’s the distinct possibility that the Air Force has more options in the classified domain, both with regards to sensors and the equipment and software necessary to fuse and distribute that information in near real time across the battlespace. Advanced battle management systems might even be able to serve as central control point for distributed groups of manned and unmanned aircraft, helping to feed instructions to semi-autonomous drones while parsing the data they collect for dissemination to other nodes. On the sidelines of the Air Force Association’s main conference in September 2017, Lockheed Martin’s Jack O’Banion, the Vice President of Strategy and Customer Requirements, Advanced Development Programs, told Defense News reporter Aaron Mheta that his company had taken some systems from its top secret projects and integrated them into their JSTARS replacement pitch, which used a modified Bombardier Global Express 6000 bizjet. With Northrop Grumman and Raytheon battling over who would build the plane’s main radar system at the time and using a commercial aircraft as the underlying platform, it’s more likely he was talking about the aircraft’s networking connectivity or other data processing tools. A view of some of the workstations on the present E-8C JSTARS aircraft., USAF Non-stealthy aircraft will still have an important role in any distributed concept, too. Having a broad range of sensors and battle management systems available will allow the Air Force to provide critical coverage in both the most contested environments and less contested ones simultaneously, and in cooperation with other services, producing as complete a picture of the battlespace as possible. All told, it appears increasingly likely that the Air Force’s plan to upgrade its existing platforms to take over various parts of the JSTARS mission is just one part of the larger puzzle. The service itself seems skeptical that this will offer a realistic solution to provide these vital capabilities in a high-threat conflict environment against a near-peer opponent. With the JSTARS replacement effort now officially dead, we’ll be keeping our eyes out for more hints about the exciting possibility that the Air Force is really working toward one or more penetrating, low-observable sensor platforms as it revamps how it performs the BMC2 mission.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2019",India Upends Its Single-Engine Fighter Competition and Will Also Consider Twin-Engine Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India has reportedly halted its plans to purchase nearly 115 single-engine fighter jets in order to reassess its requirements and open the tender up to twin-engine designs. The decision will delay purchases of any aircraft for at least two more years and will have significant ramifications for Lockheed Martin, which increasingly appeared to be the favorite with its F-16IN Viper under the existing terms, as well the Indian Air Force. On Feb. 23, 2018, The Times of India first revealed the new course of action, citing anonymous sources, which Indian online outlet DefenseNews.in also reported afterwards. The competition, which could have been worth up $18 billion, has already been going on since 2016 with Lockheed Martin’s F-16IN, an advanced India-specific version of the company’s F-16 Block 70 , and Saab’s Gripen-E being the only two contenders. This tender followed another failed deal to purchase new fighters that had collapsed the year before. “The original plan placed an unnecessary restriction on only single-engine fighters, which limited the competition to just two jets [the F-16IN and Gripen-E],” an unnamed individual told The Times . “The aim is to increase the contenders and avoid needless allegations later.” Exactly what potential allegations this individual might have been referring to is unclear. But India has struggled to procure new fighter jets over the past two decades and Indian authorities are undoubtedly keen to avoid a repeat of the failed Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft competition, also known as the MMCRA or MCRA. Saab’s Gripen-E., Saab That tender, which could have been worth approximately $20 billion and formally began in 2007, had been open to all fighter jet designs, regardless of engine configuration. India picked France’s Dassault Rafale , a twin-engine fighter, as the winner, but the actual contract quickly became mired in disputes over local production or assembly of the planes and India finally backed out completely in 2015. Reopening the tender to twin-engine fighters will almost certainly mean that many of the former MMRCA contenders will submit new offers. The most likely entrants will be American manufacturer Boeing with its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , the Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon , and one or more Russian aircraft, such as the MiG-35 Fulcrum or Su-35 Flanker-E . Broadening the competition would definitely make a certain amount of sense. After protracted negotiations, India is on track to acquire 36 Rafales for the country’s Air Force as part of limited, interim purchase. The first of those fighters are supposed to arrive some time in 2019, but the deal remains mired in controversy . A Dassault Rafale., Ian Hanning/Pool/Sipa USA via AP The Indian Navy is also in the market for new jets to embark on its upcoming fleet of new aircraft carriers . Super Hornet, Rafale, the MiG-29K, all twin-engine designs, as well as a single-engine navalized Gripen-E known as Sea Gripen, are presently competing for that contract. In 2016, the service rejected a proposal to purchase a carrier-borne version of the notoriously under-performing indigenously developed Tejas fighter jet . It is also reportedly increasingly unhappy with the performance of its existing Russian-made MiG-29Ks. Having Air Force and Navy units flying the same aircraft, or similar variants with a high commonality between airframe components and mission systems, could help reduce logistics and other sustainment costs. It could potentially help offset any higher costs associated with operating a twin-engine versus a single engine design, as well. Boeing and Dassault seem most poised to benefit from the changes to the competition’s requirements. As noted already, India is already in talks to buy dozens of Rafales and the navalized version of aircraft has a well established service record of carrier operations with the French Navy. The navalized Rafale M launches from the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle ., AP In August 2017, Boeing also announced it had used simulations to demonstrate that the Super Hornet could operate from India’s existing and planned short-takeoff but arrested recovery (STOBAR) aircraft carriers, as well as its future catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) ships. At the time, the company’s Vice President of the Super Hornet Program, Dan Gillian also made it clear that any Indian aircraft would almost certainly benefit from the U.S. Navy Block III upgrade project . The U.S. Navy’s aircraft will also have conformal fuel tanks to extend their range and free up space for additional under wing stores, modernized electronic warfare countermeasures, and improved avionics and larger digital cockpit displays. The final iterations might also have certain stealthy components , including an enclosed, aerodynamic weapons pod. This could make the jets particularly attractive to India, which is reportedly interested in joining the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, but has not yet gotten approval from the U.S. government. Indian authorities are also reportedly close to scrapping a joint fifth generation fighter project with Russia over the disappointing progress of the Su-57 stealth fighter , also known as the T-50 or PAK FA. An artist’s conception of a F/A-18F Block III Super Hornet with the conformal fuel tanks and other improvements., Boeing The biggest challenge for any competitor, as it has long been, will be meeting the Indian government’s requirements for technology transfer and industrial cooperation. For India, the fighter deal is as much about improving its domestic defense industrial capacity as it is about acquiring modern aircraft. This rebooted competition could upend the partnerships that both Lockheed Martin and Saab had announced with local firms as part of their bids for the existing contract. In June 2017, Lockheed Martin had announced a particularly attractive arrangement with Indian industrial consortium Tata, stating that if its F-16IN won it would establish a shared production line in the country to make the jets for the Indian Air Force and use that assembly line to build additional aircraft for export elsewhere. It was also considering working with Tata to build F-16 components even if the contract fell through , though. But whatever happens and whatever benefits there are to be had from reframing the competition, the Indian Air Force is unlikely to be thrilled at the prospect of having to wait at least two more years for the jets. The service first identified a requirement for nearly 130 modern fighters in 2001 . Since then, India’s aging fleets of Soviet and other Cold War-era fighters and multi-role combat aircraft have only become less airworthy. The country’s press has dubbed the remaining MiG-21s and -27s in particular as “ flying coffins ” and “ widow makers ” due to regular crashes that often claim the lives of the pilots. Indian firefighters hose down the wreckage of a MiG-27 after a crash in 2016., Ramji Vyas/Hindustan Times/Sipa via AP Those planes are among the ones the Indian Air Force is most eager to replace. The country is investigating upgrade programs for other older types, including the Anglo-French Jaguar jet combat aircraft. India’s Air Force is already well short of the total number of combat aircraft it says are necessary to maintain a credible defense against its most likely opponents, such as China , which continues to grow its own advanced military capabilities , and long-time regional rival Pakistan . The country’s Cabinet Committee on Security has laid out requirements for the service to have 42 squadrons of combat aircraft, but at present it only has 31 . This is down from 33 in 2017. The purchases of foreign fighter jets could become even more important if the domestic Tejas project suffers any more delays or other setbacks. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited expects to receive a formal deal for more than 80 Tejas Mk 1A aircraft some time in 2018, but that version of the jet has yet to fly at all. The Indian government will need to ensure this new competition leads to the delivery of actual planes if it wants to prevent the Air Force’s capabilities from slipping any further. Without the new fighters, a December 2017 report to the country’s parliament warned that the service could have just 16 squadrons of combat aircraft of any type by 2032.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",African Firm Has Big Hopes For Rebranded Bronco II Surveillance Plane In Americas Market,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new company called Bronco Combat Systems, or BCS USA, a joint venture between South Africa’s Paramount Group International and American defense contractor Fulcrum Concepts, has unveiled a new light attack aircraft it calls the Bronco II, an homage to the old OV-10 Bronco . The partnership hopes it can break into an increasingly saturated market of modified trainer , utility , and agricultural aircraft with a design it says was purpose built for limited conflicts and low-threat environments. While BCS has yet to release any specifics about the Bronco II’s capabilities or performance, it is clearly a derivative of the earlier Advanced High Performance Reconnaissance Light Aircraft, or AHRLAC . Paramount began development of that aircraft, also known as the Mwari, in cooperation with South African aviation firm Aerosud in 2009 and the initial prototype made its first flight five years later. The lead engineers responsible for the Rooivalk attack helicopter had joined together with individuals who had worked on South Africa’s upgraded Mirage III-based Cheetah fighter jet and other aerospace projects to form Aerosud in 1990. “This is not simply an armed variant of a civilian crop-duster or a modified training aircraft,” Paramount Group International Chairman Ivor Ichikowitz said according to the BCS USA press release. “Every inch of this aircraft is designed for [a] purpose – specifically for the kind of asymmetrical warfare that sophisticated military forces are now being asked to conduct.” At its most basic, the Bronco II is a pusher engine aircraft with a single turboprop engine in the rear of the center fuselage, as was the AHRLAC. Combined with a cockpit with a large canopy with minimal framing, the crew of two, sitting in ejection seats, has good views forward and to the sides, but limited visibly to the rear. One of the photoshopped images depicting the Bronco II in US Marine Corps markings that BCS USA distributed in its initial press release., BCS USA The aircraft also has a high wing and twin boom and tail configuration that is vaguely reminiscent of the long out of production North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco , which, as we noted, provided the inspiration for name of the plane and the joint venture company. The artwork BCS USA released along with its press statement are photoshopped images of one of the prototypes, with the civil registration ZU-PDM, carrying the markings of the U.S. Marine Corps, which was the last branch of the U.S. military to actively operate the OV-10. It’s not clear how much the final Bronco II might differ from the existing AHRLAC prototypes, if at all. The first iterations of the aircraft were relatively light and compact with a wingspan of less than 40 feet, shorter than that of an MQ-1 Predator drone , and an empty weight of less than 4,500 pounds, less than half that of an A-29 Super Tucano light attack plane. This picture shows an ex-US Marine Corps OV-10 that subsequently went to NASA for flight test purposes, clearly showing its twin-boom configuration. , NASA Paramount said the initial versions, which had a top speed of approximately 315 miles per hour, could stay aloft for seven to 10 hours at a time and had a maximum total range of more than 1,300 miles, but this did not necessarily reflect an aircraft fully loaded with weapons and other additional mission systems on board. Different weapon fits and other payloads could easily limit that performance. As such, the South African firm initially pitched the aircraft as a cost-effective alternative intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform for smaller countries compared to larger, more complex drones. Now, BCS USA is heavily promoting the idea of the plane as “hybrid” design capable of performing those functions, as well as light attack and close air support missions. The original promotional shot of AHRLAC prototype ZU-PDM., Paramount Group This has been in the planning stages for some time. In 2016, Boeing announced it would help integrate weapons and other systems onto the AHRLAC and bring it to the U.S. market. What happened to that deal and whether Boeing is still a part of the project is unclear. At the time of writing the company has not yet responded to our request for clarification. However, it does appear that Fulcrum Concepts , a smaller defense contractor that provides various aviation design and modification services, now has responsibility for adding weapons and other equipment to the aircraft. As a light attack aircraft, the AHRLAC was supposed to be able to carry various different kinds of weapons, including precision guided munitions, on up to six under wing pylons, as well as have provisions for an internal 20mm cannon. There do not appear to be any pictures of the AHRLAC prototypes carrying actual weaponry. The Bronco II artwork shows the aircraft carrying a pair of Belgian-designed FN HMP .50 caliber machine gun pods and four South African-made Mokopa guided anti-tank missiles, which are available with laser, millimeter wave radar, and infrared guidance options. Fulcrum Concepts presently offers a weapons management system it says is compatible with the AGM-114 Hellfire laser-guided missile and the smaller AGM-176 Griffin GPS- and laser-guided missile, as well as various unguided weapons and gun pods. Earlier concept art of the armed AHRLAC aircraft, or Mwari., Paramount Group In an armed reconnaissance or pure intelligence and surveillance roles, the planes would also be able to carry sensors or other equipment in a modular bay in the fuselage behind the cockpit. A prototype AHRLAC did appear at the Africa Aerospace and Defense show in South Africa in September 2016 equipped with an Airbus Argos II electro-optical and infrared video camera turret mounted on its nose. It also carried a Thales Anvi infrared line scanner camera and GEW Technologies radio direction finding system, which can located and track hostile communication signals, in the payload bay. The pilot could use a helmet-mounted sighting system to direct the nose turret and the line scanner fed into a display in the rear cockpit. Fulcrum Concepts also offers what it calls the Fulcrum Battlestation, which it could potentially configure to fit inside the new Bronco II. At that event in South Africa, Paramount also told reporters that it had test fitted a sensor turret in the payload bay and fitted the aircraft with a radar warning receiver to the alert the pilots to hostile threats. The prototype did not appear to have any actual countermeasures systems, such as decoy flares. An AHRLAC prototype with a sensor turret in the nose., Paramount Group As of 2017, Paramount said it had already sold two AHRLACs to unnamed customers and could support production of two planes per month at its factory in Wonderboom, South Africa. It’s not entirely clear who BCS USA might be expecting to sell U.S.-made Bronco IIs to, though. In a statement to Flightglobal , the joint venture company said that the faux Marine Corps livery in its marketing literature did not mean it was looking to sell the aircraft to that service or that it had expressed an interest in the plane already. While the joint venture could be hoping to find a way into the U.S. Air Force’s light attack aircraft experiment, it missed the first round of that evaluation. The service is running another round of tests , but only with the Textron AT-6 Wolverine and Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corporation’s A-29 Super Tucano, and it’s unclear when, if ever , it might actually buy any such planes. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is running a separate light attack aircraft effort , which is focused more on the particular systems that would go into such an aircraft rather than any particular airframe. BCS USA’s press release did appear to speak directly to the operational capabilities that a pair of modified OV-10G+ Broncos already demonstrated during a SOCOM-sponsored field test in Iraq in 2015. “The aircraft is a purpose-built, sophisticated airborne Find/Fix/Finish/Exploit/Analyze (F3EA) system able to operate for extended periods in remote theaters with minimal infrastructure and a small logistics and maintenance footprint,” the statement says. “The Bronco II operates at a fraction of the procurement and lifecycle cost of an aircraft with similar mission applications and capabilities.” One of the modified OV-10G+ Broncos that went to Iraq in 2015. , Nick Thomas During their deployment to Iraq , the OV-10G+ aircraft each had just one dedicated maintainer, with the crew assisting in basic maintenance and other support activities. This allowed SOCOM’s task force in the country to move the planes around quickly to where they would be most useful in “F3EA” missions focused on locating, tracking and striking individual ISIS terrorists. But from what we know about its capabilities so far, the Bronco II still appears best suited to offer a cheaper and more readily accessible alternative to medium-range, long-endurance drones, such as the MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper. It offers more capability than smaller, tactical drones, as well, but would still be cheaper to operate, especially during longer duration missions, than more traditional light turboprop surveillance aircraft. The aircraft’s cockpit configuration gives its on board crew a higher degree of situational awareness over those unmanned aircraft, too. As such, the Bronco II might be an option for other U.S. government agencies , as well, especially those involved in domestic and overseas counter-drug efforts. At the federal level, Customs and Border Protection , the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Drug Enforcement Administration , and even the U.S. Marshals , among others, fly a variety of manned surveillance aircraft with electro-optical and infrared cameras and signals intelligence suites to patrol America’s borders and monitor criminal activity at home and abroad. Some state law enforcement agencies have also begun to purchased manned surveillance aircraft and small unmanned aircraft for these missions. The U.S. State Department’s own air wing regularly partners with foreign law enforcement agencies conducting counter-drug missions, often planning to eventually gift surveillance and utility aircraft it operates to those groups, an arrangement that could be a particularly good fit for the Bronco II. A US State Department helicopter escorts an armored crop duster on an counter-drug mission in Colombia in 2003., DoS And by having a U.S.-based manufacturing facility and an expanded American supply chain for weapons and other mission systems, BCS USA will also be able to pitch the Bronco II as an option for any American ally or partner looking to purchase or otherwise acquire light attack planes through U.S. government military assistance programs. The aircraft could be particularly attractive to countries the United States won’t allow to buy more sophisticated drones. The U.S. military has already facilitated the delivery of A-29s , AT-802L Longsword modified agricultural aircraft, and armed versions of the Cessna C-208 Grand Caravan to other countries. It, along with the U.S. State Department, has also helped deliver unarmed C-208s and other light aircraft to foreign military and other state security forces. Independently, American-based firms, such as IOMAX, have also delivered various light attack aircraft to customers overseas. With such a crowded market already, the BCS USA is clearly betting that the Bronco II’s distinctive, clean-sheet design will help set it apart from the competition . There is a chance now that the old Bronco may return to the battlefield, at least in spirit, either with a branch of the U.S. military or one of America’s allies or partners.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 16, 2019",Did Russia Just Send Su-57 Stealth Fighters to Syria? (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Unverified pictures and video footage has begun to circulate on social media purporting to show a pair of Russian Su-57 fighters , also known as the PAK FA and T-50, touching down at the country’s Khmeimim air base in Syria’s Latakia province. The Kremlin has already used the Syrian conflict as an excuse to demonstrate new and advanced weaponry and even if this video turns out to not show operations in Syria, it is likely only a matter of time before the aircraft touch down in the country. In one of the video clips, which first emerged online on Feb. 21, 2018, an Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jet , which the Russians have already deployed to Syria, is also seen flying nearby. Additional unconfirmed reports said that the Su-57s were part a larger group of Russian aircraft arriving in the country, including four additional Su-35s, four Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft, and an A-50U Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft, all types the Russians have previously deployed to the country. Still, this would be a major deployment for Russia, coming after Putin claimed total victory over terrorists in the country during a December 2017 visit where he also announced his country would begin drawing down its military presence in Syria. It’s not clear what might have prompted the deployment of the stealthy fighters, which remain in the development stage. As of January 2018, Russia had received less than a dozen flyable pre-production prototypes and the design has suffered repeated setbacks . The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has also rightly called into question just how low-observable the aircraft really are based on number of specific features. The aircraft’s appearance in Syria would follow the loss of an Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft to a rebel shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile in Idlib province earlier in February 2018, as well as an unprecedented mass drone attack on the Khmeimim outpost and the Russian naval facility in Syria’s port city of Tartus the month before. It also comes after a steadily increasing number of aggressive interactions between Russia’s tactical aircraft and U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over eastern Syria . If the Kremlin has sent the Su-57s to Syria it could further complicate those situations since American pilots have no actual experience, beyond intelligence assessments and possibly simulations, with how the Russian aircraft appears on their sensors and at what ranges, what the jet’s actual combat capabilities are, and what threat they might pose. At the same time, of course, it could give the United States an excellent opportunity to gather new information about the fighters, especially depending on what sensors they activate or if they fly in a full low-observable configuration during missions. Although it could inject a bit more uncertainty into the air war over Syria, a pair of adolescent Su-57s, almost certainly with limited operational capabilities, will be hard pressed to change the balance of power in the conflict broadly. Russian combat aircraft in Syria have been primarily conducting indiscriminate air strikes against population centers using unguided weaponry, as well as conducting close air support missions for Syrian troops and other forces aligned with dictator Bashar Al Assad . But if it turns out that Russia has indeed sent some of these aircraft to Syria, the main underlying reasoning could easily not be tactical at all. Since Russia first entered the Syrian conflict in 2015, it has exploited the country as a proving ground and marketing showcase for new or otherwise untested advanced weapons, many of which don’t necessarily fit the mission requirements . Russian forces have hit targets in Syria with long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles that it had not previously had an opportunity to employ in an actual combat setting. It has deployed its latest Flanker fighter jet derivatives , as well as the Su-34, and sent the Tu-95MS Bear and Tu-160M Blackjac k strategic bombers on long endurance strike missions. It has also employed a variety of other specialized aircraft, including the A-50U airborne early warning plane and its new Tu-214R spy planes . On the ground there are S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, ground-based cruise missiles , and various electronic warfare systems , among other assets Russia has had few chances to use under actual operational conditions. The Russian Navy’s lone aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , even made a brief, if embarrassingly deployment to support operations in Syria. The Kremlin hasn’t hidden its true objectives in this regard, either. Senior Russian officials often boast about how Syria has demonstrated its advanced military capabilities, despite this being a debatable assertion at best. “According to the Defense Ministry, 215 up-to-date and dramatically new types of weapons were used. Many samples of current military equipment were put to test [in Syria],” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January 2018 . “”The use of our weapons in Syria has convincingly proven that by its armament the Russian military is among the world’s leading armies.” One of the pre-production Su-57 prototypes., Aktug Ates via Wikimedia If nothing else, just sending the Su-57s to Syria could offer Russia a chance to “prove” it also has an operational fifth generation fighter jet, especially after years of delays and embarrassing accidents, regardless of whether or not that claim is true. It would allow the Kremlin to present itself as being on an equal footing as the Americans with their F-22s in the eastern portion of the country, even though two stealth fighters of dubious quality would hardly be a match for the Raptors, as well. With all that in mind, it’s hard to imagine that the Russians wouldn’t consider sending the jets to Syria at some point in the future. In the meantime, we will be sure to keep an eye out for any confirmation that the Su-57s are in Syria now and we’ll continue to update this post as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 11:30pm PST— This image/footage analysis seems to confirm that the videos were indeed taken in Syria as the jets made a landing at Russia’s master air base located south of Latakia: Update: 2/22/2018 10:25am PST- Despite the growing evidence that the two Su-57s are indeed in Syria, Russian officials have yet to either publicly announce the deployment or issue a formal denial. The country’s state and quasi-state media both appear to be curiously shying away from making any definitive statements on the matter, as well. “This is [a question] for the Defense Ministry,” Dmitry Peskov, President Putin’s personal spokesperson told state-run outlet Sputnik on Feb. 22, 2018. “The president is the commander-in-chief, but this issue is still more within the responsibility of the Defense Ministry.” There is no indication that Sputnik subsequently made any effort to reach out to the country’s Ministry of Defense, though. RT, a private outlet widely associated with the Kremlin, did not include any official statements in its story . Both of these news agencies routinely interview Russian government officials and publish their comments on the record.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 10, 2019",Finland’s Getting Ice-Breaking Missile Corvettes With Serious Air Defense Abilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. State Department recently approved the potential sale to Finland of more than $800 million worth of RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, Mk 41 vertical launch systems , and other associated items. Depending on how that country decides to proceed with its Squadron 2020 naval modernization program, some of those systems could go into a new class of ice-breaking multi-purpose corvettes, as well as end up on older ships as part of various planned upgrade projects. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. military’s main foreign military sales office, announced the possible arms packages in three separate notices in February 2018. The announcements say that the 100 RGM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II+ Extended Range missiles, plus another dozen older RGM-84L-4s that Finland would upgrade to that standard itself using conversion kits, would arm its existing Hamina -class missile boats and shore-based coastal defense batteries. The 68 RIM-162s, also known as ESSMs, and the four Mk 41s would be part of the armament package on the four all-new corvettes the country is building under the Squadron 2020 plan. It is important to note, however, that U.S. government approval does not mean a country has agreed to purchase the weapons or other systems in question. Finland is in the middle of a competition to select a new anti-ship missile to replace its existing Swedish-made RBS-15 Mk IIs and Boeing’s Harpoon is just one potential option. The other contenders are the RBS-15 Mk III+ from Sweden’s Saab Bofors Dynamics, the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) from Norway’s Kongsberg, and latest iteration of the European missile consortium MBDA’s Exocet MM40 . The same is true, perhaps even more so, with regards to Finland’s future multi-purpose corvettes. The Finnish Ministry of Defense is pursuing a two-track plan to develop and purchase those ships, having hired the country’s own Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC) to craft the basic hullform in April 2017. The Finnish Hamina -class missile boat Tornio , which could receive Harpoon anti-ship missiles as part of a ongoing upgrade program., MKFI via Wikimedia In 2018, Finland expects to award a separate contract for the systems that will go into those ships. Germany’s Atlas Elektronik , the Canadian subsidiary of American firm Lockheed Martin, and Swedish defense contractor Saab are bidding on that deal. Atlas Elektronik and Saab both already supply systems for various Finnish Navy ships. How RMC defines the basic ship design and its capabilities is likely to have impact on whether or not the new corvettes will feature the Mk 41s, which can hold four ESSMs quad-packed in each launch cell. The Sylver vertical launch system from France’s DCNS is another option, but would require Finland to also choose MDBA’s Aster surface-to-air missile as the ship’s primary air defense weapon. And though the Finnish Ministry of Defense’s plan does call for the new corvettes to have a robust local air defense capability, it won’t necessary be the main focus for the engineers at RMC. “In the initial phase it was recognized that this type of new vessel with the required capabilities did not exist,” according to an official primer on the Squadron 2020 project. “The vessels on the market were not capable of mine-laying and navigating in ice,” it continues. “For a warship, the requirements arising from mine-laying and winter navigation are rare in the international context but they are essential for the Finnish Navy to fulfil its tasks.” A rudimentary breakdown of the systems the Finnish Ministry of Defense wants on the new Squadron 2020 corvettes., Finnish Ministry of Defense Finland’s shoreline is entirely along the Baltic Sea, much of which is frozen over or otherwise full of potentially dangerous ice floes during the winter. Some of the Finnish Navy’s ships, such as its two aging Hämeenmaa -class minelayers , do have a limited ice-breaking capability, but its smaller missile boats, such as the Hamina -class, have much more difficulty operating under those conditions. “The endurance and sea-going capabilities significantly limit the performance of the Hamina -class … in ice conditions and during rough sea,” the Finnish Ministry of Defense’s guide to the Squadron 2020 program notes. On top of the ice, “gale-force winds and the resulting wave heights restrict the operation of light naval units on the open sea. The significant wave height may reach six meters and more annually in the northern part of the Baltic Sea.” The Baltic is already an extremely confined space without those environmental hazards and an all-weather ice-capable warship would be invaluable for the Finnish Navy. Finland isn’t alone in recognizing the importance of having combat vessels that can operate in extreme cold weather conditions, either. Russia, Finland’s most likely potential opponent in the region, is also developing ice-breaking anti-ship missile armed corvettes , though it will most likely deploy to support the country’s expanding military operations the Arctic . An artist’s rendering of Russia’s future Project 23550 Ice -class missile armed, ice-capable corvette., Pella Shipyard Russia It’s the constraints of the Baltic that also make maritime mine warfare particularly attractive in both offensive and defensive scenarios. This is again especially true with regards to Russia, which has significant naval assets based in St. Petersburg and elsewhere. Already historical antagonists, relations between the two countries have been steadily worsening in recent years, with Finland increasing its cooperation with the United States and other members of the NATO alliance and Russian officials threatening to retaliate economically and militarily in response. Finnish authorities already accuse Russian military aircraft of routinely and provocatively violating their airspace. In a naval engagement, Russian ships and submarines would have to transit through the Gulf of Finland – less than 100 miles across at its widest point – to get into the Baltic Sea proper and Finnish mines could easily constrain their movements. It could also limit the ability of naval reinforcements from Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave to the south or elsewhere to rush into the area in a crisis. As such, minelaying is an extremely important capability for the Finns, who have various dedicated minelayers already in service. In addition, depth charge racks on its small missile boats, they can also deploy mines. The primary type in Finnish service is Patria’s Sea Mine 2000 , which reportedly has features that make it hard to detect and multiple sensors – possibly including acoustic, magnetic, and other types – to both detect potential targets and discriminate between them to focus on the most valuable ships in a task force. Patria’s Sea Mine 2000., MKFI via Wikimedia Finland does want the new corvettes to be truly multi-mission capable though, including a robust local air defense capability, which it plans to integrate with the countries overarching air defense command and control network, as well as the ability to conduct anti-ship and anti-submarine operations. Though RMC has not yet revealed the exact size and shape of the ship, existing requirements call for a vessel with both anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes , and a main gun, possibly the same Bofors 57mm automatic cannon found on the Hamina -class missile boats and the Hämeenmaa -class minelayers. The vessels will almost certainly have smaller cannons or machine guns for close-in defense. Coupled with the naval mines, those stand-off anti-ship and anti-aircraft capabilities could help improve the Finnish military’s own freedom to maneuver in and around the Baltic Sea and its adjacent littoral areas. It would also force the Russians, or any other potential opponent , to take those threats into consideration, potentially limiting their ability to operate in the region or otherwise disrupting their plans during an actual crisis. The Finnish Defense Ministry video below shows how Hamina -class missile boats would cooperate with land- and air-based assets to defend Finland’s Baltic shoreline in a crisis. The future Squadron 2020 ships should be significantly more capable. A radar with air and surface search modes, a towed sonar system, electro-optical sensors, and electronic intelligence equipment will serve to spot and track targets, as well as give the ships important surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities and improve their ability to operate in the Baltic Sea’s often poor weather. Deck-mounted launchers will be able to launch anti-missile decoys for self defense and could do double duty as a way to fire rocket-propelled depth charges at hostile submarines. It’s very likely the ships will also carry some form of electronic support measures and electronic countermeasures to defend against enemy jamming systems or other electronic warfare attacks. The vessels’ configuration will also have to take into account the increasingly likely possibility of operating in a GPS-denied environment , as well. Finland hopes the four new vessels will begin entering service sometime in the 2020s, effectively replacing the four older Rauma -class missile boats, as well as the pair of Hämeenmaa -class minelayers. The four upgraded Hamina -class with their new anti-ship missiles will remain in service, as well, with the two types forming the bulk of the Finnish Navy’s combat capability though to at least into the 2030s. If RMC’s design proves successful, Finland might also be able to be able to find foreign customers, including elsewhere in Scandinavia, who have similar requirements for a cold-weather capable combat vessel. But the new Squadron 2020 corvettes, with or without American-made Mk 41 vertical launch systems and RIM-162 surface-to-air missiles, will be the only Finnish Navy warships able to conduct year-round operations in the Baltic, which will be vital capability for Finland to have for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Claims US Coalition “Mystery Helicopters” Supplying Arms To ISIS In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian government is continuing to demand the United States answer its questions regarding unsubstantiated rumors of unmarked helicopters delivering weapons or other aid to terrorist groups, including ISIS, in Northern Afghanistan. In line with a well established policy of responding to allegations about its own activities with equal or more sinister counter-claims , Russia is advancing this conspiracy theory to distract from questions about its own connections to Afghan militants, including the Taliban . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that the U.S. government should address the accusations after meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, in Moscow on Feb. 20, 2018. The United States has accused both of those countries of either actively or tacitly backing the Taliban and other insurgents opposed to the government in Kabul and its American benefactors. “We still expecting from our American colleagues an answer to the repeatedly raised questions, questions that arose on the basis of public statements made by the leaders of some Afghan provinces, that unidentified helicopters, most likely helicopters to which NATO in one way or another is related, fly to the areas where the insurgents are based, and no one has been able to explain the reasons for these flights yet,” Lavrov stated. “In general they [the United States] try to avoid answers to these legitimate questions.” The original source of the story of the mysterious helicopters appears to be comments that Mohammad Zahir Wahdat, governor of Afghanistan’s northern Sar-e Pol province, made in local media in May 2017. He claimed that unmarked military helicopters had touched down briefly in a known militant stronghold, but that this had happened at night and none of the Afghan security forces in the area had been able to take pictures or record video of the alleged incident. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, right, and Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif speak to the press in Moscow on Feb. 20, 2018., Mikhail Tereschenko/TASS At least according to the English-language reports, Zahir Wahdat did not directly implicate any party in particular or give any indication of where the helicopters came from or headed after they left, besides that they went north. Though there is no evidence that they were American helicopters, it’s worth noting up front that the idea that the mere act of any military aircraft landing in an area with a known terrorist presence automatically indicates collusion between those parties is, by itself, patently absurd. However, a subsequent statement from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs later in May 2017, followed that improbable chain of logic, containing small, but important embellishments , including that the helicopters had flown to the main international airport in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif to the northeast, which also happens to host a major base belonging to the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan. Russian state and quasi-state media continued to run numerous reports after that, often citing unnamed locals, saying that similar unidentified helicopters had appeared in militant-controlled areas in neighboring Faryab and Jowzjan provinces, both of which border Turkmenistan, and implying that they had actually dropped off ISIS fighters or supplies for the terrorists. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s release linked the events to another unconfirmed report that Afghan authorities in Sar-e Pol had arrested American military personnel attempting to sell weapons to ISIS-linked militants in the province, as well. The statement also insinuated that the United States had deliberately released a notorious ethnic Uzbek terrorist known as Azizullah . There does not appear to be any independent, English-language reports about the alleged arms deal or the additional allegation that the United States or someone else pressured local authorities into releasing those individuals and destroying evidence. Russia also claims that the U.S. military released Azizullah from its detention center at Bagram Airfield in 2016, despite both U.S. and Afghan authorities confirming that this infamous facility had ceased operations two years earlier. A map of Afghanistan’s provinces. Mazar-e-Sharif is the capital of Balkh province, which also borders Sar-e Pol., Golbez via Wikimedia “As a governor, I can say about the province of Darzab and Khoshtipe,” Moulavi Abdulhai Hayat, chair of the provincial council in Jowzjan, told Russian state-run outlet Sputnik in August 2017. “There were rumors about flights of unidentified helicopters in those places, but MPs [members of parliament] say that this is just rumors and nothing more.” Still, like any conspiracy theory, there may be an air of truth in these claims. It very possible that the U.S. special operations forces are operating discreetly in militant occupied areas in Northern Afghanistan and are employing helicopters with no obvious national markings to move around and resupply. They wouldn’t necessarily have had to be unmarked, either. At night especially, the markings on the black-painted helicopters from the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, or even the black writing on the service’s olive drab and tan -colored conventional helicopters, would have been hard to see, especially from far away. The unique paint schemes on the 160th’s aircraft are specifically to aid in hiding the aircraft in the dark. A new Mi-17 helicopter for Afghanistan’s Air Force arrives in the country unmarked in 2009., USN American special operations could be working with local militias, who often have dubious allegiances , as part of those activities, as well. Zahir Wahdat, himself a warlord turned politician , could have been looking to label his political opponents as anti-government militants with his original comments, accusations that could well be credible to some degree . As part of new surge of U.S.-led activity in Afghanistan as a whole, earlier in February 2018, American forces have launched a flurry of air strikes against various targets along the country’s northern boundaries with both Tajikistan and China. It is easy to imagine that U.S. military personnel helped monitor insurgent and terrorist movements ahead of those operations, especially with reports last year that small pockets of militants had shifted their allegiances to ISIS . Members of the Afghan Local Police, a US-supported quasi-uniformed militia, during a village meeting Kapisa Province in 2013., US Army But much more importantly, the Russian accusations were an almost identical inverse of American-media reports suggesting the Kremlin might be actively involved in supporting militant groups in Northern Afghanistan. Zahir Wahdat made his remarks, but before Russia’s Foreign Ministry issued its statement in May 2017, Fox News reported that unmarked helicopters had been flying to known Taliban hideouts from Tajikistan, potentially implicating authorities in Moscow. Though it is clear that there is a steady flow of black market arms and other military equipment from Russia and former Soviet republics in Central Asia into Afghanistan, how actively involved Russia is or isn’t in that supply chain remains unclear. Though the Kremlin denies the allegations categorically, given its poor relations with the United States it has an obvious incentive to undermine American policy in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region. “I believe what Russia is attempting to do is they are attempting to be an influential party in this part of the world,” U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees all American military activities in the Middle East and Central Asia, told members of Congress in March 2017. “I think it is fair to assume they may be providing some sort of support to [the Taliban] in terms of weapons or other things that may be there.” US Army General Joseph Votel, left, walks with US Marine Corps Brigadier General Roger Turner, during a trip to Afghanistan in 2017., USMC If nothing else, the Russian accusations and their repeated demand for answers regarding events that may not even have occurred have only served to the muddy the waters. Sar-e Pol Governor Zahir Wahdat’s initial claims may have actually been about the sightings of helicopters zipping back and forth from Tajikistan, but now serve as the underlying basis for entirely opposite claims from the Kremlin. We’ve seen similarly dubious allegations steadily appearing elsewhere, as well, particularly regarding the U.S. government’s activities in Syria. Just in 2018, the Russian government has promoted a conspiracy theory that the United States was behind a mass drone attack on its outposts in Syria, as well as officials reiterating the claim that the U.S. military is shielding ISIS- and Al Qaeda-linked terrorists in the Rukban refugee camp near the Southern Syrian city of At Tanf. “Visits by jihadists who recover moral and physical strength are regularly observed both inside the al-Tanf zone and in the Rukban camp,” Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov said on Feb. 19, 2018. “Attacks on the rest of the Syrian territory have been carried out from there more than once.” It seems clear that militants do hold sway there, but American and Jordanian forces also treat it as a dangerous no-go area for fear of getting attacked. These new accusations notably come as it becomes increasingly apparent that Russian mercenaries , who may or may not be under the Kremlin’s direct control, have begun actively targeting American personnel in Syria and their local partners. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, right, and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem meet in Moscow in 2016., Vitaliy Belousov/Sputnik via AP Of course, the idea that the United States is actually the driving force behind ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria is a long-standing and completely unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that has been running for years. The Russian government has been happy to play into these beliefs on numerous occasions in the past . They regularly coincide with allegations from the United States or other western powers that the Kremlin is actively committing atrocities or is otherwise complicit in such crimes in countries such as Syria. What we’re seeing are deliberate information warfare tactics that Russia has made a hallmark of its new style of hybrid warfare more broadly. The claims are typically structured in such a way as to redirect focus on the Kremlin’s opponents, painting countries like the United States as the real villains and accusing them of being responsible for even more heinous acts. If Russia is driving Syrians into the arms of terrorists by facilitating the Syrian government’s mass slaughter of innocent civilians, then it is really the fault of the United States, who is propping up those groups in the first place – or so the cycle typically progresses. The Russian government’s arguments don’t even necessarily have to be convincing, just confusing and plausible enough to cast doubt on well documented events , such as the chemical weapons attack in the Syrian city of Khan Sheikhoun. From there, the Kremlin can readily amplify those viewpoints in various ways, especially through the use of spurious social media accounts . At a certain point, the spread of those ideas becomes more organic and difficult to separate from the original, state-sponsored propaganda. The use of these questionable allegations offers the Russian government an easy, low-risk, and relatively low-cost way to obfuscate what are often complicated situations to be with and do so in such a way that isn’t easy to for foreign governments to quickly counter. The burden of proof often falls on the U.S. government and others to refute the claims rather than for the Kremlin to substantiate them in any way. Until the United States finds an equally easy, quick, and reliable way to definitely reject these accusations, it seems clear that we’re only going to be seeing more of them as time goes on.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",We Now Know Exactly What Sensors the Army’s Powerful New RO-6A Spy Planes Will Carry,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, the U.S. Army is asking for more than $80 million to keep working on converting a number of de Havilland Dash-8-315 planes into RO-6A intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance aircraft. Thanks to a separate contracting announcement, we know they will each have a powerful combination of electro-optical, infrared , and hyperspectral cameras , wide-area surveillance systems , imaging radars , and signals intelligence gear when they start to enter service in 2020. On Feb. 5, 2018, the Army released a request for information regarding a potential contract to support the service’s existing fleet of de Havilland Dash-7-based EO-5C aircraft , as well as perform maintenance and other functions on the future RO-6As. As such, the documentation includes a breakdown of the specific systems on both types of aircraft to help prospective vendors gauge whether they have the requisite knowledge base to keep them airworthy and fully mission capable. In 2014, the Army began developing a plan to transition from the EO-5C, which it also calls the Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Multi-sensor (ARL-M), to the RO-6A, which it refers to as the Airborne Reconnaissance-Enhanced (ARL-E). The four engine EO-5Cs have been in service since the 1990s, but the Dash-7 airframe has been out of production since 1988, making the aircraft increasingly difficult to support. The twin engine Dash-8-315 is also out of production, but Canadian firm Bombardier continues to make other aircraft in this series , and therefore a number of common spare parts, making it a much more practical choice for the future. The plane’s Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 turboprops are each more than twice as powerful as the older PT6s on the EO-5Cs, which will make the RO-6A more capable and efficient despite having two fewer engines, as well. A Dash-8-315 Saturn Arch aircraft, which is set to become an RO-6A ARL-E., US Army In addition, the Army had previously hired contractors to operate Dash-8-based spy planes over Afghanistan and Iraq, which it subsequently purchased from those companies. Those aircraft, known by the program nicknames Saturn Arch and Desert Owl II , already have many systems in common with the service’s planned final sensor arrangement, making the full conversions to the RO-6A configuration less expensive and labor intensive than if the service started with a basic airframe. So, what will the new RO-6A carry with all of its extra power? The February 2018 contracting notice lists more than a dozen separate systems in total, which is significantly more capability in one package than either the ARL-M or the existing contractor-operated Dash-8 types. A breakdown of the systems on the existing Dash-8-315 Saturn Arch and EO-5C ARL-M aircraft, as well as the future RO-6A ARL-E planes., US Army Each ARL-E aircraft will have two camera turrets, an MX-20D and an MX-20HD, compared to one MX-15 series and one MX-20HD on the ARL-M. Both feature full-color electro-optical and infrared cameras. The MX-20D has a laser range finder and target designator, as well. The RO-6As will have Raytheon’s Airborne Cueing and Exploitation System-Hyperspectral (ACES Hy). The U.S. Air Force originally sponsored development of this sensor, which produces imagery that differentiates objects by their electromagnetic signature, making it possible to spot camouflaged or other hidden items, such as improvised explosive devices, which have a significantly different composition from their surroundings. An example of a conventional image on the left and a hyperspectral image of the same area on the right, showing chemical plumes, as seen through the camera system on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology (ASPECT) surveillance aircraft . , National Guard Bureau via FOIA On top of that, the ARL-E planes will have an OGSystems Performance-Enhanced Airborne Reconnaissance Low, or PeARL , a wide-area aerial surveillance system. This sensor features up to six individual cameras and can collect imagery across a 5,500-foot wide area as the aircraft cruises along at around 10,000 feet. As we at The War Zone often note , these wide-area sensors are important tools for monitoring activity across a broad portion of the battlespace and can allow intelligence analysts to retroactively trace enemy movements, potentially tracing them back to bases of operations or other points of interest. These multi-camera systems can also help collect information on a target’s “ patterns of life ” over time, helping determine when it might be best to try and strike or capture them without endangering innocent bystanders. An image taken with the latest version of the PeARL system., OGSystems The contractor-flown Saturn Arch aircraft had both ACES Hy and PeARL already, as well as two additional sensors, known as Big Green and the Mission Sensor System. The U.S. government crafted those systems in-house and the Army will not migrate them over to the RO-6A. We don’t know what these pieces of equipment were specifically, but at least one could be a laser imaging system with similar capabilities to the hyperspectral camera. Both almost certainly came from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), which managed the project before turning it over to the Army in 2013. According to the contracting notice, the ARL-E crews will be able to refine their searches and potentially cue the other sensors based on information from two separate Northrop Grumman imaging radars, the AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, or VADER, and the up-coming Long Range Radar (LRR). Since the LRR will use various VADER components and perform the same function, it is possible that the RO-6A will carry the AN/ZPY-5 first before replacing it with the new system. Northrop Grumman says that both units are fast-scanning active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars with synthetic aperture (SAR) and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) functionality. The system can penetrate cloud cover, smoke, dust and other obscurants that might blind the aircraft’s other cameras. The imagery above is an example of what the VADER system can do, with the red and green dots indicating contacts in motion. , DHS And while it can’t produce a moving video feed, it is possible to string multiple images along to track changes in a target’s activity, giving the plane’s another persistent wide-area surveillance capability. The Army also had VADER on one version of the smaller Beechcraft King Air-based MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System, or EMARSS , and you can read more about that particular sensor’s capabilities here . Rounding out the RO-6A’s sensor suite will be no less than six different signals intelligence systems, at least two of which will be able to detect and monitor enemy high frequency and very high frequency transmissions. Three more pieces of equipment come from DRT, a company that specializes in devices that mimic cellphone towers. These systems , commonly known as “ dirtboxes ” in reference to the firm’s name, can geo-locate a person’s position from their phone signal, while some variants can grab audio from calls and associated metadata. We don’t know what the sixth system, referred to as “PRISM 2.X/EDM-B,” does in particular. However, PRISM is a codename associated with a National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance project that also dealt with monitoring phone calls. It is possible that the system allows the aircraft to receive additional data straight from NSA databases to help geo-locate and monitor particular targets. Regardless, the full array of systems on the RO-6A almost certainly offers more capability than the single Diamondback communications intelligence system from BAE Systems on the older EO-5Cs. A slide from a briefing leaked to the public by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden showing a web interface for the NSA’s PRISM database, via Wikimedia Each one of the new planes will also carry various data links, including a satellite communications system, in order to beam the data from its various sensors back to ground stations for exploitation and other “customers” in near real time during operations. Those systems, and the control stations inside the aircraft, will run off of a standardized computer architecture the Army calls Big Iron that should better allow the service to update software and integrate new or improved sensors in the future. The Army currently plans to have the first of its converted Dash-8 spy planes in service by 2020, with the full fleet of eight aircraft on hand by the end of 2024. A ninth airframe with more limited systems will serve as a trainer for new crews. The RO-6As will replace all of the EO-5Cs, which are presently based in the United States, forward deployed to Korea and Germany, and rotate through various sites in Latin America and Africa. If the Army’s ARL-E project stays on schedule, we can expect to start seeing these new aircraft in those same locations in the next few years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2019",The US Air Force Admits It Won’t Be Buying Any Light Attack Aircraft For Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has confirmed it will not ask for any money to buy light attack aircraft in its latest proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year. The service insists that its pushing to acquire the new planes quickly and that it will set aside billions in future spending plans, but has declined to disclose any specific details about those plans for at least another year. Speaking at an event the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute hosted in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 16, 2018, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said that her service would include $2.4 billion for light attack planes into its five year strategy, but that any such spending wouldn’t begin until the 2020 fiscal cycle at the earliest. Earlier in February 2018, the Air Force announced it was cancelling a planned combat evaluation of Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corporation’s A-29 Super Tucano and Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine in favor of additional testing, focusing specifically on evaluating various sensor options for the two aircraft. “When we finish up the experiment, we’ll have to look at how many we buy, at what rate, starting in what year, what sensor we want to add to them,” Wilson said on Feb. 16, 2018. “We put a wedge in the five-year plan because basically we intend to buy light attack aircraft and we intend to buy them very rapidly.” “Rapid” has not been the operative word when it comes to the Air Force’s light attack plans so far. As I previously wrote here at The War Zone, this newest set of tests will be the sixth the service has run involving the A-29, AT-6, or both aircraft over the past decade. An A-29 Super Tucano., USAF The Air Force, along other branches of the U.S. military, have collected even more data during nearly a half dozen more similar past efforts involving other aircraft types, which you can read about in more detail here . U.S. Special Operations Command is running its own light attack aircraft project , as well. It’s not clear how the Air Force plans to pay for this new experiment, which it says will run between May and July 2018 at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, but it is possible that it could use existing funds set aside for experimentation. There are no apparent plans to conduct any additional evaluations next year. The sections of service’s 2019 fiscal year budget request dealing with research, development, test and evaluation mention the phrase “light attack” once – in a note explaining that its decision to trim more than $8.4 million from its experimentation line item was because its “Light Attack Experiment” would formally come to an end in 2018. An AT-6 Wolverine., Textron The Air Force also continually highlights the potential involvement of foreign allies and partners in the project, repeatedly raising questions about whether it truly intends to buy light attack aircraft for its own use. In her February 2018 remarks, Wilson said that “engagement with our allies” would help inform the total fleet size. “I’m talking about it in every place I go,” Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein had said at the Singapore Air Show on Feb. 6, 2018, according to Defense News , adding that he would specifically bring it up in meetings with American partners in Asia. But again, as we at The War Zone have noted , American allies and partners are not having any apparent difficulty acquiring light attack aircraft, both with the help of the U.S. government and without, absent any tangential political considerations. The United States ally in Asia most likely to be interested in such aircraft, the Philippines, is already buying A-29s , as well as Cessna C-208 Caravans configured as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms that it could easily convert later into light attack planes . This makes sense given the country’s numerous ongoing insurgencies, including one involving ISIS-affiliated militants, and the increasingly poor state of its present light attack aircraft fleets. Perplexingly, General Goldfein still mentioned the Philippines specifically as an example of a country that the Air Force could partner with in its own light attack aircraft efforts, without noting that country’s existing purchases. He also named Nigeria – which is already buying A-29s with American assistance – as another good example. It’s also worth pointing out that the Air Force’s has its own squadron of A-29s to help train pilots and ground crews from foreign air forces that operate the Super Tucano . One of the A-29s assigned to the US Air Force’s 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia., USAF It’s not clear why any country would wait for the Air Force to finalize its light attack aircraft plans, which by its own admission won’t happen until at least 2020, to look into purchasing this type of aircraft. The service itself first identified a need for a light attack capability as a cost-effective alternative to higher performance multi-role jet combat aircraft in limited conflicts and to help free up those fleets for more demanding missions all the way back in 2008 . “This is the whole point of experimenting and moving quickly,” Wilson insisted in her February 2018 talk. But if this Air Force truly believes its effort to acquire a light attack aircraft fleet has been moving quickly, we’d hate to see what it considers slow.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2020",Confusion Surrounds Confrontation With Nuclear Football During Trump’s Beijing Visit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report has surfaced suggesting that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and an unnamed member of the U.S. Secret Service got into a physical altercation with Chinese security personnel over the so-called “nuclear football,” a secure communications device inside an aluminum Zero Halliburton briefcase that enables the president of the United States to order a nuclear strike from virtually any location in a time of crisis. The Secret Service has denied that anyone got “tackled” during the alleged dispute, which may have occurred during President Donald Trump’s visit to China in 2017, but has not said outright that the incident did not happen at all. On Feb. 18, 2018, Axios , citing five anonymous individuals, first reported about the events, which happened on Nov. 9, 2017, while Trump was in Beijing as part of a larger tour of countries in Asia. As the president and his entourage made to enter the Great Hall of the People , a large government building in Beijing that serves as a meeting place for gatherings of the Chinese Communist Party and other ceremonial affairs, such as state visits, a Chinese security officer apparently attempted to block the individual carrying the football from following them for unknown reasons. That U.S. military aide is supposed to be near the president at all times. “We’re moving in,” Kelly, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general, reportedly said after hearing what was going on from where he was in an adjoining room and hurrying over to take charge of the situation. After arriving he pointedly told the aide and other members of Trump’s team to just keep walking into the hall. In the ensuing kerfuffle, a member of the Chinese security detail assigned to the Americans apparently grabbed Kelly, who shoved him away. According to Axios, a nearby Secret Service agent then tackled the Chinese officer, likely in response to what they interpreted as a potential threat to a senior U.S. official. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly., Oliver Contreras/SIPA USA via AP “FACT CHECK: Reports about Secret Service agents tackling a host nation official during the President’s trip to China in Nov 2017 are false,” the U.S. Secret Service wrote in a post on its official Twitter account on Feb. 19, 2018. The exact wording of this statement suggests that the incident was less rough that Axois’ sources had described it, but not that there had been no dispute over whether the aide could accompany Trump into the Great Hall. Axios reported that the aide assigned to carry the football never lost control of the signature black briefcase during the scuffle and that clearer heads prevailed and calmed things down quickly. The unnamed individuals told the outlet that the Chinese apologized for the incident and both sides agreed not to make a public issue out of it, as well. Even if the situation did not result in an actual brawl, any debate over whether or not the person carrying the football could accompany Trump would have been a major issue. Since at least the Cuban missile crisis, steadily improved versions of the unique piece of luggage , formally known as the President’s Emergency Satchel, have followed the president of the United States wherever they go, reinforcing the credibility of America’s nuclear deterrent as part of a larger set of procedures and failsafes to ensure “continuity of government” in a crisis. The special presidential transport aircraft Air Force One with its unique command and control capabilities, other fleets of strategic military command and control aircraft , secure bunkers , and various standing plans for senior leaders to evacuate to those sites are all part of this broader contingency concept. The idea is to make it clear to potential adversaries that a sneak attack will not be able to neutralize the U.S. government and prevent the prospect of massive retaliation. An older football that is now part of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History’s collection., Smithsonian/Jamie Chung To use the satchel itself, the president would first identify themselves by inputting codes from a card they carry at all times, called the “biscuit,” and the device would establish a direct link to the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon and to Strategic Command , or even to a E-6B or E-4B flying command post should either location be destroyed. After that, they could order a nuclear strike using a pre-set “menu” of attack options the U.S. military has already put together. Advice can be had from the military attaché carrying the football, who is from any of the services and has a rank of O-4 or higher and who is well versed on the plans and their intended effects. President Jimmy Carter reportedly demanded these simplified choices because of the very limited time in which he would have to decide how best to respond to an incoming nuclear assault or other major contingency requiring a response with nuclear weapons. There might be as little as 15 minutes available to make such a decision before enemy missiles arrive. There is no actual “ big red button ” in the bag that would immediately launch a nuclear strike . You can read more about the procedures the president has to go through to initiate a nuclear strike here and here . You can also learn more about the Pentagon’s standing plans for following through on those orders here . It’s not the first time the football and its handler has come up during the Trump Administration. In February 2017, shortly after Trump took office, Richard DeAgazio, a guest at the President’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida took photos with a member of the U.S. military identified as “Rick,” who was the aide carrying the briefcase at the time, and posted them on social media. DeAgazio was the same individual who posted the now notorious images of the president looking at potentially classified documents regarding a North Korean missile test with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a table in the resort’s dining hall. In this newly disclosed incident in China, its not clear why the Chinese official initially attempted to block members of Trump’s team from the Great Hall in the first place. The U.S. government apparently gave the standard security briefing to their counterparts in China ahead of the trip, which they do whenever the president visits the country. Members of the People’s Armed Police patrol Tiananmen Square in Beijing during President Trump’s November 2017 visit., Imaginechina via AP It is possible that there was simply some confusion on one or both sides as to the protocol and procedure and who the Chinese would allow to follow Trump into the Great Hall. It could also have been a more deliberate decision at some level to challenge the American delegation. By the time he visited Beijing in November 2017, Trump had already spent much of the year threatening implied nuclear strikes on North Korea and accusing the Chinese government of not doing enough to pressure North Korean premier Kim Jong-un and his regime into curtailing their provocative missile and nuclear weapons tests. The U.S. government had also formally censured Chinese nationals and companies it accused of enabling officials in Pyongyang to skirt American and international sanctions. The United States rightly continues to see North Korea’s use of China’s ports and other parts of that country’s shipping industry to import and export goods violation of various embargoes as a major issue . This wouldn’t be the first time Chinese authorities have at least given the appearance of snubbing a U.S. president with a debate over protocols and procedures. When President Barack Obama arrived in the city of Hangzhou in September 2016 for the annual G-20 summit, he had to unceremoniously exit Air Force One through a door in the plane’s lower fuselage due to a squabble over a mobile stairway. President Barack Obama exits Air Force One in Hangzhou, China for the 2016 G-20 summit using the aircraft’s own on board airstair. , Imaginechina via AP As part of the massive array of supporting equipment that follows the president of the United States on international trips, the U.S. government had flown in their own mobile airstair to allow passengers to get off Air Force One. The Chinese reportedly agreed to this initially, but then changed their minds at the last moment. This in turn created a commotion since the U.S. security detail complained that the local operator of the replacement airstair could not speak English and Chinese authorities refused to provide a bilingual substitute. Chinese officials eventually caved to American requests to just use their own equipment as they had planned, but by that point Air Force One was already almost on the ground and they decided to simply use the aircraft’s on board equipment in the end. “This is our country, this is our airport,” a Chinese official reportedly said in a raised voice as Obama and those traveling with him departed the aircraft. Chinese state media subsequently slammed the U.S. government and American media for making an issue out of a simple misunderstanding, but many believed the actions were deliberate harassment in response to the Obama administration’s noted criticisms of China on various issues, including its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea and human rights . Though Trump’s remarks toward China have fluctuated between combative and conciliatory during his presidency already, especially with regards to cooperation on the issue of North Korea, he has remained steadfastly critical of Chinese trade practices . In January 2018, he approved protectionist import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels coming from China and is moving to do the same with regards to Chinese steel . President Donald Trump shakes hands with Chinese premier Xi Jinping on Nov. 9, 2017., Kyodo via AP His administration’s new overarching national security and defense strategies both identify China as a major political and economic opponent and there is a special section in the controversial Nuclear Posture Review dedicated to deterring authorities in Beijing . There is once again talk about reinforcing American military posture in the Pacific region in the face of the Chinese military’s growing capabilities and Trump recently nominated U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, presently the head of U.S. Pacific Command and a major critic of Chinese policies, as the next ambassador to Australia . As such, it’s very possible that there could be similar, low-level spats over basic protocol during future visits to China. But hopefully John Kelly, or anyone else, won’t have to get in an actual fight with Chinese officials over the nuclear football again.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 8, 2019",Super Hornet Will Compete In Canada’s Fighter Contest As US Navy Funds Conformal Fuel Tanks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite having soured relations with the Canadian government with a major trade dispute , Boeing is reportedly still planning to submit a bid on the contract to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18A+ Hornets , almost certainly offering new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . The Chicago-headquartered plane maker could try to make its submission more attractive by including upgrades its already working on for the Super Hornet, such as the range-extending conformal fuel tanks it is developing for the U.S. Navy. On Feb. 15, 2018, Reuters , citing unnamed sources, reported that Boeing had formally applied to be a part of Canada’s fighter jet tender, which could be worth an between approximately $12 billion and $15 billion at the time of writing. According to a separate report from the Ottawa Citizen , in the winning company will begin delivering aircraft in 2025 and supply up to 88 planes by 2032. American firm Lockheed Martin is expected to offer its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , and possibility a version of its F-16 Viper . European consortium Eurofighter, France’s Dassault, and Sweden’s Saab are also set to submit proposals involving the Typhoon , Rafale , and Gripen E jets respectively. Whether or not Boeing would take part in the competition has been the topic of much speculation after it filed a formal complaint against Canadian firm Bombardier in 2017. Boeing accused the Canadian firm of “dumping” its CSeries airliners into the American market at artificially low prices thanks in part to subsidies from the government in Ottawa. In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce sided with Boeing and proposed huge import tariffs of almost 200 percent on any Bombardier products entering the United States. This in turn precipitated a major international spat with not only Canada, but the United Kingdom, which is home to factory that employs more than 4,000 workers to build wings for the CSeries. A Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18A+ Hornet., Canadian Forces But in January 2018, the U.S. International Trade Commission rejected Boeing’s case and refused to approve the tariffs, leaving the American company with the options of abandoning the issue or starting its legal challenge all over again. The Canadian government has said that “past and recent economic behavior of potential bidders leading up to the procurement” will have an impact on their chances of winning the fighter deal, according to Reuters. As a result of the trade fight, Boeing has already lost out on one potential deal to supply 18 Super Hornets to the Royal Canadian Air Force as an interim replacement for some of the CF-18A+ aircraft. Canada is now looking to purchase a number of older ex-Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A/B Hornets instead. It is very likely that the company decided it was not in its best interests not to pursue its dispute with Bombardier, at least for the time being. As we at The War Zone have noted before, Boeing has a strong case to make for supplying F/A-18E/Fs as Canada’s next fighter jet, which offers an established, reliable advanced fourth generation design with a number of highly desirable features, and synergistic commonality with their existing fleet of “legacy” Hornets. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet., USN AESA type radars are a relatively easy way to squeeze more capability out of an existing fourth generation fighter jet design, since they give pilots improved capability to identify and engage their targets and extended distances. Canada has already received U.S. government approval to buy the advanced AIM-120D air-to-air missile , which would make use of the Super Hornet’s radar. Canada could leverage the U.S. Navy’s Block III Super Hornet project and get jets with the same or similar improvements while sharing the cost burden. Boeing says those updated aircraft will have infrared search and track capability, which would offer another means to detect and target opponents at long range. The final American versions might also have certain low-observable features , such as a fully enclosed, aerodynamic weapons pod. With stealthy additions, the Super Hornet would be an even more attractive to Canada as a cost-effective alternative to the stealthy F-35. By the time the Canadian government signs an actual contract for new fighters, many of those improvements are likely to be out of development and in production, as well, further reducing the costs. For example, on Feb. 14, 2018, the Navy announced it would pay Boeing nearly $220 million over the next four years to design and build conformal fuel tanks for the Super Hornet, another important part of the Block III upgrade program. The Chicago-headquartered firm has already explored the possibility of adding CFTs as part of past Advanced Super Hornet and Super Hornet International projects. Concept art for the Navy’s Block III upgrades, which includes CFTs and an IRST mounted on the jet’s centerline drop tank. , Boeing These add-on fuel packs will give the jets between 100 and 120 miles additional combat radius, something that is important for the Royal Canadian Air Force given its primary day-to-day missions of contributing to standing aerial patrols and quick reaction forces defending the skies over North America and those of NATO allies in Europe. CFTs have become another increasingly attractive way to get more capability out of existing fourth generation fighter jets since they both extend the aircraft’s effective range without the need for drop tanks, freeing up that space for additional weapons or other stores. Boeing did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment on the matter, but that’s not necessarily surprising since Canadian authorities have imposed an unprecedented gag order on all competitors. This appears to be an attempt to prevent potentially embarrassing information about the fighter jet replacement project from leaking out to the public. The non-disclosure agreement reportedly prohibits the firms from ever discussing the program, now or in the future. Canada’s path to replacing its CF-18A+ jets has already been a particularly overwrought debacle. After taking office in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, head of the Liberal Party, moved to halt the country’s participation the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and hold an all-new fighter jet competition, which had been a major campaign promise . Despite repeated difficulties and delays with the jets, the stealthy F-35 had been a particular favorite of his Conservative Party predecessor Stephen Harper. The Trudeau Administration’s change of course on the matter prompted a political and legal backlash . For more than a year now, it has been struggling to make good on its promise to re-evaluate its fighter jet options, but also not lose its seat at the F-35 table in process. At the same time, the CF-18A+s are only getting older and less reliable, with only around 76 aircraft being active at all and far fewer than that being fully mission capable at any one time. A Canadian CF-18A+ Hornet, at bottom, flies with a pair of Portuguese F-16 Vipers during a patrol over Lithuania., Canadian Forces That’s where the aforementioned purchase of Australian Hornets comes in, but those additional jets are of a similar vintage and are unlikely to offer much of a capability upgrade in the meantime. It’s been hard even for Trudeau’s own cabinet to hide their displeasure at how things have gone. “We needed [new fighter jets] a long time ago,” Canadian Defense Minster Harjit Sajjan said during a visit to Riga, the capital of fellow NATO member Latvia, in September 2017. “We had a plan in place, a very good plan that was going to fill the capability gap, invest in our current fleet, and start the fighter replacement competition.” How the situation will play out now remains unclear. The Australian Hornets won’t even begin arriving until at least 2019 , as the Royal Australian Air Force retires them. As such, deliveries of those 18 jets will happen over a painfully protracted period of three years . By then, the Canadian government hopes to have finalized deal for the full contingent of new fighter jets. A Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18B., Australian DOD More importantly, Canada’s Federal Auditor General Michael Ferguson, who undercut the Harper Administration’s plans to buy the F-35 in 2012 with a damning report , is set to release another review of Canadian fighter jet procurement by the end of 2018. There’s no indication the government watchdog will find the kind of malfeasance in the government’s new plans that he did with regards to the Joint Strike Fighter, which included senior defense officials violating rules and deliberately hiding negative details about the state of the project. However, it is very possible he could call into question whether Canadian taxpayers are getting the best value out of the current courses of action, including the purchase of dated second-hand jets that won’t even be operational for years to come. That’s exactly the kind of question the Trudeau Administration appears to want to try and avoid by making the competitors sign blanket, indefinite non-disclosure agreements about the multi-billion dollar project. Canada won’t be able to wait too much longer to begin replacing its fighter jets if it wants to avoid a potentially dangerous gap in capability. Even with on-going service-life extension upgrades, the CF-18A+s are likely to be unsafe to fly by 2032, at which point they will have been in service for five decades. This will also more than decades longer than the Royal Canadian Air Force originally planned to be flying the Hornets Unfortunately, the service has already had to push its planned retirement date for the CF-18A+s back multiple times.  Hopefully, the Canadian government can make sure the tired fighter jets don’t have to soldier on even longer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 3, 2018",US Army Eyes Replacing Its 105mm and 155mm Towed Howitzers With One New Cannon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is soliciting ideas for a single new howitzer to replace all of the towed 105mm and 155mm types in its Stryker-equipped and regular light infantry brigades. The service says it is particularly interested in upgrades for or modification to its existing weapons, especially lightweight 155mm cannons, or various types of self-propelled guns, though it is willing to consider other concepts. On Feb. 14, 2018, the Army announced it would be studying its options for this “next generation” howitzer in a notice on the U.S government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps. Though there are no firm requirements as of yet, the new weapons would have to be at least as portable and lightweight as the existing 105mm M119 and 155mm M777 towed howitzers , but hopefully have better range and accuracy and be more mobile. In the notice, the Army was clear that it is just doing “market research” and is not looking to buy any new weapons at the moment. However, it added that it was looking for designs that could be ready sometime in the mid-2020s and wouldn’t require an “extended development cycle.” The M119 has a maximum range of around eight and half miles, while the M777 can hit targets nearly 20 miles away using special long-range ammunition. The 155mm guns can also fire GPS-guided artillery shells. Both weapons require trucks to move them around on the ground, but are light enough for cargo planes to air drop or helicopters to shuttle around the battlefield, as well. At present, the service’s infantry and Stryker brigades, which are the easiest maneuver units for the service to deploy in a crisis, rely entirely on these towed howitzers for organic, stand-off fire support. A typical infantry brigade has two batteries of M119s and one with M777s, while standard Stryker brigades just have the 155mm weapons. Since 2016, the Army has already been working on a new M777 variant with double the range, but not a dramatic increase its weight compared to the standard version. The problem there is whether the modified howitzer’s longer barrel makes it harder to move, especially over rough, uneven ground, where it might twist and bend as a truck pulls it along. One of the Army’s prototype extended-range M777 howitzers., US Army An upgrade for the 155mm weapon also does nothing to address the limitations of the smaller M119, which is light enough for a Humvee to tow around, making it better suited for certain airborne or other limited operations. The latest variant of this 105mm has a digital fire control system that includes GPS and inertial navigation systems to better determine its own location and by extension the exact position of and distance to the target. It does not have the ability to fire a precision guided shell, though. This is likely why the Army is interested in the possibility of an 155mm weapon that it could configure in long- and short-tube versions. The shorter barrel variant would have more limited range and accuracy, but might be able to fire the full range of existing ammunition types, including precision guided rounds. It could still be hard to trim weight from the system, though, since it would still need a robust frame to handle the recoil of firing those loads. US Army soldiers man an M119 howitzer in Afghanistan., US Army It wouldn’t be the first time the service has looked into ways to get at least some of the range and firepower benefits of a full-size 155mm weapon in a more compact package. During the Cold War, it experimented with the XM204, a “soft-recoil” gun available in both 105mm and 155mm calibers that used a complicated recoil mechanism known as the “Fire Out of Battery” system. What this meant was that when a gunner fired the weapon, the entire barrel assembly would actually shoot forward, as well, sealing the shell “in battery” in the firing chamber in the process. In theory, that momentum would help cancel out the rearward recoil, allowing the entire system to be lighter and more manageable. Despite years of research and development, including a bizarre idea to bolt two XM204s to the side of a CH-47 Chinook, the Army canceled the overly complicated howitzer. The video explains the XM204’s “Fire Out of Battery” system. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NWB8FrL-WCo Many of the same basic issues apply to lightweight self-propelled systems. Wheeled 155mm howitzers are becoming increasingly popular, especially among America’s NATO allies, as a cost-effective alternative to heavy tracked systems. The lighter weight vehicles have more limited off-road mobility, though, and could present a less stable, and therefore less accurate, firing platform. Computerized ballistic targeting systems and precision guided shells could help mitigate accuracy concerns, but wouldn’t make the vehicles any more portable or mobile. France’s CASEAR , one of the most popular wheeled 155mm howitzers presently on the market and a good general representation of the options available, is not light enough for air drop or for a helicopter to rapidly move it from one position to another, though it is air-portable using fixed-wing cargo aircraft. A French CAESAR wheeled self-propelled 155mm howitzer., Daniel Steger via Wikimedia Defense contractor Mandus Group has been working on an 105mm system called Hawkeye that is lightweight and low recoil enough to fit onto smaller vehicles, including commercial pickup trucks, which that could offer another option. The Army might be able to squeeze some 155mm-like effects out of an 105mm cannon with extended range, precision guided ammunition, but its unlikely that the smaller bore weapon would ever have truly comparable capabilities. But it’s not hard to understand why the Army might be interested in new, more mobile, lightweight artillery pieces. Having that kind of firepower on-call is immensely important for the Army’s light infantry and Stryker units, especially when conducting independent operations where they might not have the guarantee of support from other services or even other elements within the Army. Unless there are already aircraft overhead or other artillery units in position nearby, the howitzers can often respond faster to requests for fire missions, too. The guns don’t get grounded due to bad weather, either. The value of this flexible fire support has been particularly visible in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria , where Marine and Army units were able to quickly set up fire support bases in remote, austere locations with their M777 howitzers. In Syria, Marine artillery elements were a key part of the offensive to eject the terrorists from their de facto capital of Raqqa and more recently helped beat back a contingent of Syrian forces and Russian mercenaries near the city of Deir ez-Zor. The Army has also employed tracked M109 self-propelled 155mm weapons to Iraq to provide artillery fire for coalition operations. French forces employed their CAESARs to great effect, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0zndo4gttEY On top of that, further underscoring the value of ground-based, precision artillery fire, Army and Marine units brought in truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS . These vehicles offer ground forces the ability to rapidly and accurately engage targets more than 50 miles away with 227mm GPS-guided rockets and quickly became stars of the campaign to defeat ISIS. These same capabilities would almost certainly be important in a larger, conventional fight against a near-peer adversary or a smaller nation state opponent. In particular, the Army has cited Russia’s significantly more diverse tube and rocket artillery forces as an important reason to modernize its own such capabilities. Since 2014, Russian troops have employed those weapons to devastating effect in support of pro-Kremlin separatists in Eastern Urkaine and more recently as part of operations on behalf of dictator Bashar al Assad in Syria. “Russia has shown the capability to rapidly bring massive amounts of indirect fire (IDF) onto a target once they have positive identification,” a 2016 Army handbook on that country’s “New Generation Warfare” tactics explains. “The threat of massed artillery and Multiple Launched Rocket Systems (MLRS) denies friendly forces a ‘safe haven.’ Forward Operating Bases (FOB), which U.S. formations have become accustomed to are not possible in this environment.” A pair of Russian 2S19M1 Msta-S 152mm self-propelled howitzers, Vitaly Kuzmin Improving the range, accuracy, and mobility of the artillery systems available to infantry and Stryker brigades could give them additional options to respond to those threats. It would also give the Army more ways to quickly set up distributed fire support sites without having to rely on pre-existing, well established, and therefore vulnerable bases. Lightweight, mobile artillery systems could also be more flexible in a maritime environment, making use of U.S. Navy ships and Army watercraft to rapidly reposition from one area to another. Especially in the Pacific region, quickly placing guns or other stand-off weapons on a small island might allow a ground force to better support distributed operations to disrupt an enemy’s plans or defend other higher value assets from counter-attacks. The Army own recent experiences in Iraq and Syria, as well as other trends around the world, are proof artillery is still a central part of any combined arms force and that it is essential for the service to modernize and improve its capabilities in this regard. This is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in the service’s most recent budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year that includes a request for a more than 800% increase in purchases of 155mm high explosive shells alone. So, it will be interesting to see what defense contractors can come up with as options for replacing its M119 and M777 towed howitzers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russian Mercenaries Take The Lead In Attacks On US And Allied Forces In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American forces in Syria, along with their local partners, have now weathered two separate attacks from troops fighting on behalf of dictator Bashar Al Assad, one of which almost certainly involved some number of Russian military personnel or contractors from a company called Wagner. Though the United States soundly defeated its opponents in both cases, the incidents could be another sign of increasingly worrisome tensions with Russia in Syria as the situation in the country careens toward a larger regional conflagration . On Feb. 13, 2018, U.S. personnel called in a air strike, involving an MQ-9 Reaper drone, to destroy a T-72 tank that had been firing at them and members of the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the bulk of which are Kurdish fighters , on the eastern side of the Euphrates River near Syria’s strategic city of Deir ez-Zor. Almost a week earlier, those same American troops had summoned a massive amount of air and artillery support to brush back approximately 500 pro-Assad fighters and members of Wagner armed with tanks and other heavy weapons who assaulted their positions. The SDF and their U.S. advisers are situated to the east of a formal de-confliction line that is supposed to separate United States and Russian military activities and, by extension, those of their allies, specifically to avoid these sorts of dangerous engagements that could escalate into a larger conflict. The first skirmish reportedly resulted in the deaths of dozens of Russian private military contractors, who often act as deniable stand-ins for the Kremlin’s own forces. Russian involvement “According to preliminary information, we could be talking about the deaths of five people – presumably Russian citizens – as a result of an armed confrontation whose causes are being examined,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a routine briefing on Feb. 15, 2018, in what is perhaps most heavy caveated official statement to date on whether Russia was involved in the incidents in Syria or not. “There were not 400, not 200, not 1,000, and not 10.” The exact extent of Russia’s participation in the attacks remains a major question that could have significant ramifications for the overall situation in Syria. The United States, which has also sought to downplay the involvement of Russian personnel, official members of the military or otherwise, continually stresses that its own forces in the country and their local partners are only there to fight ISIS and not to take a stand in the broader civil war. The video below shows a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper destroying a T-72 tank near Deir ez-Zor on Feb. 13, 2018. “It makes no sense, it does not appear to be anything coordinated by the Russians,” U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters on Feb. 13, 2018. “I think the Russians would’ve told us [if they were involved],” he had said on Feb. 8, 2018. But there is a growing amount of evidence to challenge Mattis’ insistence that the Kremlin can only have been a neutral actor in the incidents. The most important detail is that the Russians who were involved were likely in the employ of a private military company called Wagner. Members of the firm, which officially runs its operations out of Hong Kong because such businesses are illegal in Russia, has no publicly available contact information, and reportedly recruits among former military personnel from Russia and former Soviet republics through word of mouth , has appeared alongside pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine and with pro-Assad forces in Syria , including as part of a militia known as the “ISIS Hunters.” There are reports that it has sent forces to Libya and Sudan , two other countries where Russia also has significant geopolitical interests . The group appears to be a direct outgrowth of the nebulous “ little green men ” that Putin employed in 2014 to seize Ukraine’s Crimea region. The logo of the Pro-Assad militia known as the ISIS Hunters, one of the groups the Russian private military company Wagner reportedly works closely with in Syria., inconnu via Wikimedia The Wagner connection The possibility that Wagner or other Russian military contractors had been involved in the assault on Feb. 7 emerged almost immediately after the incident. Then, on Feb. 8, 2018, Igor Girkin, also known as Igor Strelkov, a Russian veteran who has taken part in the fighting in Ukraine’s Crimea region and breakaway eastern provinces ostensibly as an independent operator, said the American counterattack had destroyed two Wagner “tactical units.” He made the claims, without citing any sources, via the online social network Vkontakte, or VK, a Russian-language analogue to Facebook. Roman Saponkov, a Russian war correspondent who previously revealed damage at Russia’s Khmeimim air base in Syria’s Latakia governorate after a mass drone attack on New Year’s Eve 2017, subsequently made his own post on the website alleging Wagner had lost between 20 and 25 personnel in the battle. Russian reporter in Syria Roman Saponkov says he believes Russian PMC Wagner lost ""20-25 fighters"" in yesterday's US airstrikes on regime forces in NE Syria. Raises question of what these forces were doing there/thinking in the first place. pic.twitter.com/6evjl9yID7 — Neil Hauer (@NeilPHauer) February 10, 2018 Three anonymous sources, including an individual said to be a Russian military doctor, told Reuters that total death toll for members of the firm were between 80 and 100. Russian opposition politicians have also seized on the issue and are demanding a formal accounting from the Kremlin ahead of the country’s upcoming presidential election in March 2018. Unlike other controversial private military companies, such as Blackwater and DynCorp , experts and observers widely believe that Wagner is either a cover for the Russian government itself or is separate, but under its direct supervision . So far, Kremlin officials have been very careful to say that no formal Russian troops took part in the attacks on U.S. troops in Syria, while otherwise deflecting responsibility. Pro-Assad forces near Deir ez-Zor in September 2017., Михаил Алаеддин/Sputnik  via AP “We can’t exclude the possibility that Russian citizens may be present in Syria. They are not connected to the [Russian] armed forces,” Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s personal spokesperson, said on Feb. 14, 2018. “Let’s all be realistic about the fact that there are quite a few of our compatriots in many countries of the world.” These remarks were reminiscent of Putin’s own past suggestion that “ patriotic ” Russians acting on their own initiative could have been responsible for various cyber attacks and other attempts to influence the United States’ 2016 presidential election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is of the unanimous opinion that the Russian government was involved directly in those activities and is planning to do so again to try and influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. https://youtube.com/watch?v=AEIcSxGn8Es In Syria, it seems difficult to believe that Wagner, or the Syrian forces they were cooperating with, could have acted without at least tacit approval from the Kremlin. There’s also the matter of how they force got across Euphrates without Russian support. The Syrian Arab Army does have its own mobile bridging equipment, but it appears to be very limited. In September 2017, Russia had rushed military bridging equipment to help enable a major push to seize control off the opposite shore near Deir ez-Zor, underscoring this relative lack of capability. The only formal bridge linking the city with the eastern bank of the river long ago ended up destroyed over the course of the fighting in the country. However, a sudden rise in the water level had destroyed the Russian temporary pontoon bridge days before the first attack by Pro-Assad forces on American and SDF personnel. Shifting operational requirements could have allowed the Syrians to redirect its limited resources to this particular operation, but regardless it would have taken considerable effort and appropriate equipment, such as mobile ferries or other bridging systems, to move any significant number of tanks and large artillery pieces them across the river. A Soviet-era truck belonging to the Syrian Arab Army carries a well worn pontoon bridge section to the bank of the Euphrates near Deir ez-Zor in September 2017, Михаил Алаеддин/Sputnik  via AP An rapidly evolving conflict All of this points to a new, rapidly evolving, and increasingly worrisome phase in Syria’s civil war. ISIS continues to launch limited attacks in the country, including on U.S.-supported forces in Eastern Syria, but the group has ceased to be an imminent threat capable of holding large swaths of territory. We at The War Zone have long warned and continue to highlight that ISIS’ rapid disintegration has exposed a host of competing agendas that parties had put on hold to focus on dismantling more immediate threats. Russia’s apparent decision to test the possibility of using proxies as a low-risk way to challenge America’s resolve is a troubling development that be a sign of more skirmishes to come between the two sides, especially around Deir ez-Zor. The main focus of the two attacks in February 2018 appears to have been control of lucrative oil and gas fields in the area that the SDF occupies. Secretary of Defense Mattis has described the idea that Russia might be looking to indirectly confront American troops “perplexing” on more than one occasion, noting that the Russians don’t necessarily have control over Syrian government security forces or their associated militias. But Russia has made it clear that it believes the U.S. military is operating in Syria illegally and that in doing so it is trying to carve out a de facto parallel state in the Eastern half of the country complete with its own proxy army in the form of the predominantly Kurdish SDF. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis., Chris Kleponis/Sipa USA via AP “The US military continues to occupy a 55-kilometer area near Al-Tanf [in Southern Syria near the Jordanian border], which has become a shelter zone for the remaining members of [ISIS],” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zakharova said in her remarks on Feb. 15, 2018, also implying the United States is supporting the terrorists, which is a common, but unfounded conspiracy theory. “The Americans conducted defiant actions on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, where they came close to an open confrontation with the Syrian army seeking to support their Kurdish allies.” And when it comes to the Kurds, Russia has been actively seeking to use that issue to drive a wedge between the United States and its NATO ally Turkey over the situation in Syria, too. Since January 2018, Turkish forces and their local partners have been fighting Kurdish rebel groups in Syria’s far northwestern corner, something the Russians have reportedly given their blessing to, which you can read about more in detail here . Russia has also been working hard to deescalate a separate and growing conflict between Israel and Assad and his Iranian allies . On Feb. 10, 2018, Putin himself reportedly called Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to help bring an end to a skirmish that erupted after Syrian air defenders shot down an Israeli F-16I fighter jet and damaged an F-15. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in August 2017., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP Russia as “kingmaker” in Syria Russia seems to be trying to position itself as the “ kingmaker ” in Syria’s conflict. As such, it’s not hard to imagine that Russia using proxies like Wagner and Syrian militias to try and achieve its own publicly stated goal of having the United States leave the country entirely, but with less danger of a direct confrontation. For months, it appeared that the United States and Russia were getting close to an actual skirmish , especially after a serious of aggressive aerial engagements between military aircraft from both countries at the end of 2017. There are now reports from the Pentagon that actual Russian aircraft and troops have decreased their operations near the de-confliction line, which could be another indicator that the Kremlin is actively seeking to further obfuscate its intentions. “What I would tell you is clearly the Russian activity has moved away from where we’ve been operating down in the Euphrates River Valley and their operations clearly have migrated up to the northwest,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigian, head of U.S. Air Forces Central Command, told reporters on Feb. 13, 2018. “So, quite frankly, our interactions with them in compared to – in comparison to what we had seen probably at two months ago is significantly decreased.” A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter pulls away from an aerial refueling tanker during a mission over Syria in February 2018., USAF Of course, groups like Wagner seem expendable in the Kremlin’s eyes, which is what makes them so attractive for both foreign and domestic political reasons. Having proclaimed total victory and pledged to draw down official Russian forces in December 2017, Putin could be particularly inclined to use the mercenaries in order to stay engaged in the conflict, taking greater risks than before , and better avoid international criticism and complaints from the political opposition at home.  This would make even more sense given that he’s in the middle of what is already a highly controversial re-election campaign . Whether or not these Russian proxies will be capable of achieving the Kremlin’s actual objectives is another matter. The huge American counterattack decisively defeated the Russian-backed force outside Deir ez-Zor and demonstrated that the United States can still rapidly call upon considerable firepower to defend its interests in the country. The Syrian Arab Air Force is in no position to challenge that superiority . The Russians could theoretically decide to more actively commit their own air and artillery assets , but this would make it all but impossible for them to hide their direct involvement in the skirmishes. Russia’s contingent in Syria also largely lacks any serious precision guided munitions capability , which would limit their ability to try and attack SDF positions, but leave their American advisers unscathed. If U.S. troops died in an obvious Russian strike it would touch off a massive international incident or worse. “This is executed as self-defense, and we are going to defend ourselves,” Lieutenant General Harrigian added during his press conference after the second attack. “We all need to be crystal clear about that.” But at a certain point, regardless of the technical accuracy of Russia’s carefully worded denials and increasingly credulous American attempts to downplay the seriousness of the situation, it may be hard to deny that the two countries are actively engaged in a low-level conflict.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 13, 2019",Glimpse Of The Future?: MC-130 Sets Up Forward Refueling Point For MQ-9 Reaper Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The idea of the forward arming and refueling point, or FARP , where transport aircraft quickly set up a temporary site for other planes and helicopters to take on more fuel and reload, sometimes without even shutting down their engines, is hardly new . But the U.S. Air Force also uses the procedure to support unmanned aircraft, which allow it to be more flexible about how it deploys and employs drones and could open up additional operational possibilities in the future. On Feb. 13, 2018, the 27th Special Operations Wing ’s public affairs office posted a video online, seen below, that shows members of the unit using an MC-130J Commando II special operations transport to set up a FARP and refueling at least one MQ-9 Reaper drone at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico. The Wing’s 9th Special Operations Squadron flies the Commando II, while its 33rd Special Operations Squadron operates Reapers. Unfortunately, there is no description to go along with this particular clip, which public affairs personnel or other airmen filmed using a night vision camera, or audio. It’s not hard to understand what is going on, thankfully. The crew of the MC-130J lands as they would during any other FARP mission, special operations airmen quickly run out hoses as an MQ-9 taxis into position. The drone has a pair of Hellfire missiles, one under each wing, possibly captive training versions, and an external fuel tank fitted under its wings. A separate group of airmen then shuts the drone down and the refueling begins. The video does not show personnel loading or unloading any weapons. The clip cuts out with the drone still sitting, engine off on the runway. We don’t know if it subsequently took off again as part of this particular exercise. In its most basic form, a FARP is used to extend an aircraft’s reach from one point to another, and potentially back again. It can also be used to increase an asset’s time over a target area and up its sortie rate. Rearming is a whole other aspect that naturally goes along with the concept. But the tactic can be used creatively to achieve more dynamic and complex effects on the battlefield too. During typical operations, the Air Force flies Reapers using a “remote-split” method in which a team on the ground uses a line-of-sight radio link to launch and recover the drone, but pilots and sensor operations conduct the actual missions remotely via satellite. The ground crews are generally also responsible for refueling, loading weapons, and routine maintenance on the unmanned aircraft. It’s a concept of operations that the Air Force has already used to rapidly deploy MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9s to remote forward locations. In 2013, the 3rd Special Operations Squadron, another unit assigned to the 27th, set up a drone surveillance operation with Predators in an undisclosed African country within three weeks . A view of the 3rd Special Operations Squadron’s Camp Shughart, situated in an undisclosed African country, and one of its Predators there, as seen through the camera on another drone., USAF via FOIA The Air Force could potentially shrink that weeks-long time frame down to days or even hours by combining remote-split and FARP operating concepts, especially if the drones are only going to be flying intelligence or reconnaissance missions where it wouldn’t be necessary to fly in additional precision guided munitions. The Air Force has shown that this is feasible with manned aircraft, including with advanced F-22 Raptor stealth fighters as part of another concept known as “ Rapid Raptor .” That involves a package that the service can fly into any suitable location, including known “bare bases” with appropriate runways, but no existing formal support facilities. With this support in place, a detachment of four F-22s can start flying combat missions from the site within 24 hours. The initial arrangement required a C-17 Globemaster III airlifter , but the Air Force has now run separate experiments involving HC-130J Combat King II rescue aircraft and the 9th Special Operations Squadron’s MC-130Js . It’s not hard to imagine a similar arrangement involving the Commando IIs and a small group of Reapers. The video below shows an MC-130J Commando II from the 9th Special Operations Squadron training to conduct FARP operations with F-22 Raptors. Since it would require fewer personnel and infrastructure on the ground to begin with, a “Rapid Reaper” force may actually be able to get going much faster. General Atomics, which makes the MQ-9, is in the process of developing a system that will allow personnel to launch and recover the drones via satellite, which would further reduce the total number of personnel who actually have to be at the forward location to support operations. The Reapers are much less fuel hungry than high performance fighter jets such as the F-22, meaning a finite number of C-130-type aircraft could be able to sustain their operations for longer periods of time. An F-22 carries 18,000lbs of fuel internally on a mission that will last roughly two hours. An MQ-9 carries 4,000lbs internally and it can fly on that for around a day with a weapons payload. So a single F-22 tank of gas can keep the Reaper flying for four and a half missions lasting the better part of a week. All of this could give U.S. units, especially special operations forces, new options when considering best how to respond on short-notice to crises or to an otherwise rapidly changing situation. Otherwise, these elements might be forced to wait for support from Reapers or similarly sized drones or manned multi-role combat aircraft operating from existing locations, potentially hundreds of miles away or even farther, at least during the opening stages of an operation. Those long transit times could significantly limit the ability for drones to provide important persistent surveillance over a given area, or at the very least it would require more resources to keep a drone overhead at any given time. This is referred to as an “orbit.” MQ-9, USAF Smaller tactical drones, such as the MQ-27A ScanEagle and RQ-21 Blackjack , could offer a more immediate, but localized reconnaissance and surveillance capability, but at present they have no ability to actually attack any targets they might find and their sensor suites and range are much more limited compared to the MQ-9. A combination of close-by persistent surveillance and light attack capabilities could be a boon to special operators in remote areas removed from other immediate support, especially against enemies with armored vehicles or other heavy weapons. When Syrian militia and Russian contractors attacked American forces in Syria earlier in February 2018, F-22s and MQ-9s were the only aircraft overhead initially. However, one of the Reapers was notably able to destroy a T-72 tank that was threatening the lighter equipped U.S. personnel and their Kurdish partners. With their already small logistical footprint and FARPs, the Reapers could also quickly move from one location to another to provide the best coverage. U.S. Special Operations Command knows how beneficial this kind of flexibility can be for fast moving operations, having employed a similar operational concept with a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Bronco manned light attack aircraft during a field test in Iraq in 2015. The benefits of being able to use FARPs to rush MQ-9s into a particular theater of operations or to a distributed network of bases within a particular region could have impacts on larger, conventional operations, too. The Air Force was already motivated to pursue concepts such as Rapid Raptor in part due to the increasing vulnerability of large, forward air bases to potential near-peer opponents. Spreading manned fighters and other combat aircraft around to multiple sites would make it harder for the enemy to halt their operations with only a limited number of stand-off strikes. Adding drones to the mix could allow the Air Force to operate from additional locations in a crisis without needing a significantly larger amount of personnel and other resources. This in turn could allow the U.S. military to conduct more distributed strikes, forcing opponents to spread resources thinly across a broader area in response, potentially disrupting their overall defensive strategy and opening them up to larger operations pin-pointed against particularly vulnerable areas. A map showing just some of the airstrips the U.S. military has identified around the world that it could potentially make use of in various contingencies., USAF via FOIA And being able to rapidly send drones to forward locations, or just within reach of those areas, using FARPs could provide an important target acquisition capability for air and ground forces. A U.S. Army or Marine force with a detachment of Reapers operating in support from a nearby site would be able to better locate and engage the enemy with its own stand-off weapons, including guided artillery shells and rockets , short-range ballistic missiles , and possibly ground-launched anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles in the near future. The rapid deployment of artillery to remote areas has become an increasingly important tactic for the Army and Marines, in Syria especially where American forces and their local partners would otherwise lack that kind of responsive fire support. Being able to quickly add a contingent of Reapers nearby would make these sorts of “islands” – figurative in the Middle East, but potentially literal in a Pacific theater scenario – much more viable, even against more capable foes. USAF As more advanced unmanned technologies mature in the future, the Air Force could expand on the concept of forward deploying drones with FARP support. Unmanned aircraft deployed at dispersed locations could act as “ loyal wingmen ” for manned aircraft as part of manned-unmanned teams. Another future scenario might involve using FARPs to rapidly establish even more revolutionary autonomous or semi-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle operations where the aircraft can take off and land and fly complete intelligence gathering or strike missions on their own. With so many possibilities, it will be interesting to see how this concept of using FARPs to support advanced unmanned aircraft operations evolves, but this short clip is more likely than not a glimpse into the Air Force’s increasingly pilotless future. Correction: The wording of the original version of this article implied that the US Air Force may have just started conducting FARP operations with MQ-9s. The service has been doing so for some time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019","Despite What You’ve Heard, The Navy Isn’t Ditching Its Railgun And Budget Docs Prove It","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite recent reports that the U.S. Navy could abandon the effort altogether, the service has included millions of dollars in its latest budget request to continue working on its potentially game-changing railgun . Though overall funds for the project have fluctuated in recent years, the revelation that the Chinese may have installed their own prototype weapon on an actual ship could prompt the service and Congress to try and accelerate the electromagnetic cannon’s development. On Feb. 12, 2018, the Navy released its proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year, which allots almost $45.8 million for research and development into both electromagnetic and directed energy weapons, reflecting the latest phase in the project’s evolution. This is a common pool that pays for the railgun project , as well as work on maturing solid state laser technology and a joint program with the U.S. Air Force to build a high-powered radio frequency weapon for aircraft called High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS). Though the new budget proposal calls for more than $10 million less than the service asked for in the previous fiscal cycle, the documents are clear that the service remains committed to the electromagnetic weapon. The funding, in part, will go toward “development addressing the unique technical challenges inherent in the construction, assembly and operation of a high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype capable of repeatedly launching long range, precision guided projectiles using electricity instead of chemical propellants,” the official description says. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has been working steadily on the railgun since 2005 and has procured two separate prototypes from BAE Systems and General Atomics. In 2012, the Navy pushed hard to move things along from a technology demonstration to a formal program of record to buy actual electromagnetic cannons. “What I’m finding is if I go ahead with the demo it will slow my development,” U.S. Navy Admiral Pete Fanta, then the director of surface warfare and now the head of warfare integration, told Defense News in 2016. “I would rather get an operational unit out there faster than do a demonstration that just does a demonstration.” As we at the War Zone have noted before , this seemed like an odd course of action given the U.S. Navy’s own experiences with similar efforts to “ concurrently ” develop and produce other high-tech systems, many of which remain mired in controversy . Not surprisingly, that aggressive strategy did not produce the desired results and in its budget for the 2018 fiscal year, the service smartly refocused its efforts on the research and development aspect of the project, pushing off an at-sea test until at least 2019. The railgun and various other technologies ended up in an all new budget line called “Innovative Naval Prototypes.” US Navy Rear Admiral Michael Klunder, then Chief of Naval Research, holds a high velocity projectile for the service’s prototype railgun in 2014., USN “These investments represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts,” the Navy says in its broad description of programs that fall into this category. “They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.” With regards to the railgun, it’s hard to overstate just how impressive such a weapon could be if engineers can turn the technology into a functional and cost-effective system. At their most basic, railguns rely on a series of electromagnets to shoot a projectile at hypersonic speeds. In most cases, the round lies on sheer velocity to destroy its target rather than an explosive charge. The Navy says its existing prototype can launch rounds at over 4,500 miles per hour, or around six times the speed of sound. The final design could have a range of more than 100 miles. An operational weapon with similar characteristics might be able to engage a variety of targets rapidly in both offensive and defensive scenarios, including striking targets on land and at sea and shooting down enemy aircraft and incoming cruise missiles and maybe even ballistic missiles, which you can read about in more detail here . Just some of the possible missions the US Navy envisions for its future railguns., USN This is a multi-mission capability far beyond what the five-inch guns on the service’s existing Ticonderoga -class cruisers and Arleigh Burke -class destroyers can achieve. Those weapons fire shells at less than half the speed of the Navy’s prototype railgun even with the largest propellant charges available. And the railgun doesn’t require any chemical propellant at all. As such, an operational weapon could give ships more magazine depth, free up space for additional systems, and might reduce various logistics costs over time. It’s true that the overall funding for the railgun project has seen a downward trend in recent years. In its budget proposal for the 2015 fiscal year, the service asked for nearly $47 million just for the railgun. This was down to less than $20 million two years later and there have since been reports that the Navy might be looking for a way to kill off the project entirely. But without knowing the exact rationale behind those fluctuations or the exact fiscal requirements needed to reach the program’s goals during those years, it’s impossible to say that this actually reflects a change in the Navy’s commitment to the revolutionary technology. Deferring the at-sea test would have significantly changed the budget outlay by itself without necessarily having an impact on other parts of the research and development effort. Relatively small, high-tech projects like the railgun program often have non-linear budgets to begin with on account of the need for protracted test cycles interspersed with bursts of new developments. And the Navy has worked hard to broaden the appeal of the effort by separating out the projectile portion and working to develop a High Velocity Projectile (HVP) that would work in both the railgun and conventional cannons. The service says the streamlined design should still be able to reach Mach 3 with a chemical propellent charge, much faster than traditional rounds. Since these inert shells would work in railguns, naval guns, and U.S. Army and Marine Corps howitzers, it could also help share the cost burden of development, as well as expanding the capabilities of existing weapons in the near term. The proposed multi-weapon HVP concept., USN The reality of electromagnetic weapons might be getting too hard for the Navy or other the rest of the U.S. military not to prioritize, anyways. In January 2018, images emerged of what is very likely a Chinese prototype railgun on a test ship. We don’t know how functional this system might be, but it could put the Chinese ahead of its American counterparts in demonstrating a realistic capability in this regard. Chinese developments in the realm of hypersonic weapons broadly, including both electromagnetic cannons and hypersonic boost glide vehicles and missiles , have already been significant. It only reinforces what we at The War Zone and others have been warning about when it comes to China’s rapidly expanding advanced weapons development programs , as well as its ability to actually field many of those systems. All of this in support of the country’s desire to continue moving from a regional power to major player on the international stage . What is very likely an electromagnetic railgun in a turn on the bow of the Chinese Type 072III-class landing ship Haiyang Shan. , Chinese Internet “We need to continue to pursue that [technology] in a most aggressive way,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, in charge of all American military operations across the Pacific, told members of the House Armed Services Committee on Feb. 14, 2017 . “[We must] develop our own hypersonic offensive weapons.” The Navy had likely firmed up most of its latest request well before the Chinese revealed their own apparent prototype railgun, but many senior officials and legislators share Harris’ views already. This might lead lawmakers to try and plus up the Navy’s budget when it comes to the railgun project, as well as funding for other hypersonic weapons and defenses across the U.S. military. Regardless, China’s developments are only unlikely to underscore the long-standing service’s desire to put even a prototype system on board a ship as soon as possible. Depending on how eager the Navy and its supporters in Congress are, and how mature the technology actually is at present, we may see a surge in railgun developments in future budgets, and possibly even before then. One thing is clear, the Navy isn’t throwing out its railgun anytime soon. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 29, 2020",The US Air Force Wants a Trio of More Modern WC-135R Nuke Sniffing Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In its latest budget request, the U.S. Air Force is asking for hundreds of millions of dollars to turn three KC-135R aerial refueling tankers into specialized WC-135R atmospheric reconnaissance aircraft as its already rickety WC-135W Constant Phoenix jets become increasingly unreliable. Those aircraft collect air samples after nuclear weapon tests and atomic accidents , a somewhat obscure, but vital mission that has only become more important in recent years, especially in light of North Korea’s test of an apparent thermonuclear device in 2017. The Air Force’s proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year, which the service released on Feb. 12, 2018, includes more than $208 million to modify the four engine KC-135Rs tankers with the same “mission sensor system” as the WC-135Ws. The 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, better known by its nickname Big Safari, would manage the conversions of the tankers to the new WC-135R standard. It’s not clear when those aircraft will be ready for service, but the service already plans to request almost $8 million in additional funds for the project in the 2020 fiscal cycle. “These conversions are needed to address airframe viability concerns associated with the aging WC-135W fleet,” the budget proposal explains. “Analysis determined that it was more cost effective to convert KC-135R aircraft into WC-135Rs than to modify existing WC-135W aircraft to be on par with the rest of the C-135 variants (i.e. RC-135 and KC-135).” A standard KC-135R aerial tanker., USAF The biggest difference between the basic KC-135R and the WC-135W airframes are their engines. The Air Force’s KC-135Rs are upgrades of older aerial tankers with the more powerful and fuel efficient CFM-56 turbofan engines in place of the older types. The two WC-135Ws each have four less efficient and reliable Pratt & Whitney TF-33s , a design that first entered production in 1959 and that the company stopped making in 1985. Otherwise, the Air Force long ago developed the Constant Phoenix’s mission equipment, and any auxiliary power sources it requires, to fit inside a C-135-series frame. Unlike the service’s RC-135S Cobra Ball , RC-135V/W Rivet Joint , and RC-135U Combat Sent surveillance and spy planes, the WC-135s do not have or need dramatic external modifications. A profile shot of an WC-135W Constant Phoenix on the ground show its relatively clean external configuration. The air sampling pod is visible on the side of the fuselage above the wing., USAF It’s actually not the first time the Air Force has converted KC-135s into atmospheric sampling aircraft. In the 1960s, the service modified two of the refueling tankers into covert nuclear reconnaissance jets . Under the guise of long range training exercises, they flew missions from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii along with regular KC-135As all the way to French Polynesia and back to gather data about France’s open-air nuclear tests . A mushroom cloud after the explosion of a French atomic bomb above the atoll of Mururoa, also known as Aopuni in 1971. From 1966 until 1996 this was the French testing ground for 193 bombs which detonated first in the atmosphere then underground. French Polynesia, Pacific., Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty Images Depending on what KC-135Rs serve as the donor airframes, the Air Force might be able to get other significant upgrades onto the WC-135R aircraft without having to spend any additional money. The service is already in the process of upgrading the aerial tankers to the new Block 45 standard , with all-new glass cockpits complete with a large main digital display, as well as variety of other improved digital and analog controls. You can read more about that update program here . But even with just CFM-56 engines, the WC-135R aircraft should be able to fly further or orbit certain areas for longer periods without having to link up with a tanker (assuming it gets a receptacle slipway) or return to base to refuel than the existing WC-135Ws. The newer aircraft would also be more reliable, too. One of the Constant Phoenix aircraft spent a week grounded in Indonesia in 2017 after an engine fire forced it to make an emergency landing. The addition of more aircraft could add much needed flexibility to the fleet overall, as well. Officially, the Constant Phoenix jets’ main job is to help enforce the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , under which members agree to abstain from above ground nuclear weapon testing. Crews from the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska fly the two remaining WC-135Ws, while specialized personnel from the secretive Air Force Technical Applications Center ( AFTAC ) operate the mission sensor system on board the aircraft. But these hybrid crews and their planes often take on other missions since there are no other atmospheric sampling aircraft anywhere else in the U.S. military. The budget proposal specifically cites the “rapidly changing global threat environment” and “emerging requirements” from regional U.S. military commands and the Intelligence Community as key reasons for acquiring the more modern WC-135Rs. The biggest of those changing threats is almost certainly North Korea, which conducted its first known nuclear weapons test in 2006 . Since then, WC-135Ws have been a regular feature near the Korean Peninsula, flying missions from Kadena Air Base in Japan. Now that the North Koreans have test fired multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles , demonstrated what was likely a thermonuclear weapon , and have threatened to conduct the first atmospheric nuclear weapons test in decades, the unique capabilities the Constant Phoenix jets offer are to only continue to be in high demand in East Asia. Beyond North Korea, with fears of greater nuclear proliferation happening around the globe in the future, the aircraft could be essential in keeping tabs on possible emerging nuclear powers. With three more reliable aircraft, not to mention an extra airframe, the Air Force could decide to have one forward deployed, such as to Japan, on a more permanent basis, while having two others available for routine and crisis missions elsewhere in the world, as well as scheduled maintenance. The latter missions might not be related to nuclear weapons or arms control, either. After the Tōhoku earthquake and the devastating resulting tsunami in 2011 caused severe damage and a series of meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, a WC-135W flew missions from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska to help monitor the spread of radioactivity. US Air Force personnel in protective suits give a thumbs down indicating that this WC-135W Constant Phoenix needed decontamination after flying over Japan following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011., USAF More recently, in February 2017, another Constant Phoenix deployed to RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom and flew missions in the North Sea around the same time as reports emerged about an unexplained spike in the amount of radioactive iodine-131 in the atmosphere originating from Russia’s northwestern Kola Peninsula. The region is home to both nuclear power facilities and nuclear waste dumps, as well as Russia’s Northern fleet, which features nuclear submarines and ships, any of which could potentially suffer a leak. “This has been planned for a long time and we didn’t go there to look for this iodine,” Colonel Jonathan VanNoord, AFTAC’s Director of Operations told Stars and Stripes in March 2017. “We need to get the background levels so if an event were to happen, we know where that baseline is. We just need to make sure that we’re getting the background and knowing what’s happening around the world and what changes are happening in the atmosphere.” But whether that mission was really routine or not, the Air Force’s WC-135s clearly provide a set of important capabilities and putting the Constant Phoenix equipment into more modern airframes will ensure the service can continue perform this unique mission reliably as time goes on.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 20, 2019",Here’s Why General Atomics Teamed Up With Boeing For The MQ-25 Tanker Drone Tender,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has announced it will team up with Boeing to compete for the contract to build the first four MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based tanker drones for the U.S. Navy if it wins the competition, though the latter firm says it will also pursue its own individual proposal , as well. This follows the service dropping something of a bombshell in its latest budget request, stating that, at best, it will only buy four of the Stingrays over the next six years and that a possible larger buy of 68 will only come some time after that, if it happens at all. After we wrote this article Tyler Rogoway talked with General Atomics about their partnership plans and their MQ-25 contender. Our findings from that interview are included at the bottom of this piece. On Feb. 12, 2018, General Atomics revealed the partnership with Boeing in a press release that also named a half dozen other companies that it would be working with on its MQ-25 bid. Pratt & Whitney will supply its PW815 high bypass turbofan engine, UTC Aerospace systems will design the landing gear, L3 Technologies will be responsible for the satellite and line-of-sight control and data links, BAE Systems will craft portions of the unmanned aircraft’s software, Rockwell Collins will provide its AN/ARC-210 radio, and GKN Aerospace’s Fokker division is on hand to design and build the arresting hook. In a statement to The War Zone, Boeing said this arrangement would not stop it from submitting its own proposal to the Navy, meaning that the General Atomics’ led group will still be up against Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Northrop Grumman decided not to compete for the Stingray contract in October 2017. “As the world’s premier quick reaction unmanned aircraft system manufacturer, we are committed to delivering the most effective, affordable, sustainable, and adaptable carrier-based aerial refueling system at the lowest technical and schedule risk,” David Alexander, President of General Atomics, said in the press release. “We look forward to supporting GA [General Atomics] with our aviation and autonomous experience.” Boeing Autonomous Systems Vice President and General Manager Chris Raymond, added in the same statement. General Atomics It’s not clear what this could mean for the team’s final MQ-25 proposal. General Atomics had been first to show concept art of a full design, which looked to be a derivative of its Sea Avenger concept that it had proposed to the Navy as part of its earlier Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program. Boeing had been the first to present a semi-functional full-scale prototype with an entirely different planform, notably including some stealthy features, including a rare flush dorsal jet intake , and the company will continue development of that design separately. In another statement to The War Zone, Boeing said that it would not disclose any specifics about its present working relationship with General Atomics, but that it would likely refine the exact details of its partnership if its competitor wins the competition. Boeing had previously demonstrated semi-autonomous unmanned aircraft operations with its X-45-series and the Decision Mission-Control software, or DICE, in early to mid-2000s. But if nothing else, Boeing brings decades worth of experience working with and supplying aircraft to the Navy. The Chicago-based plane maker reportedly sees the competition as a “must win” situation and this arrangement would give them a chance to be involved at least to some degree even if they lose out to General Atomics. We don’t know how this could impact Lockheed Martin’s proposal, which so far has not been made public to any serious degree. The extent of Lockheed Martin’s official concept artwork for its MQ-25 proposal to date., Lockheed Martin The General Atomics’ industry team also makes perfect sense given the Navy’s very public push for competitors to use as many commercial-of-the-shelf and otherwise existing components and technologies as possible in order reduce risk and shorten the aircraft’s development cycle. The Navy’s approach of buying a very small number of MQ-25s initially for a firm, fixed price does indeed mitigate some risks, chiefly ensuring the design is fully functional before proceeding with a larger purchase order. At the same time, that the field of competitors for the MQ-25 seems to keep shrinking isn’t surprising, either. The problem with the Navy’s present course of action plan, as we at the War Zone have noted before , is that it might be less risky for the service, but potentially much more so for any company interested in building the aircraft. If the firms competing for the Stingray deal had any concerns about the project’s viability, the Navy will have only magnified them by establishing a painfully slow schedule for the project, which it outlined when it released its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year on Feb. 12, 2018. Though it plans to award the initial MQ-25 engineering and development contract by the end of 2018, a chart in a briefing the Navy showed to members of the press at Pentagon noted that it only expects to have four MQ-25s in its possession by 2023. This is in line with a plan U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mark Darrah, the head of the unmanned aviation and strike weapons program office at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), first disclosed in November 2017 . Boeing’s MQ-25 prototype., Boeing But tucked away in the proposed budget’s fine print, a more detailed explanation says the “objective” time frame for the Stingrays to reach initial operational capability is 2024, but that might end up delayed until 2026. How four MQ-25s represents an operational capability of any kind is unclear. The Navy has said this is the minimum number for a single, complete unmanned system, which allows for one aircraft to be on station, another heading out to take up the refueling orbit, and other returning to the carrier to refuel itself, with a fourth drone in reserve. More importantly, it says that the firm or firms that win the initial contract won’t have to build all four aircraft up front, stating that the funds – all of which are in the research and development portion rather than the procurement section – will support work on just two “demonstrator model” prototypes, which are only supposed to have their first flights by the end of 2021. If there’s one positive in the line items for the MQ-25 in the Navy’s fiscal year 2019 budget proposal, which it now describes simply as “Unmanned Carrier Aviation,” or UCA, is that the drones should have a built-in persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability from the start. A series of reports in 2017 suggested the Navy was looking to water down the MQ-25’s capabilities even further and either scale down or eliminate the drone’s secondary intelligence gathering mission. “MQ-25 will be designed to conduct aerial refueling and ISR missions,” according to the budget request documents. “Sensor data will be transmitted at appropriate classification levels, to exploitation nodes afloat and ashore.” The US Navy’s aircraft procurement plans for the fiscal year 2018 to 2023 time frame, as of February 2018., USN Unfortunately, at present, the firm or firms that win the MQ-25 engineering and development contract would get a guaranteed order of just four aircraft over at least the next six years, and possibly longer. That need to commit significant time and money up front developing an unmanned system that the Navy might not ultimately buy at all in significant numbers – the service says it reserves the right to abort the project and start again if the drones don’t live up to expectations – is likely a major reason why Northrop Grumman dropped out of the competition entirely. And this six-year schedule is only if the program continues as planned. As noted, the actual delivery schedule calls for the contractor to supply just half the already tiny number of aircraft within three years. With how many times the Navy’s unmanned carrier projects have morphed over the past decade, its not hard to imagine shifting priorities yet again in a three to six year time frame. The social realities within the naval aviation community with regards to a future full of high-end unmanned aircraft flying from carrier decks is also a glaring issue few like to discuss. The Navy has already been publicly working on developing a major carrier-based unmanned aircraft capability for around two decades, having initially paired up with the U.S. Air Force on the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems ( J-UCAS ) program in the early 2000s and subsequently kicking off its own Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator ( UCAS-D ) project. Between 2011 and 2015, the service extensively evaluated a pair of Northrop Grumman X-47B drones , including tests showing off revolutionary autonomous carrier landings and takeoffs and the pilotless planes’ ability to link up with an aerial refueling tanker. That was supposed to be a precursor to a fully fledged program to develop a fleet of stealth, deep-penetrating strike and reconnaissance drones as part of the UCLASS program. The Navy eventually changed those requirements entirely and shifted the drone’s primary focus to acting as an unmanned flying gas station , known as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), to support a carrier air wing’s manned aircraft, which has now become the UCA program. It’s a saga you can read about in depth in this detailed feature by The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway here . One of Northrop Grumman’s experimental X-47Bs lands on board a US Navy aircraft carrier during a test., USN Now the service is pushing the possibility of having a useful MQ-25 fleet even further into the future. This is all especially notable since senior service officials have made comments in public stressing the already pressing need to free up up Super Hornets from the job of acting as smaller aerial tankers for the rest of the carrier air wing. This is added to the increasing strain on Super Hornets across the Navy in general. In October 2017, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, the service’s top aviation officer, made the shocking announcement that only just more than 30 percent of the service’s Super Hornets were ready for combat at any given times and approximately 50 percent of the total fleet was airworthy at all on average. On top of those abysmal availability numbers, the Navy estimates that a the Super Hornets a carrier can get into the air spend between 20 and 30 percent of their time on refueling . The Navy does want to buy 110 additional Super Hornets over the next five years, with 24 in its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, but that wouldn’t obviate the clear benefits of the MQ-25, even if it’s a far cry from the potentially game-changing capabilities the proposed stealthy UCLASS drones would have given each carrier air wing. The Stingrays would still free up more F/A-18E/Fs for combat air patrols and strike missions and extend the overall range of those force packages. The latter point is only becoming more important as both near-peer and smaller potential adversaries continue to expand the range and scope of their defense networks, which could force a carrier to launch its aircraft from further away in order to better shield itself from enemy counter-attacks. The MQ-25 will “We’re going to move forward with our strategy,” Rear Admiral Darrah insisted in November 2017. “[We] feel  we’re in a good position with whoever remains behind to give us a proposal.” The question now is when that strategy might actually produce the results the service needs already. Update: After talking with General Atomics MQ-25 program manager Chuck Wright and communications manager Melissa Haynes we got a clearer view as to why the company paired with Boeing, one of its primary competitors for the MQ-25 tender, as well as what we can expect from their UCA design. Wright made it clear that in his opinion Boeing is going forward with the pairing because it increases their chances of some sort of a win when it comes to the MQ-25 competition, stating “winning the whole thing is great, but a slice of a team is also great too.” Considering Boeing apparently sees this as a must win for them, hedging by agreeing to work with General Atomics if they are victorious does make good sense. During our conversation, Chuck Wright laid out a number of reasons why General Atomics saw it as beneficial to add Boeing to their MQ-25 team. These included the fact that Boeing has a large unused facility that would be well suited for producing the MQ-25—a major expense saved if General Atomics were to win the MQ-25 competition—and that it could also potentially facilitate the production of other systems in the future. Boeing highly diverse manufacturing expertise was also not lost on General Atomics. The fact that Boeing has a long standing relationship with the Navy and has huge experience particularly in the systems integration, aircraft test and evaluation, and carrier suitability space is seen as a huge benefit should General Atomics get the shot at executing on their MQ-25 proposal. As Wright put it, Boeing has a “well deserved reputation for knowing what needs to be done” when it comes to bringing a naval aviation program through to fruition, especially one that has to operate in the confines and harsh environment of an aircraft’s carrier’s deck and hangar bay. Above all else, the two defense contractors have been talking for years about how and when to cooperate on new mutually beneficial projects, and General Atomics’ MQ-25 initiative seemed to suit the bill nicely. As for the company’s MQ-25 prototype itself, which we have only seen in artists renderings as of yet, it is slated to be unveiled in just two months. Like all the UCA competitors, General Atomics had worked hard on developing an aircraft to satisfy the Navy’s earlier UCLASS requirements, which was for a more advanced penetrating reconnaissance and strike unmanned aircraft. Then the seagoing service canceled that set of requirements in favor of an unmanned tanker with much more limited surveillance capabilities and no strike or penetrating abilities at all. As such, its design emanates from the Sea Avenger UCLASS concept, which itself was a derivative of the stealthy Predator C/Avenger land-based unmanned aircraft that has been flying for years. But it’s not like General Atomics UCA entrant is just an Avenger with a tailhook and a buddy refueling pod slapped on it. The highly altered design came to be thanks to advanced software tools where engineers could reconfigure nearly limitless iterations of the basic design based on many variables and requirements. Since the Navy wants the aircraft to “carry a lot of fuel, a long ways” as Wright put it, major changes like a much more voluminous overall design and more efficient powerplant came into play. Wright says the General Atomics engineers built a lot of margin into their design as well and really optimized it as best as possible to meet the UCA mission. With all this in mind, we’ll just have to sit tight for a couple of months to see General Atomics’ MQ-25 in the flesh for ourselves.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 17, 2019",USAF’s New Bomber Roadmap Could Bust-Up Key Arms Control Treaty With the Russians,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of its latest budget request, the U.S. Air Force has outlined a plan to almost double the size of its nuclear bomber force. What isn’t clear is how this course of action fits within the very hard limits on such aircraft set out in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, one of many bilateral arms control agreements between United States and Russia. Earlier in February 2018, the Air Force disclosed a controversial concept to steadily replace its 20 B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and 60 B-1 Bone swing-wing bombers on a one-for-one basis with stealthy B-21 Raiders as those new aircraft enter service. The service wants to purchase at least an additional 20 B-21s, and possibly more, for a full fleet of at least 100 Raiders. At the same time, the 75 iconic B-52H Stratofortresses , more commonly known as the Big Ugly Fat Fellow or BUFF, will continue to fly at least until 2050. According to 2019 budget documents , and to our documents we previously received via FOIA , the B-21 will be built with nuclear capability, with the aircraft ready for nuclear operations within two years of its initial operating capability. The roadmap would give the Air Force a total bomber force of around 175 aircraft for at least 14 years, between 2036 and 2050. In 2036, the last of the B-1s are supposed to head to the bone yard, with the B-2s having gone there first four years earlier. The service hasn’t made it clear what will happen to the B-52 fleet after 2050, at which time the youngest airframes will have been in service for nearly 90 years. But what is obvious is that even 175 bombers is significantly more than the Air Force has at present and could upend the composition of the U.S. military’s nuclear triad, which includes the B-2 and B-52, as well as Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBCM) and Trident D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), each of which can hold up to a dozen individual warheads, and the Ohio- class nuclear submarines that carry them. The United States and Russia can only have 700 nuclear-capable ballistic missiles and bombers in total under New START . In 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev signed the New START deal. In addition to the restrictions on total deployed delivery systems, the treaty also limits the parties to 1,550 deployed “warheads,” with each re-entry vehicle on top of a missile and each individual bomber counting as a single warhead. The agreement does not cover smaller delivery platforms and weapons, such as multi-role fighter jets carrying nuclear gravity bombs or nuclear-capable artillery systems . For each bomber the Air Force wants to add, the U.S. military would have to tweak the number of ICBMs and SLBMs it has to remain compliant with New START. And that wouldn’t mean just putting extra missiles in a warehouse somewhere, either. The treaty includes a provision that both the United States and Russia can’t have more than 800 functional launch tubes for ballistic missiles – land-based silos or launch vehicles or individual launchers on submarines – or bombers, even if they’re not active. The idea behind that requirement is specifically to prevent either side from building up a reserve “breakout” capability that would allow them to immediately field a significantly larger nuclear force if the deal lapses or collapses. It’s worth noting that the Air Force does keep a number of B-52Hs stored in a semi-active condition in order to replace losses, which already count toward that extended total. The United States could choose one of a number of options to make the Air Force’s bomber plans work within the context of New START. It may seem like one solution would be to have Northrop Grumman deliver a nuclear-capable B-21A and a non-nuclear B-21B. A US Air Force B-1 Bone at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam in December 2017., USAF In preparation for New START and its force restrictions, the Air Force already modified its B-1s to remove any nuclear capability and make it difficult, though not impossible to restore that functionality. This process involved cutting out wiring and other control systems to arm nuclear weapons, as well as physically destroying the special pylons that would have carried in its bomb bays. Of course, this conversion program was relatively straight forward since the Air Force performed the modifications across the entire fleet of Bones and disposed of the nuclear weapons related equipment for the aircraft entirely. It would require significantly more time and money to develop a non-nuclear B-21 variant that the U.S. military could not readily convert into a nuclear-capable bomber in order to avoid immediate complaints from Russia about possible New START. More importantly, it would open up the B-21s to a rigorous inspection regime that could give the Russians an opportunity to glean other details about their construction and capabilities. Each year, Russia sends experts to physically check to make sure the Air Force’s B-1s are still in compliance with the treaty. This makes the idea a virtual non-starter and very likely explains why the Air Force abandoned earlier plans to take delivery of non-nuclear B-21s initially and add in a nuclear weapons delivery capability later. A B-52H with the tail number 61-007 arrives at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma in 2016. The service brought the aircraft, nicknamed “Ghost Rider,” out of storage and back to service after an active BUFF suffered a disastrous fire. , USAF The Air Force could also reduce the number of new ICBMs it is planning on buying as part of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program. Those new missiles are set to replace the entire Minuteman III force, but we don’t know if that will be on a one-for-one basis. The United States will get some room to maneuver with New START’s limits as it replaces its existing Ohio -class ballistic missile submarines with the Columbia -class . The latter boats have only 16 tubes for Trident D-5 SLBMs compared to the Ohio -class’ 24. However, the U.S. government’s latest Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which heavily emphasizes those boats as central to its new, flexible “tailored deterrence” model, proposes development of two new types of nuclear weapons – a modified Trident D-5 with lower yield warheads and a nuclear-tipped submarine launched cruise missile, or SLCM – for them. You can read more about those developments here . Depending on how many warheads the reconfigured Trident D-5s actually carry and how the New START treaty applies to the nuclear SLCM, there could be even more room for additional bombers or they could end up pushing the United States over New START’s limits. There’s no guarantee that the U.S. military will actually field those submarine-based options, either. The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland fires a Trident D-5 during an exercise., USN There is also the possibility that President Donald Trump and his administration are working under assumption that New START will lapse and the issue will become moot. The treaty will expire on Feb. 5, 2021, though there is an option to extend it through to 2026. After that, the two countries would need to negotiate a new deal. The Air Force seems to already be planning its bomber fleet independent of the treaty’s restrictions. “Our approach to it is – it’s an early decision – we know we’re going to need at least 100 [B-21s], we’ll possibly need more than that,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Requirements, told the lawmakers in May 2017 . “We do agree that probably 165 bombers [in total] is what we need to have.” Given the overall poor state of U.S.-Russian relations at present, the U.S. government might try to turn the bomber strategy into a negotiation tactic to try and get the Kremlin to concede more in any follow-on treaty or goad it into actually abiding by existing agreements. Though the Kremlin vehemently denies the accusations, the United States says it is in violation of its obligations under the original START and New START and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , with the RS-24 Yars ICBM and the SSC-8 ground-launched nuclear-capable cruise missile respectively. Earlier in February 2018, Russia also permanently deployed the nuclear-capable Iskander-M road-mobile short-range ballistic missile system to its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea, a controversial, but not banned move it had threatened to make years ago in response to Poland hosting U.S. military anti-ballistic missile defense sites . As such, the United States has increasingly adopted the position that it could use its own treaty-busting developments to push the Russians back into compliance. American lawmakers have already ordered the U.S. military to study what it would take to develop and field a land-based missile system, conventional or nuclear, that violates the INF. In comments to reporters on Feb. 1, 2018, Greg Weaver, Deputy Director for Strategic Stability in the U.S. Military’s Joint Staff Strategic Plans and Policy Directorate, or J5, also floated the idea of cancelling the proposed submarine-launched cruise missile in the NPR if Russia were to come back into compliance with the INF. “I want to make certain that our negotiators have something to negotiate with, that we want Russia back into compliance [with the INF],” Secretary of Defense James Mattis during a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee on Feb. 6, 2018. “We do not want to forgo the INF, but at the same time we have options if Russia continues to go down this path.” But using the different nuclear weapon systems as bargaining chips could be risky propositions that could just as easily trigger an arms race rather than reductions in kind. We at the War Zone already examined the factors at play with the INF in depth, a failure of which could have a cascading impact on a variety of bilateral and multinational arms control agreements that the United States and Russia are party to. Those same conclusions could just as readily apply to New START collapsing or United States being unable to negotiate a follow-on deal. The transporter erector launcher for the Iskander-M, at right, next to the specialized reloading vehicle using the same chassis. This vehicle is also reportedly the basis for the INF-breaking SSC-8 nuclear cruise missile., Vitaly Kuzmin The Kremlin has already put a “moratorium” on compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which sets limits on how many troops it can have arrayed along its western borders. The United States says it has been abusing the Open Skies agreement , which allows for legal surveillance operations over member countries in the interests of transparency, as well. The U.S. government says the Kremlin wants to gather more intelligence than the spirit of the agreement allows for and that it has been unfairly impeding overflights of its own territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin has routinely indicated that he believes many of the deals with Soviet Union, or the initial Russian successors, cut with the United States no longer apply or that the U.S. government has actively exploited them for its own gains. Regardless of whether those grievances are real or a way to excuse Russia’s increasingly belligerent foreign policy, they do appear to be the underlying rationale for the country’s flurry of strategic weapons developments . The Air Force’s plan to practically double the size of its nuclear bomber force could compel the Kremlin to reconsider its own courses of action, or it could simply reinforce the idea that agreements like New START are increasingly irrelevant.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 11, 2019",The Army Eyes Getting Into The Ship Killing Business With This Cruise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. military rolls out its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, one area that is likely to see newly increased attention is the development and purchase of land-based anti-ship weapons. The U.S. Army is already planning to sink a target ship with a truck-mounted anti-ship cruise missile in a major exercise as concerns grow about both near-peer and smaller states expanding their ability to control strategic waterways around the world, especially China’s militarization of the South China Sea . In January 2018, Navy Recognition confirmed that the Army would fire at least one Naval Strike Missile (NSM) at a decommissioned ship from a launcher on the back of a 10×10 Palletized Load System (PLS) truck during Rim of Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018, a massive annual U.S.-run international maritime drill that typically occurs near Hawaii in the summer. It’s not clear whether or not the launcher is on a self-contained pallet, but such an arrangement could allow the vehicle to either fire it after moving to a specific location or unload it so troops have established a temporary fixed launch site. Poland already fields a land-based version of the NSM, but using a different type of truck. Norwegian firm Kongsberg designed the NSM, which it now builds in cooperation with American defense contractor Raytheon. “We think that the emphasis on cross domain and bringing all shooters together in a distributed fashion to mass on a target or targets provides a wonderful opportunity, we are just really excited about it,” Gary Holst, Senior Director of Business Development at Kongsberg told Navy Recognition at the Surface Navy Association’s 2018 National Symposium in Washington, D.C. “The missile, no matter where you shoot it from, can hit moving targets at sea or can hit a target stationary ashore so it is designed from the get go to be a cross domain capable weapon,” Tom Copeman, Vice President of Business Development at Raytheon Missile Systems Air Warfare Systems division, added. Kongsberg art depicting a NSM launcher on the back of a PLS truck., US Army The NSM is primarily a sub-sonic, sea-skimming anti-ship cruise missile that can hit targets up to 100 miles away. It uses a combination of GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition to get the target area, then uses an infrared imaging seeker to home in on the ship in the final stages of its flight. The missile can discriminate between its intended target and other objects by running what that camera sees against an internal database of potential target types, improving its overall accuracy. It has a terrain-following functionality that means it can fly from launch positions well inland and dodge mountains, hills, and other similar obstacles, even before it gets to the open water. As such, it also has a secondary land-attack mode, making it a multi-purpose weapon that could further expand Army capabilities . On top of that, it uses composite materials and low-observable design features to better hide it from enemy sensors as it approaches the target area. The NSM also makes random course changes during its terminal flight phase to make it more difficult for close-in weapon systems to shoot it down. The video below shows a live-fire test of an NSM from a ship-mounted launcher. The U.S. Navy is already actively considering the missile as an option for a variety of ships, including its planned new class of frigates . Relatively easy to install deck-mounted launchers mean the service might be able to quickly add them to existing Littoral Combat Ships , amphibious ships supporting U.S. Marine expeditionary operations and maybe even logistics vessels and sea bases . A follow-on development, the Joint Strike Missile , could be a future option for the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A and Navy’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, as well as other foreign countries operating the A variant. But a mobile, land-based version of the system would give the Army an anti-ship capability that it has lacked in any form for decades. The service shut down its Coast Artillery Corps entirely in 1950, shifting the focus of those units to air defense. This made a certain amount of sense at the time, with the U.S. military having a dominating presence on the world’s oceans and there being a very limited threat to American coastlines from enemy surface warships. At the same time, China , Russia , and other potential adversaries who have had concerns about such attacks developed or otherwise acquired increasingly advanced shore-based anti-ship weaponry. And since the end of the Cold War, though, that United States’ clear naval advantage has steadily eroded, especially in the Pacific where China has dramatically improved both the size and capabilities of its surface fleets as it expands it territorial claims in regions such as the South China Sea and East China Sea . Chinese YJ-62 land-based anti-ship missile launchers during a parade in 2015., Imaginechina via AP In a crisis, Chinese aircraft carriers , advanced destroyers , and other warships , could be an important components of the country’s ability to control large maritime areas and deny its opponents access. On top of that, China’s military is increasingly boasting an array of other formidable anti-access and area denial capabilities, including its own-shore based anti-ship missiles, advanced manned and unmanned aircraft , ballistic missiles , surface-to-air missiles, and long-range sensors . Taken together these dense defensive networks could present a significant challenge to American operations in the Pacific. They could easily limit the ability of U.S. forces to maneuver using traditional sea- and land-based capabilities, including the U.S. Navy’s own aircraft carriers and overseas territories such as the island of Guam , which is host to vitally strategic port and air base facilities. They could similarly slow the U.S. military’s ability to respond if an ally, such as Taiwan , came under attack. Land-based anti-ship missiles and associated land-based sensors, including sea search radars, would give the U.S. military another important option to defend its own possessions, as well as rush to reinforce allies or otherwise break through area denial threats during operations. They might even have a deterrent effect on immediate Chinese activities by forcing them to consider the limits to their own freedom of movement during a potential crisis. “The goal to provide joint solutions between sensors and shooters at the tactical level across multiple domains, this is juice worth the squeeze,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, said in a speech at the Land Forces in the Pacific Symposium in Hawaii in 2017. “A forward-deployed ground force can create temporal windows of opportunity to gain superiority in multiple domains that will allow the other components to kill the enemy more effectively.” A map showing the extensive range of numerous Chinese short-range conventional ballistic missile and surface-to-air missiles the country could bring to bear during a crisis over Taiwan., DOD In addition, the goal is for these mobile ship-killing weapons to eventually be able to sync up with sensor nodes across the services, including those on board ships , manned and unmanned aircraft , and even in space , to quickly locate and engage enemy targets. This broader network, which would also include non-traditional platforms such as the F-35 , could add even more flexibility to Army anti-ship units by giving them access to a more distributed array of information or allowing them to engage targets well beyond the range of any organic capabilities. Future variants of the NSM will likely have a two-way data link, meaning that various sensor nodes would be able to feed course corrections to the weapon in flight to improve the missile’s accuracy and help it dodge threats in flight. This is already a planned feature on the air-launched Joint Strike Missile. “The end result of my challenge shouldn’t be a simple exercise where we all high five at the end and then head back to the comforts of our services,” Harris added in his 2017 speech. “Service-specific systems must be able to talk to one another if any of this is going to achieve the effects that we’re looking for. Ideally we’ll get to a point where we see the Joint Force as a network of sensors and shooters allowing the best capability from any single service to provide cross domain fires.” That level of integration could be getting closer to reality already, especially with the Navy’s push to integrate the weapons and sensors on all of its ships, aircraft, and land based assets. The Army and other services could leverage the lessons learned with that project, known as the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air ( NIFC-CA ), to develop their own systems and increase the likelihood that they would be interoperable at least to some degree from the very beginning. Mobile anti-ship missiles would be a relatively rapidly deployable capability, too. In addition to give American forces more freedom to maneuver and given the NSM’s land-attack option, the Army might be able to send launchers to allied or partner countries in the South China Sea, such as The Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia, or Vietnam , and potentially hold some of China’s island outposts at threat directly. The Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, already trains with the U.S. Air Force to rapidly deploy the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) to remote or forward areas. These so-called HIMARS Rapid Infiltration (HIRAIN) exercises often involve loading one of the truck-mounted launchers into a C-17 transport, flying it to a forward base, offloading it, and then having the vehicle’s crew either simulate or live-fire an actual rocket right from the tarmac. This same concept could work with wheeled anti-ship missile launchers to provide a rapid anti-ship defense anywhere in the world on relatively short notice. The video below shows a HIRAIN exercise at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea in 2017. Foreign partners could also join with the United States on developing and procuring such systems, which could help share the cost burdens. Japan is already slated to join the Army in the shore-based missile attack on the target ship during RIMPAC 2018 and is working on new air-launched land-attack cruise missiles in part to defend against increasing Chinese incursions in the East China Sea. And NSM is likely to be only one component of the Army’s anti-ship arsenal, as well. When it first became clear that the service was interested in getting back into the ship-killing mission in 2016, the immediate plan was to give existing Army Tactical Missile System ( ATACMS ) missiles, which have a range of 190 miles, a moving target capability. This program is still ongoing and would make these short-range quasi-ballistic missiles another possible anti-ship weapon . The Army can load one ATACMS into its wheeled M142 HIMARS and two into each of its larger M270 tracked Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) vehicles. In addition to NSM, Raytheon is in the process of developing the replacement for ATACMS as part of the Long Range Precision Fires program. It is very possible that those missiles, known as DeepStrike , could easily have a similar anti-ship capability as the modified ATACMS from the start. The Marine Corps is interested in acquiring an anti-ship missile system that will fit in the HIMARS launcher , as well, and could join with the Army in its development efforts, further sharing the burden of development and procurement costs. In 2017, the Marines demonstrated the ability to launch a standard 227mm guided artillery rocket from the deck of an amphibious ship using one of the truck-mounted systems, another employment concept that could be similarly impressive with a vehicle armed with ship-killing weapons. The basic specifications for Raytheon’s in-development DeepStrike missile., Raytheon In November 2017, the Army also expressed an interest in buying the Serbian Advanced Light Attack System ’s coastal defense variant, or ALAS-C, though it’s not clear whether those purchases would be for its own use or for foreign military sales. In 2013, the United Arab Emirates announced their intention to team up with the manufacturer EDePro, by way of the Serbia’s state-run Yugoimport SDPR arms broker, to build a light truck-mounted launcher using the 6×6 Nimr chassis. ALAS-C is wire-guided, but has an impressive range for a missile of this type, able to hit targets between 15 and 30 miles away. It has a man-in-the-loop guidance system where an actual operator steers it on its target in the terminal phase by way of an infrared camera in the weapon’s nose. The Israelis have been pioneers of this concept, which improves the accuracy, especially against moving targets and gives an actual person the ability to abort the attack very late in the missile’s flight in case of concerns about collateral damage or civilian casualties. ALAS at its core is actually very similar to Israel’s Spike-ER anti-tank missile , but has considerably greater range. The EDePro ALAS missile., Srđan Popović via Wikimedia If the Army did procure ALAS-C or a system like it, though it has relatively small warhead, it would offer another way of destroying smaller boats or landing craft . This level of anti-ship system could be useful for defending against more limited threats in constrained waterways, such as Russian missile-armed corvettes in the Baltic Sea or Black Sea or small Iranian watercraft and mining ships in the Strait of Hormuz . With a combination of NSM, anti-ship ATACMS or new Deep Strike missiles, and a short-range system such as ALAS-C, the Army could field a tiered, mobile anti-ship defense system that can engage a variety of different maritime threats. These systems could offer defense in depth at existing locations or the option of rapidly deploying the most appropriate weapon in case of a particular contingency. A six-round ALAS-C mobile launcher using the 6×6 Nimr chassis., Srđan Popović via Wikimedia The Army, along with its sister services, will almost certainly continue to iron out the exact requirements and concepts of operations for the different weapon systems in the coming months. As the number of potential threats continue to grow, the service won’t be able to wait too long to begin procuring and fielding this long neglected, but increasingly important capability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 25, 2019",Only U.S. Heavy Icebreaker Is Falling Apart On Antarctic Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Coast Guard’s only operational heavy icebreaker , the USCGC Polar Star , is still providing critical services to various U.S. government agencies in Antarctica despite suffering an engine failure and flooding. The incident is a worrying reminder of both how vital these types of ships are and the stark limitations of America’s capabilities in this regard, all as the service is struggling to move ahead with plans to buy all-new vessels. According to a press release the Coast Guard published on Feb. 6, 2018, Polar Star departed her homeport in Seattle on Nov. 30, 2017 for a cruise that is still scheduled to wrap up in March 2018. The ship’s main mission during the trip has been to cut a path from the open ocean through the ice, which can be 10 feet thick or more, to an improvised ice pier that serves the U.S. Antarctic Program ’s McMurdo Station. She has subsequently kept this channel clear of potentially dangerous ice so that other ships, including those under contract to the U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command, can safely bring supplies to and from the frigid base. “We had less ice this year than last year,” U.S. Coast Guard Captain Michael Davanzo, said in the press release. But “we had several engineering challenges to overcome to get to the point where we could position ourselves to moor in McMurdo.” “Engineering challenges” is a euphemism that doesn’t do justice to the problems Polar Star had to deal with just getting to McMurdo and the work that the ship’s crew did to make sure the ship could continue its mission. The first issue cropped up on Jan. 11, 2018 when one of the icebreakers three main gas turbines failed. The videos below are from Polar Star’s already problematic 2017-2018 cruise. The crew traced the problem to the ship’s 1970s-era electrical system, which was interfering with the electronic controls for the turbine. Between 2010 and 2012, Vigor Industrial in Seattle had performed a $62 million refit on the ship, which it appears left much of the original wiring intact. Despite locating the source of the trouble, the Coast Guard’s press release does not say that the crew had any means of repairing the fault and Polar Star pressed on to McMurdo with only two turbines. There’s no indication from that the crew has yet resolved the failure, though they continue to conduct their mission. The crew of the Polar Star work on the ship’s failed main turbine in January 2018., USCG Then, on Jan. 16, 2018, the seal on one of the ship’s three turbine shafts failed, letting 20 gallons of water per minute flow into the engineering compartment. This would be a serious problem under any circumstances, but the ambient temperatures in Antarctica , which might not get above freezing and can be below zero overnight in January, can only have made the situation more complicated. The crew did successfully get a emergency shaft seal in place and pumped out the compartment before performing more significant repairs. The Coast Guard says there were thankfully no injuries at all as a result of the malfunction. Polar Star ‘s three main propellers are visible in this picture of the ship in dry dock., USCG In spite of these issues, Polar Star safely escorted the cargo ship Ocean Giant and tanker Maersk Peary to and from McMurdo. But in the press release, U.S. Coast Guard Vice Admiral Fred Midgette, head of the service’s Pacific Area command, which has its headquarters in Alameda, California, did not mince words about what could have happened if the accidents had put the icebreaker out of commission, even temporarily. “If the Polar Star were to suffer a catastrophic mechanical failure, the nation would not be able to support heavy icebreaker missions like Operation Deep Freeze,” Midgette said, referring to the annual U.S. military operation that helps deliver essential supplies to the U.S. Antarctic Program by both sea and air. “Our nation has no [other] vessel capable of rescuing the crew if the icebreakers were to fail in the ice.” At present, the Coast Guard has a total of three icebreakers in its inventory, including the Polar Star . Unfortunately, her sister ship, USCGC Polar Sea , is now nothing more than a parts donor and its not seaworthy. The remaining ship, USCGC Healy , is a medium icebreaker, which can only cut through around eight feet of ice and serves largely as a research vessel. The National Science Foundation charters its own “ice-capable” research ship, the Nathaniel B. Palmer , for operations in Antarctica, but again, it cannot perform the same duties as the Polar -class vessels. The USCGC Healy helps free the Russian-flagged tanker Renda from ice near Nome, Alaska in 2012., USCGC The Coast Guard knows it’s in a precarious position and it’s been well aware of the situation for more than a decade. But despite repeated warnings and steadily growing concerns about Russia’s militarization of the Arctic region, the service has had trouble securing the funding to buy all-new icebreakers. Part of this stems from the curious bureaucratic position it occupies in the U.S. government as a uniformed military service outside of the Department of Defense. At the moment, the Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which has a far smaller overall budget than the military and no other components involved or otherwise interested in large shipbuilding projects who could possibly share the burden. The other problem is that no arm of the U.S. government has bought a heavy icebreaker in more than four decades. The smaller Healy , which is a much more modern design by comparison, is still nearly 20 years old. Building these ships is already a relatively specialized affair, which means hiring a shipyard to begin building a clean-sheet design will likely require significant time and funding. “We know if you have a hot production line the unit costs come down, then you build a new product,” U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft told a gathering at the annual WEST 2018 conference on Feb. 8, 2018. “New product is more expensive than what you’re already building.” A Penguin stands in front of Polar Star in Antarctica in January 2018., USCG As such, the Coast Guard has been working with the U.S. Navy to finalize a set of requirement that it hopes will keep the initial price tag as a low as possible, according to USNI News . Part of that plan might involve including trade space in the design that will sit empty at first, but end up full of equipment during later refits. One potential capability the service has already expressed an interest in is anti-ship cruise missiles and other weaponry, which could make the ships a more multi-purpose tool, especially in the Arctic. As already noted, Russia has dramatically expanded its military presence in that region, which has significant natural resource wealth and could open itself up to becoming an important shipping route as the polar ice melts as a result of global climate change. Russian developments include a host of new bases , coupled with deep-water ports, large airfields, and anti-aircraft and other defenses , all specifically tuned to the frigid environment. To support these sites, Russia has invested heavily in its own icebreaking fleet, which consist of around 40 total ships of various types, including huge nuclear-powered heavy icebreakers . The Kremlin is also planning to build a flotilla of ice-capable, anti-ship missile-armed corvettes and military support ships. Russia’s nuclear-powered icebreaker Taymyr ., Tuomas Romu via Wikimedia “We need to look differently at what an icebreaker does,” Zukunft told legislators during a hearing in May 2017. “U.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just power projection; it’s a matter of national security… If they remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of influence to over five million square miles of Arctic ice and water.” It’s not hard to see how a lack of icebreaking capability could limit the ability of the U.S. military to respond to a crisis in the Arctic or Antarctic regions. The U.S. Navy’s latest Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ship USS Little Rock has been stuck in Montreal, Canada since December 2017 and is likely to sit there pierside until at least some time in March 2018 , when the water warms up sufficiently to allow safe passage up the St. Lawrence Seaway and out into the Atlantic Ocean. USS Little Rock docked in Montreal, Canada on Dec. 16, 2017., USN The Coast Guard expects to release a formal request for proposals to shipbuilders for the first of three new heavy icebreakers by the end of February 2018. The service then hopes the winning company will be able to launch that ship some time in 2023, but wants to offer incentives to do so faster. There are also plans to buy three new medium icebreakers, as well. In his remarks in February 2018, Zukunft said that he believes a total fleet of six icebreakers of both types is “the right number,” but also appeared to indicate that this might not necessarily remain the case. Experts and advocates have questioned whether the medium icebreakers are really necessary and whether a fleet of four heavy icebreakers might offer a more cost effective and capable course of action for the Coast Guard. Of course, any shipbuilding plans are dependent on Congress decision to approve the necessary budget requests and then appropriate the funds to actually pay for the purchases. Lawmakers have already let the U.S. government briefly come to a formal halt twice since the beginning of 2018, but legislators did manage to pass a large two-year spending bill on Feb. 9, 2018, which President Donald Trump subsequently signed into law. President Donald Trump shakes hands with a member of the Coast Guard in September 2017., USCG Zukunft remains positive since a draft budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year does include money for his first icebreaker. However, as we’ve already noted, that’s no guarantee that Congress won’t make its own changes – which could involve subtracting or adding money for the project – or that it will be able to find the actual funds to get work on the ship going or keep it on schedule. The Coast Guard’s top officer is no doubt hopeful to get a surge of funds from President Trump, who has promised to significantly increase defense spending and also repeatedly praised the Coast Guard in the wake of a series of devastating hurricanes in 2017. “There’s no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard,” Trump said in November 2017 at Thanksgiving event. “What a job you’ve done.” But until a new heavy icebreaker actually comes online, the Coast Guard will have no choice but to keep sending Polar Star out to sea and relying heavily on the determination of her crew to keep her running.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 17, 2019",USAF Orders More Upgraded Massive Ordnance Penetrator Bombs Amid Tensions with North Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force will pay Boeing nearly $21 million to build more of the service’s heaviest conventional bomb, the GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, following successful tests of a new variant that includes an improved fuze. The huge bunker busters would be an essential component of any strike against North Korea , including a limited operation to try and neutralize its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon capabilities, as well as missions against other potential adversaries with extensive subterranean military infrastructure, such as Iran or China . The Air Force announced the contract award on Feb. 8, 2018, on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps , while the Pentagon confirmed it in a routine press release on the same day. The notices do not say how many individual bombs Boeing will build, but note that the company will perform the work entirely at its facilities in St. Louis Missouri and that it should have delivered all of the new MOPs by July 31, 2020. An earlier 2011 contract worth approximately $28 million had paid for eight of the 33,000 pound bombs, but also included orders for various parts and accessories, as well as a redesign of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber’s rear bomb bay to accommodate the munition. The B-2 is the only platform that would employ the weapon in combat. In addition, this new contract will almost certainly be production versions of the latest version of the MOP, also known as the GBU-57D/B, which would have a different individual unit cost than earlier types. In January 2018, Bloomberg was first to report that the Air Force had already put examples of this variant into operational service, following a series of tests in 2017. US Air Force personnel and contractors pose in front of a Massive Ordnance Penetrator mock up in 2007., USAF The Air Force is especially tight-lipped about the MOP program in general, but thanks to yet another contract notice from 2015, we do know that the GBU-57D/B design at least included a modified fuze. This component is particularly important for bunker buster-type bombs, which have various specific features to strike at facilities and other targets buried beneath significant layers of hardened material. If the fuze detonates the bomb’s main explosive charge too early, or fails to function at all, it is unlikely to cause the desired damage. At the same time, building such a system that can withstand the shock of falling from high altitude and then slamming through multiple layers of reinforced concrete or other similar barriers is no easy task. In 2017, the Air Force began ordering new BLU-137/B 2,000-pound class bunker busters for much the same reason . The major improvement in these bombs over the older BLU-109-series, which have been in service since the 1990s, is a more reliable fuzing mechanism. But these much smaller bombs are only supposed to be able to break through approximately four to six feet of reinforced concrete. Available public information suggests that the MOP’s components are supposed to survive burrowing down at least 10 times this distance into hardened targets, which would require a much more robust fuzing system to begin with. It’s not surprising that the Air Force has been interested in having Boeing continue working to make sure it is as reliable as possible. A graphic showing the potential penetration capabilities of the MOP from very early in the program. We don’t know if this is in any way reflective of the present weapon’s capabilities., DOD via GlobalSecurity.org According to a recent report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the Air Force determined the new fuze, as well as any other components of what it called the Enhanced Threat Response-IV (ETR-IV) weapon modifications, was effective after tests at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. In May 2017, three B-2 bombers each dropped one modified GBU-57/B on “a representative target,” which was the last part of the ETR-IV program, the review said. It’s not clear how many MOPs the Air Force may have retrofitted with the upgrades, though the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation said it had produced a classified “Early Fielding Report” regarding the bombs with the ETR-IV improvements in November 2017. It’s also not clear how many the service has in total. An Air Force briefing slide offering details about an earlier version of the GBU-57/B., USAF via Phase Zero Since 2011, the Air Force has taken delivery of at least 20 GBU-57/Bs of all types, but it has expended a number of MOPs in tests or exercises. This likely includes secret experiments, such as a now-declassified 2012 event in which an RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone conducted a bomb damage assessment mission after a B-2 dropped one of the bombs on a test range. The Air Force also only turned the project, which started as a Secretary of Defense-sponsored initiative in 2007, into a formal program of record in August 2017, the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation noted in its report. Whatever the case, buying more now makes perfect sense given the United States’ heightened tensions with North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs . There is increasing talk about the possibility of the U.S. military launched a limited “bloody nose” strike on the reclusive Communist country in order to try and neutralize those capabilities. The video below includes a clip of a B-2 bomber dropping a GBU-57/B during a test. “Remember, missile infrastructure is not just the missiles,” Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva explained to reporters during a round table discussion on Jan. 30, 2018. “If you’re the poor sergeant that has to go out and launch the missile, and I blow up your barracks, you’re not available to go do your job.” The senior officer added that he was confident that the U.S. military could destroy “most” of this infrastructure if necessary with a conventional strike. Since it is widely understood that the North Koreans have an extensive network of tunnels and other underground military facilities to shield its missiles and nuclear weapons from potential attack, which are well beyond the reach of smaller bunker busters such as the 2,000-pound class BLU-109 or -137 or the 4,500-pound class GBU-28/B, the MOP would have been a critical factor in any such assessment. DoD The MOP also gives the United States a non-nuclear means of holding North Korean premier Kim Jong-un and other members of his regime directly at risk, since it could potentially penetrate equally well protected underground command and control sites and other bunkers the country’s senior leadership might flee to in a crisis. The United States and South Korea both routinely make references to a “decapitation” strike focused on the North Korea’s top leaders. On top of that, the bulk of North Korea’s air defenses may be increasingly outdated , but they still form a dense array of very real threats, especially to non-stealthy aircraft. As such, B-2s carrying MOPs would almost certainly be a key part of at least the first wave of any American strike, limited or otherwise, something we at The War Zone have stressed in the past . An MOP mock up sits inside a training device that simulates a B-2 bomb bay in 2007., USAF The MOPs will be a steadily more important part of the Air Force’s arsenal in general as time goes on, both with regards to smaller potential adversaries and near peer opponents. As with North Korea, President Donald Trump and his administration have taken a particularly hard line against Iran and its ballistic missile and nuclear programs . Much of the impetus for the MOP program in the first place appeared to be Iran’s push to bury its nuclear enrichment infrastructure deep underground to protect against an American or Israeli pre-emptive strike . The regime in Tehran has only expanded those construction projects, having now built large subterranean facilities to house its missiles , as well. China has also increasingly turned to tunnels as a way to mitigate the threat of a short- or no-notice aerial or missile strike on key facilities and weapon systems. The People’s Liberation Army’s Second Artillery Corps, the Chinese government’s name for its land-based nuclear forces, alone has a tunnel network stretching more than 3,000 miles, which the country’s state media has termed an “ Underground Great Wall ,” while the People’s Liberation Army Navy notably built a large submarine base underneath a portion of Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In July 2017, Geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor released satellite imagery that indicated there was a large underground component to China’s new base in the East African country of Djibouti, as well. With all of these things in mind, it’s smart for the Air Force to get Boeing to work building more MOPs now to make sure it has an adequate stockpile to respond to any potential crises and to still have some on hand for more testing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 23, 2020",Massive US Counterstrike Against Assad’s Forces Signals New Stage Of Syrian Civil War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has now offered additional details about the withering firepower it employed during a three hour battle to beat back a battalion-sized force that threatened American troops and their local partners at a remote base in northern Syria . Coming as the United States is trying to draw down in Iraq and Syria and shift its attention to Afghanistan , the incident underscores how difficult it might be for the remaining U.S. troops to not to get wrapped up in the broader Syrian conflict . According to the Pentagon , the incident began after approximately 500 troops allied with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad crossed to the eastern side of the Euphrates River near the city of Deir ez-Zor with tanks, artillery, and other heavy weapons on Feb. 7, 2018. That force passed over a formal de-confliction line that the United States and Russia have set up to try and separate their activities and avoid these skirmishes. It subsequently used tanks or artillery to fire at least 30 rounds at a headquarters run by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed local force, the bulk of which are Kurds . American advisers, likely special operations forces, were also at the site and subsequently called in a flurry of air and artillery strikes. “F-22A Raptors and MQ-9B Reapers, were overhead providing protective overwatch, defensive counter air and [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] support as they have 24/7 throughout the fight to defeat ISIS,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart, a spokesman for Air Forces Central Command, told Military.com in a statement. “Following a call for support from Air Force Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, a variety of joint aircraft and ground-based artillery responded in defense of our SDF partners, including F-15E Strike Eagles.” In the end, U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships , F-15E Strike Eagle and F-22 Raptor jets , and MQ-9 Reaper drones , along with U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and U.S. Marine Corps artillery all took part in the response. Those various assets killed approximately a fifth of the total enemy contingent and destroyed a significant portion of their equipment. An F-22 pulls away from an aerial refueling tanker over Iraq or Syria., USAF It’s not the first time any of these assets have taken part in operations in Syria. It’s also not the first time American aircraft have discouraged forces aligned with Assad’s regime in Damascus from approaching SDF positions or outright attacked them . But the size and scope of the response underscores both the apparent severity of the threat and that the United States has no choice but to remain heavily committed to operations in Syria if it wants to continue having a meaningful presence in the country. As Colonel Pickart noted, F-22s and MQ-9s have become an increasingly common sight over SDF-controlled areas in Syria for years, keeping watch for threats in the air and on the ground. In 2015, Russia released footage of one of its Su-30 Flanker-C fighter jets flying near a Reaper drone somewhere in Syria. Then, in August 2016, Raptors swooped in to chase off Syrian combat aircraft in northern Syria that appeared to be setting up to attack U.S.-backed fighters and their special operations forces advisers. A U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet actually short down a Syrian Arab Air Force Su-22 Fitter jet in June 2017. More recently, in December 2017, one of the stealth fighters nearly collided with a Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft during a contentious engagement along the Euphrates River. It’s not clear if either of these types of aircraft conducted actual strikes against the pro-Assad forces or simply monitored their activities and kept a guard up in case Syria’s Air Force attempted to intervene. The F-15E Strike Eagles, which can carry much more larger payloads than either the F-22 or the MQ-9, were likely more significant contributors in the hours-long fight. In a series of incidents in 2017, F-15Es similarly raced to aid of American special operators and their local partners in the Southern Syrian city of At Tanf, attacking columns of Iranian-backed militiamen in armored and other vehicles, as well as shooting down two Iranian-made drones . An bomb-laden F-15E Strike Eagle fires a decoy flare after separating from an aerial refueling tanker over Iraq or Syria in June 2017., USAF The AC-130s would have been a valuable tool in such a protracted engagement, too. Though we don’t know what models or how many in total took part in the counter-attack, the AC-130Us and Ws, the two types in active service at present, can loiter over the battlefield for extended periods of time. The AC-130U Spooky is a true gunship, packing 25mm and 40mm guns and a huge 105mm howitzer. The AC-130W Stinger II is more geared toward employing precision guided munitions , such as the AGM-176 Griffin missile and the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb , but the most recent Block 20 aircraft have both a 30mm cannon and the 105mm howitzer , as well. With their automatic cannons, these aircraft are also particularly well suited to “danger close” gun runs against enemy forces that are situated close to friendly positions. They can also deploy a huge volume of fire in a fairly short period of time, and dismantling a mechanized column arrayed along a road would be a “feeding frenzy” for such an asset. The low- and slow-flying Apaches could have provided more close-in fire support with Hellfire missiles, laser-guided rockets , and their 30mm cannon, as well. It’s not clear how close the enemy force actually got to SDF- and America-occupied positions, though. U.S. Marine Corps artillery, including both 155mm M777 towed howitzers and 227mm High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems ( HIMARS ), has already been stars of the fight against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria for years, too. Marine M777s, often firing GPS-guided shells, were vital in U.S.-backed SDF-led effort to eject the terrorists from their de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2017, also known as Operation Eclipse. According to a report by Marine Corps Times , Marine howitzers fired more shells during that offensive than they have been during any other operation of a similar length since the Vietnam War. The Marines even burned out the barrel in one of the weapons, meaning that they had shot so many rounds through it that it was no longer safe to use. Conspicuously absent from this fire support armada was the Air Force’s A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft, which has a massive 30mm cannon specifically designed to take out heavy armor, can carry a large number of other precision guided bombs and missiles, and can stay on station for long periods at a time. But their absence also highlights a worrying conundrum for the U.S. military in both Iraq and Syria. In January 2018, the Air Force shifted the Warthogs, as well as other aircraft , to operations over Afghanistan as part of the U.S. government’s attempt to shift its primary focus to that conflict. Officially, the U.S. military has ended major combat operations in Iraq and Syria against ISIS and is seeking to draw down its commitments in both countries. The video below shows an A-10 attacking insurgents in a car in Afghanistan after arriving in the country in January 2018. “Afghanistan has become CENTCOM’s [U.S. Central Command’s] main effort,” U.S. Air Force Major General James Hecker, who is in charge of both U.S. and other coalition air forces in that country, told Defense News . “This has allowed CENTCOM to shift more assets our way, which will significantly improve our ability to assist the Afghans.” At the same time, the United States has made it clear that it plans to stay in Iraq and Syria indefinitely and is continuing to support the development of local security forces in those countries, ostensibly to prevent ISIS from regrouping. This has drawn the ire of Assad’s government and its principle benefactors, Russia and Iran, who all say that the American presence in Syria is an illegal occupation to begin with. Syrian forces will defeat the “conspiracy, end the presence of the US, its agents and tools in Syria, establish full control over the entire Syrian territory, and preserve the country’s sovereignty,” Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported in January 2018, citing an unnamed official from the country’s Foreign Ministry. “The Ministry considered any Syrian citizen who takes part in the US-backed militia as a traitor to the Syrian state and people and will be treated as one, adding that these militias will hinder reaching a political solution to the situation in Syria,” the outlet added. Members of the Raqqa Internal Security Force, a local element the U.S.-led coalition recently created in Syria, conduct a training exercise in January 2018., US Army As we at The War Zone have warned of regularly for years, with the immediate terrorist threat receding in Iraq and Syria , other competing agendas are increasingly coming to the forefront in an already complicated conflict. America’s plans for a more permanent and predominantly Kurdish security force in Syria has already prompted Turkish intervention in the country’s northwest, threatening to divide the SDF’s loyalty , and put Turkey and the United States on a dangerous collision course, which you can read about in detail here . “We are not getting involved in the Syrian Civil War,” U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis insisted to reporters on Feb. 8, 2018. “I have no idea why they would attack there.” Though common U.S. government talking points, they belie that American troops are in parts of Syria, which continues to be in the grips of civil war, and that the Syrian government, its authority legitimate or not, wishes they weren’t there at all. Assad also appears to have become more anxious to reassert control over more territory, launching a particularly brutal offensive into the rebel-held Idlib province in the northwestern corner of the country with Russian support and chemical weapons . Now, those aspirations may have begun to stretch eastward, with the pro-regime forces that attacked the SDF-held positions possibly having been on a mission to try and retake the Omar oil field and Conoco gas field. The American-backed group has controlled the two lucrative areas since the final months of 2017. Syrian Army T-72 tanks near Deir ez-Zor in September 2017., Михаил Алаеддин/Sputnik  via AP And whether or not Russia was directly or tacitly involved in the attack remains a serious question. Initial reports suggested the Pentagon was reviewing the available information to see if Russian private military contractors had taken part in the incident, though Mattis subsequently said the U.S. government did not believe this was the case. “I think the Russians would’ve told us,” Mattis said, adding the U.S. military used a hotline to contact their Russian counterparts during the battle, who in turn said they were not involved. “We have always known that there are elements in this very complex battle space that the Russians did not have, I would call it, control of.” However, getting a battalion-size force with tanks and other heavy vehicles across the Euphrates would have been a substantial undertaking requiring bridge-building equipment or light ferries since the only formal bridge had long been destroyed. It seems hard to imagine the Syrian military or its allied militia would have been able to do this with at least indirect support from Russia, whether through the delivery of the necessary equipment or new or existing military construction work. In September 2017, Russian forces did build a number of bridges over the Euphrates near Deir ez-Zor using Soviet-era mobile equipment. They also deployed PMM-2Ms , a tracked vehicle that can act individually as either a small ferry or in a chain forming a larger barge or a fixed pontoon bridge. The Syrians also have some old Soviet-era amphibious transport vehicles and pontoon bridging equipment and employed those systems in September 2017 to cross the Euphrates, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=npw0eGgmwLU But as of Feb. 6, 2018, there were reports that the Russian pontoon bridge, the main artery across the river, had broken up due to a sudden rise in the water level. Russian state-owned media outlet Sputnik subsequently implied that the SDF, who also control Tabqa dam further upstream, might have unleashed a torrent of water to destroy the span. This further reinforces that crossing the river with heavy vehicles the next day would have required significant effort. The temporary crossing points had already presented a challenge to formal, but already debatably effective de-confliction line that is supposed to separate American and Russian activities in Syria. The Russians routinely cross this boundary and it’s also clear that it has no direct impact on Syrian government’s operations or those of its militias or other allies. Syrian troops prepare to cross the Euphrates in September 2017 using a Soviet-era PTS amphibious cargo vehicle., Михаил Алаеддин/Sputnik  via AP On top of that, the Russians have already challenged the legitimacy of the American response to the attack and offered their continued support to Assad’s government. Syrian authorities have in turn decried what happened as a “massacre” and “ a war crime ,” though it’s not clear what international statues they might be trying to invoke. The United States has repeatedly stressed its inherent right to self-defense in counter-attacking against the pro-Assad contingent. “We are there [in Syria] to defeat ISIS,” Dana White, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson, said in her own press briefing on Feb. 8, 2018. “They are on the run, but it’s not finished, and so there’s still work to be done.” But with the imminent threat of those terrorists gone, other actors in the country are already turning their attention elsewhere. American troops will only find themselves in an increasingly precarious position the more they present an obstacle for the Syrian government’s agenda, or that of Russia or its other partners. The United States can say it has no intention of getting sucked into the larger conflict in Syria, but the parties that are will get a say, too. And the more U.S. forces act in self-defense, especially on the scale we’ve just seen, the more likely they are to create and reinforce a view that they are actually a very active participant in the broader fighting.

The U.S. Air Force has reportedly conducted an air strike to destroy one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 boosters , which came down off the Florida Coast after a test. The space launch firm had previously said it would try to tow it back to shore, but it may have become an immediate danger to maritime traffic or sites along the coast, prompting the service to take action. AmericaSpace first reported on the possible strike on Feb. 8, 2018, citing anonymous sources, but said the Air Force had declined to comment at all, directing all questions to SpaceX. NASASpaceFlight.com subsequently said it had confirmed the report, but did not say what Air Force assets had participated in the mission. So the #Falcon9 1st stage for #GovSat1 that soft landed in the ocean and survived… @NASASpaceflight has confirmed that the Air Force conducted a scuttling operation to destroy it as there was no safe way to get it back to Port.

The system has the ability to then land upright so the company can reuse it for future launches. In this instance, though, it made a high-stress descent over water, an experiment to collect research data that engineers expected would break it up or otherwise damage it enough that it would sink harmlessly to the bottom of the ocean. “This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn’t hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived,” Elon Musk, founder, CEO, and leader designer at SpaceX, Tweeted out afterwards. “We will try to tow it back to shore.” This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn’t hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived.

Depending on the exact condition of its various components, including compromised composite overwrapped pressure vessels, or COPVs, it could easily have turned into a serious hazard. On Feb. 7, 2018, SpaceX’s Go Searcher offshore supply vessel, which supports the company’s remotely-operated “ autonomous spaceport ” drone launching pads, as well as other over-water activities, returned to Port Canaveral in Florida without any sign of the booster. This in turn prompted speculation that the plan to tow it back had failed. Not sure what it means but #SpaceX #GoSearcher is in port. pic.twitter.com/bCYPQR2FgW — Tom (@Cygnusx112) February 7, 2018 We don’t know what aircraft make have taken part in any strike on the Falcon 9 booster, but there are are number of Air Force units within Florida that could have carried out the mission. There are Air Force Special Operations Command AC-130 gunships at Hurblurt Field along the Florida Panhandle and the Air Force Reserve has F-16 multi-role fighter jets with the 482nd Fighter Wing , also known as the Makos, at Homestead Air Reserve Base at the very southern end of the state. The Florida Air National Guard has F-15C Eagles at Jacksonville Air National Guard Base, attached to Jacksonville International Airport, as well. Those fighter jets are geared toward air-to-air combat, but could have strafed the booster with their 20mm Vulcan cannons. Air Guard F-15s conduct over-water cannon firing drills periodically to keep pilots familiar with employing the weapon with live ammunition. There’s variety of other air-to-ground capable test aircraft assigned to the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, which also hosts a number of weapon testing organizations, and the Air Force rotates B-1 bombers through deployments to Key West , though primarily for unarmed counter-drug missions. The Air Force or Air National Guard could have deployed other fighter or ground attack aircraft from elsewhere in the southeastern United States, as well, as it would’ve offered the chance for a realistic over-water training exercise . Another possibility is that the Air Force actually sent an explosive ordnance disposal team to either neutralize an immediate danger or rig the booster up with explosives to sink it. If the booster was too unstable for this kind of direct intervention, that could explain why the service chose to go with an air strike, as well. An F-16C from the 482nd Fighter Wing, wearing a special 25th Anniversary paint scheme in 2013, which plays on the unit’s nickname, the “Makos.”, USAF Another U.S. military service could have been the one to actually carry out the strike, too.  The U.S. Navy has P-3C Orion and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft situated in Florida and the service routinely deploys F/A-18C/D Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter-bombers to Naval Air Station Key West for regular training . Armed U.S. Army or Navy helicopters could have been yet another option, depending on how far away from shore the Falcon 9 booster had landed. U.S. Navy or Coast Guard ships could have finished it off, too. That latter possibility is something that’s actually happened before. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake off Japan, and the devastating tsunami that followed, a number of boats ended up adrift in the Pacific without crews to guide them back or any easy way of tracking their positions. The owners of the fishing boat Ryou-Un Maru assumed she had sunk in the disaster, but in March 2012, she reappeared hundreds of miles from home, derelict, off the coast of Canada. After she floated into American territorial waters the next month, the U.S. Coast’s Guard’s cutter USCGC Anacapa went out to assess the situation, determined the ghost boat was an immediate hazard to maritime traffic in the area, and subsequently sunk the trawler with fire from her Mk 38 25mm cannon . We have reached out to the Air Force and other U.S. military agencies and we will be sure to update this post if any additional information becomes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military says members of the American-backed coalition fighting ISIS in Syria, most likely U.S. special operation forces , and their local partners have come under attack in Eastern Syria from forces allied with the country’s dictator Bashar Al Assad. Details remain thin, but the United States is reportedly investigating whether Russian mercenaries or Iranian militias may have been involved in the incident. On Feb. 7, 2018, U.S. Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, announced the attack in Syria’s Middle Euphrates River Valley had occurred in a brief and vaguely worded statement. The release described the attack as “unprovoked” and directed at a Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) headquarters located nearly five miles east of a formal, but dubiously effective “de-confliction” line that the United States and Russia have agreed to in Syria to separate the two countries’ activities. Â The enemy force reportedly included artillery and other heavy weapons and had to cross the Euphrates River with that equipment. The SDF, which predominantly consists of Kurdish fighters , but also includes smaller numbers of Sunni Arabs and Turkmen, receives various types of support from the U.S.-led coalition battling ISIS in Syria. An unknown number of “coalition” personnel members were at the site, who were likely the ones that called in the unspecified counterattacks, which reportedly included both air strikes or artillery fires . Here is the full text of CENTCOM’s statement: Syrian pro-regime forces initiated an unprovoked attack against well-established Syrian Democratic Forces headquarters Feb. 7. Coalition service members in an advise, assist, and accompany capacity were co-located with SDF partners during the attack eight kilometers east of the agreed-upon Euphrates River de-confliction line. In defense of Coalition and partner forces, the Coalition conducted strikes against attacking forces to repel the act of aggression against partners engaged in the Global Coalition’s defeat-Daesh mission. The Coalition remains committed to focusing on the defeat-Daesh mission in the Middle Euphrates River Valley and asserts its non-negotiable right to act in self-defense.

CNN’s Barbara Star Tweeted out shortly after the first reports of the incident emerged that Russian contractors may have been involved, but did not provide a source for that information. A subsequent CNN report , citing anonymous U.S. government officials, said that there was no evidence yet of Russian involvement, but that the United States was actively looking into a possible connection. The U.S. military was also considering the possibility that Iranian-backed militias might have taken part.

There have also been reports that these groups are fighting as far east as the Eastern Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor , which skirts the de-confliction line separating the U.S.-backed SDF from Russian and Syrian government forces. In the news is #Afrin in northern Syria where Turkey wishes to get clearance for launching an assault against what it claims are YPG (PKK-extended) forces. Hereâ€™s the BBC map to place in context. pic.twitter.com/7ChKJPNbcz — dr harry hagopian ðŸ˜· (@harryhagopian) January 19, 2018 This isn’t the first time American troops in Syria have come under attack from Pro-Assad forces. In 2017, U.S. special operations forces called in air strikes as a convoy of Iranian-backed militiamen in light and armored vehicles approached their base near the Southern Syrian city of At Tanf located near the nexus of the Iraq-Jordan-Syria borders. American aircraft subsequently shot down two Iranian-made drones in the same area after they attempted to attack the garrison. Also, in June 2017, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Su-22 Fitter attack aircraft after it attacked SDF personnel near the Al Tabqa dam , west of the city of Raqqa. We at The War Zone have repeatedly warned about the increasing potential for a skirmish between American and Russian troops, as well local partners and contractors on both sides, in Eastern Syria as the immediate threat of ISIS recedes . Russian combat aircraft have already been involved in an increasing number of aggressive aerial intercepts or other altercations with American military aircraft in Syria, especially near the de-confliction line. In December 2017, a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter nearly collided with a Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack plane near Al Mayadin, which sits along the Euphrates River south of Deir ez-Zor. Syrian troops near Deir ez-Zor in April 2017., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik  via AP U.S.-Russia relations remain poor in general, in particular over U.S. government accusations that the Russian government actively attempted to sway the outcome of America’s 2016 president election. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said a series of politically-focused hacks could have been the work of particularly “patriotic” Russians rather than actual agents of the government, which would mirror the Kremlin’s use of private military companies as proxies in Syria.Â The United States is also an outspoken critic of the Kremlin’s support for Assad and for separatists fighting the Ukrainian government. Wagner Group , one of the most notable Russian private military companies in Syria, has also been present in Eastern Ukraine. It’s not clear what inciting factors might have prompted Russia to support or otherwise tacitly approve the attack. However, in December 2017, Vladimir Putin did declare victory against ISIS and the end to major combat operations in Syria.Â Since then, Russia has increasingly criticized America’s continued involvement in the country, saying that since the terrorists are gone, the United States should go, too. The U.S. government in turn announced its intention to stay indefinitely and establish a new partner for in Syria to stave off any attempt by ISIS to regroup. Also on Feb. 7, 2018, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the United States’ Syrian policies as a de facto attempt to divide the country.Â Sergei Lavrov speaks at an abortive Russian-backed Syria peace conference in Sochi in January 2018. Most of the attendees were Pro-Assad and those opposed to the regime in Damascus who did participate heckled Lavrov before walking out., Nina Zotina/Sputnik  via AP The United States has also been increasingly critical of Russia’s involvement in Syria, as the Kremlin supports a major Syrian military incursion into the rebel-held Idlib province east of the capital Damascus. There have been a new surge of reported chemical weapon attacks by the Syrian government on civilians as part of that operation, as well as indiscriminate air strikes in populated areas. The United States says it believes Syria has resumed manufacturing chemical agents , despite a Russian-brokered deal where it promised to turn over its stockpiles for destruction. “We know that for years Russia has looked the other way while their Syrian friends use these despicable weapons of war,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said during a recent U.N. Security Council meeting on Jan. 23, 2018 against innocent civilians in his country. “Russia is complicit in the Assad regime’s atrocities.” But, if Russian contractors or the Kremlin’s actual troops were involved in this new incident, this would still mark the first time America has come to blows with Moscow on the ground in Syria and potentially indicate a worrying shift in the character of the conflict. Now we are now monitoring for a possible response from Russia concerning this event.Â In recent weeks, Moscow’s excursion into Syria has become more visibly taxing, with multiple attacks on their master air base making headlines , one of which was deadly. Most recently, the downing of an Su-25 attack jet and the loss of its pilot at the hands of anti-Assad forces operating in embattled Idlib Province also grabbed the world’s attention. These events have occurred after Putin victory tour in Syria and elsewhere in the region.Â We will continue to update this story as more information comes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 31, 2019","Shock Trials or No, the Navy’s Newest Supercarrier Is Still an Unreliable Debacle","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is reportedly seeking to delay critical shock testing of its newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford , which is essential for determining whether the ship is ready for combat, for up to six years. That news follows a damning Pentagon report that shows the vessel’s essential systems , such as its electromagnetic catapults, new arresting gear, and advanced radar, still don’t work right under the best conditions. On Feb. 7, 2018, Bloomberg revealed that the Navy had appealed directly to Secretary of Defense James Mattis to sign off on delaying the shock testing, which involves setting off large explosive charges near a ship with a representative crew on board and seeing how the vessel holds up, to 2024. Those discussions revolve around the service’s desire to remove funding for the trials in their draft budget request for the 2019 fiscal year. That plan would see the shock tests performed some time in 2019. “Secretary Mattis will respond directly to the Navy when he makes a decision,” was all Pentagon spokesperson U.S. Navy Commander Patrick Evans would tell Bloomberg about the deliberations. U.S. Navy Captain Danny Hernandez, a public affairs officer for the service specifically, simply told the outlet that the discussions were ongoing. The Navy’s shock testing, or formally the Full Ship Shock Trial (FSST), isn’t supposed to harm the vessel or anyone on board, but rather to rattle everything to see if sensitive systems or other design features might be particularly vulnerable. If problems, or any actual damage or injuries, do occur it’s would be a pretty clear sign that there’s still work to be done before sending the ship out for potentially real combat missions. The USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN The Navy is supposed to put all new warship designs through the FSST process. This requirement has been slipping in recent years, though, with the service commissioning a number of Littoral Combat Ships without having passed all the necessary tests. In those cases, there were also accusations that the service heavily scripted the events to avoid damaging the vessels. But it appears that the Navy is rightfully worried that Ford , which it finally took delivery of in May 2017 after repeated delays, might not be able to pass those tests in any form in the near future. Serious questions remain about when engineers will be able to assure systems essential for the ship’s flight operations work as intended at all , let alone after being rocked by a massive explosion in a high-threat combat situation. The Littoral Combat Ship USS Jackson undergoes a shock trial in 2016., USN Most notably, its Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), Advanced Weapon Elevators (AWE), and Dual Band Radar (DBR) have already shown themselves to be finicky and unreliable just during relatively low impact testing. In its latest regular review of U.S. military-wide testing activities, which it published in January 2018 , the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operation Test and Evaluation said its overall assessment of the Ford -class “remains consistent with previous assessments,” which have generally been poor. “Poor or unknown reliability of the newly designed catapults, arresting gear, weapons elevators, and radar, which are all critical for flight operations, could affect the ability of CVN 78 [USS Gerald R. Ford ] to generate sorties, make the ship more vulnerable to attack, or create limitations during routine operations,” the report says in the initial summary of its section on the carrier. “The poor or unknown reliability of these critical subsystems is the most significant risk to CVN 78. Based on current reliability estimates, CVN 78 is unlikely to be able to conduct the type of high-intensity flight operations expected during wartime.” In theory, the Ford ’s EMALS and AAG are supposed to allow the ship’s crew to better fine tune how they launch and recover aircraft compared to the existing steam-powered catapults and arresting systems on the Nimitz -class. This in turn would speed up both processes, improving the ship’s ability to get aircraft into the air and get them back on board during high-intensity operations, all while reducing wear and tear on the ship and the planes. This in turn reduces the maintenance workload for personnel on board and could allow for the carriers to operate with smaller crews, saving the service on various costs and easing strains on already limited manpower . Testing during the 2017 fiscal year showed that both the EMALS and AAG remain horribly unreliable. As of June 2017, the electromagnetic catapults suffered a critical failure after an average of 455 launches, nine times more often than the Navy’s own threshold requirement. As such, Ford had an approximately 70 percent chance of completing just one day of sustained operations without a major problem with the system. When a problem did occur, the crew would have to spend 1.5 hours just waiting for the system’s generators and motors to shut down before they could even begin trouble shooting the issue. There is no way to electrically isolate specific components individually so maintenance teams can safely inspect them. The AAG’s reliability was even worse, with it being able to withstand recovering an average of fewer than 20 aircraft before experiencing a major issue. The Navy’s target is for the arresting system to be able to handle approximately 16,500 landings before experiencing a failure. As it stands now, Ford has around a one percent chance of being able to make it through a normal day of flight operations—recovering roughly 84 aircraft over a 24 hour period—before its arresting gear breaks down. These statistics are a far cry from how the Navy has described the situation in the past. “When that ship delivers we’ll be ready to land aircraft on AAG,” Vice Admiral Thomas Moore told USNI News in 2016. “I think [CVN] 78 [USS Gerald R. Ford ] is doing much better and I think we’ll have a fully functional system.” The Navy has demonstrated that it could indeed land aircraft on the carrier using the AAG, as well as launch them again with the EMALS, during at-sea tests in 2017. It’s hard to reasonably say either system is “fully functional,” though, or even near to it. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation report says the Navy could only provide “engineering reliability estimates” for the Advanced Weapon Elevators (AWE) and Dual Band Radar (DBR). It included no specific details about the elevators, which are essential for getting aircraft on and off the flight deck. Existing test results for the ship’s multi-function Dual Band Radar, which is supposed to support air traffic control functions and watch for and help target incoming threats, have not been reassuring. According to the review, land-based testing showed the system has problems tracking missiles in flight and cuing its own defenses to engage them, routinely gets confused by “clutter” and displays false information, and otherwise has trouble accurately showing the proper position of actual items of interest. These could present serious issues for the ship for a multitude of reasons, but especially it needed to defend itself, since it would rely on data from its radars to guide the latest variant of the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) to it targets. The ESSM is one of the ship’s primary means of self-defense against aerial threats. On top of that, during a limited test of the system on Ford , the radar kept unexpectedly shutting down. In addition, no one has yet assessed the reliability of the Volume Search Radar portion of the DBR at all. Maybe the most disappointing part of all this is that future Ford class variants will rely on a different radar system altogether, which points to the Navy’s own disdain for the DBR. Sailors board Ford for her commissioning ceremony in July 2017, including by way of one its large elevators. The ship’s central “island,” which contains the Dual Band Radar, is also clearly visible., USN There’s a serious underlying concern about the ship’s main power generation system, as well, which is necessary to keep all of these components running. Before delivering Ford to the Navy, Newport News Shipbuilding reported a failure in a transformer attached to one of the ship’s four main turbine generators. According to the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the Navy, not wanting to delay getting the ship any further, approved the use of an existing transformer design it already used for other applications as a substitute. It conducted no testing to determine if this component would work properly with the rest of the carrier’s electrical systems. “Voltage regulating system design flaws resulted in damage to a second main turbine generator following a subsequent transformer failure,” the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s report says. “This incident delayed the ship’s delivery as well as both live fire and operational testing and currently [as of September 2017] the ship is operating on three of the four main turbine generators as a direct result of the second failure.” Unfortunately, as the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s own review says up front, these issues are hardly new or even necessarily unexpected. When it began the program to develop a new carrier more than a decade ago, the Navy relied heavily on a concept called “ concurrency ,” whereby it would hire contractors to begin work immediately on production without having a final design fleshed out or its components tested. Workers install part of the future Ford ‘s flight deck in 2013., USN As we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly , this entire theory, applied to the Ford -class and other systems , has turned out to be a farce. Both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Newport News said the Navy’s belief that it could build Ford for less than $10.5 billion was almost comically optimistic and they turned out to be entirely correct . Each one of the Ford class carriers now carries a price tag of nearly $13 billion, which was fully in line with earlier estimates from GAO and Newport News. However, the true costs are now likely to be higher as the Navy now has to spend extra time and money making sure the ship’s various systems, many of which engineers have only tested on land to a limited degree due to concurrency, actually work. All of this has meant that the Navy was already disinclined to conduct the shock testing on Ford and had wanted to focus on getting the ship into at least limited service first. The service had previously advocated for running the trials on the USS John F. Kennedy and assuming the results would hold for both ships. But by then the Ford would supposedly be operational for years, albeit in an unvetted form. Former Secretary of that Navy Ray Mabus vetoed that plan in 2015 and announced plans for Ford to go through the shock tests in 2019. Now, it appears that the service wants to return to its initial plan. It expects to commission Kennedy in 2024, or six years from now. Ford tied up pierside at Naval Station Norfolk in 2017., USN It’s not clear how any of these developments will affect the delivery schedule for the future USS John F. Kennedy , which is already under construction. The Navy has four Ford class carriers in hand, under construction, or on order, in total. Aircraft carriers take too much time and money to build for the Navy to simply relegate Ford and even possibly Kennedy to non-combat roles – something the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps are considering doing with early production F-35 Joint Strike Fighters that they also bought under a concurrency scheme – and hope the situation improves with the future ships in the class. You can read all about this harsh reality here . The service already has to contend with a “ carrier gap ,” which makes it difficult to deploy enough flattops to meet demands, let along surge them in a crisis. This became particularly apparent when details emerged about what it took to get three Nimitz -class ships together for a massive show of force in the Pacific in 2017. The oldest of the Nimitz class ships have been in service since the 1970s and are headed toward the end of their estimated 50-year service life whether the Navy has replacements or not. It’s becoming an increasingly more serious gamble that systems like EMALS and AAG will be ready for real world operations by the time it is absolutely necessary to have the ships they are installed on available for deployments. The Navy could decide to replace one or both of those systems on Kennedy and later ships in the class with existing steam-powered versions, an idea that President Donald Trump blurted out in an interview in May 2017, but retrofitting the design would be hugely time consuming and costly in its own right. Tugs move the future Ford into position for a test in 2016., USN This is all happening as the Navy is struggling to maintain the surface ships and submarines it has amid a dangerous shortage of manpower and flagging morale . It now has to balance the Ford -class debacle against the urgent need to revitalize and expand its own shipyard capacity and improve training and overall readiness , as well as its long-standing desire to acquire more ships in general. With regards to the shock trials specifically, the Navy now finds itself in a no-win situation almost entirely of its own making. Given the poor reliability of its systems to begin with, Ford is unlikely to pass the shock trials without at least some significant issues, which would be another embarrassing development for the ship. On the other hand, one cannot reasonably see putting the trials off for six years as anything but a tactic admission of this fact. “I think we have to know if those systems continue to work in a combat environment,” Robert Behler, the Director of the Office of Operation Test and Evaluation, told Bloomberg in an interview. But that decision “is not mine to make” he added. There’s no guarantee that a shock trial in 2019 would even accurately reflect the ship’s vulnerabilities due to the continued work on its critical systems. It’s also unclear when the ship would actually be ready for service at all. At this point the possibility that it could be years before Ford is ready to deploy operationally into potential combat environments isn’t unthinkable. This might’ve made the shock trials delay irrelevant, except the Navy is building more of the supercarriers to the exact same design specifications. It could end up that major issues are found structurally with the design even after two of the vessels are totally complete and another nearly finished.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Lebanese Troops Hammered ISIS With Laser Guided Artillery Shells in 2017,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A brief notice from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut suggests that Lebanese troops pounded ISIS terrorists with hundreds of M712 Copperhead 155mm laser-guided artillery shells during a recent offensive. The United States has now replenished Lebanon’s stocks of that type of ammunition to help the country retain an apparently valuable precision guided munitions capability. Between Feb. 1 and 6, 2018, the United States delivered more than $112 million in weapons and ammunition to the Lebanese Armed Forces as part of ongoing military assistance projects aimed primarily at supporting the country’s fight against ISIS along its border with Syria, according to the U.S. Embassy’s press release . In addition to more than 800 Copperheads, these shipments included eight Bradley Fighting Vehicles , bringing Lebanon’s total fleet of those armored vehicles to 16, and 200 Mk 19 40mm automatic grenade launchers. “The United States delivered 827 Copperhead artillery rounds to the Lebanese Armed Forces,” the Embassy’s statement said. “Valued at more than $1.4 million, this ammunition replenishes LAF stockpiles used to defeat ISIS in Operation Fajr al Jouroud.” It’s not clear what this dollar amount necessarily covers. At this price, each round would have cost less than $1,700. The unit cost of the Copperhead is reportedly closer to $70,000 . The video below is from Operation Fajr al Jouroud and appears to show Lebanese artillery units using Copperhead laser-guided artillery shells. The laser-guided shells haven’t been in production since 1990 , though, and they likely came straight from U.S. military stocks. So, whatever entity was in charge of divesting the ammunition may have given them significantly reduced price tag for any number of reasons, possibly including their relative age and that the shells were officially “surplus” or “excess” to their requirements. Copperhead already has a relatively limited user base, with Egypt, Jordan, and Taiwan being among the few countries to have received them in the past. In 2007, Australia announced it would replace its projectiles with the German-made SMArt155 , which contains two sensor-fuzed anti-tank bomblets. The M712, which Martin Marietta, now part of Lockheed Martin, first developed in 1975, is effectively a precision glide bomb tucked inside a 155mm artillery shell. Lebanon’s towed M114A1 and M198 howitzers and self-propelled M109 types are all able to fire the projectile, which has two main modes of operation. Lebanese troops fire an M198 howitzer at ISIS positions during Operation Fajr al Jouroud., Lebanese Armed Forces The first involves firing the shell in a normal ballistic trajectory toward the target. At approximately 3,280 yards from the point of impact, the round’s control fins pop out and maneuver it onto the target. The second setting deploys the fins earlier in the flight path so that the round then glides toward the target area instead. Troops would employ this method if the sky was overcast or other obscurants, such as smoke, sand, or dust made it unlikely that the round falling on its ballistic trajectory would be able to see the laser in enough time to properly correct its course and hit its mark. The video below shows typical firing sequences for the Copperhead: In both modes, someone has to continuously designate the target with a laser. In Lebanon, troops on the ground with hand-held laser designators or the country’s AC-208 Combat Caravan light attack aircraft would have most likely marked the targets. The U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps initially expected to use Copperhead primarily against tanks and other moving targets, which were otherwise difficult for artillery units to accurately engage without a massive barrage across a large area or by using cluster munitions . During the opening stages of Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1990, the shells proved themselves to be equally useful for precision attacks against fortifications, radar stations, and other similar high-priority, but fixed targets . U.S. Army Brigadier General Creighton W. Abrams, then commander of VII Corps Artillery in Germany, describes one attack on Iraqi positions in an article for the service’s official Field Artillery professional bulletin in October 1991. After being hit by cluster munitions, “the defenders scurried to a nearby bunker only to have a Copperhead round fly into the laser-designated door of the bunker. Realizing the futility of flight, the rest of the enemy unit surrendered.” A Copperhead with its control fins deployed., US Army We also don’t know if Lebanon actually fired 827 Copperheads during Operation Fajr al Jouroud, which lasted from Aug. 19 to 31, 2017, or what types of targets Lebanese artillery units destroyed with their M712s. If those shells replaced expended rounds one-for-one, this would equate to Lebanese troops firing an average of more than 63 of the rounds every day. By comparison, U.S. Army artillery units fired just over 90 M712s during the first week of Operation Desert Storm, according to Brigadier General Abrams. Lebanese authorities also say that their operation only resulted in the deaths of 150 ISIS terrorists , which does not seem to align with this level of withering firepower. It is possible that the State Department’s statement that the new ammunition would make up for rounds Lebanon’s troops specifically fired during Operation Fajr al Jouroud is incorrect and that its forces had been employing Copperheads on a limited basis for months beforehand against ISIS, as well. At the same time, the country’s artillery forces could have relied on the shells more to destroy bunkers, other structures, and other hard cover rather than target groups of terrorists, just as U.S. forces did in Iraq. In Lebanon, the rounds could have been useful for engaging ISIS vehicles, including suicide car and truck bombs , as well, but only if troops happened to spot them in enough time to call in the strike. Video footage, seen earlier in this piece and below, that the Lebanese military released online does appear to show Copperheads destroying pick-up trucks, various structures, a cave entrance, and troops in the open. In January 2018, Russian forces also used their own type of laser-guided artillery shell, called Krasnopol , to strike a pickup truck in Syria as it arrived to pick up terrorists from a safe house. The Kremlin said those individuals had been among those involved in a mass drone attack against their bases in the country. However many shells the Lebanese did use during Operation Fajr al Jouroud and whatever targets those shells destroyed, the projectiles are clearly an important part of the Lebanese Armed Forces’ arsenal and one of its very few precision guided weapon. At present, the aforementioned AC-208s offer the only other significant capability in this regard with their AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. The Lebanese Air Force’s new A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft are slated to gain the ability to fire low-cost Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) laser-guided 70mm rockets soon. These weapons could be very important in the near future, even as the threat of ISIS continues to recede. After the end of Operation Fajr al Jouroud, Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun declared victory over the terrorist group, which also steadily lost ground in Iraq and Syria throughout 2017. But Lebanon faces a more complex situation with regards to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which has been actively supporting Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and receives significant support from Iran. During the Qalamoun Offensive , which preceded Operation Fajr al Jouroud, it appeared as if the Lebanese military had at least a tacit agreement to keep its activities away from Hezbollah-controlled areas . The Lebanese Armed Forces now occupy a stronger position along the Syrian border, though, a region typically seen as a sanctuary for Hezbollah. Without a common enemy the two parties could find themselves at risk of a confrontation . It’s not clear if an outright fight would occur though. Lebanon’s President Aoun is widely seen as friendly with Hezbollah, which is also a controversial member of the country democratically elected government. That relationship has survived significant pressure from the United States and some of Lebanon’s other international partners , as well as a bizarre episode in 2017 in which Saudi Arabia appeared to have essentially briefly kidnapped Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri at far right, along with President Michel Aoun, center, and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, at left., Balkis Press/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP In a televised address from Riyadh in November 2017, Hariri announced he was resigning his post and blamed Hezbollah and Iran for his decision. Aoun refused to accept the resignation and when Hariri returned later in the month, he agreed to continue to serve out his term. The debacle only appears to have reinforced Hezbollah’s standing in the country and has given Hariri new-found popularity for having defied his Saudi taskmasters. If an actual conflict were to break out, precision guided artillery and other munitions could help Lebanese troops mitigate the threat of Hezbollah’s substantial stockpiles of anti-tank guided missiles , rocket artillery , and ballistic missiles . The militant group has also acquired a number of armored and other vehicles over the years that could be prime targets for laser-guided weapons such as Copperhead. What we do know is that Lebanon’s artillery units now have nearly 830 more of the shells available should a crisis erupt in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 3, 2019",Let’s Talk About That Mysterious Chinese Anti-Ballistic Missile Launch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though there are few firm details, China says it has conducted a successful test of a ballistic missile defense interceptor. The launch could be part of ongoing work to shield the country from potential region threats, such as expanding Indian and South Korean ballistic missile forces, or even be a cover for continued anti-satellite weapon development. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense made only a brief announcement about the event – around 50 Chinese characters and fewer than 250 words in its English translation – on Feb. 6, 2018. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) fired the interceptor from the same site it had used for another test in 2014. “China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse defense system,” the official statement said, according to an English translation from People’s Daily , the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. “The missile interception test was defensive in nature and is not targeted at any country.” There was no mention of what particular interceptor system the PLA used in the experiment, whether it hit an actual test target, or any other specific objectives for the event. Separate reports have described it as a “hit-to-kill” weapon, meaning that it destroys its target by physically slamming into it, but so far there doesn’t appear to be an official confirmation. People’s Daily did include an infographic describing the basics of midcourse ballistic missile defense, but using out of date imagery of the components of the United States’ Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptor and associated sensor nodes, including the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX), one element of the land-based Solid State Phased Array Radar System ( SSPARS ), and a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. The U.S. military has been working to replace the DSP system with the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and upgrade various components of the SSPARS. To have the best chance of detecting an incoming threat and discriminating between real missiles and decoys after they’ve “gone cold” in outer space, a robust midcourse ballistic missile defense system, American or Chinese, requires these different sensors and systems to fuse that data together. That information would then also help cue the interceptor to the target, improving the chance of a kill. You can read more about how such a system would work in practice here . The People’s Daily infographic describing midcourse ballistic missile defense using images of American systems., People’s Daily China has long been interested in ballistic missile defense and has been actively working on these systems since the 2000s in response to parallel developments in the United States. But the primary publicly known interceptor is the HQ-19, a derivative of the HQ-9 , which is itself a Chinese development of Russia’s S-300 series . That system, also known to the United States as the CSA-X-19, is reportedly best suited to engaging medium range ballistic missiles (MRBM), which have a range of between approximately 620 and 1,865 miles, according to a 2017 Pentagon report to Congress on Chinese military developments. It could potentially have a capability against intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBM), with ranges between 1,865 and 3,420 miles, under certain circumstances. And despite the Chinese government’s common description of it as a midcourse ballistic missile defense system, the HQ-19 appears much more analogous to the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) system, which engages incoming threats in the final phases of their flight trajectory as they fall toward their target. THAAD is also generally seen as most capable against MRBM-class missiles , with a more limited capability against IRBMs. Chinese HQ-9 surface-to-air missile transporter-erector-launchers on parade in 2015. The HQ-19 is based on this weapon., Imaginechina via AP China’s most immediate threats in these two ballistic missile categories come from India, which has deployed the Agni-II MBRM and the Agni-III IRBM, along with the Agni-I short range ballistic missile (SRBM). The improved Agni-IV IRBM remains in development. This latest Chinese missile defense experiment does follow a separate Indian test launch of its Agni-V nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which was widely seen as a threat pointed at China, but there is no evidence that the two events are directly connected. On Feb. 6, 2018, Indian forces also fired an Agni-I, but again there is no indication that this was a direct response to China’s test launch. In addition, the Indian are working on building a class of five nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, as well, each of which would carry a dozen K-15 Sagarika or four larger K-4 nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). The K-15 is in the SBRM class, while the K-4 is in the IRBM category. India recently suffered a major setback in this project, though, after the first-in-class INS Arihant , the only boat of its type the country has built so far, suffered completely avoidable accident in 2017, which has left it in port under repair for nearly a year. Tensions between the two countries have been ratcheting up significantly since the beginning of 2017. In August 2017, a brawl in a disputed border region , known variously as the Dolam Plateau, Doklam, or Doka La, turned into a major international incident . Though prospect of an actual conflict thankfully subsided, both countries continue to reinforced their positions in the area. As such, the HQ-19 could be an increasingly important defense for both China’s regions bordering India on land or areas the country that it fears might come under SLBM attack in a crisis. China has other potential regional opponents that are in the process of expanding their ballistic missile arsenals or may be interested in doing so in the future, as well. In 2017, South Korea conducted the fourth test of its Hyunmoo-2C short-range ballistic missile and began discussions with the United States the modify a bilateral agreement that sets limits on its ability to develop even larger and longer range ballistic missiles. The South Korean government says it needs these weapons to defend against North Korea, but the Hyunmoo-2C’s nearly 500 mile range would put parts of the Chinese mainland, including the immensely strategic Dailan harbor and associated port and shipyard facilities, within range, as well. China could deploy a system such as the HQ-19 to those areas as a defensive countermeasure. There is also the possibility that the Japanese, Vietnamese, or other countries that have significant territorial disputes with China might look into developing or acquiring a ballistic missile system to challenge Chinese claims or defend their own against Beijing’s incursions. Vietnam has already bought long-range precision rocket artillery from Israel that it might be able to position within range of China’s steadily expanding man-made islands in the South China Sea. Japan has similarly begun development of land attack cruise missiles , in part to defend its possessions in the East China Sea, but there have been rumors in the past of the country looking into a possible ballistic missile program . In the South China Sea in particular, the HQ-19 could be an important addition to its facilities and defenses spread among a series of outposts.  In February 2018, Filipino news outlet Inquirer.net revealed an exclusive set of images suggesting the PLA was close to completing its already impressive construction work at seven different locations in that region of the Pacific Ocean. China had already begun installing fixed weapons and radars , as well as deploying fighter and bomber aircraft to many of those sites. There is also a possibility that China’s February 2018 test wasn’t related to ballistic missile defense at all, but was rather a cover for another Chinese anti-satellite weapon test . China declared that the aforementioned 2014 test launch from the same site was part of its work on ballistic missile defense systems and used almost identical language to describe it, but the United States has publicly said that this wasn’t the case. “China publicly called this ASAT [anti-satellite] test a ‘land-based missile interception test,’” Frank Rose, then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, said at a workshop organized by the Federation of American Scientists in Washington D.C. in 2015. “Let me assure you the United States has high confidence in its assessment that the event was indeed an ASAT test.” There’s a very fine line already between ballistic missile interceptors and anti-satellite weapons, both of which are intended to hit relatively small objects at very high altitudes. One of China’s developments in this regard is actually a derivative of the HQ-19, the SC-19, which mates components from the former missile with significantly larger rocket motor from the Kaituozhe-1 space launch vehicle. The larger Dong Neng (DN) series of ASAT weapons use actual ballistic missiles as the boost vehicle, such as the DF-11 . A low quality image of a transporter-erector carrying a DF-11 ballistic missile armed with what may be a Dong Neng-series anti-satellite weapon., Chinese state media China, as well as Russia, rightfully see the U.S. military’s reliance on satellites for communications , navigation , weapon guidance , and more as an Achilles Heel they could exploit in any possible near-peer conflict. We at The War Zone have highlighted repeatedly the potential for future warfare in space and the problems such an attack could leave for the United States in its wake . If nothing else, it may have just been another demonstration of China’s increasingly capable military. The country is also hard at work on autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles , hypersonic and electro-magnetic weapons , and more. It has been looking to project its existing power well beyond its borders, including the aforementioned developments in the South China Sea and the establishment of a major new military base in the East African country of Djibouti in 2017. Whatever the case, its the latest indication that China is not slowing down in its already rapid development of advanced military capabilities. It seems likely that we’ll only continue to see more of these tests, focused on both ballistic missile defense and shooting down satellites, in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2019","Navy’s Sea Hunter Drone Ship Is Getting A New Owner, New Abilities, and a Sister","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is now fully in control of the revolutionary Sea Hunter trimaran drone boat and already in the process of acquiring a second example. The service is still exploring just what missions these craft could perform, but the first one could be ready for operational testing by the end of the 2018 in one of a number of different roles, from sub- or mine-hunting to acting as an unmanned, floating communications node. On Jan. 30, 2018, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), one of the Pentagon’s main research and development arms, announced that it was formally turning over Sea Hunter to the Office of Naval Research (ONR). DARPA first began work on the unmanned surface vessel, also known as the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel, or ACTUV, in 2010, and ONR became a partner in the project four years later. The Navy will now continue experimenting with Sea Hunter as part of its Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV) program. “ACTUV’s move from DARPA to ONR marks a significant milestone in developing large-scale USV technology and autonomy capabilities,” Alexander Walan, a program manager in DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in an official statement . “Our collaboration with ONR has brought closer to reality a future fleet in which both manned warships and capable large unmanned vessels complement each other to accomplish diverse, evolving missions.” Oregon Iron Works, now called Vigor Works, a firm that specializes in exotic , experimental, and stealthy watercraft , built Sea Hunter in 2016. Leidos, which manufactured the first vessel’s navigation system , has since taken over the project entirely. In December 2017, that company received a $35.5 million contract from the Navy to build the second hull, referred to as Sea Hunter II. The bulk of that work would occur at a shipyard in Gulfport, Mississippi. The deal also included an unspecified number of option periods that could raise its total value to more than $43.5 million for continued work through 2020 . It’s not clear what missions the Navy has envisioned for Sea Hunter and its sister ship, but as the DARPA program name suggests, the original focus was on developing an experimental unmanned vessel capable of locating and tracking enemy submarines, primarily using a high frequency fixed sonar array. In August 2017, DARPA and ONR tested Sea Hunter with a mine countermeasures package, which could be another possible mission set for the boat. Both roles make good sense for an unmanned system such as Sea Hunter. A group of MDUSVs could more readily search a wider area for both hostile subs and mines and similar underwater hazards that larger warships and might be able to safely navigate narrow of shallow waterways to find those threats. The drone boats could also scout well ahead of manned ships for the enemy, reducing the chance that threats could avoid detection and get close to particularly high value assets, such as aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. Submarines are already a growing threat to the Navy’s surface ships, especially as advanced diesel-electric types and air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology continue to become more affordable. In addition to making these conventional submarines quieter and harder for sonar to detect, AIP systems also allow them to remain submerged for significantly longer periods of time than their predecessors, giving them capabilities in this regard closer to those of nuclear submarines, but at fraction of the price and overall complexity of those boats. Among America’s potential near-peer opponents, China in particular is working to dramatically expand its submarine capabilities , including with new AIP-equipped submarines . They’re also eager to export them , which could put those designs in the hands of smaller, regional adversaries. Russia is also slowly overhauling its submarine fleet and adding advanced diesel-electric types , as well as making those latter designs available to international customers . #China 's CSIC Unveils Three New #Submarine Designs for Export @DefenseThailand https://t.co/v1A2ehvo5x pic.twitter.com/dDbiURW26U — Navy Recognition (@NavyRecognition) November 13, 2017 Perhaps more pressing is the apparent surge in submarine development in North Korea. The country continues to grow a small, but significant fleet of types best suited to coastal defense and for inserting commandos , but is also working on larger designs capable of firing ballistic missiles , possibly carrying nuclear warheads . And while it rarely gets the same amount of public attention, the threat of naval mines is also very real and is a capability that even smaller nations could employ to great effect in a crisis. Mining remains one of the most logical ways that Iran could make good on threats to cut off the Strait of Hormuz to foreign navies and international shipping. Improvised mines have also begun to appear off the coast of nearby Yemen , where Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are employing a variety of asymmetric weapons against warships from the Saudi-led coalition operating in and around the country. For the U.S. Navy, smaller unmanned boats such as Sea Hunter would also be more cost effective than relying entirely on larger warships or other assets, such as aircraft or aerial drones, to search for and counter these threats. It could also help reduce the strain on the Navy’s manned surface fleets. These points are particularly important as the service struggles to achieve its goal of having a total of 355 ships and in finding sufficient numbers of sailors to man and repair facilities to support the fleet it has now. “ACTUV represents a new vision of naval surface warfare that trades small numbers of very capable, high-value assets for large numbers of commoditized, simpler platforms that are more capable in the aggregate,” Fred Kennedy, the director of DARPA’s TTO said. “The U.S. military has talked about the strategic importance of replacing ‘king’ and ‘queen’ pieces on the maritime chessboard with lots of ‘pawns,’ and ACTUV is a first step toward doing exactly that.” Shots of Sea Hunter at Vigor prior to her delivery. , DARPA But where ONR’s follow-on MDUSV program might be most game-changing is in its plans to get Sea Hunter and Sea Hunter II to work autonomously in concert with each other or other ships and assets, such as maritime patrol aircraft or aerial drones . Sea Hunter has already demonstrated an ability to avoid other ships and obstacles on its own. Networked together and operating in an autonomous mode, Sea Hunter and its sister ships might be even more flexible, alerting each other to potential undersea threats or points of interest. With robust data-links they could exchange data with manned ships or other assets, further narrowing down search areas and make it less likely that the target would be able to escape after an initial detection. The ability of an unmanned surface vessel such as Sea Hunter to find an enemy submarine and doggedly keep a fix on it was a key goal of the original ACTUV project. The Navy is already heavily invested in developing an interconnected series of networks that links ships, aircraft, and unmanned systems in the air and at sea together, derived from an initial air defense focused concept known as the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air, or NIFC-CA . At the same time, ONR has been experimenting with swarms of small unmanned aircraft and surface vessels , research and development that it might be able to leverage into its work with Sea Hunter. The Navy also wants to use Sea Hunter as the starting place for an eventual design that will be cover thousands of miles while operating on the open ocean for months at time. With that kind of range, endurance, and autonomy, the Navy would be able to maintain anti-submarine patrols over wide areas for extended periods, all without having to use a single ship, submarine, or sailor of its own. Those capabilities mean that, depending on their final configuration, the drone boats could similarly guard inlets, harbors, and other sensitive maritime locations 24 hours, seven days a week without having to take breaks, further relieving the strain on the service’s manned components. Whether close to home or out on the open seas, a Sea Hunter “class” of vessels could easily free up manned warships for more demanding missions or simply reduce the Navy’s overall operational workload to allow for crews to get more rest in between cruises. With all of these features, the final production Sea Hunters, or whatever craft they might evolve into, might find themselves taking on a wide array of combat missions and other tasks beyond just sub-hunting and mine-sweeping. There are already plans for anti-submarine weapons so the drone boats can engage targets directly and additional sensor suites to gather visual and electronic intelligence. In 2016, DARPA and ONR tested the drone boat with a parasail-mounted sensor system known as the Towed Airborne Lift of Naval Systems (TALONS). In August 2017, Sea Hunter took part in another exercise, Trident Warrior 2017 , along with the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Bunker Hill , three Arleigh Burke -class destroyers, and the Los Angeles -class attack submarine USS Pasadena . During those drills the drone boat carried an experimental long-range laser communications system, at times transmitting up to 10 gigabits of voice, video, and other data, highlighting a potential role as a communications node. The Navy appears to be eager to start examining just what Sea Hunter might be able to do and according to DARPA, the service could begin operational evaluations or actual field testing by the end of 2018. In February 2017, Captain Chris Sweeney, Deputy Director of Surface Warfare for Aegis and Ballistic Missile Defense, told USNI News that the service was considering forming an “experimental squadron” consisting of Sea Hunter, the first-in-class USS Zumwalt stealth destroyer , an Arleigh Burke -class destroyer, and a Littoral Combat Ship, or LCS, for this purpose. But whether or not the Navy creates this unit, it seems likely that we will be seeing more of Sea Hunter in various tests and exercises in any number of different roles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2019","Let’s Face It, The USAF Isn’t Serious About Buying a Light Attack Aircraft","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has announced details about the next phase of its light attack aircraft experiment, also known as OA-X , which will consist of more tests of Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine and Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano . This will be at least the sixth such evaluation of one or both aircraft the U.S. military has conducted since 2007, which continues to beg the question about whether the service is actually interested in either of these planes for its own use . The U.S. Air Force made the announcement on Feb. 2, 2018, saying it was necessary to gather more data on training, maintenance, and logistics requirements for a new light attack platform. The latest experiments would also explore potential mission systems for such an aircraft, including weapons , sensors, and communications equipment . Lastly, the service says it wants to investigate more about how it might integrate the planes into its existing force structure and how they might work together with other U.S. services, as well as allied or partner forces , as part of a larger coalition effort. The tests will occur at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona between May and July 2018. “Rather than do a combat demonstration, we have decided to work closely with industry to experiment with maintenance, data networking and sensors with the two most promising light attack aircraft – the AT-6 Wolverine and the A-29 Super Tucano,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said, according to the Air Force’s release. “This will let us gather the data needed for a rapid procurement.” “This effort to find a lower-cost and exportable aircraft for permissive environments is directly in line with the National Defense Strategy,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein added. “A light attack aircraft would not only provide relief to our fouth and fifth generation aircraft, but also bolster our interoperability, so we can more effectively employ airpower as an international team.” A Dominican Republic A-29 Super Tucano during a training exercise in the United States., USAF Goldfein’s point about the need for a cost-effective alternative to expensive fourth and fifth generation fighter bombers in low threat environments is entirely true, as we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly . But that requirement is also immediate, long-standing, well established, and something the Air Force and its sister services have already studied in depth over the past decade. Beginning in 2007, the U.S. Navy evaluated an Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucano in the light strike and forward air control roles, particularly with an eye toward offering an organic capability to special operations forces units as part of project known as Imminent Fury . The Brazilian plane maker, in cooperation with American firm Sierra Nevada Corporation, has since rebranded that plane as the A-29, in line with its official U.S. military designation. The next year, a team at Air Combat Command (ACC), drafted the first OA-X concept document , outlining a similar requirement. This subsequently evolved into two separate programs, Light Air Support (LAS) project for foreign partners and the Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) for the Air Force’s own use. In seeking an appropriate plane for both of those requirements, the service tested both the AT-6 and the Super Tucano, choosing the latter and formally giving it the A-29 moniker, a saga you can read about here . Though the service subsequently cancelled the LAAR requirement, Air Force crews assigned to the 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base have been actually flying A-29s to train foreign pilots on the light attack aircraft since 2014. Starting in 2010, the U.S. Air National Guard also explored the possibility of flying the AT-6 in the light attack role. For those tests, Textron and the Air Force worked to integrate various systems found on A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft into the smaller aircraft, with the idea that it would make it easier for those pilots to transition to the new plane. A pilot from the Air Force’s 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron exits an AT-6 aircraft after a flight during an Air National Guard-sponsored program in 2010., USAF Most recently , the Air Force put the AT-6 and A-29 through the paces again in a series of tests at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 2017. That event also featured L-3’s AT-802L Longsword , a derivative of an agricultural aircraft, and Textron’s Scorpion light jet . And those six instances are just the times in the last decade the U.S. military has specifically tested the AT-6 and A-29. It does not count a United States-based test program that U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) led using a pair of heavily modified OV-10 Bronco aircraft on loan from NASA, a combat evaluation in Iraq involving those same planes, evaluations of armed Cessna C-208 Caravans for American and allied use, or the Air Force-supported development of modified crop dusters for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and light attack missions, all in the same time frame. SOCOM is also in the midst of its own complimentary program , called Light Attack Support Special Operations, or LASSO. The combat evaluation with the Broncos showed the underlying concept could be extremely effective in a real world setting, both in terms of mission performance and cost . The pair of aircraft used laser guided rockets to launch precision attacks against terrorists in the dead of night and required such a small logistical footprint that it was easy to self-deploy from one austere operating location to another as necessary. Radios onboard could locate particular targets and using their off-the-shelf infrared sensors, the Broncos became man hunters, sniping individual combatants standing in windows and doors with their laser-guided rockets. It’s extremely hard to believe that the Air Force does not already have a trove of data on the AT-6 and A-29, and about light attack aircraft as a broad concept , that hits on all of the areas it says are in need of further study. That’s not to say anything of the information it could seek from the Navy or SOCOM in order to speed up the “rapid procurement” Secretary Wilson says she desires. If this information somehow does not exist, that raises serious questions about the value of the numerous previous tests and evaluations. One of the two OV-10G+ Broncos that SOCOM evaluated as part of a light attack aircraft program., Nick Thomas Even if there is still somehow test data left to collect, that wouldn’t have precluded already having a official procurement program in the works, especially if the Air Force was truly eager to get the aircraft into inventory as soon as possible. 265 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters have already been delivered, many of which belong to the USAF, and the service is buying more despite the fact that the aircraft has not yet even begun its operational test and evaluation phase, let alone flown any actual combat missions . As such, we at The War Zone had already questioned the rationale for both the Holloman experiments and the now-canceled overseas combat evaluation based on this existing history. At the same time, we noted that there was a heavy emphasis on foreign sales, which the Air Force has reiterated is an important consideration for this project. Government representatives from Australia, Canada, Paraguay, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as an unnamed fifth nation, were present during the events in New Mexico. The Air Force says it will invite more international partners to attend this second phase at Davis-Monthan. It’s not clear why the Air Force would need to spend additional time investigating a new “exportable aircraft” as Chief of Staff General Goldfein calls it, either. The United States does not seem to have any problem facilitating the delivery of American-made or partially American-made light attack aircraft to its allies and partners, including the A-29 itself. Just in 2017, the United States approved the potential sales of L-3’s AT-802L Longsword armed crop duster to Kenya and A-29s to Nigeria . It also announced plans to help deliver the latest iteration of Orbital ATK’s armed C-208 conversion, known as the AC-208 Eliminator , to Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia also tested Textron’s Scorpion , which it could seek to buy with the help of the American government. An Iraqi Air Force AC-208., DOD Afghanistan and Lebanon already operate A-29s thanks to U.S. government assistance. Iraq and Lebanon have older versions of the AC-208 they received through American military assistance programs. And don’t forget, the A-29 is an aircraft the Air Force already flies , as well as trains pilots and ground crews to operate and maintain. In spite of all this, senior Air Force officials such as Wilson and Goldfein insist that there is still more data to gather before their service can move forward with just developing a possible plan to buy any aircraft buying actual aircraft. “The Air Force is gathering enough decision-quality data through experimentation to support rigorous light attack aircraft assessments along with rapid procurement/fielding program feasibility reviews,” U.S. Air Force spokesperson Captain Emily Grabowski told Defense News . “We’re finalizing requirements documentation and developing an acquisition strategy.” Going through the process developing requirements documentation isn’t a guarantor of anything, either. The Air Force has similar broad specifications for a notional replacement for the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft, which we at The War Zone previously revealed are wallowing in a bureaucratic gray area. The same goes for a formal acquisition strategy. The service included funding for the LAAR program in a number of budget proposals , as well, but those aircraft never materialized. US Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, in green, shakes hands with Secretary of the AIr Force Heather Wilson during the OA-X experiment at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 2017., USAF It is true that there was money in the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year specifically set aside for light attack aircraft, but it’s important to remember that it was put there by advocates in Congress and was not in response to an actual Air Force request. It’s not even clear where the funding for this latest round of experiments will come from. “We are working a cost estimate for the next phase of experimentation, but we need to work with our industry partners to finalize the cost estimate,” Grabowski added in her statement to Defense News. “At this time, we expect to use current experimentation funding for the stateside experiment.” With all this in mind, it’s important to remember that the Air Force is also proceeding with its revamped second round of OA-X testing without releasing the results of the initial experiment, or producing an unclassified summary thereof. All of this continues to call into question the Air Force’s interest in and commitment to the program, despite the assurances from senior officials such as Wilson and Goldfein that the service is pushing ahead toward buying actual aircraft.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 13, 2019",The French Army Eyes All-New Fleet of Light Attack Airplanes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The French Army is in the process of defining the armament and other characteristics of its future Airbus H160M helicopters , which will replace its aging Aérospatiale SA342 Gazelles in the armed scout role. At the same time, particularly given the demands of France’s broad counter-terrorism campaign in Northwest Africa , the service is looking at light attack aircraft to supplement scout and gunship helicopters in certain circumstances and as cost-effective alternative to expensive multi-role combat aircraft. According to a report by Flight Global , the French Army is looking at a version of the still-in-development H160M that will have provisions for a forward-firing 20mm cannon, two door-mounted 7.62mm machine guns, and the ability to launch laser-guided 70mm rockets . This largely mirrors the existing weapon options for the SA342, but would also give the new helicopters a low-cost precision guided munitions capability. Earlier in 2018, Airbus launched the first Thales FZ275 laser guided rockets from an H145M helicopter with a similar weapons package, called the HForce, which also includes an L3 MX-15D sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras and a laser designator. The French Army already has a “box full of ideas” about what it will do with H160Ms, Lieutenant General Michel Grintchenko, chief of the French Army Light Aviation branch, or Aviation Légère de l’Armée de Terre or ALAT, said at a conference in London on Jan. 31, 2018, according to Flight Global. The senior officer was also “confident” that he would be able to replace each of his approximately 80 Gazelles with a new helicopter. In March 2017, the French government announced plans to procure as many as 190 of the new choppers from Airbus to replace the Gazelles, as well as Dauphin, Panther, and Fennec across all arms of the country’s military under the Inter-service Light Helicopter program, also known by its French acronym HIL. That project also involves upgrades to the service’s Tiger gunship helicopters and the acquisition of more NH90 transport choppers to supplant older Puma and Cougar types. But when it comes to the SA342, beyond just being a more modern aircraft – the original Gazelle prototype first flew in 1967 – the H160M also has two engines instead of one and will have significantly greater range and payload capacity over the older helicopters. Grintchenko said that this could open up the possibility of using them for light transport, medical evacuation and command and control functions. All of these capabilities could be especially useful for France with regards to its sprawling counter-terrorism effort across the Sahel region of Africa, the scrubland zone that divides North Africa and the Sahara Desert from the true sub-Saharan parts of the continent. At present, French troops operate from Mauritania, through Mali and Niger , all the way to Chad, with forces in each of those countries, as other locations in the region, as part of a mission dubbed Operation Barkhane. They are engaged in active conflict with a variety of Al Qaeda and ISIS-linked terrorist groups, as well as local militants. One of Airbus’ H160 prototypes, which will serve as the basis for the militarized H160M., Airbus The entire region is notably austere, with operations often occurring in remote areas far from large established bases in major population centers. Helicopters and other aircraft have become essential to supporting those activities, with the French often forming temporary air-land task forces to conduct long distance patrols through so-called “ungoverned spaces.” This term applies to areas where formal governments have little presence, giving terrorists and other armed groups, as well as criminal elements, places to flourish. But given the nature of the terrain, the ALAT is becoming increasingly of the view that helicopters might not be the best tool for all situations and that relying on fast-moving French Air Force multi-role fighter jets to provide additional support simply isn’t practical or cost effective. Lieutenant General Grintchenko revealed to a gathering in London that he was actively looking at acquiring a fleet of manned, fixed wing light attack aircraft to supplement his rotary wing fleet. “Why do I need to use a helicopter to do this particular mission; it has to be because I have something to do on the ground [and need to land in a confined area],” the ALAT’s commander posited, according to a separate report from Jane’s . “If I don’t need to do anything on the ground [such as area surveillance or close air support], then why don’t I use a fixed-wing aircraft instead? It is much cheaper.” France has already seen the limitations in its existing posture as it rushed to support American forces caught in an ambush in Niger in October 2017. It took an hour for French forces in that country’s capital Niamey to get Mirage 2000 jets over the battlefield. It took even longer for Tiger gunships and Puma transport helicopters , some which had to fly in from neighboring Mali, to arrive on the scene, by which time four U.S. Army soldiers were dead. Grintchenko did not specify any particular aircraft he was interested in buying, but he has no shortage of possible options. The French Air Force has ordered a number of Pilatus PC-21 turboprop trainers, a type that could potentially serve as the basis for a light attack platform. The French Army could potentially find a way to leverage that existing deal for its own needs. A Pilatus PC-21 trainer., Adrian Pingstone via Wikimedia The ALAT also has a small number of PC-6 light utility aircraft , an older type that the U.S. Air Force briefly experimented with in an armed configuration in the 1970s and that went on to serve as a light attacker with the Royal Thai Air Force afterwards. Those aircraft are now out of production, though there are a significant number of them available on the second-hand market. There has otherwise been a renaissance of sorts for light attack aircraft in recent years in general, even among larger air forces, such the U.S. Air Force. That service is in the midst of its own experiment with these types of aircraft, which has examined a variety of options presently on the market, ranging from low-cost jets to armed turboprop trainers to modified crop dusters . That future of that program remains uncertain , though. A Royal Thai Air Force AU-23 Peacemaker light attack aircraft, based on the Pilatus PC-6, in 2013., Z3144228 via Wikimedia Any of those options could offer the ALAT much more flexibility to respond to contingencies, especially in Africa. They would almost certainly offer greater range, speed, and a heavier armament compared to armed scout or gunship helicopters. As such, they would be able to orbit over particular areas for longer periods of time. Coupled with lightweight sensors, such as electro-optical or infrared cameras and the same low-cost laser-guided rocket capability the French Army plans for its armed choppers, these aircraft could be even more formidable weapons. This would also reduce the need to rely on the much more expensive to operate Mirage 2000s and Rafale fighter jets for longer range missions and to provide rapid support in the event of an ambush or other crisis. Lower- and slower-flying light attackers might just be better suited to providing close air support in certain circumstances, too. During the October 2017 ambush in Niger, French pilots reported that they did not engage the enemy forces in part because of a fear of accidentally hitting the American troops with their laser-guided bombs. The French military already has some historical experience mixing armed helicopters and light attack aircraft together, too. During its counter-insurgency campaign in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s, the French Air Force formed dedicated light attack squadrons to complement ALAT fixed-wing and helicopter units. The combined force operated a variety of armed trainers and other modified aircraft during the conflict. A French Rafale multi-role fighter jet links up with an American aerial refueling tanker during a mission over Iraq in 2017. , USAF It’s not clear when the French Army might actually get any H160Ms or light attack aircraft, though. Airbus has run into a number of delays with the H160 series of helicopters as a whole. The European aviation consortium had originally said it would deliver the first civilian models to buyers some time in 2016, but now doesn’t expect the initial prototypes to even receive a flight certification until 2019 . This delay was likely a factor in the French Navy’s decision to go ahead and scrap its dated Alouette III helicopters , another type the militarized H160M was supposed to replace, and lease additional AS365 Dauphins in the meantime. On top of that, the French government had itself expected the new helicopters would arrive in 2024, but the country’s new President Emmanuel Macron then proposed cutting military spending after entering office in 2017. Following the resignation of the Armed Forces Chief of Staff, General Pierre de Villiers, in protest, Macron changed course, promising to boost the country’s defense budget by more than $2 billion, with a significant portion going to paying for overseas operations. Exactly how these shifts have affected the country’s long term military procurement plans will likely become clear when France releases details about the latest plan to fund the military, expected to come later in 2018. If Grintchenko has been as vocal behind the scenes as he was in London, the French Army’s aviation arm might end up looking very different over the next six years.

Turkey is nearing the end of the second week of its incursion into Northwestern Syria , which aims crush Kurdish forces in and around the city of Afrin . Though the Kurds remain in control of most of the area, Turkish authorities have already announced plans to eventually push eastward, setting them up for a direct confrontation with their allies the United States and potentially setting off a larger regional conflagration . Since the offensive began on Jan. 19, 2018, Turkey claims its forces, along with Turkish-backed Free Syria Army rebels, or TFSA, have ejected the Kurdish Peopleâ€™s Protection Units, or YPG, from nearly 30 broad â€œzones,â€ which including 20 individual villages and seven strategic mountain and hilltop positions.

Both sides accuse each other of killing civilians , in the course of their operations or deliberately, and reports have emerged alleging TFSA fighters have been responsible for atrocities, including executing and mutilating Kurdish fighters they had captured. There's also another video going viral which is too graphic to share. But I'll try to describe it.

There is no indication that Iran has actually supplied any weapons to the Kurdish forces, which could just as easily have come from captured Syrian military stocks. Kurdish YPG forces have already claimed to have destroyed a number of Turkish armored vehicles. A separate report also claimed that a member of Kurdish Women’s Protection Units , or YPJ, an all-female companion organization to the YPG, had destroyed a tank in a suicide attack.Â #BREAKINGNEWS #Iran supplied the #YPG with the Toophan-1 ATGM to attack #Turkish tanks in #Afrin .

The PKK has previously used these types of weapons to shoot down gunships within Turkey. On Jan. 31, 2018, TFSA fighter claimed to have captured at least one of these systems from the YPG. Despite those threats, Turkey has a decided technological edge against the YPG. Turkish authorities have made clear that they won’t be deterred from achieving their objectives. #AfrinOp : 1st Corps of National Army claims capture of a MANPADS from #YPG on Hamam front. https://t.co/GJd1xrTVtU pic.twitter.com/TJBirmIsQ1 — Qalaat Al Mudiq (@QalaatAlMudiq) January 31, 2018 â€œHow long will the operation be?â€ Deputy Prime Minister Bekir BozdaÄŸ told Turkeyâ€™s state-run Anadolu Agency news outlet on Jan. 29, 2018. â€œThis operation will continue until the last terrorist is neutralized. It is not possible to tell a certain period of time. The length of the operation depends on its success.â€ How the intervention continues to play out will depend largely on how Turkish authorities define who theyâ€™re fighting and why. And thatâ€™s where things have already become painfully complex. Turkey insists that its intervention, which theyâ€™ve dubbed Operation Olive Branch, is only aimed at eliminating â€œterrorists,â€ including the YPG, and is not an attempt to cleanse all of the Kurds from Afrin and its environs. The real goal appears to be to prevent the Kurdish group from securing a de facto independent state, which Turkey fears could lead to its own Kurdish regions breaking away. The immediate impetus for the Turkish offensive appears to have been the U.S. government announcement that it planned to stay in Syria and support the local Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the bulk of which are YPG fighters, indefinitely. ErdoÄŸan lashed out at the plan, saying the United States was supporting an “ army of terror ” and that “this treacherous projectâ€™s target is Turkey.” A YPG fighter in Syria., Onder Simsek/LeJournal/SIPA via AP Turkish authorities already say the YPG is a direct extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party , or PKK. Turkey and the United States, among others, have both designated that group, which has fought for decades in the name of greater autonomy or outright independence for a Turkish Kurdistan, as a terrorist organization. However, the U.S. government insists that the YPG and PKK are two distinct entities. For years, the United States has worked with the YPG as part of the SDF, and the group has been instrumental in routing ISIS in Syria. The reality is that the two Kurdish groups likely coordinate at least to some degree, though itâ€™s unclear how much they truly share in the way of common strategies or an over-arching agenda. To underscore their claims about the linkage between the organizations, the Turks did release video of one of their aircraft bombing a massive hillside portrait of Abdullah Ã–calan , the most prominent of PKKâ€™s founding members who is presently in a Turkish prison, somewhere near the Afrin canton. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vx7dYLnseUI But the United States is more worried that the Turkish campaign undermines the fight against ISIS at a particularly critical juncture, potentially giving those terrorists a chance to regroup. The U.S. government has publicly called on both the Turks and the Kurds to keep the focus of their efforts on the Sunni extremists. â€œThe common threat is ISIS,â€ Pentagon Chief Spokesperson Dana White told reporters during a press briefing on Feb. 1, 2018. â€œAnd anything that takes away from that fight is a distraction. Â So that’s why we’ve asked them [the Turks] to restrain themselves and to limit this offensive.â€ Turkey has responded to those demands by claiming that they are fighting ISIS, also known as Daesh, as well as the YPG. However, there are no credible reports whatsoever that that latter organization has any presence in Syriaâ€™s far northwest corner. Reports suggestions that the Kurdish fighters have released Sunni Arab extremists they had in custody in order to fight Turkish forces and their allies are equally dubious. Beyond that, Turkeyâ€™s President ErdoÄŸan publicly threatened to extend his countryâ€™s Syrian intervention eastward on Jan. 26, 2018 . On Jan. 27, 2018, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu added his own call for the United States to evacuate its forces from in and around the strategic city of Manbij, which is a major SDF hub in northern Syria.Â Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, Michael Kappeler/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Leaving Manbij is â€œnot something we are looking into,â€ U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, the top American commander for operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, said in response on Jan. 29, 2018. In March 2017, U.S. special operations forces had specifically moved into the area around the city to block Turkish forces and the TFSA from seizing control from the YPG, a move that clearly stung Turkey. â€œWe will rid Manbij of terrorists, as it was promised to us,â€ ErdoÄŸan had said on Jan. 26, 2018. â€œWe will either do this together [with the United States] or we will take care of ourselves.â€ Itâ€™s not hard to imagine that if ErdoÄŸan makes good on this plan that it could lead his troops, or TFSA fighters, into a direct conflict with their supposed American allies. The United States has already said its forces near Manbij regularly come under fire from TFSA elements and are forced to defend themselves , though there have been no reported casualties on either side from these exchanges. U.S.-Turkish relations have already been especially cool since members of the Turkish military attempted to oust ErdoÄŸan in a coup in 2016 . Turkey’s president has blamed Fethullah GÃ¼len, a former political ally living in self-imposed exile, for masterminding that plot and has been infuriated by the U.S. government’s refusal to turn him over without clear evidence of his involvement. In the United States, politicians and others have begun to publicly question whether Turkey is truly an ally and some have called for a halt to arms sales and other cooperation , as well as removing dozens of American nuclear weapons from a Turkish Air Base.Â As if things werenâ€™t complicated enough, though, the United States has been equally clear that they do not provide any support to the YPG in the Afrin canton and have a zero tolerance policy for any member of the SDF that shifts their attention away from battling ISIS. Pentagon spokespersons have added that the international coalition fighting the terrorists has at no time ordered any Kurdish elements to reposition themselves to response to the Turkish incursion. Pentagon (cont'd) ""We will not condone the use of any Coalition-provided weapons and equipment for any purpose other than to defeat ISIS. If we identify any group or individuals violating this agreement, we will investigate and cut off equipment support."" 2/2 #SDF #Afrin #Syria — Kevin Baron (@DefenseBaron) January 25, 2018 This in turn led to the rather stunning admission that the SDF as a whole, while it benefits from U.S.-coordinated materiel support and air and artillery strikes, operates entirely independent of any direct coalition control. The implication there is that why U.S.-backed fighters might end up cut off from future support, thereâ€™s nothing to suggest they couldnâ€™t take the weapons and equipment they have now and set off for Afrin. At the same time, whether or not the United States would continue to support the YPG, even within the context of the SDF, if the political environment changed sufficiently is equally unclear. in January 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis acknowledged “historic connections” between that the group and the PKK and talked favorably about Sunni Arabs in the force. (5/9) Mattis on whether there's an alternative to US cooperation with Kurdish-led SDF: ""You're going to see a lot of Sunni Arabs, obviously in the — in the police force."" Pentagon plans to ""leave local security forces"" — Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) January 22, 2018 U.S. President Donald Trump also reportedly called his Turkish counterpart to urge him to reconsider the military operations in and around Afrin and warn about the potential for a direct confrontation with U.S. forces in Syria, according to the White House. Turkey subsequently challenged this interpretation of the phone call, which officials there insisted has been a far less dramatic exchange of views . And knowing that the United States has no intention of supporting the YPG in Syriaâ€™s northwest corner, the Kurds there have made public appeals to the Syrian government, imploring it to defend its sovereign territory against the Turkish invasion. So far, Syriaâ€™s dictator Bashar Al Assad has not sent any forces to the area, but his government has decried Turkeyâ€™s actions and threatened to shoot down Turkish jets , something they have actually done in the past. Assad is clearly not thrilled about Turkey invading his country, but he still has to contend with the separate agendas of Russia , one of his primary benefactors. The Russians had previously cut a deal with the YPG in Afrin, but abandoned them in favor of at least tacitly backing Turkeyâ€™s operation, most likely as a way to further drive a wedge between authorities in Ankara and Washington. If Syrian troops were to attack Turkish forces or TFSA rebels, it could put them at odds with the Kremlin, as well as risk Turkey appealing to its NATO allies for support. Assad could try to move closer to Iran, his other primary ally, but that country has recently been beset by a massive outpouring of public furor in part over its involvement in Syria. Any of these scenarios could have a cascading effect elsewhere in the country and potentially beyond Syriaâ€™s borders. There was evidence that PKK and YPG fighters moved into Iraq to support that countryâ€™s Kurdish Regional Governmentâ€™s abortive bid for independence in 2017. Iran and Turkey both sided with the government in Baghdad in forcing Kurdish authorities to back down. With so many competing agendas and intertwined alliances of convenience, itâ€™s hard to say for sure what might happen, even in the near future. All of this taken together, though, does present a very real possibility of prompting an entirely new phase in the already multi-faceted conflict in Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 27, 2020",Now Russia Is Demanding US Stop Spying Near Its Borders After Buzzing Navy Spy Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has mocked the crews of American spy planes as overly cautious and suggested the United States either stop such missions near its borders or agree to a set of rules governing those flight. The official statement comes after the U.S. Navy released half a dozen videos showing one of Russia’s Su-27 Flanker series fighter jets flying dangerously close to an EP-3E Aries II intelligence aircraft in international air space over the Black Sea. The inciting incident occurred on Jan. 29, 2018, as the Navy’s Aries II conducted a routine mission in the Black Sea near Ukraine and its Russian-occupied Crimea region. The Kremlin says Crimea is part of its national territory and developed a major military presence there, including advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles , since seizing control of it in March 2014. The Russian military “will continue to provide robust defense of the borders of Russian airspace,” the statement from the country’s Defense Ministry on Feb. 1, 2018 said, according to quasi-state outlet RT . “If the realization of this fact by American pilots causes depression and phobias, we recommend that the American side either exclude flying near Russian borders in the future or return to the negotiations table and agree on a set of rules for such flights.” The United States has already made it clear that it believes the actions of the Russian pilot were dangerously aggressive, with the Su-27 flying within five feet of the four-engine turboprop spy plane at times during its nearly 3 hour long intercept. The Flanker then jammed itself in front of the EP-3E, leaving only an estimated 10 feet between the two planes and shaking the crew onboard the American aircraft, before departing the area, according to the U.S. Navy. A US Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane., USN “For the Russian fighter aircraft to fly this close to the U.S. Navy aircraft, especially for extended periods of time, is unsafe,” U.S. Navy Captain Bill Ellis, commander of Task Force 67, which oversees the service’s patrol and intelligence gathering aircraft in Europe and Africa, said in his own statement on Jan. 31, 2018. “The smallest lapse of focus or error in airmanship by the intercepting aircrew can have disastrous consequences. There is no margin for error and insufficient time or space for our aircrews to take corrective action.” The EP-3E subsequently aborted its mission and returned to base. The Navy has now released a total of six video clips of the incident which notably show the Su-27 was armed with a mix of semi-active radar homing and infrared homing versions of the R-27 air-to-air missile during the intercept. The five additional clips the Navy made public on Jan. 31, 2018 are seen below. “The maneuvers of the Russian fighter jet on January 29 were standard, absolutely legal and perfectly safe for the American surveillance plane,” the Russian Ministry insisted in its February 1st, 2018 statement. “When NATO fighter jets conduct similar maneuvers towards Russian military planes on patrol over the Baltic, the Barents, the Norwegian, the North or any other sea, they do not affect the Russian crews in the slightest way.” The Kremlin has not provided any associated evidence to bolster its claims that NATO jets routinely perform similarly unsafe maneuvers when intercepting and otherwise monitoring its aircraft in international airspace. In June 2017, Russia did release a video showing another Flanker type fighter placing itself between a Dutch F-16AM fighter jet and a Tu-154 VIP plane carrying the country’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The Viper never appeared to be dangerously close to either Russian aircraft, though. It is true that these contested intercepts are hardly out of the ordinary . They’ve become even more pronounced as Russia’s relations have deteriorated with the United States , other NATO members , and countries along its borders that aren’t part of the bloc, but are aligned with Western Europe . They’ve even spread to Syria, where U.S. and Russian military aircraft regularly run into each other, sometimes almost literally . This has occurred despite a formal agreement between the two countries that is supposed to keep their planes separated specifically to avoid any dangerous interactions. The video below shows U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter jets forward deployed in Lithuania intercepting Russian Su-30 Flanker-Cs in 2017. But the Kremlin’s new appeal to stop the flights near its borders entirely or adopt a bilateral understanding is a significant development. It underscores a separate and worrying breakdown in long-standing arms control treaties and other basic norms , which we at The War Zone have previously discussed in depth here . Notably in relation to this incident in the Black Sea, the Russian government has already blocked U.S. surveillance flights over its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea, as well as Chechnya and South Ossetia, in violation of the Open Skies Treaty . That deal is supposed to provide foreign countries with a way to legally observe others’ peacetime military movements and strategic posture in order to promote transparency, stability, and help with treaty verification. It’s worth noting that South Ossetia is not part of Russia, even by the Kremlin’s own assertions, at least as of yet. The United States and the bulk of the international community agree that it is integral part of Georgia, despite the region’s declaration of independence following a brief war in 2008 between Russian “peacekeepers” and Georgian forces. Russia does seem to be quietly working toward formally annexing the province, though. A US Air Force OC-135 Open Skies aircraft on the ground in the Czech Republic in April 2017., Rostislav Kalousek/CTK via AP Now, it appears Russia might be looking for new ways to block military flights near Crimea. Though it did mention American and NATO spy flights elsewhere, the Russian Ministry of Defense’s statement focused heavily on reiterating the country’s claim to the region. “We would like to address the commander of the 67th Task Force of the 6th Fleet Bill Ellis with a reminder Crimea is an integral part of Russia,” the official statement said, according to TASS . The Russian state-run outlet added that “the Russian military believes that when it dispatches air pilots on reconnaissance missions in this part of the Black Sea the United States should keep in mind that they will encounter Russian fighters, and not Ukrainian partners, or supply all crews with updated maps showing the correct borders of Russia’s airspace.” Russian aircraft have already harassed American and NATO warships operating in the Black Sea on numerous occasions . In February 2017, the Pentagon complained about two Russian Su-24 Frencer swing-wing combat aircraft and an Il-38 May maritime patrol aircraft making provocatively low passes near the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Porter as it sailed through the body of water. The United States is unlikely to respond to the Russian demands to curtail its military activities in international airspace. The U.S. Navy’s initial statement said that both parties have a clear right to operate in those neutral spaces, but that it is the Kremlin’s forces that haven’t been abiding by international standards for doing so. A US Air Force F-15C based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom intercepts a Russian Su-24 Fencer. , USAF The U.S. government has not had good experiences with attempting to come to bilateral understandings about surveillance flights, even when they’re done at the highest levels, either. In 2015, the United States struck just such a deal with China outlining rules for the intercepts themselves and establishing an hotline in case of any apparent miscommunication. This had followed years of dangerous intercepts over various areas of the Pacific, particularly the East China Sea and South China Sea , most notably an incident in 2001 that left a Chinese pilot presumed dead and another EP-3E severely damaged and stranded with its crew on China’s Hainan Island. This didn’t stop the aggressive encounters and the Navy subsequently installed special camera pods on its Aries II aircraft to better capture evidence the incidents. These types of additional measures haven’t prompted China to change course, either, with a People’s Liberation Army Air Force Su-30MKK Flanker buzzing a WC-135C Constant Phoenix atmospheric sampling plane over the East China Sea in May 2017. So, with regards to Russia, the U.S. military would likely be more inclined to reiterate its inherent rights, possibly in the form of more visible responses to Russian aircraft making routine trips in and around Europe or elsewhere, additional surveillance missions near Russia’s borders, or by adding its own armed escorts to those flights, all of which would require a significant expenditure of manpower and other resources. Any such escalation could prompt responses in kind from Kremlin. Both sides could also appeal directly to international governing bodies to try and secure formal decisions to bolster their claims about the others’ violations of various treaties and norms, real or imagined, as well. This could have a cascading impact on other international arrangements, though, as they become diplomatic bargaining chips. Whatever does happen, the Russians seem intent on using all the tools available to indirectly renegotiate various international agreements and redraw various boundaries to suit their own interests. This will only increase the likelihood of miscalculations and mistakes, though, which could easily turn a dangerous intercept into a much more serious incident.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2019",US Missile Defense Test Fails As N. Korea Plans Parade With Hundreds of Ballistic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s latest test of its Standard Missile 3 Block IIA ballistic missile interceptor has reportedly failed.  So far, it’s unclear what happened, and the weapon is still in development, but it does come amid months of escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea and reports that authorities in Pyongyang are planning a parade with hundreds of ballistic missiles , likely in no small part to dissuade the U.S. government from considering a limited “bloody nose” strike. CNN was first to report the apparent failure on Jan. 31, 2018. The test launch would be the fifth for the weapon, commonly referred to as the SM-3 Block IIA, and the third in which it attempted to actually intercept another missile. The last such experiment, which occurred in June 2017, also failed , but this was because a U.S. Navy sailor accidentally triggered the missile’s self-destruct function. Another SM-3 Block IIA had successfully knocked down a target for the first time four months earlier . The U.S. military plans to eventually add the weapons to the Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and install them at fixed Aegis Ashore sites in Europe. Japan is a major partner in the program and plans to equip its own warships with the weapon and establish land-based Aegis Ashore facilities within its territory. “The Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy sailors manning the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) conducted a live-fire missile flight test using a Standard-Missile (SM)-3 Block IIA missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii, Wednesday morning,” Mark Wright, a spokesperson for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), told CNN. The organization has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that the test was unsuccessful. According to CNN, this was a deliberate decision made specifically in light of heightened tensions with North Korea. The U.S. military plans for the SM-3 Block IIA to be a critical part of its overall ballistic missile defense shield, which is primarily focused on defeating threats from smaller opponents, such as North Korea and Iran. The United States says its systems are not intended to negate the strategic deterrent capabilities of potential near-peer opponents, such as Russia or China. Though MDA only expected earlier versions of the SM-3 to take on medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the Block IIA missile could eventually provide another, if more limited defensive option against higher- and faster-flying ICBMs in certain circusmstances. The War Zone has previously examined the missiles capabilities and potential limitations in depth here . Missile defense is a complicated endeavor overall and failures are not uncommon. Whether they’re successful or not , these test launches are necessary in order to gather important data to further improve the weapon. An official infographic showing the various interceptors the U.S. military has or is developing as part of its ballistic missile defense program and what type of weapons it expects them to be able to shoot down., MDA The development of SM-3 Block IIA has taken on new significance in light of the rapid progress North Korea has made in its ballistic missile program, specifically the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). In November 2017, the North Koreans revealed their Hwasong-15 ICBM , which could potential carry a nuclear warhead to any point in the continental United States. So it’s not necessarily surprising that MDA might be disinclined to report another failure, regardless of the cause, which it might not even fully understand yet. Japan could also be concerned about what message publicly announcing even the basic details surrounding the failure might send to North Korea or other potential adversaries, too. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera, at center, shakes hands with an American military official at the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex in Hawaii on Jan. 10, 2018., Kyodo via AP The situation on the Korean Peninsula already looks set to become more politically and militarily complicated. Also on Jan. 31, 2018, CNN reported , citing anonymous sources, that a North Korean parade in February 2018 would feature hundreds of this class of weapons, including dozens of Hwasong-15s, “to scare the hell out of the Americans.” North Korea will stage the event ostensibly as an annual tribute to the founding of its military, the Korean People’s Army. However, this had traditionally occurred in April . The new date, February 8th, conveniently happens to be the day before the 2018 Winter Olympics start in the South Korean city of Pyeongchang. Both Koreas will march in the open ceremony together in a gesture seen as an attempt de-escalate tensions, but which critics have warned is a way for authorities in Pyongyang to drive a wedge between officials in Seoul and their American counterparts, who have continually advocated for a tough stance toward North Korea. North Korean premier Kim Jong-un, in black, stands next to a Hwasong-15 ICBM ahead a test in November 2017., KCNA In deference to their South Korean allies, the United States has agreed to push back major annual bilateral defensive military exercises, which North Korea routinely claims are actually preparations for a northward invasion. In light of that development, officials in Pyongyang reiterated a common demand for South Korea to end the drills permanently . But with reports about the SM-3 Block IIA’s failure already leaking out, it’s not clear if MDA’s decision not to discuss the matter publicly will have the intended impact. The U.S. government is unlikely to rely on open reports in the press to reassure its Japanese and South Korean allies about the progress of the program and its commitment to defending them against North Korean threats. North Korea is still likely to at least use the incident for propaganda purposes, regardless of the facts, as well. And the actual effectiveness of America’s existing ballistic missile defenses is an important part of the growing debate about a potential “bloody nose” strike against North Korea. President Donald Trump again referred to what his administration called a “campaign of maximum pressure,” which reportedly includes various military options, during his first State of the Union address on Jan. 30, 2018. “North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland,” Trump told the assembled lawmakers and guests on Capitol Hill. “We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.” Below is video MDA released from the successful test of the SM-3 Block IIA in February 2017. Also on Jan. 30, 2018, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva offered some additional details on possible plans for a military operation against North Korea. The senior officer suggested that it might be possible to neutralize “most” of the country’s nuclear-capable ballistic missile capability by striking at its associated infrastructure. “Remember, missile infrastructure is not just the missiles,” Selva told reporters in during a round table discussion in Washington, D.C. “If you’re the poor sergeant that has to go out and launch the missile, and I blow up your barracks, you’re not available to go do your job.” He also said the U.S. government believed that the North Koreans had not yet finished development of the terminal guidance and re-entry vehicle technology for a fully-functional nuclear-capable ICBM. The general acknowledged that they could have done so, but not yet demonstrated it publicly, but insisted that this possibility was remote. “It is possible, although I think unlikely, that he has found a way to do the test without us knowing,” Selva said. “But I can’t envision what that test would look like, where he would be convinced that he has those components at a reliable-enough level of performance to declare that he’s ready.” Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva., DOD U.S. officials do appear to be in agreement that North Korea won’t lack this capability for long. “We talk about him [Kim Jong-un] having the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon to the United States in a matter of a handful of months,” Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo told the BBC in an interview, adding that there was a good understanding of North Korean ballistic missile capabilities within the American Intelligence Community and among its foreign partners. If the United States did decide to go ahead with a punitive strike against North Korea, it would almost certainly provoke a massive North Korean retaliatory attack against the United States and its East Asian allies, which could involve ballistic missiles , conventional artillery , and other conventional and asymmetric capabilities . With this in mind, its highly debatable that the U.S. military would be able to keep a small strike against Kim Jong-un’s regime from rapidly escalating. CIA Director Mike Pompeo., Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP With years of talk of “ decapitating ” his regime from American and South Korean officials, its not clear he would ever be convinced any American strike would be limited in scope. It is not hard to imagine Kim Jong-un ordering a launch with a less-than-fully reliable nuclear-tipped ICBM, or even completely untested weapon, in a crisis where he believes the survival of his regime is at stake. “If we believe that Kim is undeterrable without such a strike, how can we also believe that a strike will deter him from responding in kind?” Victor Cha, a professor at The Georgetown University and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank, wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Jan. 30, 2018. “And if Kim is unpredictable, impulsive and bordering on irrational, how can we control the escalation ladder, which is premised on an adversary’s rational understanding of signals and deterrence?” The Trump administration had been considering Cha as a candidate for Ambassador to South Korea, but has since dropped that plan after the academic and former adviser to President George W. Bush on North Korea voiced these same concerns in private. It seems that other senior U.S. leaders have similar concerns, though. Victor Cha, right, and President George W. Bush., The Georgetown University “There’s plans out there that have been developed over the years [for military action on the Korean Peninsula],” U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General Robert told a gathering at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank, on Jan. 25, 2018. “If it were to go down, I am not sure it’s going to go down the way we planned it.” “It never does,” he continued. “It would not be good for anybody.” At the same time, though, there has been an almost worrying overconfidence from the highest levels of the U.S. government about the ability to ward off incoming ballistic missiles in such a scenario. The concern here is is that some American officials might feel there is a good enough chance able to escape a North Korean response to make the idea of punitive strike more viable. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway recently wrote a detailed dissection of the myths and realities of present missile defense capabilities, finding the truth lies somewhere in middle . The last SM-3 Block IIA failure doesn’t indicate the program is failing, but it does underscore how difficult this this technology is to develop and how it would be foolish to rely on it in its present state as part of the planning for any military action against North Korea.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 22, 2018",Is This Chinese Navy Ship Equipped With An Experimental Electromagnetic Railgun?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged on social media that show a Chinese landing ship armed with what could be a prototype railgun . If confirmed, this would be the first time any country has actually installed an electromagnetic gun system on a ship, even for test purposes, and would be a game-changing development for China’s military. The images now circulating online show the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) Haiyang Shan , a Type 072III-class landing ship with the pennant number 936, sitting in Wuchang Shipyard in Hubei province with a new, massive gun turret fitted on its bow. The mount appears to be fully enclosed and features a large diameter gun barrel. The other vessels in the class have a significantly smaller twin 37mm cannon in that position. A low quality close up of the Haiyang Shan ‘s new turret. , via @xinfengcao There are also a number of shipping containers amidships, which could contain the large power source required for an electromagnetic weapon system. One of them also features an air conditioner, which could be to cool power generators or other electronic systems or be an indicator of a manned control station for the weapon or a place where engineers could sit and gather data during live fire experiments. The cannon’s size and shape, as well as the nearby containers, are reminiscent of the U.S. Navy’s own prototype railgun . While that system has yet to go to sea, the service has released a number of images and video of the land-based test fixture showing the boxy-looking cannon on a frame with its power source and other control systems in containers below. It also features an automatic loading system . With so much equipment exposed on the deck, the fit aboard the Haiyang Shan does not appear to be an operational design. Designed to carry up to 500 tons of cargo, the Type 072III-class does make good sense as a test ship, though. The U.S. Navy has itself proposed using a Spearhead -class expeditionary fast transport, previously known as the Joint High Speed Vessel, for the first at-sea tests of its own prototype railgun. These vessels are based on catamaran ferry design and have a large, open helicopter landing pad that could accommodate temporary test article installations. According to the U.S. Navy’s own public plans, they envision a weapon that would give ships significantly increased range over existing cannons, allows those vessels them to engage targets faster, and has the ability to hit enemy forces on land and at sea, as well as knock down aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. On top of that, it could make those ships less vulnerable and ease the strain on the logistics chain, since the ammunition is inert and doesn’t require an explosive charge to sending it flying down range. These features also mean the weapon could be cheaper than a traditional gun system and give ships more magazine depth by storing more rounds in the same space that propelling charges previously occupied. You can read more about these potential benefits here . As such, the weapons could be useful for both a wide array of different mission sets, including sea control and amphibious operations , both of which are important considerations for China, which has vast maritime territorial claims. The PLAN is already in the midst of a major push to expand the size and capabilities of its surface fleets , as well. The Chinese military has also been heavily invested in railguns and other related technologies, such as electromagnetic catapults to launch aircraft from its future aircraft carriers . China’s electromagnetic weapon research reportedly dates to at least the 1980s , but there were indications that it had advanced considerably just recently. In October 2017, Rear Admiral Ma Weiming, in charge of such research at the PLAN University of Engineering in Wuhan – the capital of Hubei province, home of Wuchang Shipyard – announced his team had made major breakthroughs in their research. The gun aboard Haiyang Shan could also just be a large conventional cannon or a hybrid system of some type that combines a railgun’s inert, hypervelocity projectile design with a traditional chemical propelling charge. The U.S. Army and Navy have both looked at the latter concept as a way to leverage work on electromagnetic weapons and get at least some limited capabilities into combat in the near term. The Navy’s experimental railgun shoots rounds at approximately six times the speed of sound. In theory, a conventional ship cannon or artillery piece could fire that same aerodynamic projectile at speeds up to Mach 3, which would be significantly faster than is possible with existing ammunition. But the U.S. Navy has reportedly begun to lose interest in electromagnetic weapons after more than a decade of research and development without a prototype that meets the requirements for a field test. We at The War Zone have reached out to the Office of Naval Research, which is leading the effort, to try and confirm the status of the program, but have so far not received responses to our queries. Its worth noting that Wuchang Shipyard has previously performed tests of major equipment destined for the advanced Type 055 destroyer and the country’s aircraft carriers , among other ships. Suffice to say, Chinese warships equipped with electromagnetic guns, or even hybrid systems, could significantly help in the PLAN’s ability to project power and deny access to various parts Pacific region it claims as its integral national territory . This, in turn, would pose an all new challenge to its competitors in those spaces, especially the United States . But above all else, it is another very high-tech area where Beijing may be quickly moving past parity with the United States, a phenomenon that is becoming an increasingly dire concern within the halls of the Pentagon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2018",US Uses a Private Helicopter Force to Get Around Kabul And Intel Woes Might Put It At Risk,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than 16 years of U.S.-backed efforts to stabilize the country , American diplomats and other supporting personnel still rely on privately-operated helicopters just to safely get around Afghanistan’s capital Kabul. Now, a new State Department report says contractors responsible for assessing potential threats to those flights do not have the necessary security clearances and resources to effectively do their jobs. This all comes amid a separate report from a top U.S. government watchdog that suggests the international coalition is deliberately obscuring details about the dismal state of security across the country. On Jan. 29, 2018, the Department of State’s Office of the Inspector General released the review of the Embassy Air Program, which is responsible for the flights, primarily using ex-U.S. Marine Corps CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, to and from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, the U.S. Embassy in the city, and a nearby diplomatic support facility known as Camp Alvarado. Per the existing arrangement, intelligence analysts, private contractors working for private military company DynCorp , are supposed to help other personnel craft operational reports and flight plans that mitigate potential risks to those activities. At the time of writing, the Inspector General report was no longer available online, but it is unclear why that was the case. “DynCorp intelligence analysts, however, do not have access to Top Secret intelligence,” the State Department’s internal investigators found in their audit. “In addition, the DynCorp intelligence analysts … are not located in facilities that are suitable for processing and storing of Top Secret intelligence.” Those individuals do have a Secret clearance. As a result, they have relied heavily on information available through two separate U.S. government information networks , the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System ( CENTRIXS ) and the Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network ( SIPRNet ), which contain only information classified at the Secret level or below. An Embassy Air CH-46 heads out for a flight in Kabul in 2016., NATO The concern is that since those analysts do not have access to Top Secret sources, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System ( JWICS ), that they inherently lack the ability to present a complete picture of potential threats. Compounding that problem is that these individuals work in facilities that don’t meet the necessary security requirements for personnel to handle that information, even if it was available, such as having a specialized Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility , or SCIF, on site. The investigators did not say whether or not there was evidence that this lack of information had contributed to any dangerous incidents, but it’s a significant issue nonetheless. The Embassy Air Program runs an average of between five and six scheduled shuttle flights five or six times days a week, carrying an average of 150 people on each of those days, according to the State Department’s report. In addition, the contractors are on call to help American diplomats, supporting personnel, and other U.S. nationals evacuate in a crisis and similar contingency missions, as well as otherwise being available to support the Ambassador and their staff. During the 2017 fiscal year, the Embassy Air Program in Afghanistan conducted more than 32,000 scheduled flights and more than 3,500 unspecified “special missions,” transporting nearly 36,000 passengers in the process. Not having access to all of the U.S. government’s own intelligence resources can only increase the risks to those flights. Kabul has “tenuous security situations that are constantly changing, and often flying is the only safe way to transport personnel,” according to the State Department’s investigators. An unclassified, official satellite image of the State Department’s Camp Alvarado in Afghanistan as of December 2012., DoS The Office of the Inspector General report said that this same assessment of the general security environment and the concerns about contractors’ access to appropriate intelligence information applied to Embassy Air’s activities in Iraq , as well, which performs a similar volume of flights across that country. The State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs’ Office of Aviation, also known as the State Department Air Wing , has been managing the program in both countries since 2009, as well as aircraft elsewhere around the world engaged in counter-drug and other specialized activities. The scope of the effort in Iraq is significantly larger than the one in Afghanistan, though, with helicopters running scheduled flights daily between the Embassy and other diplomatic sites in Baghdad. The shuttle service also makes trips to the cities of Erbil and Basrah, as well as Amman, the capital of neighboring Jordan, multiple times per week. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs says it will make sure to require intelligence analysts working for Embassy Air in both countries have Top Secret clearances in its next round of contracts, which will cover more than a decade of future State Department Air Wing operations. The State Department is in the midst of that contracting process, but its not clear when properly cleared personnel might actually arrive. Officials are reportedly working with DynCorp to see if the company could reassign individuals with appropriate credentials to the jobs in the meantime, but that wouldn’t change the lack of secure facilities in both Afghanistan and Iraq for those individuals to actually view any Top Secret information. At the same time, the report’s findings are especially pertinent to Afghanistan right now , where the Taliban has already made a number of uncharacteristically bold attacks on sites within Kabul in 2018. On Jan. 28, 2018, a member of the insurgent group detonated a suicide car bomb hidden inside an ambulance near the old site of the country’s Ministry of the Interior, an area that also contains a hospital and numerous diplomatic buildings, killing 95 people and injuring more than 190 others. This followed other notably deadly attacks earlier in the month, including separate incidents in which actual armed gunmen stormed the Intercontinental Hotel in the capital and the offices of Western charity Save the Children in the city of Jalalabad further East. A father and his child, who were both injured in the Taliban’s attack on Save the Children’s offices in Jalalabad, walk past police after receiving treatment at a nearby hospital on Jan. 27, 2018., Kyodo via AP The situation in the country has already been increasingly precarious for some time. In September 2017, the Taliban claimed it had attempted to assassinate visiting U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis in a rocket and mortar attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport. America’s top defense official was never in any actual danger, but it was still a particularly brazen display of the group’s capabilities. The fact that the State Department needs a private air force to safely travel in and around Kabul only underscores how dangerous the U.S. government believes the situation in Afghanistan is on the ground for its personnel.  If effectively concedes that nowhere in the city of approximately five million people is it safe for Americans to be out on the street or even riding in discreetly armored vehicles . Things may be even worse than they appear on the surface, too. On Jan. 30, 2018, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, a Congressionally-mandated watchdog to oversee American military and other activities in the country, released its 38th quarterly report . “This quarter, DOD [the Department of Defense] instructed SIGAR not to release to the public data on the number of districts, and the population living in them, controlled or influenced by the Afghan government or by the insurgents, or contested by both,” the watchdog said in press release to accompany the report. “This is the first time SIGAR has been specifically instructed not to release information marked ‘unclassified’ to the American taxpayer.” The Pentagon has since confirmed it relayed this request to SIGAR, but has insisted that it is only the messenger, stating both that Afghanistan’s defense ministry asked for the redactions and that it has no authority to release NATO information , unclassified or otherwise. Afghan authorities have since denied they made any such demand and it is unclear why American officials could not secure approval from the North Atlantic Alliance for SIGAR to publish this information as it has done routinely in the past. For the first time, the U.S.-backed coalition also asked SIGAR to remove details about casualties and other attrition, including desertion, as well as information about capability assessments regarding Afghan security forces, another critical metric for public accountability. The Pentagon again classified its own information on those topics, which it had first done in the previous quarter. The U.S. military has in the past described Afghan casualty rates as “ unsustainable .” We at the War Zone have also reported repeatedly on the continuing difficulties Afghanistan is having in trying to improve its security forces and their capabilities , especially with regards to its Air Force . Embassy Air’s operations, concern about growing risks to those activities, underscores how dangerous even some of the most heavily protected parts of Kabul, which is supposed to be the most secure city in the country, have become in recent months. A report by CBS News’ “60 Minutes” earlier in January 2018 said that private helicopters on contract to the U.S. government, including the State Department and the U.S. military, could actually be flying 10 trips or more in a day between the airport and sites within the city, keeping personnel safely ensconced behind blast walls and other defenses the entire time. A Columbia Vertol 107-II helicopter under contract to the US military at a facility in Afghanistan. These helicopters also routinely fly missions to and from Hamid Karzai International Airport and other sites in Kabul., US Army The security situation had deteriorated to that point that U.S. authorities had reportedly banned those personnel from making the two-mile long trips – as short as a five minute ride by air – via convoys on the ground. The video “60 Minutes” shot during their visit shows armed, contractor-operated State Department Air Wing Huey II helicopters flying patrols nearby, possibly escorting the flights.  Embassy Air’s CH-46s do not carry weapons, but do have missile warning sensors and flare dispensers to ward off man-portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. “It’s a country at war,” U.S. Army General John Nicholson, who is in charge of all U.S. forces in the country and the NATO-led coalition, said in an interview for the segment. “And it’s a capital that is under attack by a determined enemy.” Another one of Embassy Air’s CH-46s, with the decoy flare dispensers visible under the forward fuselage and above the rear sponsons., US Army Acknowledging that the capital itself is under regular attack is a relatively stunning admission on the part of the U.S. military, which has been actively fighting the Taliban and other insurgent and terrorist groups in the country since October 2001. Donald Trump is now the third American president to oversee the war and has approved yet another surge of troops and other support amid repeated promises to finally “win” the conflict. “I don’t think we’re prepared to talk [to the Taliban] right now,” Trump while at the United Nations for a lunch with members of the Security Council on Jan. 29, 2018, dismissing the idea of any peace talks with the group in the near term. “We’re going to finish what we have to finish.” That’s almost certainly to be easier said than done. In addition to the resurgent Taliban, the United States and its Afghan and international partners are also contending with ISIS franchise in the country and other threats. The Trump Administration has also taken a hard line against neighboring Pakistan , which U.S. officials and independent analysts have rightly noted at least tacitly provides safe havens to insurgents and terrorists, but is also essential for bringing the conflict to an end. It remains to be seen whether that renewed political pressure will produce results. Pakistani authorities have threatened to cut off critical overland supply routes for the NATO-led coalition. They have also been unconfirmed reports of a growing push for a Pakistan-China-Iran regional bloc, which could present a political challenge to the United States. It’s too soon to know for sure how the U.S. government’s latest strategy for the conflict will play out for sure. Unless the security situation dramatically improves soon, though, American diplomats and other personnel will be stuck making short hops in helicopters and staying within fortress like facilities. Correction: An earlier version of this story said that the attack on Save the Children’s offices occurred in Kabul. This incident took place in the city of Jalalabad.

"Joseph Trevithick, n","Updated on May 31, 2019",Here’s The Army’s Plan For A Larger And More Deadly Bradley Fighting Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is in the process of upgrading its Bradley Fighting Vehicles to give them the power necessary to run new networked communications and other systems, as well as make sure they remain just as capable despite the growing weight thanks to new equipment and other upgraded gear. At the same time, the service is already looking at new proposals for even more dramatic changes to the fleet, including a larger hull, new weapons, and additional sensors. Shephard got the scoop on the Army’s plans and detail the various configurations they are considering for a notional M2A5 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle on Jan. 29, 2018. The goal is to have a first unit equipped with the revised armored vehicles by the beginning of 2026. At present, the service already has approximately $600 million with which to fund both development and the initial purchases of the upgrade components, but this could increase as the Pentagon looks to significant grow its budgets across the board in the 2019 fiscal cycle. According to Shephard , the proposals Army officials are considering at present fall into two main categories, a focus on the vehicle’s hull or more emphasis on its turret. The service already has to budget to pursue either option, but a new hull would reportedly take approximately four and half years to develop, versus a full five years to craft a new turret. The Army has already spent tens of millions of dollars working with the Bradley’s present manufacturer, BAE Systems, on a pair of sequential improvements, known as Engineering Change Proposals, or ECPs, since 2012 . The service will designate vehicles that receive those modifications as the M2A4. The M2A5 appears to take the place of previous plans for a third ECP package . Based on the concept art, the proposal for a new hull involves stretching the length of the vehicle, but without needing to extend the tracks or add in a seventh wheel on either side. With this added room, the vehicles would be able to carry eight troops instead of seven. Though primarily intended to transport and fight alongside dismounted infantry, the Bradley’s original design infamously sacrificed space for troops in favor of other weapons and equipment. Adding in space for an additional soldier is therefore significant, but still wouldn’t be big enough for the service’s otherwise standard infantry squad, which has 9 individuals. The expanded hull will also provide space for even more add-on armor and defensive countermeasures, which could include active protection systems to shoot down incoming rockets and anti-tank missiles. Information Shephard obtained indicates that the Army believes this will allow them to install between twice and five times as much protection for the crew and other occupants. Troops dismount from a Bradley during a training exercise, giving a sense of the vehicle’s cramped passenger compartment., US Army These added defenses would undoubtedly help better protect the vehicles against improvised explosive devices and various man-portable anti-tank weapons, which have steadily proliferated among insurgents and terrorists , particularly in the Middle East. However, it would also make the vehicles more able to take on conventional foes, including potential near-peer enemies such as Russia and China , who are fielding increasingly more capable anti-armor weapons and armored vehicles , among other emerging capabilities , as well. Since 2014, when Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region and began actively supporting separatists fighting the government in Kiev, the U.S. military as a whole has steadily reoriented its posture toward preparing for those more traditional conflicts. For the Army, this has meant a renaissance of sorts for armored vehicles , such as the Bradley, and renewed emphasis on their capabilities in a high-intensity scenario . The proposal for a new hull would actually be able to leverage significant work BAE Systems had already done on its Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) for the Army, which is essentially a turretless Bradley, as well as its experience with the abortive Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), which it derived from the vehicle’s design. The Army cancelled the latter program after the approximate weight of the proposed prototype spiraled out of control to some 84 tons , more than an M1 Abrams tank . A prototype of BAE Systems AMPV, which could serve as a basis for the M2A5 Bradley., BAE Systems The expanded hull would reportedly keep the weight of the chassis under 40 tons. However, this would still be significantly heavier than a standard M2A3 Bradley, which tips the scales at around 33 tons, including its turret. The Army has already begun to mitigate this issue somewhat through the earlier ECP program, though. The first of those design changes includes track, suspension, and transmission upgrades already necessary to make sure existing Bradleys didn’t lose mobility or become significantly more maintenance intensive under the weight of a host of other more minor upgrades. Those included explosive reactive armor suites , devices to jam and otherwise counter improvised explosive devices, and other self-protection and defensive measures, together known as the Bradley Urban Survival Kit , or BUSK.  The driving force behind those additions had been experiences learned during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq between 2003 and 2008, when American troops routinely patrolled urban areas where insurgents and terrorists would often use the environment to their advantage to engage armored vehicles with anti-tank weapons at close range or hide roadside bombs. A US Army Bradley Fighting Vehicle with explosive reactive armor in Iraq in the mid-to-late 2000s., US Army The new hull would also feature the auxiliary power unit the Army is planning to add to the M2A4 Bradleys, which will provide the power necessary for new networked communications gear, additional sensors, and other equipment. The service says this extra power gives the design future growth potential, as well. It may also allow for the running of critical crew support and mission systems without having the main engine running, which could be beneficial for certain missions. The pitch for a new turret might result in a less dramatic change to the overall size and shape of the vehicle, but would be no less significant in terms of the upgrade in capability. The biggest difference from the existing arrangement would be the replacement of the 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon with the larger 30mm XM813 Bushmaster II from Orbital ATK. There is no mention of any plans to modify or replace the TOW missile launcher on the side of the turret. The Army is already adding this new gun to a number of Stryker 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles, a configuration known as the Dragoon , to give them more firepower against emerging threats, especially the kind of light armored vehicles that near-peer countries such as Russia and China field in large numbers. The XM813 is a version of the U.S. Navy’s Mk 44 variant of the Bushmaster II and the U.S. Air Force also uses another type, the GAU-23/A , on its AC-130W and AC-130J gunships . The commonality makes it a particularly attractive option from a logistical standpoint, as the services could order spare parts in bulk together.  However, some ammunition would remain distinct between the variants , which serve different functions against different target sets and have to work in different environments. The new turret would have room for 180 30mm rounds at the ready, compared to the 300 rounds now available for the M242 in existing Bradleys. There would also be space for a new Ethernet connection to feed networked information into the gunner’s targeting system and the commander’s various displays. Those two individuals would continue to ride in the turret as they do now. There is no mention of any plans for an unmanned turret, which could reduce the crew size and offer more protection since the remaining personnel would be situated in the better protected hull. The vehicle commander and gunner of this Bradley are visible in this picture from a training exercise. , US Army The Army would blend together either course of action with other upgrades it already has planned for the Bradley fleet as follow-ons to the ECP program. These include the improved Ethernet connection for networked data transfer throughout the vehicle, as well as upgraded networked communication systems to send and receive information from other sources. Updated laser aiming and ranging finding devices and color daylight and infrared cameras are in the works, as well. There is also talk of adding a “5.56mm Suppression Weapon,” according to Shephard , but it’s not clear what this necessarily is in reference to specifically. From that rudimentary description, it sounds like a system to help protect the vehicle against small groups of hostile individuals, particularly in a close quarters fight, such as combat in an urban area. A Bradley sits in an urban training area at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany., US Army Such a system could just include a remote weapon station with an existing 5.56mm machine gun , such as the Army’s standard M249 Squad Automatic Weapon , or it could consist of a much more involved arrangement. Another more extreme possibility could involve a weapon such as the XM214 Microgun , a six-barrel rotary machine gun based on the iconic Minigun, but chambered in the smaller round. General Dynamics, which purchased the rights from General Electric, no longer offers that gun on its website, though, and other similar designs appear to be more of a novelty than a serious weapon. This bullet point could also just be a stand in concept for a more general suppressive capability or just be a reference to an existing, but obscure weapon based on the M16 rifle that troops can shoot from within the Bradley through two firing ports at the rear of the vehicle. The Army could also decide that an active protection system provides the same measure of defense against close-in threats. An XM214 Microgun., Joseph Trevithick The Army may ultimately decide to pursue both courses of action in sequence or simultaneously, providing it secured the funds to do so. There is otherwise the potential for new weapons and other equipment to end up on the Army’s wishlist for the Bradleys on top of the existing proposals as time goes on, much as has been the case with the ECP program and subsequent plans for the M2A5 already. It is possible that the A4 or A5 upgrades could make their way on to other Bradley variants beyond the M2, as well. The Army already plans to adopt an M7A4 Bradley Fire Support Team Vehicle, or BFIST , a type of vehicle the Army has specifically configured to provide armored transport for individuals spotting for friendly artillery and other fire support missions. The updates, especially the added power generation, could be especially useful for a future Short Range Air Defense ( SHORAD ) version, which the service is also considering as a successor the now retired M6 Linebacker anti-aircraft variant. The BAE Systems’ Maneuver-SHORAD, or M-SHORAD, air defense vehicle demonstrator, based on the Bradley., Joseph Trevithick It might not be as difficult to imagine the Army embarking on a more ambitious upgrade program as it once was, given President Donald Trump and his administration’s continuing plans to expand the defense budget. Earlier in January 2018, Defense Secretary James Mattis also released a new National Defense Strategy that re-emphasized conflicts against conventional opponents, and potential near-peer adversaries in particular. The future of the Bradley might not be guaranteed then either. In 2017, the Army gave a $237 million dollar contract to a team with defense contractor SAIC in the lead to develop two prototype designs for a possible Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), which is still very much in the conceptual stage , as a possibly Bradley replacement. On Jan. 29, 2018, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper said that he would be willing to consider existing foreign armored vehicles for such a program, as well. “Many of our NATO allies have very capable tanks,” Esper told reporters during a press conference at the Army’s top headquarters in Europe, situated in Wiesbaden, Germany, according to Defense News . “As I think about a next-generation combat vehicle, we should look at our allies, and look at their designs, and look at how they’ve built combat vehicles and combat systems, and think about adopting some of those.” In the meantime, though, the service is very seriously considering just how much more capability it can squeeze out of its existing Bradleys.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 27, 2019",Army’s New Pistols Often Eject Live Rounds and Don’t Work Well With Regular Bullets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army’s decision to select two versions of Sig Sauer’s 9mm P320 pistol as the new standard sidearms across the service was not without controversy , including a formal protest by competing gun maker Glock, which claimed the service didn’t complete certain critical tests. The Pentagon recently released a report that shows testing of the M17 and M18 handguns exposed a number of significant and persistent deficiencies, including firing accidentally if a shooter dropped the gun, ejecting live ammunition, and low reliability with traditional “ball” cartridges with bullets enclosed inside a full metal jacket. These and other details were in the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation review of such work during the 2017 fiscal year, which it published earlier in January 2018. This regular report covers a wide variety of high profile weapon systems and other important equipment across the U.S. military, including the Army’s Modular Handgun System (MHS) program. In January 2017, the Army chose Sig Sauer to supply a total more than 300,000 of the full size M17 and compact M18 pistols as part of that project, a deal worth approximately $580 million. The other U.S. military services are now considering following suit and adopting the guns and the company is making essentially the same gun available to civilian shooters as well. According to the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the guns experienced a number of issues in testing between April and September 2017, which is the end of the period the report covers. The first of these was a publicly known issue that the pistol could go off if the user dropped the weapon. Needless to say, an accidental discharge could be dangerous to the shooter or those around them. The Army discovered this issue during the initial “Product Verification Test,” but it is unclear when specifically the service became aware of the problem. Sig Sauer did subsequently make unspecified changes to fix this issue in the M17 and M18 pistols. Members of the US Army’s 3rd Cavalry Regiment train with their M17s in January 2018., US Army It’s worth noting that in August 2017, Sig Sauer issued a voluntary recall for other P320 pistols due to the same issue, but implied in their press release that shooters had dropped the weapons in an excessive manner “beyond U.S. standards for safety.” That statement also stressed that Army’s new guns wouldn’t need the replacement parts, but declined to mention that this was because they already had them, leaving open the interpretation that they never needed the update in the first place. More worryingly, the Pentagon’s top testing office said that during further tests, the trigger assemblies in two pistols had splintered apart and this was potentially the result of the drop fix, presenting an entirely new issue. As of September 2017, the recommendation was to “work with the vendor to identify and eliminate cause of variability in the manufacture of the trigger group mechanism.” Testing also revealed that the handguns had a propensity to eject a live round along with the empty cartridge case during normal functioning. There was no indication that this issue caused any malfunctions, such as “stove-piping,” which generally involves empty casing ending up jammed in place, typically sticking up from the ejection port. The video below shows a stove pipe malfunction in a Glock handgun and a process for clearing the jam. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OKvG38pr87Y It is still a significant issue for shooters to be losing live cartridges during routine use, meaning they might run out of ammunition before they expect to or simply waste resources. The Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s said that the problem became more pronounced the more rounds evaluators fired through their M17 and M18 pistols. As of September 2017, the Army was still working with Sig Sauer to identify the root cause of the problem, after which they would need to develop another fix. This wasn’t the only ammunition related issue, though. In tests, the M17 and M18 worked just fine with the Army’s new XM1153 “special purpose” cartridge, a hollow point round . They did not function reliably with the companion XM1152, a standard “ball” round with a bullet fully enclosed within a copper jacket. M17 magazines loaded with XM1153 hollow points during a test., US Army The Army had a requirement for the new pistols to be able to shoot 2,000 rounds straight without a stoppage at least 95 percent of the time on average. The service defined a stoppage as any instance in which the guns stopped functioning normally, but where the user could get the weapon running again without the need for tools or replacement parts. With the XM1153 hollow point, the M17 hit the 95 percent reliability mark, while the M18 managed just slightly better at 96 percent. But when troops loaded up magazines with the XM1152, the results were dismal. The full-size gun had only a 75 percent probability of functioning properly, while the compact version was barely over 60 percent. The report does not say why this might have occurred and it’s not clear what the Army was doing to correct the issue. The problems had appeared during the Product Verification Tests and the service simply opted to conduct operational testing and evaluation with the special purpose cartridge only. This in turn suggests that troops getting the pistols will receive the hollow points as their standard round, a significant change from previous doctrine. Only having one ammunition type available – not counting blank and dummy rounds for training purposes – could limit the utility of the new pistols. Traditionally, hollow points begin to expand after hitting their targets, generally creating more serious wounds, but also reducing their ability to penetrate through cover, such as car windshields and doors. Modern bullet design has greatly enhanced the hollow point’s versatility and lethality, making it less limited and far more deadly than it once was, though, and pistol rounds generally are not suitable for piercing body armor or barriers to begin with. There is a possible international law issue, as well. The Hague Convention of 1899 , an agreement that the United States abides by, bans any bullet that has features that cause it to deliberately expand from combat use. The U.S. military has previously said that types with an open tip to improve accuracy aren’t subject to the restrictions because expansion is not the primary purpose of the design, but it has generally limited the issue of actual hollow points to its internal law enforcement arms. It has also made the argument that those rounds are legal for combat use when there is a “clear military necessity.” Some special operations forces already issue hollow point pistol rounds for specific combat missions with this justification in mind. The Army began issuing the first M17s and M18s to units in November 2017, including members of its first dedicated advisory unit, the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, which is heading for Afghanistan soon . The service also expects to hand out the pistols to more soldiers in total than it had done with sidearms in the past. A member of the US Army’s 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade trains with an M17 in January 2018., US Army Without ball ammunition to issue, those troops and other personnel with the new pistols will have to stick to the hollow points for the foreseeable future. This in turn could prompt challenges from humanitarian groups and other advocacy organizations, potentially bogging the service down in protracted legal action. Taken together, these issues also underscore complaints that Glock, another contender for the MHS contract, had leveled at the Army’s testing metrics and decision to choose Sig Sauer. In February 2017, the Austrian gun maker filed a formal protest, but focused on specific contract wording that allowed for a second run-off competition between multiple guns. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) rejected the argument , stating that there was nothing that prevented the Army from skipping that additional evaluation and proceeding straight to picking one winner. This is Glock’s entrant into the MHS competition. Note the factory manual safety, a feature that is not commonly found on Glocks (a few  police orders have included a mechanical safety from the factory as well as a number of prototypes) although the Cominolli Safety , which is very similar to the one shown, is a relatively popular aftermarket modification. A version of the Glock MHS entrant will be offered to the public. Dubbed the Glock 19X , it features the full-sized frame of the Glock 17 and the compact slide and barrel layout of the Glock 19, among other features. , Glock But after losing that challenge, Glock issued an open call to the Army suggesting that it had cut the developmental testing short, specifically deciding not to run “heavy endurance testing,” and asking the service to finish those experiments before following through with purchases of the Sig Sauer pistols. The firm noted that GAO had confirmed that its gun had already shown better reliability over the P320. The new details from the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation would seem to reinforce Glock’s contention that more tests could have been beneficial, at least in exposing issues of basic functionality with standard ball ammunition. The Army’s decision to effectively abandon that type of round in the interim is hardly a long-term solution. A US Army National Guardsman fires a Glock pistol during a competition., US Army The findings could open the service up to further legal action, even if Sig Sauer has already delivered subsequent fixes, or at least reignite the controversy over the decision to select the P320. This might lead the U.S. Air Force and Navy to reconsider plans to follow the Army’s lead and adopt the M17 and M18 in the interests of maintaining commonality in ammunition and spare parts. Those few Army special operators who are still using older M9 Berettas were likely to end up with the M17 or M18, too, for the same reason. Glocks are already popular with U.S. special operations forces, though including both Army Special Forces and the U.S. Navy SEALs , and the U.S. Marine Corps has begun acquiring a limited number of them to issue to select personnel, which could open up an avenue for larger purchases. Any future plans by any of these parties to purchase the new MHS pistols could depend heavily on the Army’s ability to work with Sig Sauer to fully mitigate these various existing issues.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 4, 2018",US Special Operators Demand More Firepower and Protection for Their Newest Battle Buggies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Special Operations Command is planning to spend millions to refit a number of its newest light vehicles, known as the Ground Mobility Vehicle 1.1 , or GMV 1.1, with new turrets with better protection or remote weapon stations armed with machine guns and guided anti-tank missiles . The new details have emerged after a scathing media report suggesting that Marine special operators in particular think vehicle is virtually useless its present configuration due to its limited defenses. On Jan. 11, 2018, officials at Special Operations Command (SOCOM) approved plans to award a contract worth more than $3 million straight to defense contractor Military Systems Group for the heavy duty turret assemblies. The command is treating this is a modification to the original 2013 GMV 1.1 contract, which it awarded to General Dynamics after selecting its Flyer 72 vehicle as the winning design. With the equipment , the entire program will have cost nearly $765 million so far. The new turrets will allow users to install a Gunner Protection Kit, or GPK, to the present manned turret or fit a version of the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station, or CROWS , so the gunner can fire various weapons, including the Javelin anti-tank missile , from within the vehicle itself. SOCOM says that it has received three separate “combat-mission need statements” from deployed special operations units for these added capabilities on their GMV 1.1s since February 2017. Various configurations of General Dynamics’ Flyer 72 vehicle, which serves as the basis for the GMV 1.1. , GD These details and more were included in a contracting document SOCOM posted on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on Jan. 25, 2018. In order to pursue this type of sole-source arrangement with a single company, the command had to submit a written justification for why it could not run a typical competition to select a supplier. The GPK would be a significant improvement over the existing weapon mount on top of the GMV 1.1, which offers no protection to the individual in the turret. The protection kit has long been in service on Humvees , Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, and other wheeled vehicles across the U.S. military. It includes an armored shield in front and a three-sided armored frame around the gunner. The complete system can accommodate the .50 caliber M2 machine gun and is likely compatible with the special operations forces-specific Mk 47 automatic grenade launcher , the two main weapons for the GMV 1.1. It’s not a perfect solution, though. After experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan in the mid-2000s, the U.S. Army developed an improved version with higher sidewalls and a bigger shield, all with transparent armored windows to better shield troops from snipers and shrapnel. SOCOM adopted a similar arrangement for its own Humvee-based Ground Mobility Vehicles (GMV) and MRAPs, but these protective measures would likely still be too heavy even for the reinforced turret SOCOM plans to fit on the GMV 1.1. US special operations Forces GMVs in Syria with the reinforced gunner protection kit., AP This in turn explains some special operators’ desire to install the CROWS in lieu of a manned turret of any kind. These remote-control systems include a joystick and camera feed that allows the gunner to aim the weapon while sitting inside the vehicle. The version SOCOM is looking at packs an M2 machine gun or an automatic grenade launcher, as well as the Javelin anti-tank missile . Though intended to take out tanks, U.S. conventional and special operations forces have both found it offers a quick and accurate way to neutralize enemies , including snipers and heavy weapon teams, especially if those targets are behind cover or hiding inside a building. But this works best when the vehicle itself offers significant protection against enemy fire. The GMV 1.1 in its present configuration features only rudimentary defensive measures, with its four doors in particularly only being armored half way up, with the top portion being a clear plastic “window” that users can zip open and closed. The initial versions didn’t even have that, featuring just a large open roll cage, akin to a large all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or dune buggy. The video below shows a Stryker with a CROWS system with an M2 machine gun and Javelin missile launcher, similar to the one that SOCOM is looking to fit on the GMV 1.1. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1455YnBKD48 To be fair, the point of the GMV 1.1 is not to get into extended engagements with large enemy forces, but rather to provide added mobility for small special operations units, especially during long range reconnaissance operations or when operating from remote forward sites. The whole point is that they’re lightweight and easy to operate and maintain. Another major requirement was that they had to be able to fit inside a CH-47 Chinook, or the Army’s special operations MH-47 versions. Before then, those aircraft could only readily insert special operators on ATVs or motorcycles , though it’s possible to cram a stripped down Humvee inside if absolutely necessary. SOCOM says the new turret assembly for the GMV 1.1 from Military Systems Group will feature folding components so that the vehicle will still meet this transportability requirement. The extra weight of the GPK or the CROWS could have a negative impact on the GMV 1.1’s basic performance, though, raising new issues. Either addition could make the vehicle heavier and raise its center of gravity, which in turn could make it slower or and more likely to roll over when turning or driving down a steep gradient. US military personnel and contractors work on a GMV 1.1 at a facility in Kuwait., USAF General Dynamics itself is looking at various ways to give their Flyer series of vehicles extra protection. These include fully armored doors with bullet-proof windows and the installation of a lightweight active protection system , such as Israel Military Industries’ Iron Fist , to destroy incoming rockets and missiles before they even hit the vehicle. But the urgent requests from special operations on combat missions – likely on deployments in support of the U.S. military’s counter-terrorism campaigns in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan – suggest that they have often found themselves in situations underscoring the need for some extra defenses already. This is in line with a report from Marine Corps Times earlier in January 2018, which cited a number of Marine special operators on the condition of anonymity who called into question the utility of the GMV 1.1 and various other light vehicles. A Flyer with a Mk 47 automatic grenade launcher and the Iron Fist active protection system., Joseph Trevithick The main focus of their complaints was about the various ATVs that SOCOM has purchased in recent years, such as the Polaris MRZR . One individual derided them as “tactical golf carts” and the interviewees said that they had little use beyond making it easier to get to and from the shooting range because they were so vulnerable to enemy fire. “They aren’t being used really … no one will approve any real operation with MRZR,” another individual explained to Marine Corps Times. “We’ve used them for recon in training but not in real life.” An array of US special operations forces vehicles at the garrison in At Tanf , Syria, including an MRZR closest to the front, a GMV 1.1 at right, and two Humvee-based GMVs., US Army However, the Marine special operators said many of the same complaints extended to the GMV 1.1. On top of voicing concerns that the vehicles wouldn’t able to survive any sort of real combat, they pointed out the present configuration of the vehicle can’t fit inside the cramped confines of the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor , one of their preferred methods of aerial transport. The smaller Flyer 60 variant can fit inside that aircraft and this was important selling point for the vehicle. The promotional video below shows personnel loading a prototype Flyer vehicle onto an MV-22 Osprey, something the Marines say they cannot actually do with the present version. As such, Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has yet to deploy any of its 21 GMV 1.1s on combat operations and has no plans to do so in the near future, according U.S. Marine Corps Major Nick Mannweiler, a spokesperson for the command. “If and when that day comes, operational employment restrictions or limitations are determined by relevant combatant command authorities within their respective areas of operation and not by MARSOC,” he added. So far, those authorities do not appear to have banned the vehicles from combat zones entirely. Publicly available pictures exist of special operators in Syria , as well as neighboring countries , using them or preparing to move them into the theater. These units were likely among those that reached out to SOCOM for the new turrets. Members of the 5th Special Forces Group train at an impromptu firing range in Southern Syria. A GMV is in the foreground and a GMV 1.1 is in the background., US Army Once they get the new equipment, they will almost certainly provide additional feedback about whether it gives them more freedom to operate and confidence in the GMV 1.1 as a whole.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 13, 2019",The USAF Expands MQ-9 Reaper Drone Force in Afghanistan to Its Largest Size Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says its force of MQ-9 Reapers at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan is now the largest deployment of the type to a single base ever. The drones are part of a larger surge in the air war over the country, which could still include yet more unmanned aircraft in the near future as other services, such as the U.S. Navy , consider their own unmanned contributions . The Air Force says there are now nearly three squadrons worth of Reapers at Kandahar, though it declined to give specific numbers, according to a report by Stars and Stripes on Jan. 26, 2018. The size and scope of American presence there had steadily shrunk since the NATO-led coalition officially ended combat operations in 2014. It has begun to grow again as the United States has reinvigorated its efforts against the Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other militant groups in the country, deploying additional ground forces, including elements of the U.S. Army’s first ever dedicated advisory unit, the 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade, or 1st SFAB . Those deployments have in turn prompted a need for more close air support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft “to make sure that they can accomplish their mission successfully,” U.S. Air Force Major General James Hecker, who is charge of both U.S. and other coalition air forces in the country, told Stars and Stripes. In addition to the extra drones, the Air Force sent manned A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft and HH-60G Pave Hawk combat search and rescue helicopters to Kandahar. Having so many Reapers at the base will give the U.S. military and Afghan and coalition partners an impressive ability to monitor insurgents and terrorists along the country’s restive border with Pakistan. At least some of the MQ-9s there are the newer Block 5 version , which can carry an external fuel tank, allowing the drone to fly even further or remain in a specific area for a longer period of time. A Block 5 MQ-9 Reaper in Afghanistan with the external fuel tank for extended range., USAF As we at The War Zone have highlighted on numerous occasions in the past , persistent surveillance is essential for making sure the Taliban and other militants cannot move about the country with impunity, especially at night . The latter point is only increasingly more important as insurgents have begun to acquire night vision equipment and otherwise improve their ability to conduct operations after dark. The Reapers in particular also provide a unique wide-area persistent surveillance capability with the Gorgon Stare system , which packs nearly 370 individual cameras that can simultaneously grab imagery across a 40-square mile zone. Analysts can then combine those images into a single mosaic map and look for significant changes or patterns of activity and track vehicles and personnel movements over large areas. Put that together with other sources of intelligence and it can offer a dramatically more nuanced view of the battlefield as a whole. The Reapers can also carry precision guided bombs and missiles themselves, allowing them to engage any targets that they might find directly. This gives commanders a better chance of being able to attack fleeting time-sensitive targets, such as small groups of terrorists meeting together or planting improvised explosive devices, as well as just shortening the overall time it takes between locating the enemy and responding to the threat kinetically. A Reaper in Afghanistan with the Gorgon Stare system., USAF “We’re going after the enemy, we’re going after the vehicles they use, we’re going after the buildings that they try to hide from us in,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Stephen “Joker” Jones, an Air Force officer who has been involved in unmanned aircraft operations in Afghanistan since 2000, told Stars and Stripes for its report. He added that he could put a Hellfire missile “right into somebody’s chest if I needed.” Unfortunately, the MQ-9 can’t carry the Gorgon Stare pods and weapons at the same time, so having more Reapers in Kandahar gives U.S. commanders more flexibility in how they employ the drones. It also offers a way to increase American air power in the country relatively quickly and without the need for a large number of personnel on the ground. The Air Force uses the “remote-split” operating method for these unmanned aircraft, meaning that small teams on the ground launch, recover, and maintain them at Kandahar, but crews back in the United States actually fly the missions. The Reaper force might only be the start of a larger U.S. drone mission in the country, both in size and scope, too. Colonel Jones told Stars and Stripes that while the MQ-9s were massed at Kandahar now, there was a possibility they could move to other established bases in other parts of the country as necessary. Airmen at Kandahar Airfield ready an MQ-9 for a mission in 2017., USAF The Air Force’s unmanned aircraft already share space at Kandahar with the Army’s MQ-1C Gray Eagles , which offer their own persistent surveillance and light attack capabilities. The service used to fly their own smaller MQ-1 Predators from the base, but transitioned to the more capable Reapers as part of a service-wide effort to retire the older aircraft by the end of 2018. But as The War Zone was first to report , the Predators might get a new lease on life with conventional or special operations units within the U.S. Navy or Marine Corps. U.S. special operators are heavily engaged in Afghanistan, especially against the ISIS franchise there , and could benefit from having an expanded, dedicated drone force of their own. With the Predators, those elite units would have to rely less on conventional forces for air support, especially of the unmanned kind. If assigned to Naval Special Warfare or Marine Corps Special Operations Command elements, directly, they would not necessarily have to turn to Air Force and Army special operations units provide this capability, either. The Navy SEALs in particular have long been interested in acquiring their own manned light attack aircraft for exactly this reason. Marine and Navy special operators do already drones, but these are generally smaller, tactical types, including the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle, Textron Aerosonde, and AeroVironment Puma AE. Special Operations Command has been working to give those unmanned aircraft new capabilities, as well. An MQ-27A ScanEagle drone on its catapult launcher., USN In particular, the ScanEagle, now known to the U.S. military as the MQ-27A, has gained a signals intelligence capability, called “Peebles” or the “Peebles Payload.” The small, catapult-launched drone still retains its electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras. The Peebles’ exact capabilities are unclear, but its size and shape are reminiscent of systems that mimic cellphone towers, which are often referred to as “ dirtboxes ” after one manufacturer DRT. These systems allow the user to track the position of an individual from their phone signal and some versions can scoop up the actual audio from the call, as well as the associated metadata. Special operators are using a similar piece of equipment, called Silent Eagle, on their RQ-20A Puma AEs, and these systems are ideally suited to monitoring the movements of specific terrorists and militants ahead of a raid to capture them or a targeted strike. There is the possibility that the MQ-27A could gain a light attack capability, using miniaturized precision guided munitions , in the future, as well. A low-quality image of MQ-27A’s payload bay, with a green arrow pointing to the Peebles system., SOCOM The War Zone was also the first to note that the Navy was separately considering hiring General Atomics, which makes the Reapers, to fly those drones itself over Afghanistan in support of Marines in Helmand Province. It is not clear whether the service is still interested in pursuing that plan or if the Air Force’s deployment of extra MQ-9s is in response to those demands. If the Navy did pursue the contractor-operated arrangement it would only further increase the U.S. military’s unmanned aircraft capabilities in the region. Per existing rules and regulations, though, the private aviators would only be able to fly reconnaissance missions and not attack any targets themselves, though. The U.S. military, as well as the intelligence community, almost certainly already has additional unmanned aircraft in and around Afghanistan that we don’t know about, too. On Jan. 24, 2018, Pakistani authorities accused the United States of launching a targeted drone strike within their borders, killing a commander with the Haqqani Network terrorist group, as well as a number of innocent civilians in a nearby refugee camp. The Pentagon subsequently denied it had flown any such mission , suggesting that another American agency, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, was responsible. The Bureau of Investigative Journalist, which tracks confirmed and reported drone strikes in Afghanistan, as well as other countries, has already recorded a significant uptick in unmanned operations in the country since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 over the previous year. This doesn’t necessarily account for unmanned aircraft flying traditional close air support missions, either. American air strikes and other combat support missions have increased across the board as the Trump Administration continues with its renewed push against the Taliban and other militants. With the Air Force’s large Reaper force now situated in Kandahar, 2018 looks set to see even more unmanned activity already, and it could be the beginning of a larger drone component of the United States’ overall air war in the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 15, 2020",Heckler & Koch’s New Combat Rifle Tries to Blend the Best Features of Existing Designs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A year after revealing its existence, German small arms manufacturer Heckler and Koch has brought examples of its new HK433 to the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. H&K is now investing heavily in the modular gun, which combines many of the best features of the company’s existing G36 and HK416 , as well as other popular designs, hoping it will win over the German Army. Heckler and Koch quietly unveiled the gun in January 2017 and showed it to a select group of journalists in that year’s SHOT show. The HK 433 is now one of four different assault rifle patterns the company makes, including its earlier G36 , which is the German Army’s present standard rifle, and its newer HK416 series , a derivative of the American AR-15/M16 pattern . The company also makes a rifle called the HK233 , which is related to the G36, but features a system that allows the user to change the length of the barrel with relative ease. “The new HK433 … combines the strengths and outstanding features of the G36 and the HK416 families of assault rifles – both proven worldwide,” the company’s website boasts . “It doesn’t matter at all whether you are right or left-handed or have trained on a G36 / HK416 weapon system or AR-15 platform: The HK433 is the solution for every scenario imaginable.” That’s a typically outlandish marketing claim, but it doesn’t mean H&K hasn’t worked hard to make the gun as easy to adapt to different roles as possible. Unlike many of its past rifles, the HK 433 is a distinctly modular design with an emphasis on ergonomics and overall compact dimensions. Without the need for any special tools, a user can swap out the barrel for one of a different length, making the weapon much more versatile for different mission sets. So far, the available barrels range from an 11-inch compact type to a 20-inch one suitable for turning the weapon into a marksman rifle . H&K also designed the gun so that users can rapidly change to different calibers with a simple conversion kit that would include at least a new bolt and carrier assembly, barrel, and lower receiver assembly. The basic upper receiver shell can accept those different options without needing any other changes and has an ejection port that is wide and long enough to function properly with various different types of cartridges. The various barrel lengths already available for the HK 433., HK via The Firearms Blog The main variant the company has put on display is an assault rifle chambered in the NATO-standard 5.56x45mm cartridge . However, the firm has said it may offer the weapons in the larger NATO-standard 7.62x51mm and the Soviet-developed 7.62x39mm , versions it is tentatively calling the HK 231 and 123 respectively. Another option could be the increasingly popular .300 Blackout, a specialized and highly adaptable cartridge that remains accurate and powerful even in very short-barreled guns and can be had in subsonic form, which you can read more about here . The existing 5.56x45mm version of the HK433 also uses NATO-standard magazines, which will allow it to use the same ones as any AR-15/M16 pattern weapon or derivatives such as the HK416, as well as many other combat rifles. H&K has also offered a conversion kit that allows G36 rifles to do this, as well. As such, compatible magazines are already widely available to potential customers, which could be an important cost-saving selling point and interoperability feature. On top of that, the HK433 has a number of basic features either inspired by or lifted directly from the company’s G36 and HK416 patterns. It also appears to be a product of some of the company’s other past efforts, such as its stillborn XM8 rifle for the U.S. Army, which had a similar modular design with elements taken from various successful guns, again including the G36 and the AR-15/M16 pattern. The new HK433 uses a physical gas piston to cycle the action, as do both the G36 and HK416. This helps keep particulate matter away from vital internal components and reduces the likelihood that the gun might jam if it goes without routine cleaning for an extended period of time. As with G36 and HK416, it also has an ambidextrous magazine release and selector switch to change the gun’s firing mode between safe, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. HK says it will offer those controls in the exact same styles as the existing weapons, making it easier for troops presently using either one to transition to the new rifle. Unlike the AR-15/M16 but much like other popular combat rifles including the FN SCAR , the HK433 features a charging handle on the side of the upper receiver. This handle folds flush so as not to snag on things but is only on one side. The user can move it to the left or right relatively easily though. It takes an entire new upper receiver to have the gun eject shell casings to the left rather than the right, but a large deflector would likely keep the brass out a shooter’s face either way. The gun’s buttstock completely folds to one side and has a wide range of length of pull adjustments, a big improvement over AR-15/M16 pattern rifles, and it includes an adjustable cheek rest to alter the cheek weld to the individual soldier. The latter feature can be an important issue, especially when using different kinds of optics, which might sit higher than typical iron sights. Shooters can swap out the pistol grips to give them the most ergonomic grip and the grip’s overall design is borrowed from the shape of the one found on HK416 which has proven to be very popular.  . It also has accessory rails all along the top of the rifle and underneath the handguard, as well as other attachment points along the side using the KeyMod system that American company VLTOR Weapon Systems developed. These two mechanisms will accept a wide array of different accessories, including grenade launchers , visible and infrared aiming lasers, flashlights, bipods, and vertical foregrips. It seems likely H&K could offer other mounting options, too, such as U.S. manufacturer Magpul’s increasingly popular M-LOK arrangement. An HK 433 with a magnifying optic and 40mm grenade launcher., HK This level of modularity and ease in adding or removing accessories has long been a major selling point for the AR-15/M16 pattern and its derivatives. Other manufacturers have been pursuing similar new multi-purpose designs, such as Belgian firm FN Herstal’s SCAR family , which is in service with U.S. special operations forces , among others. The HK 433 has drawn direct visual and functional comparisons to the American Magpul Masada , another modular rifle concept that has since passed to a shared production arrangement between the Remington and Bushmaster Companies . H&K is itself also offering the HK233, which is essentially modular G36 variant. H&K is clearly betting on this combination of desirable features being especially appealing to the German Army, which is looking to choose a replacement for its entire inventory of G36s by 2019. Germany first adopted the polymer-clad gun, which was fairly exotic when it was unveiled, as its existing standard service rifle in 1997. If the service chooses the HK 433, the firm may be able to suggest that the country’s special operation forces could also replace their HK 416 and larger 7.62x51mm HK 417 rifles with this new modular rifle. Just getting the G36 deal would be a major boon for the company.. The German Army has more than 160,000 G36s and the final contract would likely be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Other components of the German military and security apparatus also use the rifle and could be looking for replacements. , A member of Germany’s Kommandos Spezialkräfte der Marine (KSM) with a heavily accessorized G36., Bundeswehr But despite being a favorite in the competition, H&K still faces significant competition, including from two other German manufacturers , Rheinmetall and Haenel. Those companies are offering AR-15/M16 derivatives that, like the HK416, use a gas-piston operating method, as is Swiss gun manufacturer Sig-Sauer . The final entrant is FN Herstal with its SCAR rifle. It’s possible German authorities may look to go with another company after decades of choosing HK to supply its standard infantry rifles. The country’s government got into a dispute with the firm over reported problems with the G36 performing poorly in hot weather based on the country’s own experiences in Afghanistan and reports from other users. German troops in Afghanistan with G36 rifles., Bundeswehr The German government subsequently sued H&K for breach of contract. A national court eventually ruled in the company’s favor in 2016, but on a technicality , stating that the deals didn’t cover the alleged faults. The gun maker has denied its weapons suffered dramatic drops in accuracy after overheating or otherwise malfunctioned more than could be expected from typical use. If the German Army ultimately chooses another manufacturer, there are still a huge number of other military and police units around the globe that might be interested in replacing their rifles with H&K’s ultimate offering. And after years of spurning civilian shooters, H&K has sought to court those markets again with semi-automatic-only versions of many of rifles, but it still has to contend with both American and German import and export laws . Germany will reportedly wrap up tests of the different contenders for its particular competition by the end of 2018. H&K has made a strong case for the country’s Army to stick with it once again in the form of the HK433. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 11, 2019",The USAF Still Can’t Get The New AC-130J Ghostrider’s 30mm Cannon To Work Reliably,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says the first of its newest AC-130J Ghostrider gunships are ready for combat, just as soon as they can train enough crews to fly them. A new report from Pentagon’s top testing office says that while that assessment might be technically true, the aircraft’s 30mm and 105mm guns continue to suffer from poor accuracy, unreliable ammunition, and other significant issues. Earlier in January 2018, the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which oversees that work across the services, released its latest report , covering various testing activities during the 2017 fiscal year. This routine review touches on the progress of dozens of different weapons programs, including the AC-130J, highlighting both successes and failures. “Although analysis is ongoing, preliminary data from the IOT&E [initial operational test and evaluation] indicate that the Block 20 AC-130J will support most elements of the Close Air Support and Air Interdiction missions,” the section of the report on the Ghostrider notes up front. “But some shortfalls remain.” One of these is, glaring giving the aircraft’s role as a gun ship, is that the fire control systems associated with the plane’s 30mm GAU-23/A cannon from Orbital ATK. The weapon system still has trouble compensating for changes in altitude and how the AC-130J is oriented toward the target as it flies in one of its typical pylon turn attack runs. A close up of the AC-130J’s 30mm GAU-23/A cannon., USAF The gun and its mount are supposed to automatically adjust to those shifts in position to make sure the rounds fall on the right target. Tests during the fiscal year 2017 showed that the gun ended up out of alignment more than once and needed a calibration update in flight. The problem then became that when the gunners tried recalibrate the cannon itself, they often threw off the positioning of its mounting hardware. It would be a more time consuming process to recenter the weapon in its mount and then recalibrate the system as a single unit. On top of that, the GAU-23/A vibrates so violently at its maximum rate of fire – 200 rounds per minute – that it regularly becomes so inaccurate that it triggers a built in safety mechanism. The failsafe stops the cannon from shooting before the gun automatically recenters itself. After this process is complete, the gunner has to press the trigger again to start firing again. Both of these are serious problems, especially for the Air Force’s various types of AC-130s have developed an excellent reputation for being precision tools ideal for “ danger close ” missions where enemy forces are close to friendly troops, innocent bystanders, or both. A loss of calibration or severe vibrations could send shells flying wildly off the mark, potentially leading to friendly fire or civilian casualties . A view of the GAU-23/A and the gunner’s position inside an AC-130J., USAF According to the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s report, the safety measures in place have prevented any potentially dangerous episodes in testing. Those safety measures, however, do halt the shooting right in the middle of firing runs, which could be differently problematic in an actual combat scenario. So, if nothing else, these issues could reduce confidence in the effectiveness of the gun as a whole, leading to a reticence to employ it when it might actually be the best option. The AC-130J’s other weapons are a 105mm howitzer , AGM-176 Griffin laser- and GPS-guided missiles, and GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs . In the future, the Air Force plans to integrate the multi-mode GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II and AGM-114 Hellfire missile onto the aircraft.  The service also wants to add a directed energy weapon to the gunships in the near future. All of these are highly precise weapons and the Air Force has long billed precision guided munitions as the primary armament of its newer gunships, leading to the observation that it would be increasingly more accurate to call them bomb trucks . Still, the 30mm cannon is specifically supposed to provide a weapon with an even more limited blast radius and larger volume of fire for situations that might call for it, such as particularly tricky danger close attack runs. Existing AC-130W Stinger II gunships have the exact same weapon and the older AC-130U Spooky models have a 25mm Gatling cannon and a single barrel 40mm cannon to fill this gap. The GAU-23/A is supposed to offer an in-production option with better range than the older 25mm weapon and firepower similar to the 40mm gun. The latter weapon is a World War II-era design that is becoming increasingly difficult for the Air Force to maintain. This plan and the cannon’s accuracy problems aren’t new, though. In 2007, the Air Force test fitted the same weapons to a number of U model aircraft and determined that they were insufficiently precise. And as noted, the W variants use virtually the same gun arrangement as the J model, too, but don’t have the same vibration issue. On those aircraft, the crew can recalibrate the cannon independently of the mount, as well, a feature that apparently got lost in porting the system over to the Ghostrider. The Air Force itself seems befuddled by the inconsistencies. These aren’t the only gun related problems with the AC-130Js, either. The 30mm cannons use a special type of ammunition, the PGU-46/B, which has specific features that make it inherently more accurate and less likely to malfunction, which we at The War Zone have previously reported on in detail. Unfortunately, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation says subsequent tests show that these rounds perform poorly against targets on soft surfaces, punching through wood floors and exploding below or burying themselves in the ground before exploding, which absorbs much of the explosive energy and shrapnel. One experiment in particular showed manikins took less damage if they were positioned on top of a target building with a plywood roof than those on top of a concrete test structure. The video below is a montage of Orbital ATK’s different chain guns, including the Mk 44 Bushmaster II, from which the company derived the GAU-23/A. https://youtube.com/watch?v=h4YCLrtKmt8 The Ghostrider’s 105mm cannon, a relative latecomer to the J model’s arsenal that the Air Force initially had no intention of adding in, reportedly works just fine, as does its ammunition. “The 105 mm round demonstrated expected lethality against personnel, trucks, and light armored vehicles,” the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s report states matter-of-factly. But there is an odd and potentially worrisome problem with the rack that holds the large howitzer shells. Though larger artillery pieces often use separated ammunition, where the projectile and propellant aren’t physically joined together, 105mm weapons in the U.S. military use self-contained cartridges that have the same basic design as the rounds for rifles and machine guns. For an unknown reason, unlike the ammunition storage on the AC-130U, the system on the J model doesn’t keep the shells snugly in place. During flight, the normal movements of the aircraft and typical vibrations apparently have a tendency to shake the 105mm projectiles loose from their brass casings. An AC-130J crew member loads 105mm shells into the ammunition storage rack during a test in 2016., USAF If the explosion of the propellant gasses isn’t fully contained inside the case, the shell could end up flying slower than expected or with otherwise different ballistic characteristics, potentially throwing the gunner’s aim off and sending it off course. As with the 30mm cannon problems, this in turn could reduce the crew’s confidence in the weapon and reduce its willingness to employ it in actual combat for fear of making a serious mistake . Now, to be fair, we don’t know if the Air Force has resolved these issues since September 2017, which is the end of the fiscal year and the end of the reporting period for the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s review. That being said, it’s also the same month that the service declared the AC-130J had reached initial operational capability. “This is a fully configured gunship,” Lieutenant General Marshall “Brad” Webb, the head of Air Force Special Operations Command, told DoDBuzz at the time. Though the aircraft might be fully configured, it now appears that not all the pieces are functioning as intended. The issue might even turn out to be moot. Webb also said that the Ghostriders were still likely years away from any actual deployments because he simply did not have enough personnel to meet his operational demands and have crews training on a new aircraft type at the same time. “We’re still just shy of two years away from wanting to put those in combat,” he explained. “The challenge that we have, it’s my problem, is how do we fight the current fight — we have gunships deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria — and use those same people to convert into a new weapon system?” As of July 2017, the Air Force had received nine AC-130Js from manufacturer Lockheed Martin.  The service totaled a tenth aircraft during testing when it briefly flew out of control, went inverted, and over-stressed the airframe. The plan is to ultimately buy a fleet of 37 Ghostriders, which will fill the gap left by the retirement of the AC-130H Specter in 2016 and completely replace the remaining AC-130Us. If the Air Force can’t fix the issues with the AC-130J’s guns in the next two years or so, when they are set to make their first deployments, the aircraft might effectively revert back to being more of a bomb truck .

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 7, 2019",Navy Orders Development Of New Air Defense Blasting Missile That Will Fit Inside F-35,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has hired Orbital ATK, now part of Northrop Grumman, to begin formal development of a new missile that can suppress and destroy enemy air defense emitters, known as the the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER. The new weapon will give the service’s carrier air wings more freedom to operate in areas full of integrated defense networks and will be an essential capability for its future F-35C Joint Strike Fighters , as well as one that will almost certainly find its way onto the USAF’s F-35A fleet, and even on other platforms . OrbitalATK announced it had secured the deal, without disclosing the value of the contract, in a press release on Jan. 24, 2018. The Navy describes the weapon as an update of the existing AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) and asked for more than $180 million for the “modification” program in its budget request for the 2018 fiscal year. The service has been actively working on developing requirements for the follow-on AARGM-ER since at least 2015 . Orbital ATK “This contract is a major step in Orbital ATK’s ongoing commitment to advancing AARGM’s counter-air defense capability for the U.S. Navy,” Cary Ralston, Vice President and General Manager of the Defense Electronic Systems division of Orbital ATK’s Defense Systems Group said in the press release. “We are committed to increasing the effectiveness of the warfighter to suppress and destroy enemy air defense threats while remaining safe.” As such, the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor has actually crafted a new weapon that, while leveraging a significant amount of the internal components from the existing AGM-88E, and packages them in an all-new shell. The Navy’s requirements for more range, increased resistance to enemy countermeasures, and the ability to fit inside the limited space in the F-35C’s weapons bay, necessitated an almost entirely revised external configuration. A breakdown of the basic components of Orbital ATK’s AARGM-ER design., Orbital ATK The Navy’s exact range and speed requirements are understandably classified. According to publicly available information , the existing AGM-88E can hit targets more than 80 miles away and reach speeds of more than twice the speed of sound in a final sprint. The new missile will need to have ability to hit targets further away in order to keep a non-stealthy launching aircraft safe from enemy defenses. Though the Navy’s goal is to combine the weapon with its Joint Strike Fighters, it immediate plan is to reach initial operational capability with the weapon sometime between 2022 and 2023 using its existing carrier-based F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter bombers and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. These two aircraft are the service’s primary launch platforms for the AGM-88E and the Navy only plans to reach initial operational capability with the F-35C in 2019. The basic configuration of the AGM-88E AARGM., Orbital ATK At the same time, though, America’s fourth generation aircraft, especially those tasked with suppression of enemy air defenses mission, or SEAD, have become increasingly vulnerable as potential opponents, especially near-peer powers such as Russia and China , have worked to develop improved radars and other sensors linked to long-range surface-to-air missiles. Less capable hostile states, such as Iran and North Korea , are also steadily improving their defensive networks. Orbital ATK says the AARGM-ER will have an all new propulsion system in order to meet the Navy’s range requirement, but it’s not clear what type of powerplant it might use. In 2015, the Navy had reportedly decided to focus on a dual-pulse rocket engine over a ramjet to provide additional range,, which will give the missile between 20-50 percent greater range than its AGM-88E predecessor. A longer sustained thrust capability would also make this new anti-radiation missile more survivable and would substantially increase its probability of a kill. These new features will have to fit within a shape that is defined by the F-35’s internal weapons bays . This existing AGM-88E is too long and its fins make it too wide for the Joint Strike Fighter to carry while in its most stealthy configuration . Dispensing with the existing control surfaces and mid-body wings, the AARGM-ER will feature a new tail for flight control and strakes along the side for stability and enhanced range. The streamlined design gives the missile a more aerodynamic profile, hopefully further improving its speed and range. A mockup of the AARGM-ER in one of the weapons bays on an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter., Orbital ATK Orbital ATK says the arrangement will make the weapon more maneuverable and therefore less likely to be susceptible to anti-missile interceptors and other short-range air defenses . Moving the control section to the rear of a missile is an established way to enhance its maneuverability. In addition, it will have a thermal sleeve to further limit the enemy’s ability to detect and target the missile, but there is no word yet about improved resistance to electronic warfare systems . Otherwise, as it stands now, the AARGM-ER will have the same guidance section and warhead as the AGM-88E. As such, the new missile will have the same capability to home in on enemy radars and other emitters, key components of integrated air defense networks . The guidance system also has other targeting modes using either a combination of inertial navigation and GPS or millimeter wave radar. This multi-mode guidance makes the missile more precise and means it has the ability to find and hit its target even if the crew tries to hide by shutting off their equipment or, if the system is mobile, makes a dash for cover. According to Orbital ATK , this gives the existing AARGMs and future AARGM-ERs a secondary time-sensitive strike capability against fleeting targets even if they’re not emitting a signal of some sort. https://youtube.com/watch?v=16EimRYN3uw The present AGM-88E’s guidance suite is networked, too. This allows the launching aircraft to fire the weapon without having to acquire the target’s emissions first, or potentially at all. The missile can detect and categorize targets autonomously or it could get that information from another source as it speeds toward the general area. The system is supposed to be able to send data back to the launching aircraft confirming its final attack status, too. With so much proven, in-production technology at its core, the new missiles are likely to be a much more cost effective option over an entirely clean sheet design, no matter how different the weapon’s body is from existing AGM-88s. It could also simplify logistics and training requirements, since some portion of the maintenance and operational procedures will likely remain the same. It is very likely that Orbital ATK will look to design the weapon with an eye toward easily adding upgraded capabilities, both in terms of hardware and software, in the future. The AGM-88E itself was just new guidance and control systems mated to the existing AGM-88B/C design, which emanates from the AGM-45 which was operational in the mid 1960s. With its known features, the AARGM-ER will give the Navy’s carrier air wings an important means of breaking into denied areas full of rapidly evolving enemy air defenses. Combined with the F-35C, it will be an even more effective combination and will open up the Joint Strike Fighter to a whole new level of suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), also known as “Wild Weasel,” capabilities—a mission set that has always been among the stealth fighter’s most exciting possibilities. An EA-18G Growler carrying an AGM-88E., USN Able to carry a pair of the new missiles while remaining in their most stealthy configuration, the Joint Strike Fighters could help rapidly clear a path for follow-on strikes by Super Hornets or other older fourth generation aircraft during a crisis . It could also enable other F-35Cs to potentially use their low observable features to get close enough to destroy air defense components via internally-carried precision guided bombs, such as the stand-off capable Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). In addition, with the added range of the AARGM-ER, F-35Cs tasked with suppressing hostile air defense networks would be able to suppress and destroy hostile emitters further into enemy territory, as well. This could be particularly important when taking on an opponent with multiple, overlapping layers of long-range defenses, and in increasing the speed at which allied forces can “knock down the enemy’s door” and create a lane for other platforms to rush into. Using their own data links and other intermediary communication nodes, the Joint Strike Fighters would also be able to feed information from their sensor suite to fourth generation aircraft carrying additional AARGM-ERs. All three variants of the F-35 are already setup to gather and fuse together an immense amount of information about electronic emitters and the enemy’s electronic order of battle, which could become targeting information for anti-radiation missiles. Under such a scheme , fourth generation fighters or F-35’s in non-stealthy configuration could act as “missile trucks” well behind a stealthy F-35 screen, remotely launching AARGM-ER’s on demand. An F-35C in a less stealthy configuration with a number of external stores pylons. , Lockheed Martin The Navy is already heavily invested in the idea of networked sensors and weapons, with an overarching plan known as Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air, or NIFC-CA , which is focused on integrating the anti-air and anti-surface capabilities of its aircraft and ships. But there’s no indication that the AARGM-ER would stay limited to Navy aircraft, either. The aforementioned operational concepts would translate to the Air Force’s F-35As and Marine Corps F-35Bs —although the B model’s smaller bay couldn’t accommodate the weapon internally—as well as those aircraft working in concert with other fourth generation aircraft and aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms across the services . It’s long-range could open up more novel possibilities, as well, including using autonomous or semi-autonomous unmanned aircraft to either locate emitters or as the launch platform itself . USN Combining the missiles with the up-coming B-21 Raider stealth bomber could present a new and particularly impressive capability to challenge enemy anti-access and area denial developments. It would give the bombers an ability to defend themselves against “pop-up,” or unforeseen threats along their mission route, thus further increasingly the type’s survivability . It seems likely that a number of foreign countries, especially those who are part of the Joint Strike Fighter program, will be interested in acquiring the new missiles, as well. Many U.S. allies in Europe and the Pacific region are presented with many of the same anti-access and area denial challenges from Russia and China. The AGM-88E was already a cooperative effort between Orbital ATK and the European missile consortium MBDA, with Italy being one of the weapon’s launch customers. Australia is now looking to purchase the E model, as well. Both the Royal Australian and Italian Air Forces also plan to adopt the F-35A. This new anti-radiation missile will also act as “insurance” as to guarantee the Joint Strike Fighter’s relevance against very high-end threats that will keep the jet from getting within Small Diameter Bomb attack range of the most threatening enemy emitters. Not all emitters are made equal. Pinpointing and suppressing or destroying particular sensors that threaten the F-35 and other stealthy aircraft most, like those that don’t operate on or around the X-band for which stealth fighters were designed to evade, will become essential in future conflicts. In other words, blinding the emitters that can potentially track the F-35 and even the F-22 at a distance, and can cue other sensors to look in these aircraft’s direction, after which that wide array of sensor data can be “fused” to create weapons engagement quality track, need to be destroyed more than the sensors that the stealth jets are largely invisible to. The AARGM-ER could help greatly with this problem. F-16CJ/CMs have been the backbone of the Wild Weasel fleet since the retirement of the F-4G in the early 1990s, but the F-35’s SEAD/DEAD capabilities are undeniable., USAF The USAF’s need for this missile in particular is abundantly clear. The existing Block 50 F-16CJ/CM fleet, which dedicates much of its training to the “Wild Weasel” mission-set, is increasingly challenged to remain relevant in a world where potential enemies  are rapidly building-up ever denser and more capable air defense networks. As a result, a longer-ranged and more survivable primary SEAD weapon would be very welcome. And as the SEAD/DEAD mission increasingly blurs between the dedicated “Wild Weasel” community and that of any F-35 squadron with their unique abilities to sneak up and neutralize enemy air defenses, fielding the AARGM-ER for the USAF’s F-35A units will become overtly logical. With or without the USAF, foreign participation, or the potential of overseas sales, the US Navy is definitely committed to acquiring this important capability for its own aircraft as the threat of advanced, networked air defenses continue to grow. But really, the AARGM-ER and what it can do across the F-35 fleet is downright exciting.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2019",German Firm Says it Has a “Safer” Way for Tanks to Blast Incoming Projectiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. German defense conglomerate Rheinmetall says it latest active protection system for tanks and other armored vehicles, which protects military vehicles against various types of incoming projectiles, has become the first anywhere in the world to pass a stringent independent safety evaluation. The hope is that this will help allay potential customers’ fears that these types of defenses might pose significant risks to friendly troops and innocent bystanders. Earlier in January 2018, ADS GmbH, a Rheinmetall subsidiary, announced that independent defense auditor TMS had declared that its APS-Gen3 defense system met the International Electrotechnical Commission’s IEC 61508 standard for functional safety. The firm plans to submit the active protection system for additional tests later in the year to certify it meets that standard’s Safety Integrity Level 3, the second highest rating, which means the equipment’s chance of failing to function properly is at least 1 in 1,000. “Functional safety is not about whether a system is working well in its field and delivering an expected performance,” Dr. Ronald Meixner, a lead engineer at ADS, said in a press release Rheinmetall published on Jan. 23, 2018. “It’s about whether it is safe for all of us to use such system – as operator or as any human being which simply happens to be nearby.” Car companies use the same guidelines for air bags , but often accept just hitting Level 2, where the system in question only has to work at least 99 out of 100 times on average. The fourth level of reliability, a failure rate of 1 in 10,000 or better, is generally reserved for especially critical equipment, such as nuclear reactors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Hg9cbi7aEfY Reliability is an important consideration in any weapon or other piece of military, but particularly so with regards to active protection systems. By definition, these defenses have to detect an incoming projectile and launch a countermeasure of some type, often with only a fraction of a second before it actually hits the vehicle. The APS-Gen3 is a “hard-kill” type system, which means it is set up to physically destroy the hostile anti-tank missile or rocket. The ADS system does this with small, focused explosive. The system is scalable, consisting of a number of sensor and countermeasure sets fitted around the outside of any tank or other vehicle. Each charge is good for blasting one incoming round. The rest of the system includes short-range radars and electro-optical sensors, plus the necessary electronic components to link everything together. The radars detect the missile or rocket as it approaches the vehicle and the cameras spot it milliseconds before impact, triggering the explosive countermeasure at exactly the right moment. A Leopard 2 main battle tank configured as a demonstrator with the APS-Gen3, smoke grenade and other visual countermeausre launchers, and other equipment., Rheinmetall Other types of active defenses, such as Israel’s Trophy , which the U.S. Army is buying for its M1 Abrams tanks, use a similar combination of sensors cued to launchers that are essentially large shotguns. These then neutralize incoming missiles or rockets with a burst of metal balls. The APS-Gen3 actually has a lot in common with older explosive reactive armor suites , that array blocks of explosives around the hull of armored vehicles. In this case, the charges are set up to simply detonate when they get hit by a threatening projectile. But it’s exactly these methods of operation that have long presented hurdles to more widespread adoption of both explosive reactive armor and more modern hard kill active protection systems. Covering armored vehicles with charges or other systems that could be lethal 30 to 40 feet away makes them inherently more dangerous to nearby friendly dismounted troops and innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire. Both are especially significant concerns during operations in urban environments or other areas that bring the vehicles closer to potential threats, which are the exact situations where vehicle crews would want an active defense system. Unfortunately, these are the same scenarios where supporting dismounted infantry are equally crucial and where vehicles are more likely to be in close proximity to civilians . First generation active protection systems, such as the Soviet Drozd , were infamously hazardous to friend and foe alike and that perception has persisted to a degree of such defenses in general. The video below shows the Drozd in action, with a slow-motion clip of the interceptor blasting a recoilless rifle round at 0:50 in the run time, which gives a good sense of just how dangerous the system could have been to any troops close by. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_a9SianUASY “In the West, we have to take care of things that the Russians don’t worry about quite as much,” Geoff Revill, a Rheinmetall spokesperson told Breaking Defense earlier in January 2018. “We care about our blue [friendly] forces, we care about civilians in an urban environment.” At the same time, though, both nation states and non-state actors are increasingly fielding more modern anti-tank guided missiles, such as the American TOW , the Iranian Toophan derivative , and the Russian Kornet , among many others . The have been similarly steady improvements in unguided, shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons , as well. The Russian RPG-30 has features specifically intended to defeat active protection systems. So, there is a clear demand for new defensive countermeasures and ADS and Rheinmetall say that their system is safer than competing types of hard kill active protection systems available. The APS-Gen3 focuses its already limited blast almost straight down, which helps keep the explosion and any shrapnel directed away from troops or civilians near the vehicle. The system is modular, though, and components can be fitted where necessary to protect vital areas, including the tops of tanks and other armored vehicles. Its not clear how safe an upward directed blast might be for anyone close by. The test Leopard 2 main battle tank with explosive charges and electro-optical sensors positioned to the side and roof of the turret., Rheinmetall The independent certification is supposed to indicate that its particular combination of sensors is less likely to accidentally trigger the charges, as well. According to Breaking Defense , before securing the IEC 61508 rating, engineers tried to fool the system with blasts of water, flying piles of dead leaves, and white phosphorus smoke grenades, none of which generated a false positive. The water test was reportedly at the request of an unnamed Southeast Asian customer concerned about what might happen to vehicles with the APS-Gen3 during the monsoon season. In addition, ADS bolted one of the radars from its active protection system to the side of the building and left it out in the open for three years . In that time, it never inadvertently registered a passing bird or other object as an incoming threat. But it’s still not clear whether the safety evaluation or the systems’ other features would necessarily be the deciding factor for potential customers one way or another. As noted, the U.S. Army, one major potential customer, is already purchasing Trophy, which has a proven combat record and boasts multiple intercepts during the 2014 Israeli intervention in the Gaza strip without any accidental detonations. Senior U.S. Army leaders have also made it clear the bigger issue they’re facing is trying to convince troops that active protection works in general. “There has to be a level of trust in whatever it is that you’re trying [to use] to displace that passive armor,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General John Murray, Deputy Chief of Staff for Resource Management, said at a gathering with industry representatives in March 2017. A system like the APS-Gen3, which waits until the last moment to counter an incoming missile or rocket with a very precise charge with a potentially limited engagement envelope, might not inspire that level of confidence, no matter how reliable it is overall. And once those explosives detonate, whether they destroy the threat or not, the system effectively becomes dead weight until technicians can install new countermeasures. Combining various different types of defenses could provide vehicles with a more robust defense, something the U.S. Army is looking into as part of its Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) program. It’s not entirely clear what such a system might look like, but one immediate possibility would be combining a hard kill active protection system such as Trophy with explosive reactive armor. Regardless, an arrangement involving multiple defensive countermeasures would come at the cost of more weight and bulk. Any such configuration including the APS-Gen3 would also render its safety certifications moot as it would only be one part of a larger whole. An M1 Abrams tank with the Trophy active protection system on the turret and explosive reactive armor along the hull., US Army via Leonardo That being said, for any country that is worried that existing active defenses pose too much of a risk of friendly fire and collateral damage, the German system does now boast an impressive set of credentials. The availability of a “safer” system might be enough to convince a military that had previously written off active protection to consider it now. In addition, these could prove to be important selling points for countries, especially in Western Europe, where there is increasing public concerns about any weapon system that acts in an autonomous and semi-autonomous manner . Active protection systems have presented a complicated gray area for advocates calling for a total ban on so-called “lethal autonomous weapons.” “We understand that this automated weaponry, it’s scary stuff,” Rheinmetall spokesperson Revill said. “It’s absolutely needed, but to be the guy that makes the decision to deploy it, the confidence levels have to rise significantly.” The German conglomerate clearly believes its APS-Gen3 will be able to ease potential customers’ fears about active protection.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 23, 2021",China Reveals It Has Two Underwater Listening Devices Within Range of Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese government has revealed the existence of two underwater sensors situated between the United States island of Guam and the South China Sea. Though officially for scientific research, the undersea listening devices are likely doing double duty, monitoring the movements of American and other foreign submarines and potentially intercepting their communications. The state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences only disclosed the pair of acoustic sensors earlier in January 2018, but had been operating them since 2016, according to a report from the South China Morning Post . One of them is in the Challenger Deep , located at the southern end of the Marianas Trench and the deepest known point on earth, and the other is situated further west near the island of Yap, part of the Federated States of Micronesia . Both reportedly can pick up acoustic signatures more than 620 miles away, putting them within range of Guam and the major strategic U.S. naval base at Apra Harbor. The two devices are “a breakthrough for China,” the head of the deep-sea surveillance and communication programs at the Academy of Sciences, identified only by the surname Zhu, told the South China Morning Post . “The deeper under the surface, the quieter the world becomes, and it allows us to concentrate on the signal we most want to hear.” At least officially, those signals are the sounds produced as a result of undersea earthquakes, typhoons and other extreme weather patterns above, and marine animals, such as whales . Underwater quakes in particular can trigger devastating tsunamis giving the sensors a legitimate role in improving early warning of potential natural disasters. In February 2017, the Academy of Science’s Institute of Geology and Geophysics conducted a number of controlled detonations in the Marianas Trench that would have produced important data in this regard. At the same time, those same sensors cannot help but offer a way to listen for submarine traffic. Their strategic locations near Guam, a major staging base for U.S. submarines and surface warships, as well as long-range bombers , only reinforces the likelihood that the devices have secondary military early warning and intelligence gathering roles. Just being able to monitor underwater movements to and from Guam, and elsewhere in the general vicinity, is an important capability. Capable of operating for protracted periods below the surface, submarines have inherent deterrent qualities and are well suited to avoiding detection in order to get close to a particular area to launch a no-notice strike or to discreetly gather intelligence . A tug helps move the Los Angeles -class attack submarine USS Key West to a pier in Guam after a four-month patrol., USN On top of that, the Chinese listening devices may be able to pick up underwater communications transmissions. The South China Morning Post reported that there might be networks of undersea hydrophones in and around Guam that allow submarines to communicate with U.S. Navy command centers without having to get to periscope depth or surface completely and reveal their position. It would also be able to pick up any other acoustic communications, as well. In 2008, reports emerged that the U.S. Navy had hired Raytheon to work on a system called Deep Siren , which would use a small buoy to convert satellite signals into sound waves, allowing a submerged submarine to use long-range communication networks without having to expose itself. It is likely that any such transmissions containing sensitive information would be encrypted or otherwise coded in some fashion, but they could still provide a wealth of information for Chinese analysts , such as possible details about standard operating procedures based on how many messages go out in a certain time frame or when and where the exchanges occur. It could also expose potential vulnerabilities in those communication methods. A shot of submarine activity at Apra Harbor in Guam, with two Los Angeles -class attack submarines moored to the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land at right and the Ohio -class guided missile submarine USS Michigan pierside at left., USN This is not a new concept, of course. During the Cold War, the United States built and maintained an extensive undersea surveillance network to help monitor the movement of Soviet submarines, known as the Sound Surveillance System, or SOSUS . Spies subsequently comprised that system, leading to a multi-faceted combination of underwater sensors and ship-based towed sonar arrays, all cued to processing stations ashore, known as the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS), parts of which remain in operation to this day. But for China, developing its own such capability is important, especially as it increasingly tries to restrict the movement of foreign military forces through its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. Though international tribunals have continually rejected the Chinese government’s positions, authorities in Beijing have pushed establish de facto control, primarily through the establishment of numerous military outposts on man-made outcroppings in previously uninhabited reefs and shoals. A map of Chinese and other foreign outposts in the South China Sea., DOD In turn, the United States in particular sends aircraft and warships into those areas on Freedom of Navigation Operations, or FONOPS , asserting its right to operate freely in international waters. Earlier in January 2018, the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Hopper conducted one of these missions near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, prompting a Chinese warning that the country would do everything to defend its sovereign territory . Though China’s steadily growing integrated air and coastal defenses on its South China Sea outposts do present an increasing anti-access/area denial challenge, there has been little the country could do to limit submarines moving through the area. The Chinese are intent on expanding the size and capabilities of their own submarine force, including the development of advanced diesel-electric types using air-independent propulsion systems and other technologies to reduce their acoustic sigature, So far, though, the results of those modernization efforts have been less impressive than parallel work with regards to the country’s surface fleet, including new modern destroyers and an expanding aircraft carrier fleet . At present, the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) submarine component remains a relatively small portion of its overall naval force and relies heavily shorter range coastal types less well suited to long duration patrols to help enforce its maritime claims. One of China’s Type 091 nuclear-powered attack submarines in 2009., Qiao Tianfu/Color China Photo/AP As such, the Chinese have turned to other means to try and limit the ability of foreign submarines to maneuver freely through areas it claims. In February 2017, China announced planned changes to its maritime safety regulations that would require submarines to surface and display a national flag while transiting through the areas of the South China Sea that the country claims as its own territory and report their activities and movements to civil authorities. Beyond just being of dubious legality under international maritime law, there was no obvious way Chinese authorities could enforce these rules. The new acoustic sensors could easily be part of an effort to change this balance of power. All of this would be in line with previous reports of the country working toward that goal. In 2016, the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation publicly presented a concept for what it called an “ Underwater Great Wall Project ” to support the PLAN in the South China Sea. Then, in May 2017, other Chinese research institutions announced they would begin placing underwater sensor nets in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea, the latter of which is central to a territorial dispute with Japan . Again, the ostensible objective was to gather scientific data, but authorities acknowledged that they also had an innate “national defense” capability, as well. A screen grab from Chinese state television in May 2017 that reportedly showed one of the prototype underwater sensors destined for the South China Sea or East Sea., CCTV From all accounts, this will be a major undertaking. The aforementioned research network alone has an estimated price tag of $2 billion Yuan – more than $300 million at the present official rate of exchange, which the Chinese government reportedly deliberately undervalues. Other parts of the “Underwater Great Wall” will likely not come cheap, either. These costs are immediately offset by the potential of having a game-changing undersea surveillance net that could change the strategic calculus both in disputed regions of the Pacific specifically, as well as the region as a whole. The new reports of new sensors near Guam only underscore that China is determined to project power further into the Western Pacific and challenge the ability of foreign military forces, especially those of the United States, to operate with impunity in and around regions it considers to be integral to its national territory.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 9, 2020",The French Navy Is Finally Retiring These Antique Helicopters After 55 Years of Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The French Navy will reportedly retire the last of its Alouette III light helicopters after more than 55 years of service and at least a decade before its scheduled replacement arrives, as the Cold War-era helicopters have become a nightmare to maintain. The service plans to lease Airbus Helicopters AS365 Dauphins to fill the resulting gap until the European consortium’s new H160 become available. French newspaper La Tribune first reported the decision on Jan. 19, 2018. At present, the French Navy’s aviation arm, or l’Aéronavale , has fewer than 20 of the aging Alouette IIIs, which first entered service in 1962. They increasingly serve in the reserve utility role, if they fly at all, but as of as least 2016, a number of them were still assigned to the unit Flottille 35F. That year they deployed aboard some of France’s warships, even taking part in large, multi-national exercises, such as the U.S. Navy’s Rim of the Pacific drills, or RIMPAC. According to La Tribune , French Navy Admiral Christophe Prazuck, the service’s Chief of Staff, told the Defense Committee of the country’s National Assembly in October 2017 that it now costs approximately 13,000 Euros per flight hour to operate each Alouette III, equivalent to almost $16,000. This was up from 5,000 Euros in 2010, or approximately $6,100, and at least twice the price per hour to operate similar, but much more modern helicopters in the same roles. At the same time, less than 40 percent of the French Navy’s total fleet was actually flyable at any one time on average. The main reason for this is that the Alouette IIIs have been in French Navy service for more than 55 years and the design has been out of production for more than three of those decades. Admiral Prazuck reportedly complained to the assembled lawmakers in October 2017 that the helicopter had already been in service for two years when the movie Fantômas , starring famous French actor Jean Marais and featuring the chopper heavily on screen and in its marketing literature, came out in 1964 and his service was still flying it more than five decades later. French Navy Captain Francois Duhamez, a defense attaché with the United Nations, exits an Alouette III helicopter during an exercise on the Japanese island of Okinawa in 2014., USMC France’s Sud-Aviation had first flown a prototype in 1959. It continued to build the helicopters even as the company subsequently became part of French aviation consortium Aérospatiale in 1970. Production finally stopped in 1985, after which the company eventually became part of what is now known as Airbus Group. The helicopters have performed a wide variety of missions, but have primarily spent their time as small personnel and cargo transports and air ambulances with militaries and civil operators around the world. The Alouette III’s good performance in so-called hot-and-high environments made it popular throughout search and rescue duties, especially in mountainous terrain. An Austrian Alouette III flies in the Alps in 2005., Pflatsch via Wikimedia They also became heavily associated with limited conflicts in Africa during the 1960s and 70s, where countries such as France , Portugal , Rhodesia – which became Zimbabwe after the transition from white minority rule in 1980 – and South Africa , turned them into small air assault platforms and light gunships. Even after 1985, Romania’s IAR and India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) continued to build additional models under license, as well. It’s a testament to the durability of the design that it’s remained in service in France and more than a dozen other nations for so long. But it’s also an increasingly dated design that the French military as a whole has been working to phase out for decades already. The country’s Army and Air Force had formally retired their examples by 2013. The video below offers an overview of various specialized units within the Rhodesian military, including footage of Alouette IIIs: When it came to the l’Aéronavale , the Dauphin steadily took over from the Alouette III in the search and rescue role after its introduction in the late 1970s. The Panther , a further improved derivative of the Dauphin, also replaced it in the anti-submarine warfare role in the 1980s. The French Navy bought a number of Westland Lynx light helicopters for the latter role, as well. But it’s not entirely clear why the Alouette has remained in French Navy service up to this point. It’s single-engine design and navies have increasingly preferred multi-engine rotary-wing aircraft as an added safety precaution in case of one of the powerplants failing during over-water flight, which could leave the crew with little option but to ditch in the sea. The Dauphin, Panther, and Lynx are all twin-engine designs. Below is a video montage showing helicopter operations aboard France’s aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in 2012, including Alouette IIIs that were part of its air wing at the time: Part of the issue appears to have been a desire to try save money by waiting for a replacement under the Inter-service Light Helicopter program, also known by the acronym HIL. This goal of this project is replace the Alouette, as well as the remaining Dauphin, Panther, Fennec , and Gazelle light helicopters across all of France’s military services, with versions of the Airbus Helicopters H160 . Unfortunately, the development schedule for the H160 has continued to slip since its first flight in 2015. Two years earlier, Jean-Yves Le Drian, then French Minister of Defense, had suggested the French Army would have its first examples in service by 2024. Now, according to La Tribune , budget difficulties have pushed this back to at least 2028. In September 2017, France announced it would boost defense spending by $2 billion to help improve readiness and speed up various modernization efforts. Whether Airbus can have the helicopters ready on time is a separate matter. In 2016, the multi-national firm said it would deliver the first civilian versions to customers within two years. A report by Defense News says the European aviation consortium has now pushed this back until at least 2019, when it expects to have the first three flying prototypes ready for flight certification. Its helicopter sales and deliveries reportedly slowed in general between 2016 and 2017. One of the three Airbus Group H160 prototypes., Airbus These delays are likely why the French Navy has decided to ditch at least the Alouette IIIs and lease more AS365s in the meantime. Since it’s a type the service already operates, it will have little trouble integrating them into the overall force. Still in production, the Dauphins will be cheaper to maintain and keep mission ready than the older helicopters, too. This arrangement could continue until the H160s finally begin to enter French Navy service, sometime after 2028. The French government expects to sign deals for between 160 and 190 of the helicopters in total across the services starting in 2022 or 2023, which would be a major boon for Airbus’ production line. If that delivery schedule slips any further, however, France may feel it has to trim the total buy and seek other solutions as other helicopter types, such as the also out of production Gazelle, become increasingly more difficult to maintain. However that program plays out, though, the Alouette III’s career in French service is finally coming to a close after nearly five decades.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 3, 2019",The US Navy May End Up Flying the Air Force’s Unwanted MQ-1 Predator Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After operating the iconic drones for more than two decades of service, the U.S. Air Force is getting closer to retiring its fleet of MQ-1 Predators . The unmanned aircraft may continue to fly at home and abroad, though, with the U.S. Navy looking into picking up some of them before they go to the bone yard. In an Email to the War Zone, the Air Force confirmed that it expects to complete its planned transition from the MQ-1 to the larger MQ-9 Reaper by the end of 2018. The service first announced that plan in 2015, but without explaining what might happen to the more than 100 remaining perfectly serviceable drones. The first RQ-1 unmanned aircraft entered service with the US Army in 1995 before the Pentagon shifted control to the Air Force in 1996. The type gained the ability to launch AGM-114 Hellfire missiles in 2001 and was re-designated the MQ-1. “We are in the initial phases of working through the process. There are a number of possibilities as to where they could go, including Air Force museums,” an Air Force spokesperson told us in the Email. “The Air Force is working with the Navy to determine configurations and quantity for possible transfer.” We don’t know what those configurations would necessarily be or how much of the Predator fleet the Navy might be interested in taking for itself. At present, the Air Force flies the MQ-1 in two primary configurations, with one being setup for armed reconnaissance with two pylons for precision guided bombs or missiles, as well as electro-optical and infrared cameras in a turret under the nose. The service also operates in the drones in an unarmed configuration with just the sensor turret. A US Air Force MQ-1 Predator., USAF The Navy could also replace the existing sensor turret with a newer system, or otherwise look to add in additional sensors or other mission equipment, such as electronic warfare jammers or communications nodes, within the constraints of the design. General Atomics, which developed the Predator, offers the Lynx multi-mode radar with a synthetic aperture imaging capability, which fits in the Army’s similarly sized Warrior Alpha and MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones. It’s worth noting that the Air Force opted to switch over to the MQ-9 specifically because of its added range and payload capacity and flies Reapers with external fuel tanks in order to further expand its capabilities. At the same time, though, sensor suites for certain mission sets are steadily getting smaller, which might open up new possibilities for the older MQ-1s. A compact wide-area airborne persistence surveillance system in particular, which feature one or more wide-angle cameras, could breathe more life into the Predators. Various systems exist that would be small enough to fit on the MQ-1, including Logos Technologies Redkite and Elbit Systems SkyEye Wide Area Persistent Surveillance (WAPS). These sensors can capture still images and full motion video across a broad region, allowing a single unmanned aircraft to monitor a greater area by itself. With this kind of information, intelligence analysts can more readily track enemy movements and spot significant changes in their activities or the terrain itself. It’s an especially useful capability for locating small groups of fighters who might be operating discreetly across a broad region and then establishing a “ pattern of life ” to help determine the best possible time to strike. The U.S. military has also found these sensors can help spot improvised explosive devices and then trace militants’ movements back to the workshops where they build the bombs. The Navy has already made it clear that it is interested in developing its own unmanned airborne surveillance capabilities to support its own personnel, as well as U.S. Marines, during on-going counter-terrorism operations. Earlier in January 2018, the service announced it was interested in hiring General Atomics directly to fly and otherwise maintain its own MQ-9s in Afghanistan. It is possible that the service could enter into a similar arrangement with General Atomics to operate any MQ-1s it gets second hand from the Air Force. However, the contractors would only be able to fly unarmed reconnaissance missions, at least under existing rules and regulations . The Navy is also responsible for procurement of aircraft for the Marine Corps, so it could acquire the Predators on their behalf. A fleet of Navy owned and either Navy or Marine operated Predators would be able to conduct both intelligence and surveillance operations, as well as strikes. Either way, the service’s MQ-1s would expand the total number of medium-altitude, medium-endurance drones, which are always in high demand , that are available to the U.S. military as a whole. Other retired airframes could become parts donors to help reduce the cost of sustaining the aircraft. Whether contractor operated or not, the Navy could assign these drones to conventional units, akin to Navy squadrons with manned patrol aircraft or the Marine Corps’ existing unmanned elements . For the Navy in particular, having the Predators could provide a new stepping stone to a future unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) capability, which the service effectively shelved when it decided to turn its carrier-launched stealthy, penetrating strike drone project into a program to develop an unarmed unmanned aerial tanker . Though a future UCAV fleet would be a very different affair from the Predators, including likely flying autonomous or semi-autonomous operations without the need for an operator in the loop, the MQ-1s could serve as a way to steadily integrate armed drones into broader Navy operational concepts and promote the development of more multi-mission unmanned units within the service. The Naval Special Warfare community itself has long been interested in an organic light attack aircraft to reduce its dependence on other services for this type of support, but has focused primarily and so far unsuccessfully on acquiring a manned type . Of course, Navy and Marine Corps special operations units already have their own drones, but having MQ-1s would provide a very different and proven capability to attack targets, all without having to rely on the U.S. Army and Air Force to provide those assets. This in turn could given those elite Navy and Marine units more flexibility to operate, especially on short notice, when and where the other services might not be available. Beyond Navy or Marine Corps use, it’s not clear what other future there might be for the Predators, though. The Army has already made it clear that it has no plans to acquire any of the MQ-1s, since they do not share enough components with the MQ-1C for such a plan to make sense logistically. Some could end up as targets for air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons and sensor testing. A member of the US Army’s 10th Combat Aviation Brigade walks by an MQ-1C Gray Eagle at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq in 2017., US Army Pentagon regulations for this type of military unmanned aircraft technology require thurough de-militarization to remove and destroy components with no defined non-military purpose. This might make it time consuming for the U.S. government to rapidly transfer them to civilian government agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the Drug Enforcement Administration . Still, for those agencies with airborne surveillance requirements it could well be worth going through this process in order to acquire more unmanned aircraft at a relatively low cost. The rules also ban the sale of any surplus Predators directly to private buyers without going through the aforementioned demilitarization process, though it is possible that the Air Force could cut a deal to send them back to General Atomics. Export restrictions limit the ability of the U.S. government to transfer them to foreign buyers, as well. “The USAF does not anticipate these aircraft will be made available via the Excess Defense Article Program for Security Cooperation,” the Air Force spokesperson told us specifically in their Email. Still, there will be a “screening of the aircraft condition and configuration to determine if there are suitable candidates to be offered via the Excess Defense Article Program.” An Italian Air Force Predator operating from Djibouti as part of the European Union’s counter-piracy mission in 2014., EUNAVFOR It is possible that this may be less of an issue under President Donald Trump than it might have been in the past, though. The Trump administration has already approved a number of foreign military deals that the U.S. government had previously blocked, including the sales of manned light attack aircraft . In August 2017, the United States launched a review of those export rules with an eye toward to expanding foreign military sales. In addition, Trump himself has also said he is encouraging the America’s diplomatic corps to push more weapons deals to foreign partners. Loosening up restrictions on the transfer of the Predators could let the U.S. government challenge the growth of similar foreign drone exports, especially from China , to traditional American partners , such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia . MQ-1s could just go to countries that have already secured approval to buy them in the past, such as Italy, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates. With the Navy already looking to pick up at least some of the Predators, its likely that the MQ-1’s career with the U.S. military is still far from over.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 7, 2019","Turkey Launched An Offensive Against Kurds in Northwestern Syria, Here’s Why It Matters","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey says it has effectively kicked off an offensive to destroy Kurdish forces in and around the far northwestern Syrian city of Afrin with an artillery bombardment, after deciding against air strikes in the face of Syrian threats. It is the latest indication that the conflict in the country is evolving rapidly as the threat of ISIS terrorists has steadily dissipated . There is now the potential for a dangerous three-way standoff between the Turks, the United States, and Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Russian and Iranian benefactors. On Jan. 19, 2018, Turkish artillery shelled areas in and around Afrin under the control of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units , also known by the acronym YPG. The government in Ankara says this group is simply an extension of the Kurdish Workers’ Party, or PKK, an organization that it and other countries have designated as terrorists. Turkey had previously said it would conduct air strikes, but apparently held off after Syrian authorities threatened to shoot the planes down . In 2012, Syrian forces did actually shoot down a Turkish F-4 Phantom II fighter jet, claiming it had violated their air space. “The operation has actually de facto started with cross-border shelling,” Turkish Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said, according to Reuters . “All terror networks and elements in northern Syria will be eliminated. There is no other way.” At present, the major players in and around Afrin are the YPG, Turkmen and Arab members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, and forces aligned with the Assad regime, including elements of the Russian military. The canton forms a pocket that is physically separated from the main areas of YPG control further to the east, which is also where the U.S. military is situated in the country. The map below gives a good sense of just how isolated Afrin is from the rest of Kurdish-controlled territory. Canikli stressed that Turkey had not yet deployed any ground forces into the Afrin area. There were separate reports that buses carrying Turkmen and Arab members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, or TFSA, had crossed the border into areas east of the city. It’s close enough that Turkish artillery can shell YPG positions from within the country, though. Videos quickly appeared on social media showing Turkey’s T-155 Firtina 155mm self-propelled howitzers in particularly firing rounds across the border. Turkish troops may soon join the fighting directly, though. On Jan. 17, 2017, Turkish officials had made clear they were gearing up for a larger operation against the YPG in the Afrin canton and subsequently sent tanks and other armored vehicles and troops to their side of the border. Also on Jan. 17, 2017, the PKK released a video, seen below, that it claimed show its fighters destroying a Turkish S-70 helicopter as it sat at a remote mountain top outpost with an anti-tank guided missile, an increasingly common insurgent tactic . A separate clip from the Turkish personnel at the site, also shown below, later confirmed that the Black Hawk had actually dodged the attack and escaped unharmed. The “YPG is ready to confront Turkish troops and FSA terrorists,” the Kurdish group said in a statement, according to Reuters. “If they dare to attack, we are ready to bury them one by one in Afrin.” The Kurdish group also released video and imagery of reinforcements heading toward Afrin from the area in and around city of Manbij farther to the east, showing them in convoys that included armed pickup trucks and improvised armored vehicles, as well as armored personnel carriers and self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery they had apparently captured previously from Syrian forces. Notably, the columns also included Humvees, IAG Guardians, and Lenco Bearcats, all of which would almost certainly have come from the United States or other members of the international coalition fighting ISIS by way of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of which the Syrian Kurds make up the majority. The immediate impetus for Turkey’s intervention was the U.S. government’s announcement that it would continue to support the the SDF in Eastern Syria indefinitely. The United States says it is doing so in order to prevent ISIS terrorists from regrouping, stem growing Iranian influence , and provide the security necessary for the success of the internationally-backed, but largely stalled peace process to end the Syrian civil war. “U.S. disengagement from Syria would provide Iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in Syria,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Jan. 17, 2018. “Additionally, a total withdrawal of U.S. personnel at this time would restore Assad and continue his brutal treatment of his own people.” Turkey has long opposed the SDF in general, since the YPG makes up the bulk of the force. So, on Jan. 15, 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had described the reported American plans to craft a 30,000-member “Syrian Border Security Force” for this long-term mission in Syria, with at least 15,000 members of the Kurdish group at its core, as giving legitimacy to a “ terror army .” He said Turkey would “strangle it before it’s even born.” For its part, the U.S. government has continued to call on Turkey to remain focused on efforts to defeat ISIS terrorists. In his subsequent remarks, Tillerson also said the description of the proposed U.S.-backed Syrian force as being specifically for border security had been a misstatement. Regardless, the United States denies the YPG has a direct connection to the PKK or plans to seize Turkish territory. A YPG fighter rests in Kobane during fighting against ISIS in 2015., Laurence Geai/Sipa via AP In March 2017, U.S. special operations forces even deployed to Manbij in order to block a Turkish-backed push against the Kurdish group. American troops continue to help preserve the status quo in that part of Syria. But there is a distinct possibility that whatever happens in the near term in Afrin could have a much more far-reaching impact on the conflict in Syria. This situation in the district is deeply intertwined with the wildly different goals of various other actors in the country and in the region. We at The War Zone have repeatedly noted that these competing agendas could only rise to the surface as ISIS ceased to be an imminent threat . Turkey already appears to be using its complaints about what the United States is doing in Eastern Syria to achieve separate goals in the western portions of the country. The U.S. military does not actually operate in Afrin, at least publicly , per an agreement with the Russians , which created a formal boundary between the two countries’ respective military activities in the country to avoid any potentially dangerous misunderstandings . There is no indication that the United States will come to the rescue of Kurdish forces in Afrin or that it would even necessarily continue to work with the YPG as part of the SDF if the political landscape in Syria changed significantly. The U.S. government notably stood by as Iraqi forces swiftly crushed Kurdish aspirations for an independent state in that country in October 2017. SDF fighters during the U.S.-backed offensive to eject ISIS from Raqqa in 2017., Morukc Umnaber/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Knowing that the United States would at least not deploy troops that far to the west in Syria due to its arrangement with Russia, the YPG in Afrin actually cut its own ceasefire deal with the Kremlin in August 2017 . This put them under the umbrella of a Russian-managed “ de-escalation zone ,” which in turn kept Turkish-backed forces out of the area. Russia, along with Iran and Turkey, had agreed to create these safe areas earlier in the year to help consolidate their respective positions and present a more tangible obstacle to the United States and its partners. A Turkish operation in Afrin immediately puts them at odds with the Russians and Iranians and threatens the basic integrity of the de-escalation zone plan. On Jan. 18, 2018, Turkey reportedly reached out to the other members of the triumvirate in order to secure their approval for air strikes, but it appears the parties haven’t reached an understanding yet. Then on Jan. 19, 2018, Russia said it was moving “observers” near Afrin , which could be an effort to dissuade the Turks from pushing ahead with a more significant ground operation. At the same time, Assad remains wary of a formal Turkish presence in his country, given Ankara’s long-standing support for the TFSA, which seeks to overthrow his regime. This is almost certainly what prompted the Syrian government’s threat to shoot down Turkish warplanes over Afrin. Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad during a trip to Russia in November 2011., Michael Klimentyev/Sputnik  via AP How this complex situation will play out from here is unclear. Turkey has steadily grown closer to Russia over its dispute with the United States and its support for the Kurds. President Erdoğan and other Turkish officials have toned down their rhetoric toward the Assad regime, as well, in the process. Still, the relationships may be relatively fragile. Russia, which has had its own deadly skirmishes with Turkish and Turkish-backed forces in Syria in the past, initially blamed Turkey for not stopping an unprecedented mass drone attack on its forces in the country earlier in January 2018. Unknown militants launched the unmanned aircraft from Syria’s Idlib governorate, which is part of a Turkish-managed de-escalation zone. In response, Turkey accused Russia and Iran of violating the spirit of the ceasefire plan by launching operations into Idlib. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin subsequently backed away from those allegations, publicly stating that the Kremlin did not believe the Turks were responsible in any way for the drone attacks. Russian officials have still not said who they do believe was behind the incident, despite claiming to have killed them in an artillery strikes days later. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during a shared press conference in Ankara in December 2017., Evgeny Biyatov/Sputnik  via AP There are possible indications that Russia may be increasingly losing patience with Assad, as well. Russian officials notably sidelined the Syrian leader when Putin triumphantly visited the country in December 2017. There are now reports that the brutal dictator is piling up debts he can’t repay , infuriating both the Kremlin and Iran. All of this could make an already complicated situation more complex if the fighting in Afrin expands. The YPG will almost certainly come into contact with Turkish-backed forces as they seek to reinforce their position with troops from further east. This in turn could force Turkey to expand the scope of the intervention immediately to support Free Syrian Army units that might come under attack. Any Russian or Syria troops that end caught up in the crossfire might just engage Turkish or Turkish-support elements in self-defense. That in turn could easily escalate into more serious clashes before officials in either country can find a way to de-escalate the situation. Authorities in Damascus or Ankara might have trouble reigning in their respective militia groups, too. Depending on their particular affiliations and allegiances, they might call in their own reinforcements, which could add even more disparate actors to the mix. Members of the pro-Assad Desert Falcons militia in Palmyra in 2016., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP This is hardly idle speculation, either. We’ve already seen a number of similar potentially serious incidents develop rapidly in Syria just in the past year. In August 2017, U.S. special operators defended themselves against Turkish-backed rebel groups, who had launched an attack on the SDF fighters they were working with at the time. Earlier 2017, other American forces and their Syrian partners in the country’s southern desert near the Jordanian border similarly attacked pro-Assad Iranian-supported Shia militiamen who made a number of attempts to advance on their positions. U.S. combat aircraft shot down two Iranian drones during the incidents. The United States tried, but was unable to use of its emergency hotline with the Russians to get those irregular forces to stand down. The situation now developing in Afrin perfectly encapsulates the complexities of the fighting in Syria and the ever present potential for dangerous miscalculations that could drag any number of parties into a broader conflict. However it plays it, it will have significant ramifications for Turkey and the local militias it supports, the United States and its Kurdish partners, and the Assad regime and its allies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 8, 2019",Ukraine’s New AK-M16 Mashup Rifle Is Symbolic of the Country’s Morphing Strategic Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ukrainian military has received the first of its new US-made WAC-47 rifles, a derivative of the American-designed M16 rifle that chambers the Soviet-era 7.62x39mm cartridge. Ukraine is primarily looking to get the guns as part of a push to modernize its forces and to make it easier for its troops to work together with foreign units , especially members of the NATO alliance, but in doing so they’re also sending a clear political message to Russia. In a New Year’s statement on Jan. 3, 2018, Ukraine’s central state arms company, UkrOboronProm, or UOP, announced it had delivered the initial batch of WAC-47s to unspecified units by way of American firm Aeroscraft . Ukrainian officials first revealed plans to purchase the rifles in January 2017 and the country expects to eventually issue the guns across both its active and reserve military units and to personnel in other state security services. It would be an important upgrade for these organizations, which use dated variants of the legendary Kalashnikov AKM pattern as their primary service rifles at present. “The first batch of WAC-47 … will go into trial operation in the combat units of Ukrainian army,” UOP said in an earlier press release about the project in October 2017. “Gathering feedback from Ukrainian soldiers will enhance necessary changes before mass production starts.” UOP said it delivered these trial guns in a carbine configuration, known specifically as the M4-WAC-47. These weapons appeared to have 16-inch long barrels, though, unlike the 14.5-inch barrels on standard U.S. military M4s . The trade-off is always that a weapon with a shorter barrel might be handier, particularly for troops who have to get in and out of aircraft and other vehicles or otherwise operate in confined spaces, but it will also be less accurate, especially at longer ranges. The guns do appear to share the same basic operating mechanism as their American cousins, though. This so-called “ direct impingement ” system siphons propellant gas from the barrel as the gun fires to directly cycle the action. Both the AKMs and some newer derivatives of the M16 pattern use a physical piston, which helps keep particulate matter from building up on critical components and causing the weapon to jam. As such, the new M4-WAC-47s weapons will require more cleaning and routine maintenance than Ukrainian troops are likely used to with the notably simpler AKM-pattern guns. This will almost certainly require changes in training regimens and standard operating procedures to make sure Ukrainian troops take care of the new guns properly. A lack of understanding about the M16’s cleaning and maintenance requirements, coupled with inaccurate sales pitches, poor quality control, and a change in the formulation of the gunpowder inside the cartridges, turned into an infamous scandal when U.S. troops in Vietnam first began to receive significant quantities of the rifles in the 1960s. The M4-WAC-47s also have the same style of controls, such as the charging handle, fire selector, and magazine release, as M16 pattern firearms. Photos of the prototype rifles show them with handguards featuring both U.S. military standard accessory rails and additional attachment points using American manufacturer Magpul’s M-LOK system . The rifles also had pistol grips and retractable buttstocks from Magpul. A Ukrainian soldier poses with an AKMS rifle, the a version of the standard AKM with a folding stock., Ukraine MoD Older AKM-based designs have notably limited space for installing similar systems so a user can rapidly attach grenade launchers, optics, laser aiming devices, flashlights, and other accessories. As such, the M4-WAC-47 could quickly offer Ukrainian troops additional capabilities with a minimum of effort, but only as long as the government in Kiev also purchases sufficient numbers of those ancillary systems. The most significant feature, though, is that the M4-WAC-47 uses the aforementioned 7.62x39mm cartridge. Most military M16 pattern weapons typically chamber the smaller 5.56x45mm round . A M4-WAC-47 with a non-magnifying optic and a 40mm grenade launcher., UkrOboronProm That’s not to say this type of caliber conversion – which can be as simple as adding a new barrel, bolt and carrier assembly, and magazine – is new. The ubiquity of the Soviet-developed cartridge, its heavier bullet, and the popularity of the M16 pattern design have long made the idea of such a combination attractive, particularly to civilian shooters. In the early 2000s, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) also expressed an interest in the idea. The underlying concept was that American special operators might end up conducting extended missions in areas with limited support where it might be easier to source 7.62x39mm ammunition. It would also improve their ability to work closely with local forces armed with AKMs or other similar guns chambered in that round, something American special operators had done extensively in the opening phases of the war in Afghanistan. Since the Vietnam War , special operations forces, advisers, and even regular troops have often just carried AK type rifles they had captured or otherwise acquired for a variety of reasons, too. SOCOM subsequently crafted a requirement for a weapon that its personnel could easily convert from one caliber to another, known as the Special Operations Forces Combat Rifle, or SCR. One of the firms who submitted designs was Knight’s Armament Company, which crafted an M4 carbine derivative known as the SR-47 , which not only used the larger cartridge, but would accept standard AKM magazines. The Knight’s Armament Company SR-47., Knight’s Armament Company In the end, SOCOM decided that the ability to use locally sourced or captured ammunition wasn’t important enough to warrant the cost and effort of buying and issuing dedicated weapons or even conversion kits. The follow-on program, known as the Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, dropped the 7.62x39mm requirement. Belgian manufacturer FN Herstal ultimately won that competition with a design entirely separate from the M16 pattern. Other manufacturers continued to experiment with and produce M16s chambered in the cartridge, though. At present, there are more than a half a dozen different types commercially available in the United States either as complete rifles or conversion kits. One of the more recent of these is Colt’s Model CK901, an M4 derivative it reportedly developed specifically at the request of the government of Yemen before it collapsed in 2014. The “CK” in this instance stands for “Colt Kalashnikov,” a reference to the AK-series, as the gun not only uses the same round, but also the same magazines, as with the SR-47. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UyhvWiesEMs UOP said it was this relative modularity that led it to choose the M16 pattern in the first place. The company’s past statements suggest it is also considering building a host of different versions with various barrel lengths, including a 10.5-inch super-compact type and a 24-inch marksman variant , and in additional calibers. The plan is to eventually drop 7.62x39mm entirely and adopt the NATO standard 5.56x45mm. Though Ukraine isn’t part of the alliance, it regularly trains with other countries that are and has deployed troops in support of the bloc’s missions, such as its operation in Afghanistan . In 2009, Ukrainian authorities also agreed to form a combined brigade with Lithuanian and Polish troops, both NATO members, ostensibly to cross train for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Ukrainian troops stand at attention along with personnel from Lithuania and Poland during a ceremony relating to the combined Lithuanian–Polish–Ukrainian Brigade in 2013., Ukraine MoD According to UOP, having M16 pattern weapons will ease in the overall transition to NATO-standard ammunition, weapons, and other equipment. As stocks of 7.62x39mm ammunition run out and troops send their guns in for routine armorer- or depot-level maintenance, technicians would swap out the appropriate parts and return them in a 5.56mm configuration. The Ukrainian military could use the same procedure to retire the smaller Soviet-developed 5.45x39mm cartridge, which it also uses to a lesser degree. But for Ukraine, the WAC-47’s potential multi-caliber nature is inherently political, as well. UOP makes it clear that the new guns are as much about modernizing their military as they are about cutting away the last links to the old Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. A 5.56x45mm WAC-47 variant., UkrOboronProm Ukraine and Russia have been embroiled in a serious conflict since 2014, when the Kremlin seized the Crimea region and began actively supporting separatists seeking to break away from the government in Kiev. This all followed a popular political uprising that ousted Ukraine’s previous Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Though the two countries are not openly at war, by all accounts Russian troops have been actively engaged in fighting with Ukrainian troops on Ukrainian soil as part of a complex, hybrid war . “For our country and the Ukrainian army, M16 production in Ukraine is a real step towards Euro-Atlantic structures,” UOP said in the October 2017 statement. “Every country that has teared [sic] itself away from Russia’s orbit, went or is going through this difficult stage, [is] taking many years and demanding great effort.” Another view of the 7.62x39mm M4-WAC-47 and its caliber-specific magazines., UkrOboronProm Underscoring these statements is UOP’s partnership with Aeroscraft , a division of Worldwide Aeros Corporation. The firm’s main business is lighter-than-air craft, such as blimps and tethered aerostats. Igor Pasternak, who grew up in Soviet Kazakhstan, first founded Aeros Limited in Soviet Ukraine in 1986, becoming one of the Soviet Union’s first private engineering firms to appear under Premier Mikhail Gorbachev’s Perestroika reforms, according to his company’s website . Pasternak subsequently immigrated to the United States in 1993 and has steadily become an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his policies, especially with regards to Ukraine. Igor Pasternak., Aeroscraft In 2016, Worldwide Aeroscraft signed a separate deal with the Ukrainian border guard to supply unspecified surveillance equipment. At the time, Pasternak said this contract was part of the U.S. government’s larger program to provide non-lethal military aid to Ukraine. In December 2017, President Donald Trump’s administration approved a commercial license for the sale of Barrett M107A1 .50 caliber sniper rifles to Ukraine, which seemed to indicate a departure from the policies of President Barack Obama. It’s not clear if this was necessarily the case, though. That month there was a separate report that Texas-based AirTronic USA had quietly secured similar approval for the delivery of a number of its Precision Shoulder-fired Rocket Launchers, or PSRL , an upgraded version of the Soviet RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher, to Ukraine in 2016. If Aeroscraft has actually produced any version of WAC-47 in the United States it would have needed a similar waiver to actually deliver them to Ukrainian troops. Though Trump has often called for better relations with Russia , there is no indication he would’ve necessarily been inclined to block this particular sale or any future ones. An M4-WAC-47, at left, on display next to a Hopak rifle, a suppressed, special purpose AKM derivative, at booth at the 2017 Association of the US Army conference. , Joseph Trevithick The administration has gone back and forth in its tone toward the Kremlin, sometimes criticizing its involvement in conflicts in Ukraine and Syria , its potential support for insurgents in Afghanistan, its intransigence over North Korea , and its aggressive foreign policy . In December 2017, there were reports that Trump was considering a larger lethal arms package for Ukrainian forces that would notably include Javelin anti-tank missiles to help counter Russian armored units in the country. If nothing else, the guns will be an important upgrade over the older AKM types. One can see the M4-WAC-47s as a larger metaphor for shifting American policies toward the conflict in Ukraine and the Ukrainian government’s own desire to develop even closer ties to the United States and Western Europe.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2018",USAF Official in Charge of A-10s Says Re-Wing Program Is “Not Going to Happen”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The top civilian in charge of the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Warthog program has reportedly told other service officials that a critical re-wing program for the aircraft will almost certainly remain incomplete, which means more than a third of the total A-10 fleet will end up grounded or sent to the bone yard for good. If true, this would be just the latest in a long string of efforts to deliberately hobble the fleet and force the type into retirement . On Jan. 17, 2018, the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) reported that Todd Mathes, the A-10 Program Element Manager for Air Combat Command, the Air Force’s top warfighting command, had made the service’s position clear at a routine review meeting. Individuals in the room had disclosed the remarks to the private organization, which advocates for various reforms within the U.S. military, on the condition of anonymity, apparently fearing retaliation for speaking out about the plan. They no doubt remembered how now retired Air Force Major General James Post implied to his subordinates in December 2014 that offering support for the Warthog in public or in letters to their representatives in Congress was tantamount to treason . Todd Mathes stressed that a rebooted re-wing program for the Warthogs “was not going to happen,” the anonymous individuals told POGO. This in turn would allow the Air Force to eliminate three A-10 squadrons, reducing the total number from nine to six. This is an idea the service floated in 2017 , only to meet significant resistance from the aircraft’s supporters in Congress. At present, approximately 170 A-10s came off the production line with new, strengthen wings or received them as part of an upgrade program that began in 2007. The update will keep those aircraft airworthy through at least 2030 and many much longer. An A-10 Warthog moves into position behind an aerial refueling tanker during a mission against ISIS terrorists., USAF This leaves another 110 or so aircraft without the improved spans, many of which are fast becoming unsafe to fly. The Air Force originally planned to make sure the entire fleet had the new components, but stopped the project early, blaming budget cuts and caps as a result of the 2011 Budget Control Act, a process more commonly known as sequestration. However, critics called this claim into question since the service itself said it would only save a relatively modest $500 million in doing so – less than the approximate cost of 6 F-35s and around $4.5 million per airframe to keep more than 100 A-10s airworthy. Congress subsequently blocked the service from retiring any Warthogs by law, a major blow to the service’s efforts to retire the Warthogs . In December 2017, testimony from Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, in which she described herself as a “fan” of the Warthog, suggested a change in the service’s general tone on the matter. She seemed to imply that as long as legislators made the appropriate funding available, the service was committed to the re-wing effort. “If that [funding] comes through, we will work on executing that so we can get that line back up so that we can re-wing,” Wilson explained to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Dec. 7, 2017. “I think the amount would be the tooling and the first four or five sets of wings for the A-10.” Mathes comments would seem to contradict these statements, but in response to a query from POGO, the Air Force further clarified that it has no plans at present to continue with the re-wing project beyond the work outlined in defense budget Congress passed for the 2018 fiscal year. This included $103 million to restart production of replacement wings and purchase sets for four aircraft. An A-10 undergoing maintenance at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan in 2013., USAF “The Air Force plans to use the $103 million authorized in the FY18 NDAA to award a contract, establish a new wing production line and produce four additional A-10 wings,” a spokesperson for the service told POGO. “Establishing the production line will enable the Air Force to procure additional wings if the decision is made to do so in future budgets.” “If” is the operative word in that last sentence, though. It is important to note that the Air Force did not include any money for new A-10 wings in its budget request for the 2018 fiscal cycle, instead shunting it into a wish list of “unfunded” projects, putting the onus on Congress to figure out how to pay for it on top of everything else. Boeing, for its part, has disputed the idea that the production line for the new wings has gone completely cold, telling FlightGlobal that it is still in the process of delivering wings as part of the original deal it cut with the Air Force a decade ago. It’s unclear how many units the company is still working on and whether it is still capable of producing some or all of the necessary components. But as we at The War Zone have noted more than once, the exact state of the wing production line and the possibility of future funding may be moot points. The Air Force has already said Warthogs without the new wings would start hitting their maximum allowable fight hours starting in the 2018 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2017. An A-10 lands on a dirt strip at Bicycle Lake Army Airfield at the National Training Center in California during an exercise., USAF Without knowing his exact words, it is possible that Mathes may actually have just been expressing his opinion on this state of affairs with the Warthog fleet. Without having a ready supply of new wings right now , it remains hard to believe that the Air Force will be able to avoid grounding at least some of the A-10s that the service doesn’t already have slated to receive the upgrade, even if only temporarily. This could have a cascading impact on pilot and ground crew proficiency with the Warthogs. In turn, the Air Force might feel it has a stronger case for retiring those particular planes for good and either converting the three squadrons to fly other aircraft or distributing the personnel to other units. If that were to happen, any impetus for completing the re-wing effort would evaporate entirely and Mathes would be right to say that it’s “not going to happen.” Congress, however, is unlikely to agree with this course of action. Legislators have repeatedly blocked the Air Force’s attempts to retire the A-10 absent an adequate replacement and have so far dismissed the service’s assertion that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can take over the Warthog’s missions, instead ordering a fly-off between the two aircraft that could begin later in 2018. A contract technician watch another working on a replacement A-10 wing in 2009., USAF At a certain point, opposition from lawmakers might not matter, though. Congress can block the Air Force from retiring any A-10s forever, but it won’t be able to make jets without the new wings any more airworthy with just the stroke of a pen. Legislators who support keeping the Warthogs on active duty for the foreseeable future appear to face a no-win situation of either agreeing to trimming the fleet or compelling the Air Force to maintain units with aircraft that are increasingly unflyable as the service suffers a growing shortage of pilots . There is significant evidence suggesting that this has been the service’s plan all along in delaying A-10 upgrades in general. In the end, Congress is unlikely to allow the Air Force to retire the Warthogs entirely, but they might not necessarily be able to stop them from sending more than a third of the fleet to the bone yard.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 22, 2019",Watch These Russian Su-30 And Su-34 Jets Do Touch-and-Gos on a Highway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of Russia’s Su-30M2 Flanker fighter jets and Su-34 Fullback fighter-bomber aircraft performed a series of touch-and-gos on a highway, with this reportedly being the first time those two types of aircraft have ever done so. Su-27 Flankers and Ka-27 Helix helicopters also took part in the exercise Rostov region, which included mock air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, as well as simulated combat search and rescue operations. According to a statement from Russia’s Ministry of Defense, “complex weather conditions” prevented pilots from actually landing and then taking off again, but there were no specific details about the conditions. TV Zvezda , the Russian military’s official outlet, said it is rare for the country’s combat aircraft to practice on roadways during the winter in general. The last such major instance of this type of training occurred during the massive Zapad 2017 drills with Belarus, when Russian Su-27 Flanker and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, as well as Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft, performed similar maneuvers on a stretch of road near the Belorussian capital Minsk. It’s not clear what Russian forces might have done to otherwise prepare the highway for the drills. Military police and local authorities did make sure to close off the area to civilian traffic and personnel erected a number of temporary airfield type markers to help guide the aircraft. One official photograph showed two trucks with large searchlights positioned at one end of the impromptu airstrip, even though the operations took place during the day. Despite these various measures, the Ministry of Defense statement suggests that the exercise planners couldn’t be sure the roadway was safe enough for the jets to try a complete landing run and then take off again or that the pilots were capable of performing the task. While a highway might seem like a perfectly logical improvised runway, it can present serious challenges , especially in bad weather, such as snow and ice. Foreign object debris kicked up from the road surface could be a particularly significant concern to pilots in high-performance jet combat aircraft. Neither the Russian Ministry of Defense nor TV Zvezda gave an official reason for why the units performed the particular maneuvers during the exercise, either. Many countries conduct similar drills, generally with the purpose of preparing pilots to operate from austere or unusual conditions either in foreign countries where established facilities might be limited or in a crisis where friendly bases might be especially vulnerable to attack or otherwise unusable. The Kremlin may feel that being able to operate its combat aircraft from dispersed locations is an increasingly important capability amid simmering tensions with the United States and NATO. Since seizing Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, Russia has found itself more and more at odds with the Western alliance. A Su-34 Fullback comes in for a touch-and-go on a highway during an exercise in Rostov., Russian MoD Moscow’s active support for separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region has led to international censure and economic sanctions from many countries, especially elsewhere in Europe. Rostov province, where this particular touch-and-go exercise occurred, borders eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has embarked on an steadily more revanchist policies, including seeking to expand the country’s influence abroad , building up its military capabilities , and generally taking a more aggressive stance internationally. In turn, there have been numerous tit-for-tat military drills and other incidents between Russian and NATO forces, since 2014, especially in and around the strategic Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions. If nothing else, its the latest indication of the Russian military’s attempts to improve its overall readiness and expand its operational capabilities. Just in 2017, the Kremlin conducted a number of major snap drills , including a large strategic exercise involving the launch of multiple nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. As such, this may be the first time Su-30SMs and Su-34s have tried their hand at even briefly touching down on a highway, but its unlikely to be the last exercise of its kind for Russian pilots.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",US Army Rushes to Add Hundreds of Stinger Missile Teams As Threat of Small Drones Evolves,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the threat of small drones , or swarms thereof , becomes increasingly apparent, the U.S. military as a whole is rushing to add new and improved short-range air defense capabilities . Now, the U.S. Army in planning to add hundreds of teams armed with Stinger missiles to smaller units as it pushes ahead with a broader program to develop new electronic warfare jammers and lasers , as well as more traditional surface-to-air missiles and automatic cannons . Earlier in January 2018, the Army deployed soldiers to Europe to begin training new teams to operate the Stinger shoulder-fired man-portable air defense system. The service plans to reintroduce as many as 600 teams in total to standard, Stryker-mounted, and mechanized infantry companies as part of a larger effort, known as Maneuver Short Range Air Defense, or M-SHORAD, according to the November-December 2017 edition of Fires Bulletin , the Army’s official artillery and air defense professional journal. “Bringing back the Stinger addresses a self-identified gap that the Army created and has recognized,” Lieutenant Colonel Aaron Felter, the Director of Training and Doctrine at the Army’s Air Defense Integrated Office, told Defense News earlier in January 2018. “We’re getting back to the basics and providing short-range air defense to maneuver units.” Attaching Stinger teams to small maneuver units was a typical practice during the latter stages of the Cold War, which came to an end as the threat of enemy air attacks appeared to dissipate in the 1990s, creating a significant and dangerous gap that The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway explored in depth in this past feature . In addition, the Army has taken steps to make the missiles more effective against a wider array of targets, specifically small drones. The service is adding new proximity fuzes, which feature a conformal radar antenna wrapped around the warhead assembly, as it sends old Stingers that have reached the end of their shelf-life back to the depot for overhaul. Interesting details about the Stinger's existing fuze and new proximity one, including the use of a conformal antenna in the latter. pic.twitter.com/pm6k5Rh8jz — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) January 4, 2018 But the extra Stingers are just an interim solution to a growing threat. The Army envisions adding a number of additional systems, including vehicles with electronic warfare suites, lasers, and more conventional missiles and guns, throughout its forces and has been actively evaluating a number of possible options. On Jan. 17, 2018, OrbitalATK, now part of Northrop Grumman, announced it had demonstrated a modified Stryker wheeled armored vehicle with the Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Defense System, or AUDS, as well an XM914 30mm cannon to the Army at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, as part of the latest iteration of the Maneuver Fires Integrated Experiment, or MFIX. The service holds these events regularly to evaluate various types of weapon systems and equipment, with short range air defense has been an increasingly important focus. Those developments also feed into the larger effort, known as Maneuver Short Range Air Defense, or M-SHORAD. OrbitalATK’s Stryker with the AUDS and XM914 cannon., OrbitalATK The Stryker-based system OrbitalATK showed off at MFIX represents two of the main lines of effort in filling that capability gap—directional jammers and rapid-firing automatic cannon. The Army has already sent a pair of the armored vehicles with a similar electronic warfare capability , but no new guns, to Europe for field tests. OrbitalATK’s configuration cues the jammer via an infrared camera and a set of short-range electronically scanned array radar units, all on a telescoping mast on the rear of the vehicle. The crew can also use the sensor suite to aim the remote operated 30mm cannon, which can engage aerial targets with air-bursting ammunition, increasing the probability of a kill. The firm developed the Stryker-mounted system as part of an $8.5 million contract with the Army. It is possible that it could adapt some or all of the equipment to fit on other vehicles, such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle tactical truck or the M1 Abrams tank . Separately, the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor brought one of its M25 25mm grenade launchers to the MFIX event to show how an individual soldier could use that weapon’s airburst capabilities to knock down small drones. The Army has been actively evaluating that system on and off since 2010, but cancelled its official plans to buy any of the launchers in 2017. A 25mm airburst from an M25 grenade launcher round knocks down a small quad-copter type drone during MFIX., OrbitalATK These technology demonstrations aren’t a guarantee that the Army will actually buy any of these systems, though. OrbitalATK had already brought the same vehicle to White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for another M-SHORAD event in September 2017. Boeing, Raytheon, and South Korea’s Hanwha all brought their own offerings, all of which were on display at the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual conference the next month. Boeing’s system is also Stryker-based, but features a larger, multi-purpose turret at the rear, which can fire Stinger, Hellfire Longbow, and Sidewinder missiles. At White Sands, the vehicle fired the millimeter wave radar-guided Hellfire Longbow at both small fixed wing drones and remote-controlled Humvees. Raytheon, in cooperation with Israel’s Rafael demonstrated a truck-mounted version of the much-touted Iron Dome counter-rockets, artillery, and mortars (C-RAM) system, demonstrating the interceptor’s capabilities against unmanned aerial vehicles. Hanwha’s Hybrid Biho is a much more conventional mobile short-range air defense system that combines a turret with two 30mm cannons, four Singung short-range surface-to-air missiles, and a mechanically-scanned fire control radar with a tracked chassis the company derived from its K200 armored personnel carrier. It’s not clear when new short-range air defense systems might reach soldiers in the field, either, though the Army has clearly acknowledged that there is a serious need for this capability already. A series of mass drone attacks against Russian forces in Syria have only underscored the reality of this emerging threat. But it’s not just terrorists and insurgents that will be making use of small drones. Potential near-peer opponents, such as Russia and China , are steadily improving their capabilities, including the ability to operate small groups of unmanned aircraft in autonomous or semi-autonomous swarms. In the November-December 2017 issue of Fires Bulletin , Brigadier General McIntire specifically highlighted the danger of unmanned aircraft serving as scouts and spotters for enemy artillery and air strikes. He specifically highlighted Russia’s tactics Ukraine, which also involve electronic warfare and other assets, something the Army has dubbed Russian New Generation Warfare . “Low, slow, and small UASs [unmanned aerial systems], in particular, present considerable threats to maneuver forces and are difficult to detect and defend against by maneuver units,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Randall McIntire, commandant of the Army’s Air Defense Artillery School at Fort Sill, wrote in the November-December 2017 edition of Fires Bulletin . “Without such [short range air defense] capabilities, maneuver formations are exposed to potentially continuous surveillance by threat UASs and subsequent devastating attacks by fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and artillery.” A Russian Eleron-3SV tactical drone , one of many the country has fielded in recent years., Vitaly Kuzmin The service has also cited the Russo-Ukrainian conflict as a driving force behind its decision to immediately start reintegrating Stinger teams into smaller units. With both sides using small drones, man-portable surface-to-air missiles have been an important weapon for Russian-backed separatists , as well as Ukraine’s own troops . As such, “the immediate focus is Europe and getting Europe ready to fight tonight and defend Europe against any adversary,” Lieutenant Colonel Felter told Defense News. “The goal is to get 62 Stinger teams into the operational force as soon as possible.” The simmering conflict in Ukraine, which began after Russia seized the Crimea region in 2014, has prompted a significant change in the U.S. military’s posture, as well as that of its European allies . In addition to new air defense systems, American troops in Germany recently received up-gunned Strykers with a 30mm cannon turrets, as well as versions with mounted Javelin anti-tank missiles, to give units them more fire power against a near-peer opponent, such as Russia, with larger armored and mechanized formations. The problem, as we at The War Zone have repeatedly highlighted , though, is that many of the available countermeasures are best suited to counter individual small drones and similar aerial threats, not defeat complex swarms of unmanned aircraft. The Russian experience in Syria has already shown how even a small number of home built aircraft can breach multi-layered defenses that include traditional air defense radars, short-range air defense systems, and electronic warfare assets. The two experimental Strykers with counter-drone systems during field tests in Europe in 2017., US Army Many Advanced technologies, such as lasers and directional jammers, have similar limitations, being able to generally focus only on one target at a time. Broadband electronic warfare systems could offer wider protection, but might knock out friendly emitters in the process, effectively shutting down vital sensors, communication nodes, or other equipment right in the middle of an attack. Our own Tyler Rogoway has posited more than once that the only real defense against an enemy swarm might be a friendly, writing previously : “Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky – a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots.” However the Army decides to proceed with the M-SHORAD effort, it’s working on a truncated timetable, though. The threats of unmanned aircraft and drone swarms are already rapidly evolving. In the space of just a year, non-state actors in the Middle East went from sending individual commercial quad- and hex-copter type drones with improvised munitions to harass state security forces to launching mass attacks using autonomous, GPS-guided unmanned aircraft. Nation states are steadily making their own advances in these areas, too. With the gap between its existing defenses and these potential threats already expanding, the Army cannot afford to wait too much longer to introduce new weapons and other countermeasures.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 30, 2019",US Navy To Charge Ex-Destroyer Commanders With Negligent Homicide Over Deadly Collisions (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The US Navy says it will charge the former commanding officers of the Arleigh Burke -class destroyers USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain with negligent homicide, among other charges, in relation to a pair of deadly collisions in 2017. Other individuals involved in those incidents face courts-martials and non-judicial punishments after a damning report concluded that serious breakdowns in leadership, along with other serious issues, were directly responsible for the mishaps. USNI News was first to report on the charges against U.S. Navy Commanders Bryce Benson and Alfredo J. Sanchez, who were in charge of Fitzgerald and John McCain respectively, on Jan. 16, 2018. Both men face a number of charges that include negligent homicide and dereliction of duty, unnamed sources told USNI News. Navy leadership had already relieved the two officers of their commands after the mishaps. In June 2017, Fitzgerald collided with the container ship M/V ACX Crystal off the coast of Japan. Then, in August 2017, McCain slammed into the chemical tanker M/V Alnic MC as it headed toward Singapore. The two incidents together resulted in the deaths of 17 sailors. A subsequent Navy investigation revealed officers, senior sailors, and watch standers aboard both ships had violated a host of rules and regulations and ignored basic seafaring conventions in the run up to the accidents. The report, which we at The War Zone previously analyzed in depth here , also highlighted poor training and readiness standards, dangerously low morale , and other systemic issues across the service. An unnamed petty officer from the McCain will also face a charge of dereliction of duty and Benson and Sanchez are expected to have their preliminary hearings soon, according to USNI News. The Navy confirmed that there were pending charges, but would would not officially comment on them. US Navy file photos of Commander Bryce Benson, left, and and Commander Alfredo J. Sanchez, right., USN Other officers and sailors face non-judicial punishments, as well. In addition to firing the former commanding officers of the destroyers, the Navy has also relieved the head of the Destroyer Squadron 15, the commander of the Seventh Fleet’s Task Force 70, and the Seventh Fleet’s top officer. All of those organizations are forward deployed in Japan . The Navy also removed the head of Naval Surface Forces from his post ahead of his scheduled retirement and the commander of US Pacific Fleet will also separate from the service early. The two deadly accidents, along with a string of other mishaps, has forced the Navy to do some serious soul searching in general. US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson and Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer will appear before the House Armed Services Committee on Jan. 18, 2018 to give a public report on two separate investigations into the service’s readiness. Both men will almost certainly face questions about how they plan to rectify the situation. In turn, the Navy’s highest uniformed and civilian leaders are likely to raise concerns about continually uncertain budgets that make long term planning almost impossible. American legislators are already in the midst of tense negotiations on other issues ahead of a possible government shutdown on Jan. 20, 2018, when funds from the last the latest short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, run out.

UPDATE : The US Navy’s Chief of Information (Acting), Captain Greg Hicks, has now released an official statement on pending charges relating to the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain collisions, which is as follows: “On 30 October 2017, Admiral William Moran, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, designated Admiral Frank Caldwell as the Consolidated Disposition Authority to review the accountability actions taken to date in relation to USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) and USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) collisions and to take additional administrative or disciplinary actions as appropriate. “After careful deliberation, today Admiral Frank Caldwell announced that Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) charges are being preferred against individual service members in relation to the collisions. “USS Fitzgerald: Courts-martial proceedings/Article 32 hearings are being convened to review evidence supporting possible criminal charges against Fitzgerald members. The members’ ranks include one Commander (the Commanding Officer), two Lieutenants, and one Lieutenant Junior Grade. The charges include dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel, and negligent homicide. “USS John S. McCain: Additionally, for John S. McCain, one court- martial proceeding/Article 32 hearing is being convened to review evidence supporting possible criminal charges against one Commander (the Commanding Officer). The charges include dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel, and negligent homicide. Also, one charge of dereliction of duty was preferred and is pending referral to a forum for a Chief Petty Officer. “The announcement of an Article 32 hearing and referral to a court-martial is not intended to and does not reflect a determination of guilt or innocence related to any offenses. All individuals alleged to have committed misconduct are entitled to a presumption of innocence. “Additional administrative actions are being conducted for members of both crews including non-judicial punishment for four Fitzgerald and four John S. McCain crewmembers. “Information regarding further actions, if warranted, will be discussed at the appropriate time.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Law Enforcement News & Features"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The US Coast Guard Wants Its Own Prison Ship to Hold Suspected Drug Smugglers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Coast Guard’s top officer says his service doesn’t have any good ways to temporarily hold the drug traffickers and other smugglers it arrests at sea until it can get them to detention centers ashore. So, Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft is looking for a solution, including one particularly novel and likely controversial idea: hire contractors to operate a dedicated prison ship. Zukunft disclosed that he was considering the plan in an interview with Military.com in December 2017 that the outlet published on Jan. 16, 2018. At the time, the specifics of the proposal seemed to be in the formative stage, with the admiral saying his service might ask for the Pentagon to manage such a vessel or do so by way of U.S. Southern Command , which is in charge of American military operations across Latin America and the Caribbean. There were no formal requirements for the ship itself, either, but it was clear the Coast Guard felt the existing situation was increasingly untenable. “We’re spending about a third of our ship time right now moving these detainees from one ship to another to provide them the best creature comforts at sea until we can land them in Panama, which is the only country right now that will accept detainees for further transport back to the United States,” Zukunft told Military.com. A dedicated prison ship “might have better accommodations than we have on ships with flight decks and helicopter hangars to at least get people out of the elements,” he added. The main logistical issue appears to be a combination of how the United States processes individuals the Coast Guard detains and that traffickers have steadily shifted from smuggling drugs and other illicit cargoes through the Caribbean to running operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean . The latter area is far less congested, giving criminals more room to maneuver and avoid detection. A US Coast Guard Medium Endurance Cutter sails near a captured low profile vessel in the Eastern Pacific Ocean belonging to suspected drug smugglers in October 2017., USCG As Zukunft noted, the only third party country where the Coast Guard can deposit individuals it detains in the Pacific is Panama. Other assets would then move them to the United States for prosecution in civilian courts. Otherwise, his cutters have to sail through the Panama Canal to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. In 2017, the service arrested more than 700 suspected smugglers. A prison ship could provide a more purposeful method of transporting detainees from one point to another and streamline the process as a whole. Zukunft told Military.com that one possible starting place would be an offshore or platform supply vessel , a type of vessel that normally supports off-shore oil and gas operations. This would make sense, since these ships are already configured to carry passengers to and from locations at sea. Below is a video describing the more typical missions of offshore supply vessels: https://youtube.com/watch?v=PJ4t-BpJceQ A civilian operator would have to modify those accommodations for prisoners, which would likely include added precautions to prevent their escape and closed circuit monitoring systems throughout the ship. Zukunft said that Coast Guard law enforcement augmenteess, which the service already deploys on board U.S. Navy ships for counter-drug missions, would actually be in charge of this improvised afloat detention facility. Another possibility might be to refurbish an appropriately sized ship from the U.S. Navy’s mothballed reserve fleets , which include a variety of older logistics vessels. A contract civilian or hybrid civilian-military crew could then operate the reactivated vessel. Neither option would necessarily be unprecedented. The U.S. military routinely hires private companies to provide specialized ships for logistics and training missions, as well as actual military operations overseas . Military Sealift Command already uses crews made up of uniformed personnel and merchant mariners to operate its own logistics and special purpose fleets . The U.S. Navy also recently considered reactivating Oliver Hazard Perry -class frigates with limited mission systems for counter-drug missions in particular. Prison ships or the use of mothballed hulls or barges to house prisoners are hardly new ideas, either. New York City Department of Correction operates the largest such floating facility in the United States, the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center , a barge on Long Island Sound that operates in conjunction with the Rikers Island jail. Having a roving afloat jail would be a unique take on the concept, though. The Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center barge., Reivax via Wikimedia But as Zukunft noted, having the floating jail would also free up his service’s already limited resources from prisoner transport duties, which can only get in the way of important law enforcement and life-saving missions. The Coast Guard’s area command for the entire Pacific Ocean , which oversees operations around Alaska and American possessions in the Western Pacific and the service’s activities in Japan and Singapore, has some 15 high and medium endurance cutters in total. Just three of these are the more modern Legend -class National Security Cutters , which began primarily replacing the 1960s-era Hamilton -class in 2008. There are still four Hamiltons on active duty, though, the youngest of which has been in service since 1972. The Coast Guard itself occupies a curious position of being a uniformed military service within the Department of Homeland Security, having previously been part of the Department of the Treasury and then the Department of Transportation. This bureaucratic limbo has long translated into budget difficulties . It helps explain why Zukunft is already thinking he might have to beg the Pentagon for help in implementing his plan. Even if the U.S. military does come through with the ship, the plan might prove too legally complicated and otherwise controversial to work, though. The Coast Guard Commandant said he was looking seriously at the idea in part because of an exposé The New York Times published in November 2017 that detailed squalid conditions for detainees in transit. “Go below deck and look at where my crew is berthing,” Zukunft complained to Military.com, referring to the state of his service’s ships in general. “The living conditions in any prison system in the United States [are] better than the berthing areas in my 52-year-old ships. We are operating out of prisons.” But more importantly, per The Times report, the Coast Guard already has to routinely secure waivers from federal judges extending the time it can hold detainees without charge. This in turn led one anonymous former lawyer for the service to describe cutters as “floating Guantanamos,” a reference to the U.S. military’s extremely controversial terrorist detention facility attached to the U.S. Navy’s base in Cuba. The USCGC Midgett , the youngest of its remaining Hamilton -class cutters., USCG The Coast Guard has secured those legal opinions based on the argument that it lacks the means to get alleged criminals into a court room any faster. It might have trouble making that case if it decides to manage a dedicated prison ship with the stated purpose of keeping detainees in lockup for protracted periods of time. This in turn could also open up the service to costly legal action from civil rights groups and other activist organizations. If nothing else, the idea of the U.S. government effectively running a floating jail in international waters could easily prove to be an oversight and public relations nightmare. “We can’t lose sight of the fact that these individuals who were detained, they’re peddling poison,” Zukunft stressed to Military.com. “These aren’t just down-on-their-luck fishermen; they have a choice. You can either fish, or you can be a criminal.” Still, the commandant may find support for his plan among President Donald Trump and his administration, which has taken a hard line stance toward immigration and border security. Trump himself has often cited illegal drugs as an especially important reason for those revised policies. President Donald Trump, along with First Lady Melania Trump, left, and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, right, meets with members of the US Coast Guard in September 2017., DHS The current ad hoc practice of dispatching the Coast Guard’s limited number of cutters to move prisoners around rather than perform their primary missions seems unsustainable in the long run, though. That Zukunft is considering the idea a prison ship at all suggests he might see it as among the least worst option for freeing up the service’s personnel for their core missions of protecting America’s borders, guarding its maritime interests, and being on call to save lives at sea.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 4, 2019",China Is Hard At Work Developing Swarms Of Small Drones With Big Military Applications,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A mass drone attack on Russian forces in Syria has highlighted the very real danger that small unmanned aircraft increasingly pose, even in the hands of non-state groups. At the same time, it underscores how small drone swarms could be a game-changing capability for larger nation states, including the United States’ near-peer opponents, such as China, who are already developing this technology in more structured environments. In December 2017, researchers from the Chinese state National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), more formally known as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) National University of Defense Science and Technology, conducted an experiment involving approximately two dozen of small fixed wing unmanned aircraft. An official PLA publication said that the test consisted of the entire group of drones acting as a swarm to complete a simulated reconnaissance mission, according to the East Pendulum blog . The individual aircraft operated together as a single entity and performed certain, unspecified portions of the flight autonomously. “The team has been working for nine months on the preparation of this swarm test, sometimes we have to do a hundred test flights a day,” Professor Shen Lin Cheng, the Chair NUDT’s Institute of Artificial Intelligence Sciences and former head of its Institute of Electro-mechanical Engineering and Automation, said. “We have precise short, medium and long term objectives, which are consistent with those set by the government on the modernization of the Chinese armed forces by 2020, 2035 and 2050.” The December 2017 flight test followed an earlier experiment two months earlier that involved an unknown, but reportedly smaller total number of drones. These two events may have also included a number of small quad-copter style unmanned aircraft, which NUDT has also been working with. In June 2017, the state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, or CETC, conducted its own record-breaking swarm experiment with nearly 120 unmanned fixed wing aircraft, as well. This event included simulated missions where the entire formation acted as a whole and instances where smaller groups broke away to complete separate objectives. The specific objectives of the NUDTs drone swarm experiments are unclear, as are those related to the CETC’s tests, but it seems almost certain that it is foundational research to see what small unmanned aircraft can and can’t do as a single entity within the limits of existing technology. The U.S. military is also engaged in a host of similar technology demonstration efforts regarding drone swarms . This low-quality screengrab from Hunan Television shows the routes for the NUDT drone swarm during the test in December 2017., Hunan Television via East Pendulum The NUDT’s latest experiment looks very similar in concept to the U.S. Department of Defense’s Strategic Capabilities Office’s tests with Perdix , a miniature air-dropped unmanned aircraft, and the U.S. Navy’s Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology project, which used Raytheon’s Coyote , another small fixed-wing drone. Both of these efforts focused as much on the software, which allowed the swarms to respond in unison to commands and operate autonomously based on pre-programmed instructions, all while avoiding running into each other, as the hardware itself. Small groups of networked drones could significantly change how military forces operate in the future. Our own Tyler Rogoway explained some potential scenarios in a feature last year on the need for new short-range air defenses, or SHORAD systems, writing : “Being networked together, and being autonomous in nature after being loaded with a target area location, along with other mission parameters, these swarms will be extremely hard to defend against using even the best SHORAD systems in development today. It’s the saturation nature of the attack, the size of the attackers, and the fact that they work as a coordinated swarm, employing dynamic tactics to see as many in their company survive long enough to make their suicidal attack, that make them so deadly. They could even drop micro-munitions and be reused for a later attack. Just the knowledge that such an attack is possible would be psychologically stressful and demoralizing for troops on the ground. Similar swarming strikes could be unleashed behind the front lines as well, with hugely expensive and low density/high demand combat aircraft being especially vulnerable to this sort of tactic—something General James Holmes alluded to inadvertently while speaking to the Air Force Association, stating: “Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.” “Actually, it would be even easier to just strike the jets as they sit idle and vulnerable on the flight line. One swarm could see a whole squadron of tightly packed fighters destroyed without even having a chance to fight back.” Future swarms of small drones might also be able to carry electronic warfare jammers , emitters that mimic the signals of larger aircraft , equipment capable of conducting cyber attacks , or other systems to confuse or overwhelm an opponent’s defenses ahead of or during a more complex operation. A swarm of drones with small electro-optical or infrared cameras might be able to rapidly search a broad area for targets of interest discreetly and, with miniaturized data links, feed this information to other aircraft or other assets where it can be fused and exploited, giving their friendly force a more complete view of the battlefield and any potential hazards or targets of opportunity. Even a swarm of small drones each with different modular capabilities installed could potentially conduct a broad array of tasks at once and in a resilient manner. Navigation system carrying types could help guide armed versions over long distances. Some armed variants could be capable of homing in on certain types of radiation—like radar emitters, air defense nodes, or even individual communications devices, while others can be capable of attacking prescribed targets that visually match images in their memory database. In this way, developments may be able to reduce the overall size and complexity of the basic underlying aircraft. This is an especially important consideration since the cost of launching dozens, or even hundreds of drones, could otherwise become prohibitive quite quickly, especially if the user doesn’t expect some or even all of them to necessarily survive. The video below shows an earlier CETC drone swarm test in 2016. https://youtube.com/watch?v=p1eWmE3draU Systems that are ostensibly for scientific research purposes, but that have sensors designed to monitor visual or other changes across a wide area could easily have military applications , too, acting as early warning nets or helping guard borders. According to East Pendulum, Chinese research agencies and institutions have published at least a dozen public studies regarding drones working in unison, including on land and at sea, as well as in the air, but not all for explicitly military applications. China is surely doing more work on the potential uses of drone swarms in more classified settings. Whatever the goals and state of China’s drone swarms developments are, the potential threats are definitely real and rapidly evolving. Militants in Iraq and Syria, including ISIS, have already shown what they can do with limited resources and facilities. Between January and December 2017, these groups went from conducting very limited attacks using individual commercial type drones with improvised munitions to a mass attack using a home brew autonomous design with GPS guidance. Two of the improvised armed drones Syrian militants used in a mass attack on Russian forces earlier in January 2018, highlighting the increasing sophistication of even home-built designs., Russian MoD Writing about the incidents in Syria, Tyler Rogoway noted that we should expect more advanced nation states to produce even more threatening swarm technologies, writing : “But regardless of the direct implications this new tactic has on Russia’s Syrian operation, it does give us our first glimpses of a new age in modern warfare – one where dense swarms of low-cost drones armed with high-explosives will be able to wreak havoc on targets. Russian defenses, and those of other countries for that matter, may be able to fend off a handful of these improvised drones executing a very loosely coordinated attack, but a near peer-state competitor could field a much denser, more nimble, adaptable, and networked force. And as we have mentioned before, there is no known kinetic defense to counter such an attack.” On top of that, future parallel developments in artificial intelligence could help intelligence analysts more readily parse large amounts of data from many individual sources, like from a localized swarm, making the prospect of distributed wide-area persistent monitoring, especially from the air, more manageable in general and speeding up the process of getting that information into the hands of the individuals who need it the most. The United States is already conducting tests of one such system to help U.S. military personnel sift through visual imagery. Chinese authorities are reportedly turning the country’s western Xinjiang province into a dystopian laboratory to test even more extreme methods of artificial intelligence-driven intelligence collection and persistent monitoring in order to help maintain control. Members of the region’s predominantly Muslim Uighur population , a Turkic ethnic group, has often been critical of Han Chinese rule, either as peaceful activists or members of international terrorist groups . The video below shows how China is harnessing artificial intelligence to rapidly sift through surveillance imagery. And at least at present, all of this technology is evolving faster than countermeasures can keep up , too. Directional jammers and solid-state lasers , as well as other ultra-short range defenses , are generally best for disabling or destroying one target at a time rather than a whole group of small drones simultaneously. Omnidirectional jamming equipment could just as easily disable friendly tactical drones using the same frequencies or other communications and surveillance systems as the incoming enemy. As the Russians found out in Syria earlier in January 2018, a combination of traditional short-range air defense and electronic warfare systems is not enough to guarantee the destruction of all the drones in even a modestly sized swarm. We at the War Zone have been warning about this emerging threat for some time, and Tyler Rogoway has posited on more than one occasion that the only defense against small swarms may be a friendly one, noting : “Maybe wide-area electronic warfare could help counter such a threat, at least to some degree. But clearly the best defense of all is to not let the enemy get close enough to launch such an onslaught in the first place. But this is a tough proposition when it comes to defense from such an attack in friendly areas or behind the lines, where even the fastest fighter jets sit stationary on flightlines, the coordinates of which are readily available on Google Earth. “Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots.” Though the technology is still in an experimental stage, the Chinese military is clearly looking forward to a future full of deadly small drone swarms.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 21, 2019",Turkey Wants to Link Its F-35 Computer Brains to Networks That Will Include Russian Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Turkish military says it wants to make sure there is a secure link between its future F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and the Turkish Air Force’s main computer networks that will prevent the inadvertent sharing of classified information. This comes as many of the countries involved in the international stealth fighter program increasingly worry about the security of the jet’s main data transfer setup and as the United States expresses concern about Turkey’s growing ties with Russia . Earlier in January 2018, Turkey’s Undersecretariat for Defense Industries, the country’s top military procurement arm, also known by its Turkish acronym SSM, launched a competition to buy the necessary equipment and software to connect the F-35s to the rest of the Air Force’s systems, Defense News reported . SSM’s cybersecurity and electronic warfare division is in charge of the project and is asking for anyone interested in submitting a bid to do so by the end of February 2018. “The program involves safe connection of information systems elements between the F-35 aircraft and the Air Forces’ information systems network as well as safe sharing of classified information between these systems,” SSM said, according to Defense News. “The political idea is to earn as much indigenous software space as possible while at the same time remaining within the [JSF] program,” an anonymous source also told the outlet. Though it’s not entirely clear from the report, the goal of the Turkish effort seems to be gain more control over what information goes into and comes out of its F-35s, improving its ability to share information across the country’s air force. This is particularly important given the Joint Strike Fighter’s sensors’ ability to vacuum up important information , especially about electronic emitters such as enemy radars. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF Being able to rapidly move that data around a variety of networks would give pilots in aircraft with less capable radars and other sensors a significantly improved view of the battlefield during missions, as well as allowing commanders to better plan future missions. Finding ways to link the F-35, especially using its stealthy Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), to fourth generation aircraft has been a major goal for the U.S. military services flying the jets, as well. Joint Strike Fighters have coordinated with older planes using the non-stealthy Link-16 data link during past exercises . There is also a concern that without a filter, the Joint Strike Fighter’s cloud-based computer brain, the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), might automatically send sensitive data to the United States or other partners in the program, or to the manufacturer Lockheed Martin. ALIS’s main job is to collect data on the jets’ figurative health, but monitoring information from various sensors about parts that are in need of routine maintenance or may be likely to fail for some other reason. Ground crews download these details from the aircraft via a secure laptop and then upload them into a larger system that, at least in theory , is supposed to help streamline the maintenance process and identify points of concern in need of improvement or upgrades in the future. On top of that, though, it’s how Lockheed Martin plans to release software patches for the jets. Most importantly, the system acts as the load point for mission data packages, containing route plans, locations of potential threats and hazards, and other similar information. Many of the countries involved in the Joint Strike Fighter Program are increasingly fearful that ALIS might be scraping information from those packages during uploading or downloading of other data and that it might end up on the system’s main servers or just be worryingly vulnerable to cyber attacks . Italy and Norway now have a shared software laboratory at the U.S. Air Force’s Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, which is working on a secure filter to prevent any unauthorized transfers. Australia has also expressed interest in its own such firewall. A Norwegian F-35A Joint Strike Fighter at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona for training in 2015., USAF There is also the possibility the United States could use ALIS in the future as an unprecedented export control . It could allow Lockheed Martin, at the direction of the U.S. government, to disconnect a country’s F-35s from vital updates and potentially disrupting the jets’ operational capabilities remotely, if necessary. American authorities might also be able to use the network as a vector for a cyber attack to more completely disable to the aircraft. For Turkey, as with the other countries pursuing national-level solutions to these data sharing and sovereignty issues, the main problem is that they will all still have to use ALIS in the day-to-day operation of their F-35s. So far, only Israel has managed secure the rights from Lockheed Martin to install its own software on the jets that would allow it to operate independently of the company’s cloud-based network. Some Joint Strike Fighter program members may be able to negotiate their own country-specific arrangements with Lockheed Martin with the U.S. government’s blessing. It seems very unlikely that either the Maryland-headquartered defense contractor or U.S. authorities would be willing to extend the same privileges to Turkey, at least in the near term. A member of the US Air Force connects to the F-35’s computer system using a laptop., USAF Relations between Washington and Ankara have steadily cooled since 2014 in light of the U.S. military’s increasing support for Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria in the fight against ISIS. Turkish authorities see the Kurdish People’s Protection Units in Syria, also known by the acronym YPG, in particular as indistinct from the Kurdish Workers’ Party, or PKK, in Turkey. Both the United States and Turkey have designated the PKK as a terrorist group. However, the U.S. government vehemently disagrees that the YPG and PKK are inseparably linked and that the former has plans to seize Turkish territory. The YPG form the core of the Syrian Democratic Forces , the main U.S.-backed force in Syria, which has been instrumental in routing ISIS. Ties between the two countries only deteriorated more in 2016, when Air Force officers attempted to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a coup . Erdoğan and his political allies promptly launched a massive crackdown, arresting tens of thousands of people, and accused the United States of sheltering the man they allege to have been behind the putsch, Fethullah Gülen . It’s worth noting that the U.S. military still keeps a stockpile of approximately 50 B61 nuclear gravity bombs at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, which has increasingly become a separate security issue . But the series of events also led to warming ties between Turkey and Russia, though. In July 2017, Erdoğan confirmed his country would buy the Russian S-400 air defense system , prompting statements of concern both from the United States and the country’s other NATO allies. The eight wheeled 5P85SM2-01 transporter erector launcher, part of the S-400 air defense system. , Vitaly Kuzmin With regards to the F-35, there is a distinct concern that Kremlin may be able to exploit the deal, which will reportedly involve some level of technical cooperation with Turkey’s defense industry, to see how its anti-aircraft system fares against the fifth generation fighter. Russia could then use that information to refine and expand its existing anti-stealth research and development work. There have been similar concerns about plans to add the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to the Joint Strike Fighter program. “We’re going to have to start looking at, if they are going to go through with this [S-400 purchase], how we can be interoperable in the future,” Heidi Grant, Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for International Affairs, told Defense News in November 2017. “But right now, I can tell you our policies do not allow us to be interoperable with that system.” “It’s a significant concern, not only to the United States, because we need to protect this high end technology, fifth-generation technology … [but for] all of our partners and allies that have already purchased the F-35,” she added. Turkish officials have repeatedly said they have no plans to back out of the deal, unlike in 2015 when they cancelled a similar plan to buy Chinese FD-2000 air defense systems in the face of pressure from the United States and NATO. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during a shared press conference in Ankara in December 2017., Evgeny Biyatov/Sputnik  via AP There had already been some calls to block sales of the F-35 to Turkey in 2017 following a incident outside the Turkish embassy in Washington, in which Erdoğan’s personal security detail attacked Kurdish activists peacefully protesting, triggering a brawl and censure from city and U.S. federal authorities . In July 2017, David Cicilline, a Democrat Representative from Rhode Island and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, proposed an amendment in the Fiscal Year 2018 defense budget that would have halted the sale of Joint Strike Fighters to Turkey. This did not make it into the final version of the law. Limiting Turkey’s access to the F-35 program may not be an easy prospect in the future, either, as a result of efforts to incentivize partners to join in the first place. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) is responsible for the construction of portions of the jet’s center fuselage and could service the aircraft’s Pratt and Whitney F135 engine for other NATO operators in the future. In total, 10 different Turkish firms have contributed in some fashion to the project. Any restrictions of Turkish involvement in the program could therefore negatively affect both the construction of jets now and the ability for NATO allies to sustain their own F-35 fleets. At the same time, Turkey has been pursuing an indigenous fifth generation fighter jet, the TFX , in cooperation with BAE Systems in the United Kingdom. A composite of TAI concept art for the proposed TFX fifth generation fighter jet., Mehmet Delice via Wikimedia As such, the Turkish government could conceivably threaten to back out of the Joint Strike Fighter program entirely, and focus on the TFX instead. Of course, this would significantly delay when Turkey’s Air Force would get its first fifth generation fighter jets, given the protracted and expensive development cycles for such aircraft. At present, TAI doesn’t expect to have a flyable prototype until at least 2023 and the quality and capabilities of that aircraft are still very much up in the air. It is doubtful that it will feature as advanced a capability set as the F-35 offers. It would also squander significant existing Turkish investment in the program, including plans to buy at least 100 F-35As. There are also reports that the country’s military might be interested in purchasing a number of short and vertical take-off and landing capable B models. Lockheed Martin says Turkish defense contractors could expect to see a windfall of up to $12 billion from supporting the Joint Strike Fighter project, as well. Though 2017, the U.S. military’s main F-35 Joint Program Office said it had no immediate plans to change its cooperation with Turkey, though they did say there were reviewing the issues at play. With the S-400 deal moving ahead and Turkey now pushing for greater control over how the jets will interact with its other information networks, there may be a greater impetus to study the implications of Turkish policies on the rest of the Joint Strike Fighter program. How the situation plays out could be an important test case for how the F-35 project manages increasing concerns from partner nations about the heavily intertwined nature of both its computer networks and its physical industrial base.

On Jan. 12, 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defense, by way of state media outlets , announced that special operations forces, working together with military intelligence elements, had established the whereabouts of the militants involved in the mass drone attacks in Syria, which occurred on Jan. 5, 2018. The special operators and Russia’s own drones overhead then monitored the site before calling in the precision artillery strike using 152mm Krasnopol guided artillery shells . “When the terrorists arrived at the facility where they were to board a minibus, the whole subversive group was eliminated by the Krasnopol high-precision munition,” the Ministry’s statement said, according to TASS. Separately, “Russian military reconnaissance” located the assembly and storage facility, which the Kremlin’s forces destroyed with another Krasnopol, the statement continued. Below is the video showing the strike against terrorists Russia says were responsible for the mass drone attacks. Both targets were in Syria’s Idlib governorate, where forces opposed to the regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad are largely in control. Depending on where the enemy was situated within the province, the Russians could have had to mount more than just a commando reconnaissance mission into the area in order to carry out the strikes. Below is the video showing the strike against the drone workshop. The howitzer-fired Krasnopol has a effective range of approximately 12 miles, while portable laser designator and targeting system Russian troops typically use in conjunction with the shell has range of less than three and half miles. The firing sequence involves troops in the field determining the basic map coordinates and transmitting that information back to the firing unit, who uploads the data into the shell’s inertial mid-course guidance system. The shell uses that information to get to the general target area and then troops on the ground guide it to the specific impact point with the laser. There are reports that the Russians employed this weapon in Syria for the first time in 2016. And that the Russians did not simply launch airstrikes into Idlib suggests that there may have been no precision guided munitions available for its aircraft in Syria or otherwise available to planes close enough to launch an attack against the time-sensitive target. Official images and video from the Khmeimim air base and of Russian air strikes originating outside the country commonly show aircraft dropping strings of unguided bombs on their targets. Below is a video showing a demonstration of the Krasnopol laser-guided artillery shell. The latest Russian Ministry of Defense statement still did not name the group the Kremlin believes was responsible for the attacks, but did say they were the same militants who had killed two Russian personnel at Khmeimim air base in a separate attack on Dec. 31, 2017. A previously unknown group, the Free Alawites Movement , has now claimed responsibility, but there has been no independent confirmation and it’s not clear if that group is actually active in Syria. Alawites are a sect of Shia Islam found predominantly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey, who have generally been supportive of Assad, who is himself a member of the group. On Jan. 11, 2018, during a meeting with editors of Russian state and private national news agencies, Putin said that Russia knew who the attackers were, where they were broadly, and how much they had “paid for these provocations,” but did not reveal their identities or affiliations, according to RT . The Russian president said the attack had been a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between his country and its partners in Syria, including Iran and Turkey. “There were provocateurs there, but they were not Turks,” Putin said, appearing to dismiss earlier Russian allegations that Turkish-backed rebels were behind the incident. “We know when and where those unmanned aerial vehicles were handed over and how many there were.” Russia, Turkey, and Iran are all part of a coalition in charge of managing various so-called “ de-escalation zones ” in Syria. Turkey is in charge of those activities in Idlib and Russia had initially criticized them for failing to properly implement the ceasefire. Anti-Assad rebels and their families prepare to board buses and leave the suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus for Idlib as part of a ceasefire deal in May 2017., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik  via AP Turkish and Russian authorities have a complicated relationship, especially when it comes to Syria. In 2015, a Turkish F-16 Viper fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24 Fencer ground attack aircraft, prompting fears that a more serious conflict might erupt. The next year, Turkish military personnel attempted to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who responded with a massive crackdown and accused the United States of harboring the coup’s mastermind , a former political ally named Fethullah Gülen . This, in addition to the U.S. government’s close cooperation with Kurdish groups that Turkey sees as terrorists, strained relations between Washington and Ankara and pushed them closer to Moscow. As part of his December 2017 victory tour , Putin stopped to visit Erdogan. But the two countries still have very different agendas in the region and there is a remote possibility that another state might have aided rebels in Idlib in launching the mass drone attacks to try and upset this potentially shaky alliance. So far there has been no firm evidence to support that conclusion, though. There has similarly been no confirmation of Syrian opposition claims that the attack actually came from areas where regime-allied militias operate. In addition, Putin had again stressed that the drones were too sophisticated for militants to have developed them with significant outside support. This has been a particularly important point of contention for the Kremlin, since the Russian president declared victory over terrorists in the country during his December 2017 visit to Khmeimim. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in suit at left, stands with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, in suit at right, and Russian pilots at Khmeimim in December 2017., Office of the President of Russia “Those aircraft were only camouflaged – I want to emphasize this – to look like handicraft production,” Putin said. “In fact, it is quite obvious that there were elements of high-tech nature there.” Major General Alexander Novikov, head of the Russian General Staff’s Office for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Development, gave a similar accounting of the drones during a press briefing earlier on Jan. 11, 2018. “[The drones] were developed and operated by experts with special skills acquired in countries that produce and apply systems with UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles,” the senior officer said. Evidence continues to grow to the contrary, though. A new analysis by Bellingcat suggests that that the drone’s GPS antenna is its most complex component, but notes that this could have easily come from another commercially available design. There does seem to be a standardized design and there is now open source documentation of at least four other examples beyond those the Russians captured after the Jan. 5, 2018 attacks. Programming the autonomous flight path and release point for the bomblets would have required certain skills, but would not necessarily have been difficult for militant groups who have been able to recruit individually internationally with various knowledge bases. The U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria has, on multiple occasions , said that it killed terrorist drone experts or destroyed workshops dedicated to their production in its own air strikes. It is possible that this international recruitment is what Novikov and other Russian officials have been referring to when they cite the need for foreign training to develop and operate these unmanned aircraft. However, the Russian Ministry of Defense’s implication that there might be a link to the mass drone attacks and a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon patrol plane flying in the Mediterranean, as well as Novikov specifically name-dropping Ukraine during his briefing, suggest otherwise. The exact basis for these allegations of outside assistance will likely continue to be unclear until the Russians decide to name the attackers and their affiliation, when and if that occurs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Four Big Need To Know Takeaways From The Long Awaited US Nuclear Posture Review,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As a candidate, President Donald Trump reportedly questioned why the United States had nuclear weapons if it could never really use them and has since pledged to dramatically increase the capability of America’s deadliest arsenal. As such, latest Nuclear Posture Review was always going to be significant, but our first glimpse of the new policies shows a particular dramatic shift in thinking, which not only preserves the nuclear triad in its present form, but looks to expand it considerably in many ways. On Jan. 11, 2018, HuffPost News published a detailed analysis of the Trump Administration’s nuclear plans based on a draft copy of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) that it had obtained, as well as the document itself. It’s dated January 2018 and marked “pre-decisional,” indicating that the text is not necessarily final, but with the Pentagon expecting to finish up the process in February 2018, it’s likely to be very close in tone and overall content to the finished version. It focuses heavily on the need for deterrence strategies tailored to specific enemies and potential opponents , a modernized nuclear arsenal and associated infrastructure to respond to those growing threats, and, most worryingly, plans for a more “flexible” posture that could make these potentially world-ending weapons more useable. “This review candidly addresses the challenges posed by Russian, Chinese, and other states’ strategic policies, programs, and capabilities, particularly nuclear,” the review states in its executive summary. “It presents the flexible, adaptable, and resilient U.S. nuclear capabilities now required to protect the United States, allies, and partners, and promote strategic stability.” The document, which HuffPost made available online , is worth reading in full, but here are four takeaways from the draft review that we at The War Zone think are especially significant. The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Kentucky , part of America’s nuclear triad., USN New, low-yield nuclear weapons By far, the most important part of the draft NPR is its emphasis on flexible, low-yield, non-strategic nuclear weapons. The review justifies this with the same basic logic that advocates of the concept have pitched in public for years . Per their argument, the existing triad of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and heavy bombers with long-range cruise missiles and gravity bombs, may be too slow and inflexible to actually deter an opponent. Potential enemies with their own large stockpiles of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons in particular might feel they have the ability to launch a quick, limited attack that achieves their objectives before the United States can respond at all. In effect, the focus on large, strategic weapons “self-deters” the U.S. government from taking its own limited action, or so the theory goes. “These [non-strategic] supplements will enhance deterrence by denying potential adversaries any mistaken confidence that limited nuclear employment can provide a useful advantage over the United States and its allies,” the draft document says. “For example, Russia’s belief that limited nuclear first use, potentially including low-yield weapons, can provide such an advantage is based, in part, on Moscow’s perception that its greater number and variety of non-strategic nuclear systems provide a coercive advantage in crises and at lower levels of conflict.” Concerns about this Russian doctrine, known commonly as “ escalating to deescalate ,” have grown significantly since 2014, when the Kremlin seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea Region and then began to further “ salami slice ” the country apart by way of proxies. There are fears that Russia might use such tactics to bully a neighbor, including certain NATO members with mutual borders, before the United States or its allies could respond. Experts, however, disagree about how serious Moscow is about putting such plans into action. Regardless, the main focus of this new low-yield nuclear weapon effort would center on the development of new, smaller warheads for the D-5 Trident II SLBM and an all-new submarine-launched nuclear cruise missile , or SLCM. The U.S. Navy’s Ohio -class ballistic missile submarines carry these weapons and they will be the main armament of the upcoming Columbia -class , too. The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland fires a Trident D-5 during an exercise., USN In addition, the draft NPR calls for expanding the U.S. military’s capability to deploy nuclear-capable bombers and multi-role fighter jets to forward locations . The review specifically calls for following through with plans to add a nuclear weapons capability to the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter , as well. Taken together, the goal would be to make it clear that the United States has a diverse array of nuclear options within quick reach of any possible hot spot. Even without low-yield weapons, nuclear ballistic missile submarines are already among the most flexible tools in America’s arsenal, able to operate for extended periods underwater, avoiding detection while still being within reach of potential target areas. The main problem with this plan, of course, is that it assumes potential opponents, large and small, will draw the appropriate conclusions about the restructuring both before and during a potential nuclear exchange. Experts worry that it would be hard, if not impossible for any nation state to see any functional difference between “limited” and “full-scale” nuclear attacks. It could be especially hard for them to make any determination about the size and nature of the strike within the small decision-making window they would have after detecting it in the first place. Since the U.S. military routinely employs conventional submarine-launched cruise missiles, it could be difficult for an opponent to discern if the incoming weapons are nuclear armed at all. An enemy could easily feel compelled to simply adopt a position of assuming that any incoming missile has a high-yield warhead on board, which could limit the United States ability to launch limited, conventional stand-off strikes without risking a major escalation. There are concerns that a U.S. doctrine that includes making small-scale statements with nuclear weapons would lower the bar for when it would launch such a strike, and in turn further increase the chances of actually prompting a cataclysmic exchange. The United States does not have a policy of “ no first use, ” but at present states that it would not ever threaten a nuclear strike against a non-nuclear state that is party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. President Donald Trump gives a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, in which he threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea., Anthony Behar/Sipa USA via AP The idea that the ability to carry out a smaller strike would deter an enemy more than the threat of massive retaliatory assault seems dubious, as well. It seems hard to believe, especially given Trump’s many public threats implying the use of nuclear weapons , that any nation thinks the U.S. government would hesitate to use them if necessary. “Anyone can come up with a scenario that requires a new weapon,” Hans Kristensen, head of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, wrote in a deep look into the flaws of deterrent strategies focused on lower-yield nuclear weapons in June 2017. “What’s missing from the debate is why the existing and planned capabilities are not sufficient.” The nuclear posture review does not mention that the United States already has more than 1,000 nuclear warheads with a so-called “dial-a-yield” feature that includes a low-yield setting. More glaringly, though, the review specifically says that the United States has no plans to fundamentally change its thresholds for when it would use nuclear weapons in general, which calls into question the entire concept. “If you’re saying that having low-yield nuclear weapons does not lower the threshold for use, then you’re essentially saying there’s no difference between using a low-yield and a high-yield weapon,” Alexandra Bell, the senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation and a former senior State Department official, told HuffPost News. “If you’re saying adamantly in here that this won’t change our current posture choices, it basically negates your reason to have this [low-yield] capability in the first place.” Four B61 nuclear gravity bombs. All of the remaining different versions of this weapon, as well as upcoming B61-12, have variable yields., DOD Tailored deterrence Despite this seemingly contradictory logic of the underlying strategy, the idea of the need for a more flexible and usable deterrent permeates through the rest of the review. The authors of the draft NPR are adamant that a “one-size fits all” approach simply does not match the potential threats and so-called “tailored deterrence” is necessary. “This need for flexibility to tailor U.S. capabilities and strategies to meet future requirements and unanticipated developments runs contrary to a rigid, continuing policy of “no new nuclear capabilities,’” the document states. “Potential adversaries do not stand still.” There is a tailored strategy for Russia, which again focuses heavily on neutralizing the impact of the escalate to deescalate doctrine. That particular section also reiterates America’s commitment to its NATO allies , something the draft NPR stresses at various points, no doubt in part in response to President Trump’s repeated criticisms of the organization. Below is a 60 Minutes segment looking at Russian and U.S. nuclear capabilities. There is another one for China that strongly implies the United States could consider employing nuclear weapons in response to non-nuclear aggression, including potential incidents in space and cyberspace , in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese government is rapidly expanding its capabilities to enforce its massive territorial claims, especially in the South China Sea , and has recently threatened military action should Taiwan decide to make a bid for independence. The U.S. government disputes Beijing’s claims throughout the Pacific and has a legal obligation to defend Taiwan. Again, the draft NPR does not make clear why the United States cannot deter Russia and China from initiating limited nuclear exchanges with its existing arsenal and policies. The end goal seems to be the same as it ever was, to make sure any hostile nuclear power understands that it can’t use nuclear weapons against the United States or its allies and somehow escape a response in kind, which is the basic underpinning of deterrence as a concept . The two remaining strategies tailored for particular nations, North Korea and Iran, the latter of which has not officially declared it has nuclear weapons or is developing them, both speak further to a classical deterrence strategy, stressing that the United States would initiate a massive retaliatory operation if either country launched a nuclear strike. This would seem to contradict public statements from senior U.S. government officials, including National Security Adviser U.S. Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who has suggested that such strategies might not work against North Korea in particular. Interestingly, both sections also suggest that the United States could choose to respond to a nuclear attack from either country with major conventional strikes rather than with nuclear weapons. The draft NPR makes it clear that the U.S. government would hold North Korea directly responsible for the end results of it proliferating nuclear weapons technology to other states. There are additional, broader sections on ensuring America’s posture continues to provide extended deterrence for allies in Europe and Asia, as well as being prepared for unexpected contingencies. Separately, there is another chapter that deals specifically with stepping up efforts to ensure terrorists and other non-state actors do not acquire nuclear weapons , which the Trump Administration also highlighted in its recent National Security Strategy . North Korean premier Kim Jong-un, in black, stands next to an exmaple of the Hwasong-15 ICBM in November 2017. North Korea claims it can hit anywhere in the United States with this weapon., KCNA Modernizing the Triad Per the draft NPR, this stated need for a more flexible, tailored deterrent means that continued investment in the United States’ nuclear arsenal and associated infrastructure, including both command and control nodes and warhead design and production capabilities, is more important than ever. It also makes clear that the U.S. military will retain all three legs of the triad, despite earlier comments from Secretary of Defense James Mattis in 2017 that suggested the review could result in a revised nuclear dyad . Mattis later stated publicly that he supported the full triad. “Throughout past decades, senior U.S. officials have emphasized that the highest priority of the Department of Defense is deterring nuclear attack and, therefore, sustaining the nuclear capabilities necessary to deter [such an attack],” the document notes. “This requirement is now magnified by the need to tailor U.S. strategies to a broader range of adversaries and contingencies and to hedge against unanticipated developments.” Beyond the plans for the new low-yield submarine-launched ballistic and cruise missiles, the review does not describe any plans for other previously unannounced future delivery systems. The authors say that the submarine-launched cruise missile is specifically intended to provide that type of capability within the constraints of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, despite reports that the U.S. military will study a weapon that would, if realized, violate the terms of that agreement. There is a specific mention of a planned feasibility study to examine the possibility of including a W78 nuclear warhead, the same one found on the U.S. Air Force’s existing Minuteman III ICBMs, onto an unspecified “Navy flight vehicle.” This is very likely the submarine-launched hypersonic weapon prototype the U.S. Navy tested in 2017, or a further evolution of that concept. The video below depicts the full end-to-end flight of a Minuteman III ICBM with its single W78 warhead. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ygdv1aQnNRY Otherwise, the U.S. military would remain focused on existing nuclear modernization efforts, which are the continued development of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber , the B61-12 nuclear bomb , the air-launched Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) cruise missile, and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) ICBM. In addition, the Pentagon would remain committed to improving land- and space-based strategic early warning systems, land and airborne command and control nodes, and other related infrastructure . Notably, the draft NPR renews calls for improving Department of Energy infrastructure associated with the development and production of nuclear weapons, because of concerns about the environmental impact of existing facilities. These, in general, are the specific responsibility of DoE’s National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA). “NNSA’s ability to achieve its vital national security missions is dependent on safe and reliable infrastructure,” Frank Klotz, the soon to retire NNSA administrator says in a quote in the review. “If not appropriately addressed, the age and condition of NNSA’s infrastructure will put NNSA ‘s missions, safety of its workers, the public, and the environment at risk.” The NNSA’s main job will be sustaining and extending the life of existing nuclear warheads, including keeping the B83-1 gravity bomb viable past its present unspecified retirement date as a reserve system. At the same time, it will be working on devising new designs that could increase commonality between Air Force and Navy delivery systems. An inert B83 “shape” on display at Pease Air Force Base in 1989., USAF Russia’s Status-6 is a threat In addition to the demands of the new flexible nuclear posture, the draft NPR explains that this modernization of America’s arsenal, which could ultimately cost more than $1 trillion, is necessary because of the rapidly expanding capabilities among potential opponents. The authors included a chart showing the dozens of new weapon systems Russia , China , North Korea have fielded or have put into development since 2010 compared to one such American program, the nuclear-capable F-35A. The comparison is completely disingenuous though, since many of the systems, especially the North Korean ones, are likely not anywhere near what the U.S. military would consider a full operational capability. A more fair comparison would show the GBSD, LRSO, and B-21 bomber programs in the United States’ row at least. There are almost certainly other projects in the classified domain, such as the Navy’s aforementioned submarine-launched hypersonic system, which it only revealed to the public in November 2017. Regardless, it is interesting to see the flurry of development represented in this fashion. And though the scan of the document is very low quality and the chart’s text is difficult to read, it includes one particularly important addition, Russia’s Status-6, also known as Kanyon . An edited version of the low-quality scan of the chart from the draft NPR, with Status-6 highlighted., DOD via HuffPost News This weapon, sometimes referred to as a torpedo, but more accurately show on the chart as an “autonomous underwater vehicle,” first emerged publicly in 2015. Russian television broadcasts caught a glimpse of it in a briefing book while covering an otherwise mundane meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and representatives of the country’s defense industries. From what little is known about the system, the idea is that Russian submarines would launch the system, which carries a thermonuclear warhead, into an opponent’s port cities to deny access to them in a crisis. The design appears to be deliberately “dirty,” producing deadly amounts of radiation to make it particularly difficult for the enemy to get things back up and running. In theory, it could be especially devastating in confined maritime environments, such as the Baltic Sea and Black Sea, giving Russia an addition means to control access to those areas. “If detonated, Status-6 would be capable of dousing cities like New York in massive amounts of radioactive fallout,” Jeffery Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, wrote in Foreign Policy at the time . “At the risk of understating things, this project is bat-shit crazy.” A screen grab of the original 2015 broadcast showing the “Status-6” system., via @EvShu It’s not clear how far along Russia might be with the project and letting it leak out in that fashion might have been part of a deliberate disinformation effort . The U.S. government, though, appears to have reason to take it seriously. The chart also highlights Russia’s INF-breaking ground-launched cruise missile . The NPR’s text separately mentions the country’s work on a hypersonic boost glide vehicle, which it may have tested in 2017. From what else is legible in the chart, there does not appear to be any mention of any other previously unknown nuclear delivery systems. Now, again, it’s important to note that this is only a draft document, but it’s equally true that broad policies are unlikely to change dramatically at this late date in the process. Even if they did, that the authors initially considered these conclusions is a significant revelation. As it stands now, the review makes it clear that the U.S. military is in favor of new nuclear weapons and capabilities. It says these additions will not make it any “easier” for the United States to employ its nuclear arsenal, but it seems hard to believe this dramatic shift in priorities won’t change the calculus , at least to some degree. It’s less obvious how adding low-yield weapons, and a new doctrine to with them, will actually impact how the United States expects to deter its opponents from launching a potentially apocalyptic strike.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 9, 2018","Russia Offers New Details About Syrian Mass Drone Attack, Now Implies Ukrainian Connection","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian military’s top officer in charge of drone development has offered new details about apparent first of their kind mass drone attacks on its forces in Syria in an official briefing at the country’s Ministry of Defense. The presentation reiterated the Kremlin’s assertion that terrorists or rebels could not have conducted the operation without significant outside support , now implying a possible Ukrainian connection, but significant questions remain unanswered. Speaking from the Russian Ministry of Defense’s briefing room, amid examples of the drones and their munitions that the country recovered after the attacks, Major General Alexander Novikov, head of the Russian General Staff’s Office for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Development, gave the most detailed and complete official description of the incident to date. He said that unspecified terrorists utilized a total of 13 improvised drones, each carrying 10 bomblets, sending 10 to Russia’s Khmeimim air base in Latakia governorate  and the other three to its naval base in Tartus on the Mediterranean Sea. The munitions each had an explosive charge weighing nearly one pound, as well as strings of metal ball bearings or BBs glued together as pre-formed shrapnel, which would have made them most effective against individuals out in the open. “Construction of these drones takes significant time period and special knowledge of aerodynamics and radioelectronics,” Novikov. “Assembly and use of these components in the joint system are a complicated engineer task demanding special training, scientific knowledge, and practical experience of producing these aircraft.” Novikov said that Russian forces had been able to capture a number of the drones after electronic warfare systems at Khmeimim knocked them out of the sky. Somewhat confusingly, he later said that whoever had built the unmanned aircraft had included systems to specifically to defeat those countermeasures, though. A video of Novikov’s full briefing is available online, with additional views of the captured drones and associated items and imagery, but the commentary is entirely in Russian. Air defense radars aided in detecting the attacks and Pantsir-S1 short-range air defense systems destroyed some of the improvised unmanned aircraft, as well. He added that this was the first time Russian forces in Syria had come under such an attack, though rebels and terrorists have been employing such systems for years now in both that country and neighboring Iraq . The general officer acknowledged that the individual components, such as the apparent lawnmower or moped motors, were available commercially. This is a point the U.S. military has been keen to stress in the aftermath of the attacks. “We have seen this type of commercial UAV technology used to carry out missions by ISIS,” Pentagon spokesperson Major Adrian Rankin-Galloway told Russian state outlet Sputnik on Jan. 8, 2018. “Those devices and technologies can easily be obtained in the open market and that is cause for concern.” However, Novikov insisted that militants would not have been able to conduct the necessary research and development and flight testing out of their workshops in Syria to make sure the improvised aircraft actually worked without significant assistance. “It is impossible to develop such drones in an improvised manner. They were developed and operated by experts with special skills acquired in countries that produce and apply systems with UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles],” he said, without naming where those individuals might be situated or where the militants might have received such training. To support these assertions, Novikov focused heavily on the drones’ on-board GPS, which has become an important component of Russia’s allegation that outside actors, including one or more nation states, would have had to have been involved in the attacks at some level. The Major-General said the systems gave them military-grade precision when navigating to Khmeimim and releasing their bombs over the target area. The “pre-programmed coordinates are more accurate than those in the Internet,” Novikov, challenging arguments that militants could have acquired the necessary data via open sources online. Though the briefing included maps of the pre-programmed flight routes, which the Russian Ministry of Defense said it had created using information it downloaded from the examples it captured, he did not provide any actual data to support his claims. Maps showing the drones flight path during the attack., Russian MoD In his January 2018 briefing, Novikov also specifically appeared to suggest there might be a connection to Ukraine. He brought up the country when talking about the source of the explosive material inside the bombs the drones dropped on Khmeimim. “The PETN [ pentaerythritol tetranitrate ] is produces [sic] by a number of countries, including Ukraine at the Shostkinsky Chemical Plant,” he explained. “This explosive material cannot be produced in an improvised manner or extracted from other munitions.” One of the captured drones showing it carrying eight, rather than the reported 10 bomblets., Russian MoD Besides Syria and Russia, Ukraine was the only other country Novikov mentioned by name, according to the official transcript. He did not note that military forces around the world and commercial mining companies use PETN, which German scientists first developed in 1894, and that it is relatively easy to obtain . The difficulty in spotting the explosive on typical airport x-ray machines has made it particularly popular with terrorists for more than a decade. “Shoe bomber” Richard Reid , “butt bomber” Abdullah Al Asiri , and “underwear bomber” Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , among many others , all employed or attempted to employ devices featuring PETN charges. Russia and Ukraine have been at odds since the Kremlin seized the latter’s Crimea region in 2014 and subsequently began directly supporting separatists fighting the government in Kiev. The conflict has earned the Russian government international censure and economic sanctions from various countries, including the United States . A close up of some of the captured bomblets, showing the metal ball shrapnel., Russian MoD Ukraine is the third country Russia has indirectly implied might have aided the attacks in some fashion. On Jan. 9, 2018, an official statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense, as well as reports from state media outlets, strongly suggested that a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon patrol plane flying off the coast of Syria during the attack was somehow involved in the incident. The implication was that the aircraft was feeding targeting information, such as the aforementioned GPS coordinates, or other information to the militants controlling the drones. These aircraft do have a robust electronic support measures suite that can collect information about various emitters, such as enemy radars, but additional electronic and signals intelligence systems have yet to become operational . The idea that the United States is supporting ISIS, who may have been responsible, is a long-standing, but completely unfounded conspiracy theory . The U.S. government and its partners have armed groups opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, though, most notably with TOW anti-tank missiles . Still, there is no actual evidence whatsoever the U.S. military had a role in the attack. Then, on Jan. 10, 2018, the Russians indirectly pointed the finger at Turkey and rebel groups it backs in Northern Syria. The Turkish government is responsible for a so-called “ de-escalation zone ” in Idlib governorate, which is where the Kremlin says militants launched the drones. In 2017, Russia, Iran, and Turkey agreed to establish the ceasefire areas as part of a controversial plan that seemed aimed at challenging the influence of the United States, its allies, and its local Syrian partners, especially the Kurdish People’s Protection Units in the country. According to The Washington Post , Russian officials sent a letter to their Turkish counterparts, not accusing them directly of involvement, but holding them responsible for the Khmeimim attack, blaming them for not being able to maintain the ceasefire in Idlib. Turkey in turn accused Russia and Iran of not keeping up their end of the bargain and demanded that they halt an offensive into the governorate, exposing potential fractures in the partnership. Turkish troops ride in an armored personnel carrier near the border with Syria in 2016., Ismail Coskun, IHA via AP The conspiratorial claims appear to be in response to these bold and unprecedented attacks coming so soon after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s victory tour of the Middle East in December 2017. This trip included a brief stopover at Khmeimim, where Putin declared total victory over terrorists in Syria. As yet, the Kremlin has provided little firm evidence to support its assertions about foreign involvement. There is a growing body of evidence calling into question Russia’s insistence that militants could not have crafted the drones on their own, as well. On Jan. 10, 2018, the Daily Beast reported that it had found similar drones for sale via the Telegram online messaging service, which militants in the Middle East and North Africa especially have increasingly used to conduct black market arms deals .The detailed investigation also turned up images of similar improvised unmanned aircraft and bomblets in Syria on Jan. 1 and 2, 2018. The munitions in particular are almost identical in design and construction to examples various research groups have documented through open sources. “From what I can see, this ‘drone’ was fabricated using wooden parts and tape,” Mike Blades, a drone industry analyst at the consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, told the Daily Beast. “Perhaps the servos and engine were purchased online, although it’s more likely been scavenged from a model airplane.” On top of that, fighters with the Saray al-Areen militia, which is aligned with the Assad regime, said they had found one drones near Khmeimim on or about Jan. 1, 2018 and posted the video seen below, suggesting the unmanned aircraft had seen some action before the mass attack later in the month. On New Year’s Eve 2017 there was another attack on the air base, but Russian authorities said the militants used a mortar. The Kremlin also disputed reports that the incident had left a number of aircraft destroyed. It remains unclear who has been responsible for this string of attacks. As yet, no group has officially claimed to have carried out the operations, despite their high profile nature and obvious propaganda potential. “There’s a lot of fishy stuff going on in Idlib – agents running around, and groups working with groups they shouldn’t work with,” Aron Lund, an analyst at the Century Foundation, told The Washington Post earlier in January 2018. “It’s very, very murky.” What is increasingly clear is that Khmeimim and Russia’s military and other interests in Syria are more vulnerable than many reports have previously suggested . The air base in Latakia province in particular appears to be under regular attack now . It also seems safe to say that swarm drone attacks have arrived, albeit in a very primitive state, and are likely to become a major tool of both national militaries and terrorists and insurgents. It’s a danger that many, including us at The War Zone , have expressed concern about for years already. In light of the mass attack in Syria, Russia has called for the creation of an international coalition to combat this emerging threat. Novikov said the Russian government was prepared to use all “appropriate measures” to eliminate the danger, without elaborating on whether this might involve an increase in military operations in Syria or elsewhere or sanctions or other actions against those it believed facilitated the attack. “There is a real threat that terrorists can use drones for their attacks worldwide,” Novikov said near the end of his briefing. This particularly statement seems indisputable. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces Russian Air Force Swarms Unmanned"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 30, 2018",US Navy Wants to Hire Contractors to Fly Their Own MQ-9 Reaper Drones in Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is planning to hire drone-maker General Atomics to fly its own unarmed MQ-9 Reapers in support of U.S. Marines in Afghanistan. The service says the contractor-operated drones would provide a “surge” of intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities as the U.S. military expands its activities in the Central Asian country, which the U.S. Air Force is not able to provide at present. On Jan. 9, 2018, the Naval Air Systems Command, or NAVAIR, announced the proposed deal on FedBizOps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website. The contract, which the Navy did not give an estimated value for, would cover up to a year of operations in Afghanistan running between the 2018 Fiscal Year, when began on Oct. 1, 2017, and the 2019 fiscal cycle. The notice implies that this arrangement would be a sole-source contract the Navy would award directly to General Atomics without a lengthy competitive process. NAVAIR says “delaying the procurement” would be “impractical” given the urgent needs of Marines assigned to Task Force Southwest , which has the job of conducting advisory missions in Afghanistan’s infamous Helmand province, as well as portions of neighboring Nimroz province, both of which border Pakistan . The contracting announcement doesn’t say how many Reapers would be involved in the contractor-run mission, or how many personnel it might take to manage the operation, which would not involve any armed sorties. The Navy did give very clear capabilities it was looking to procure, though. US Air Force and UK Royal Air Force MQ-9 Reapers share a hangar in Afghanistan., USAF As it stands now, NAVAIR is looking to hire General Atomics to provide a single “orbit” supplying coverage over one particular area 16 hours a day, seven days a week. The company could have to conduct missions lasting 24-hours or more in certain cases, but with advance notice. A typical MQ-9 Reaper combat air patrol involves four individual aircraft, so that one aircraft is always on station, while another is heading back to base to refuel, and a third is heading out to take over the mission. The fourth drone is in reserve in case a malfunction, accident, or other issue sidelines one of the aircraft. In order to make this work smoothly, the Navy proposed a so-called “remote-split” arrangement, whereby General Atomics’ crews would launch and recover the drones in Afghanistan using line-of-sight control, but pilots and sensor operators would perform the actual operations from a site in the United States via satellite link. The team in Afghanistan would also be in charge of maintaining the aircraft and their sensors. The U.S. Air Force already uses this method to conduct unmanned persistent surveillance operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world . In addition, the Navy says the Reapers themselves must carry a high-resolution imaging radar system, as well as a multi-spectral camera system. The Air Force’s latest MQ-9s already carry the Raytheon multi-spectral targeting system and General Atomics’ own Lynx multi-mode radar and it’s likely this is the capability NAVAIR is looking for on the contractor-operated drones. There is no stated requirement for a wide-area persistent surveillance system with multiple cameras, which could be particularly useful for monitoring insurgent movements. Sample imagery from the Lynx radar operating in its synthetic aperture mode., General Atomics Separate from the actual business of operating the drones, the proposed Navy contract would also require General Atomics to provide liaisons in Task Force Southwest’s command center and other headquarters in order to aid in the sharing of data the unmanned aircraft gather during their flights. The goal is to make sure Marine intelligence elements and their troops on the ground in Afghanistan receive the information in a timely manner, which could be especially important for assisting in Afghan or other coalition operations against fleeting, time sensitive targets, such as small groups of insurgents or terrorists on the move or particular individuals. This entire proposed arrangement is significant, but not necessarily unprecedented. Stretched increasingly thin on various counter-terrorism related efforts around the world, the U.S. military has increasingly relied on contractors to provide aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support , among various other capabilities . In Afghanistan in particular, the U.S. military has routinely hired private companies to fly manned spy planes with a variety of different sensor suites . In August 2017, the U.S. Army announced it would again look to extend the contract for a pair of contractor-owned and operated Night Eagle aircraft. These are modified Beechcraft King Airs carrying sensor turrets with both electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras, which can also capture still images to help spot any significant changes over time. A low-quality composite image showing one of the Night Eagle aircraft, its sensor turret, and sample imagery., US Army Since at least 2015 , the U.S. Air Force itself has employed contractors to fly unarmed drones in intelligence gathering missions. The service pursued the controversial decision as it struggle in meeting the growing demands for the support, which had already put a serious strain on existing unmanned aircraft pilots and sensor operators. Contractors already operate smaller drones, such as the ScanEagle , within Afghanistan . But that the Navy is looking to hire General Atomics directly to supplement Air Force drone operations in Afghanistan speaks to a number of continuing concerns about both the prosecution of that conflict and the present state of the U.S. military. President Donald Trump and his administration have made securing a victory against the Taliban and other militants and terrorists in the country a central policy . As such, there has been a renewed emphasis on American involvement in Afghanistan, including the Marine task force headquartered in Helmand , and a steady increase in the U.S. military presence in the country. This in turn has created requirements for more air strikes , close air support , and aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. “I have served as a battalion commander in Iraq and regimental commander in Afghanistan, but in some ways, the Task Force Southwest mission has been the most complex challenge I have faced,” U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General Roger Turner, head of the task force, told Marine Corps Times earlier in January 2018. “Even though we don’t have Marines directly maneuvering against the enemy, we are most certainly fighting the enemy by, with and through our [Afghan National Defense and Security Force] partners.” Task Force Southwest Marines load onto a US Army CH-47 helicopter during a mission in July 2017., USMC Persistent surveillance has been essential for limiting the ability of the Taliban and other groups to move freely, especially at night, and had been essential to keep militants from making significant gain. At the same time, as we at The War Zone have noted on multiple occasions , the Afghans still cannot adequately provide this and other critical capabilities on their own. So, the NATO-led coalition, and the U.S. military in particular, remain responsible for the bulk of air support activities in the country broadly. The U.S. Air Force, though, has been increasingly hard pressed to provide much of this support, including additional drone patrols. The demands of a seemingly never-ending world-wide war on terrorism have put increasing strain on the service after nearly two decades of almost constant operations. Earlier in January 2018, a report by Air Force Times gave new and particularly granular detail to the difficulties the Air Force faces in support operations around the globe. Worrisome personnel shortages have now expanded from the unmanned community into manned aircraft operations , as well. Monetary bonuses and other incentives have so far failed to fully stem the exodus of pilots in particular. The official video below, titled “Insatiable Demand,” which the Air Force released in April 2017, gives a look into the existing demands on the Air Force’s drone community. The increasing tempo of air strikes and other aerial operations in Afghanistan will likely cut into any respite the Air Force may have gained from a slow-down in operations over Iraq and Syria . The most notable of these efforts has been a series of high profile attacks on infrastructure related to the production of heroin and other illicit narcotics. Along the border with Pakistan, in provinces such as Helmand and Nimroz, the need for more air support, especially intelligence gathering sorties, may only increase as the Trump Administration seeks to pressure the Pakistani government into doing more to combat Taliban and other terrorist activities on their side of the border and stem cross-border movement by withholding some military and security-related aid. So far, though, authorities in Islamabad have threatened to end coordination with the US military and could consider cutting off over-land supply lines critical to coalition forces in Afghanistan in response. NAVAIR’s proposed contract with General Atomics seems to be further admission that the Air Force simply cannot meet all of the demands the U.S. military has placed on it, especially as the United States steps up operations in Afghanistan again. It’s not clear when that might change, either. The service is also planning to finally retire the MQ-1 Predator for good by the end of 2018 in favor of the MQ-9. It remains unclear what will happen to the older, less capable drones, but one possibility is that contractors could scoop them up and put them back into action as part of future contractor-managed deals. However, NAVAIR’s January 2018 notice specifically stated a requirement for Reapers. An armed US Air Force MQ-9 in Afghanistan. The contractor-operated Reapers would fly unarmed missions only., USAF The Trump Administration has promised significant budget increases and a larger U.S. military overall, but that failed to materialize in the budget for the 2018 fiscal cycle. It is possible that we may see this spending boost when the White House releases its Fiscal Year 2019 in the coming months. How long it might take for the new funding to make an impact is unclear. Congress would still have to approve the money for any such budget, too. Legislators have so far been able to unable to get together to actually fund the budget, formally known as the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, even after Trump signed it into law late in 2017. Instead, they have kept the government functioning using short-term spending bills, known as continuing resolutions . Secretary of Defense James Mattis, among other senior U.S. military leaders , has decried this mechanism , which effectively prevents budget long-term planning. Of course, these issues don’t change the needs of deploy units and NAVAIR seems intent on getting Marines Helmand drone support sooner rather than later. Unless the budget situation changes dramatically or the United States finds a way to significantly reduce its commitments overseas, it seems likely we’ll see more of these contracts, at least in the near term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 29, 2018","US Marines Get Upgraded SMAW Rocket Launcher, But It Could Already Be Obsolete","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than five years of development and testing, Marines have finally begun to receive the first improved 83mm Mk 153 Mod 2 rocket launchers, also known as the Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon Mod 2, or SMAW Mod 2. The updated weapons are more accurate and easier to use and maintain, but their future is unclear, coming as the Marine Corps looks to begin issuing the similar Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle and eliminate certain infantry units equipped with the SMAW from the service entirely. Marines with the II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF), which has its headquarters at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, got their SMAW Mod 2s in November 2017, according to Marine Corps Times . The Weapons arrived at that I MEF, situated at Camp Pendleton, California, in January 2018. The Corps expects the weapon to reach full operational capability across the service between 2019 and 2020. The SMAW gives Marines “a capability gap in breaching and provided a Marine-portable capability to defeat bunkers, breach urban structures and destroy lightly armored vehicles,” Barbara Hamby, a Marine Corps Systems Command spokesperson explained to Marine Corps Times. “SMAW Mod 2 improvements increase system accuracy, reliability and maintainability, and increase gunner survivability.” Marines can reload the 83mm should-fired rocket launcher, which can use a variety of different ammunition types, making it a flexible system against various targets. These include traditional high-explosive anti-tank and anti-personnel types, as well as rockets with “Novel Explosive” thermobaric warheads that create massive blast overpressure and are especially effective against enemy forces in confined spaces, such as buildings or caves. A representative of Marine Corps Systems Command shows the SMAW Mod 2 launcher to Marines in 2013., USMC The most visible change between the earlier Mod 0 SMAWs and the updated version is the replacement of the original sight with a new Modular Ballistic Sight, or MBS. The unit works during the day and at night, thanks to a thermal imaging system, and includes a laser range finder that allows Marines to aim and fire faster and more precisely. The laser ranging component also replaces the older and more complicated spotting rifle on the earlier weapons. This earlier arrangement consisted of what was essentially a separate gun strapped onto the side of the rocket launcher that fired a unique 9mm projectile that matched the ballistic trajectory of the main weapon. A close up of the SMAW Mod 2’s improved sighting system., USMC Gunners would aim at a target and first fire the spotting rifle in order to make sure they were on the mark and then fire the rocket. Needless to say this method was complex and time consuming and meant Marines spent considerable time exposed to the enemy. The improved weapons feature various additional improvements and use advanced materials to lighten the overall weight. In the end, the 13 pound Mod 2 is approximately three pounds lighter than the original launcher. But despite the obvious improvements over the original design, the weapon’s future in the Corps is uncertain. The service has already spent more than two decades working to update the system, which it first introduced in 1984. American defense contractor Talley Defense Systems, which Norway’s Nammo bought in 2007 and renamed Nammo-Talley, derived the original Mk 153 from the Israeli B-300 , a 1970s-era design. Marines fire older Mk 153 Mod 0 SMAWs during a training exercise in 2015., USMC In 1988, the Marines initiated a product improvement program for the SMAW and in 1994, Navy engineers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division in Virginia crafted a prototype upgraded version. The major updates included a simplified spotting rifle and lightweight construction. By the early 2000s, the service subsequently turned to what was then a partnership between Talley and Nammo, the latter of which was building the ammunition, to further develop this Mk 153 Mod 1. That project ran into significant delays, in no small part due to issues concerning licensing and patents related to the design, and by the late 2000s, the Marines and Dahlgren had shifted focus to the further improved Mod 2 variant. It wasn’t until November 2015 that the Marines finally signed a $72 million production contract for the first 56 SMAW Mod 2s, but with Atlantic Diving Supply , a small Virginia Beach-based defense contractor, rather than Nammo-Talley. In August 2017, the company settled a lawsuit with the U.S. government and agreed to pay $16 million over allegations it misrepresented its size as a small business to win a number of deals with the U.S. military and had actually subcontracted a significant amount of the work on various projects. It is not clear whether or not the case touched on the Mk 153 Mod 2 contract specifically. At the same time, however, the Corps has initiated a number of plans to modernize the fighting capabilities of its infantry units, especially when it comes to individual and crew-served weapons . Directly threatening the future of the SMAW, Marines in Japan conducted a trial of the 84mm Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle in November 2017, just as the first Mod 2s were arriving with II MEF. A US Marine fires a Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle during an evaluation in Japan in November 2017., USMC The Swedish-designed weapon is similar in many respects to the SMAW, but has a wider array of ammunition. The Corps is now considering replacing some or all of the older rocket launchers with these weapons. The Carl Gustaf is two pounds heavier than the Mod 2 version, though, which could be a factor in the service’s final decisions about what weapons ultimately remain in what units. The U.S. Army has recently adopted the weapon for broad use among its own infantry units. Special operations forces across the U.S. military have already been using the weapon since the 1990s. Related Video: On top of that, earlier in January 2018, Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller announced that the service would do away the assault section in weapons platoons of each of its infantry companies and eliminate the Infantry Assaultman Military Occupation Specialty, also known as MOS 0351, entirely. At present, these elements are the main Marine units armed with SMAWs. The plan, which Neller told Military.com would occur within three to five years, is to free up those Marines for other jobs, including expanding intelligence and cyber warfare capabilities. In place of the assault section, Marine combat engineers attached to infantry units would provide the same ability to destroy hardened enemy fortifications and similar dug-in positions, as well as removing other obstacles and hazards. This transformation could give the Marines an added opportunity to retire the SMAW for good. The plans to purchase significant numbers of Carl Gustafs to replace at least some of the rocket launchers across the service will only reduce the need for the improved Mod 2 version. If nothing else, it would be reasonable to ask why the Corps would need two distinct, but roughly analogous systems and whether that money might be best spent elsewhere. That being said, the Marine Corps’ top officer did seem to suggest that the SMAW would serve on with other infantry elements, as well as combat engineering units, in the near future. In an exchange with a Marine assigned to the service’s crisis response task force in Spain, Neller said he insisted that anyone could handle the launcher. Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller shoulders a Mk 153 Mod 2 SMAW during a demonstration in 2016., USMC “Yes, you can [shoot a SMAW],” Neller reportedly told the individual after they said they didn’t have the necessary training. “I could teach you in five seconds.” Depending on how the Marine Corps’ structure and needs continue to evolve, though, that supposed ease of training might become a moot point and the service might just as easily decide the SMAW has reached the end of its useful service life.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Russia’s Northern Fleet Brings The Fireworks In This “Explosive” Year In Review Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Military forces around the world routinely put out highlight reels to celebrate special dates or their achievements , especially around the New Year in order to recap the past 12 months of activities. The Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet is no different and has put out a particularly action-packed montage of its live-fire training exercises during 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defense released the video, set to rock and roll score, on its official YouTube channel on Jan. 6, 2017. There’s a lot packed into the nearly 3 minute long film, including appearances by a number of major submarines and surface vessels, including the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov , the Borei -class ballistic missile submarine Yury Dolgorukiy , the Yasen -class cruise missile submarine Severodvinsk , the Kirov -class battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy , the Slava -class cruiser Marshal Ustinov , and Udaloy -class destroyers. There are clips showing air defense missiles, close-in protection systems , 130mm guns, self-defense decoys, and more in action. “The Northern Fleet fulfilled all the tasks assigned to it in the past year,” the video title proudly declares. According to the description, the ships of the unit conducted approximately 4,700 exercises in total, more than half of which involved the employment of live weapons. That’s not necessarily surprising. The Northern Fleet is the largest of the Russian Navy’s four main combat fleets and has control over the service’s main flagship, Kuznetsov , as well as the bulk of the country’s remaining large surface combatants, including the Pyotr Velikiy . The unit is spread out among a number of facilities located n Russia’s far north, often operating near the Arctic Circle , a region of steadily increasing strategic importance to various countries in Europe, Asia, and North America, including the United States. The video opens with a passing clip across Kuznetsov ’s flight deck, with both its MiG-29K and Su-33 fighter jets visible. In 2017, the carrier had a rather embarrassing deployment to the Middle East, with one of each type of aircraft crashing into the Mediterranean Sea. In the end, it reportedly sent its aircraft ashore to support Russia’s intervention in Syria from the Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia Province. The only other clips we see of the carrier is of it shoot a 3K95 Kinzhal surface-to-air missile, a navalized variant of the low-to-medium altitude land-based Tor system, and anti-missile decoys. There are numerous clips of other surface ships firing these same systems throughout the video. The 3K95s, also known as the SA-N-9 Gauntlet, sit inside particularly interesting eight-tube rotary vertical launchers arranged in a circular configuration. A 3K95 missile emerges from its vertical launch system., Russian MoD Pyotr Velikiy and Marshal Ustinov both have S-300F Fort long-range surface-to-air missiles, naval versions of the land-based S-300 , inside similar, but significantly larger vertical launch systems. The video offers a below-deck clip showing the massive worm gear mechanism that rotates the entire assembly, before moving up above to show the system in action. On land, it takes large eight-wheeled transport-erector-launchers or tractor trailer-mounted launchers to move these missiles into position. A view of the huge worm gear that moves the missiles in the S-300F’s vertical launch system into firing position., Russian MoD There are great shots of Pyotr Velikiy firing its massive P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles , which are also known by their NATO reporting name, Shipwreck. Her sister ship the Admiral Nakhimov is in the midst of a major refit that will replace these Cold Warriors with a mix of more modern hypersonic , supersonic, and subsonic anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles . After she returns to service, Pyotr Velikiy is supposed to go to the shipyard for an overhaul into the same configuration. Our own Tyler Rogoway has written in depth about this upgrade plan here and you can find his overview of Shipwreck missile here . Interspersed throughout the rest of the run time are clips of various ships firing their twin 130mm AK-130 main guns, as well as Kashtan and AK-630 close-in weapon systems. The AK-630 is a single, turreted six-barrel 30mm rotary cannon. The Kashtan is a larger combination weapon with two of those guns along with eight 9K311 short-range surface-to-air missiles. The Russian Navy plans to begin replacing the Kashtans with a version of the Pantsir short-range air defense system, the Pantsir-ME, in 2018, which you can find out more about here . Pyotr Velikiy ‘s deck is engulfed in fire and smoke as it launches as Shipwreck ant-ship missile., Russian MoD There’s even a portion of the video that looks to show Marshal Ustinov moving one of her five-tube torpedo launchers into position before firing one of the weapons. When not in use, the system sits inside the ship near the waterline behind a door that closes flush with the hull. The video ends with a number of clips of what are likely the submarines Yury Dolgorukiy and Severodvinsk launching ballistic and cruise missiles while submerged. In June 2017, Yury Dolgorukiy in particular achieved a major milestone when it successfully fired a RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile, which subsequently flew a complete flight cycle as it would have during a real launch with live nuclear warheads. The inert multiple independent reentry vehicle warheads all hit their targets at the Kura Missile Test Range in Kamchatka. Marshal Ustinov ‘s torpedo tube system open and in its firing position., Russian MoD In October 2017, submarines from both the Northern and Pacific Fleets also fired both ballistic and cruise missiles during a snap strategic exercise . This event also included the launch of a ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers releasing air-launched cruise missiles . Altogether, the video is an impressive and interesting demonstration of a wide array of capabilities within the Russian Navy. Its overall tone is in line with the Kremlin’s increasingly assertive domestic and foreign policies, as well. In 2018, it seems likely that we will only continue to see Russia work to expand its presence and influence in the Middle East , North Africa , Asia , and elsewhere around the world . Its geo-political competition with the United States and its European allies is only likely to escalate, as well. A major limiting factor in the Navy’s ability to contribute will be continued cuts to the overall Russian defense budget, a result of both a significant drop in the international price of oil, one of Russia’s major exports, and international sanctions following the Kremlin’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and subsequent support for separatists fighting the government in Kiev. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Vladimir Korolyov during the country’s Navy Day celebrations in July 2017., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP Moscow has a desire to significantly expand and modernize its Navy, but has lacked the funds to expand the necessary shipbuilding capacity and otherwise pay for these big budget items. This has already forced the country to shelve plans for new aircraft carriers and destroyers, cut funds for the overhaul of the Admiral Kuznetsov , and delay finishing the refit of the Admiral Nakhimov , and calls into question plans for new amphibious assault ships and fixed-wing naval aircraft . But the Northern Fleet has already been an important tool in implementing Russia revanchist policies and if this video is anything to go by, it looks set to continue to do so in the New Year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 9, 2018",Russia Implies Drone Swarm Attack On Its Base in Syria Linked to US P-8 Patrol Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is advancing a conspiracy theory, without providing any evidence, which suggests a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon patrol plane may have been involved in an attack on its Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The incident has been highly embarrassing for Russian authorities, coming after President Vladimir Putin declared total victory over terrorists in the country, and the Kremlin is increasingly insistent that it could not have occurred without direct foreign support. On Jan. 9, 2018, Russian state-run media outlet, citing an anonymous source within the Russian Ministry of Defense, reported that a P-8A had been flying in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in the vicinity of both Khmeimim, also known as Hmeimim or Hmeymim, and the Syrian port city of Tartus during the time of the attack. The latter location also hosts a Russian naval base , for which the Kremlin signed a new 49-year lease in 2017. “The programming of systems to control unmanned aerial vehicles and drop GPS-guided munitions requires completing engineering studies in a developed country,” the unnamed official told TASS. “Besides, not everyone is capable of calculating exact coordinates using space surveillance data. We would like to stress once again that terrorists did not have anything of that kind until recently.” “It is a strange coincidence that during a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] attack on the Russian military facilities in Syria, a U.S. Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft was cruising for more than four hours over the Mediterranean Sea at an altitude of 7,000 meters,” the source continued. A P-8A Poseidon fires flares during a test., USN The individual never explicitly makes the connection, either that the aircraft was directing the strike or feeding targeting information or other intelligence to the attackers, and does not provide any details to back up any such assertion. U.S. Navy P-8A and older P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft fly routine patrols in the Mediterranean and elsewhere in Europe monitoring various hot spots and potential conflict zones and otherwise supporting American interests. The Navy first deployed Poseidons to the region in 2016, sending seven aircraft from Patrol Squadron Four Five (VP-45) to Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily for a seven-month rotation that wrapped up in April 2017. Also on Jan. 9, 2018, Sputnik, another Russian state media outlet, said authorities were actively looking into a potential link between the P-8A and the attack, citing a statement directly from the country’s Ministry of Defense. The Russian Defense Ministry has since denied it was implying American involvement. The allegation that the United States may be working hand-in-hand with ISIS or other terrorists in Syria is nevertheless obvious. “It is necessary to undergo studies at a qualified engineering school in one of the developed countries to program systems for controlling aircraft-type UAVs and dropping GPS-guided ammunition,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in yet another statement posted on its official facebook page. “Moreover, hardly anyone can get accurate coordinates based on space intelligence data.” There is no actual evidence the bombs the drones dropped on Khmeimim were GPS-guided themselves. The pictures the Russian government released showed mortar bomb-style projectiles that open sources have documented before in Syria and Iraq. This may be a translation error, though, with the individuals referring to the drones, which would have had to use a GPS autopilot to navigate to Khmeimim from rebel- or terrorist-held territory, rather than the munitions themselves. Still, basic GPS coordinates for a large site such as the air base are also readily available online and unclassified imagery of neat lines of Russian aircraft there routinely circulates on social media. A photo of improvised bombs the Russian Ministry of Defense released after the drone swarm attack on Khmeimim Air Base., Russian MoD Russia’s underlying claim that the drones flew dozens of miles to a preset drop point remains unverified, as well, though it is hardly implausible. Already one of the first to report on the attack, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway had suspected these details, true or not, would lead the Russian government to allege foreign and potential American involvement in the drone swarm attack, writing : “First off, it’s interesting Russia is providing all this information on a threat to its own base. Who knows how accurate some of these details really are, but if the number of drones launched at the facility is anywhere near correct, it would seem to be the first self-contained, large scale, coordinated, standoff drone assault on a fixed installation like this. Also of note is the stated range of these drones—over 60 miles. That means they could be launched from well outside regime controlled territory, which makes countering them at their source extremely challenging. On the other hand, Russia could have specifically inserted this detail in its release to make it seem as if the nearby area around the base remains totally uncontested and not subject to a deteriorating security situation. Beyond the drone, rocket, and artillery threat, the Russian Air Force apparently sees shoulder-fired SAMs also as a threat in the immediate area, which points to the possibility that Russia is operating in a more troubled neighborhood than what the Ministry of Defense and the Assad regime commonly let on. Russia’s statement also insinuates that whoever is launching these drones, whether they are an anti-Assad rebel force or a terror related group, is getting some sort of external help in creating these improvised guided missiles of sorts. We’ll have to see where this road leads and if Russia begins to allude more clearly to the possibility that state actors may have some kind of a hand in these attacks.” The assertion that the United States and its allies are actually in league with ISIS, which it sees as indistinct from other groups in Syria opposed to the regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad, is a long-standing conspiracy theory . This is not the first time the Russians have made such allegations , either. The latest string of attacks on Khmeimim is particularly uncomfortable, though, coming after Putin’s triumphant victory tour to Syria and other countries in the region in December 2017. Separately, TASS reported about concerns that Russian warships at Tartus could come under attack from terrorist drone boats. This is a tactic that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have employed with some success against vessels belonging to the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in Yemen. Infamously, in 2000, Al Qaeda terrorists had also used a manned suicide boat in a deadly attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Cole as it sat in port in the Yemeni city of Aden. A Russian naval infantryman appears to fire at a derelict ship near the country’s base in Tartus during exercises with Syrian forces in April 2017., Dmitriy Vinogradov/Sputnik via AP This second TASS story further touched on the potential for terrorists to launch drone swarm attacks on other Russian sites in Syria, including “diplomatic facilities,” as well. In addition, some of the named experts the outlet interviewed reaffirmed the belief that terrorists in Syria could not have launched the Khmeimim attack, or launch future drone swarm operations, without active outside assistance. “I can name [drone] production centers: NATO countries, including the United States, Middle East countries (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel), as well as Turkey and Asia Pacific countries,” Igor Korotchenkov, editor-in-chief of the National Defense magazine, told TASS. But “it is impossible to say what exact country was behind the attack without reliable intelligence data.” Others downplayed the requirement for heavy outside involvement. “It’s a secret to no one that Islamic State militants used drones made in other countries in Syria and Iraq, but the Russian defense ministry’s photos feature clandestine UAVs assembled from commercially available components,” Denis Fedutinov, editor-in-chief of the Unmanned Aviation magazine, explained to TASS. One of the drones Russia put on display after the swarm attack on Khmeimim Air Base., Russian MoD According to Sputnik, the U.S. military has formally denied any involvement in the incident. The Pentagon has also rightly stressed that the technology necessary to build the drones is available on the open market. Since the Russian government has not provided any evidence, real or otherwise, it’s hard to say how far they might take these allegations. It is possible that they are simply trying to muddy the waters, as they appear to have done in other instances , which could prompt suspicion about any future reports about complex attacks Khmeimim. What does seem clear is that there will be more of these types of swarm attacks, both on land and potentially at sea, and the Russians seem well aware of this fact.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An image has emerged on social media that reportedly shows a CASA CN-235 aircraft flying somewhere over eastern Syriaâ€™s Al Hasakah Governorate. The photo appears to show one of a fleet of shadowy U.S. Air Force-owned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance versions of the plane, one of which spent more than a week in 2017 flying over Seattle, Washington as part of a secretive training mission. You can read more about these specialized CN-235 aircraft and their potential capabilities in detail in a past feature here at The War Zone . French journalist Harry Boone posted a version of the image on Twitter on Jan. 6, 2018. Shot from the ground, the aircraft is flying against a clear blue sky and there are no reference points that could help confirm its location. The photo is low quality, but there are a number of distinct features visible that line up with one of the six known U.S. Air Force CN-235s, which researchers and observers believe are part of the 427th Special Operations Squadron .Â Under the forward fuselage, offset to the left, there is what appears to be the camera door which is found on these unique American aircraft. What looks like the cluster of ventral antennas between the main landing gear is also visible. Most importantly, there is a fairing on the aircraftâ€™s empennage, which looks similar, if not identical to the ones on the U.S. Air Force types.

An edited version of the reported image of the CN-235 flying over Eastern Syria, highlighting the particular features of interest., via Harry Boone And while we canâ€™t confirm the aircraftâ€™s exact location, eastern Syria has been a hotbed of U.S. special operations forces activity , focused predominantly on hunting ISIS terrorists and advising local forces , since at least 2015 , if not well before then . American troops have now established a constellation of forward operating bases in the country to support those operations. In March 2017, aircraft spotters noticed one of the aircraft, serial number 96-6046, on open source flight tracking software appearing to be heading toward Jordan. In November 2017, another one of the fleet, serial number 96-6043, showed up on the same websites heading east, with stops in Spain and the Italian island of Sardinia. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ US Air Force CASA CN235 96-6046 REACH53 pic.twitter.com/xSuOUq5nzQ — CivMilAir âœˆğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ (@CivMilAir) March 12, 2017 pic.twitter.com/NYkmlkJH6A — CivMilAir âœˆğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ (@CivMilAir) November 9, 2017 Likely launch points for actual missions over Eastern Syria could include air bases in Jordan, facilities in Northern Iraqâ€™s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and sites in Turkey. We already know that the main airport in the Iraqi Kurdish capital Erbil alone has hosted other shy aircraft, including a discreetly marked Beechcraft King Air intelligence gathering aircraft, contractor-operated S-92 helicopters, and a pair of experimental OV-10G+ Bronco light attack planes, both of which worked closely with elements of the equally secretive Joint Special Operations Command. As for what the CN-235 might have been doing specifically over Syria, based on our previous analysis, it is very likely that the aircraft in the Air Forceâ€™s fleet have a persisent wide-area aerial surveillance (WAAS) capability, as well as a signals intelligence suite. They may also have the ability to focus their search based on geo-location information straight from the National Security Agency about a particular targetâ€™s cell phone. This combination of sensors would be ideal for persistent surveillance as special operators hunt for and gather intelligence on individual terrorists or specific groups, as we explained in our earlier feature: Some WAAS sensors require the aircraft to fly tight overhead orbits,  while others work at a slant angle in relation to the ground.  Considering the mounting location and aperture size on the CN-235 in  question, this kind of “slant” setup would likely be the case. Also, the counterclockwise orbits the aircraft flies, between roughly six and  twelve miles across, at altitudes from 17,000 to 22,000 feet, also  indicate such a setup. Above all else, these types of surveillance systems are especially good at capturing and monitoring so called “patterns of life” over and around a target area. This is an especially useful tool when  collecting intelligence on an enemy target or group of targets over time and can open up new possibilities when it comes to the  process of  finding, fixing and finishing the enemy. Simply put, instead of  recording a snapshot in time such as what a satellite can furnish,  persistent airborne surveillance sensors capture massive amounts of  exploitable information over hours and days. So if a picture is akin to a thousand words, this persistent type of wide area aerial surveillance  is equivalent to an entire novel or even a series of novels. When paired with communications intelligence gathering, such as intercepting radio communications and mobile and satellite phone chatter, a high fidelity “picture” of a targeted area and how specific targets in that area operate can be compiled in a relatively short period of time, all using a single relatively economical asset. Also, the aircraftâ€™s extensive communications suite can take this information, including streaming video, and send it to a command center around the world or relay it to regional ground stations. As such, it can likely provide high-fidelity overwatch of ongoing special operations mission, and relay that video and/or audio to commanders in real time. These capabilities are also especially useful in dense urban areas, where it might otherwise be difficult to positively identify small targets or specific individuals and in turn reduce the chance of inadvertently killing innocent civilians in a subsequent strike or raid. As such, it is possible that the Air Force’s CN-235 flying over Seattle was conducting a realistic training exercise ahead of its deployment to the Middle East. Simulated surveillance missions over a real city full of neutral bystanders would have given the crew valuable experience regardless. One of the US Air Force’s CN-235s, serial number 96-6042, near Seattle Washington in 2017., Russell Hill – Sabian404 at Flickr Whatever the case, the surveillance capabilities offered by the CN-235s are likely to become even more important in the near future. Though the United States , the Iraqi government , and the Russians have all declared ISISâ€™ dream of a physical caliphate to be effectively over, the group has gone back to its insurgent roots and remains a very real threat. As the group has lost physical territory, its members have dispersed into less populate areas or otherwise gone into hiding, making them more difficult to locate without persistent monitoring across broader areas.Â And it’s clear the United States and its partners are still actively hunting for members of the organization and senior leaders. Between October and December 2017, the U.S.-led coalition said it had killed nearly 20 named terrorists in targeted operations in both Iraq and Syria. Among these individuals was Abu Walid al Qamishli, who the U.S. military said had controlled a â€œnetwork of fighters in Hasakah Province,â€ according to an official press release . By April 2017, the Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the official name of the overarching American-led unit in charge of special operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, had already killed more than 21,000 terrorists in both countries. An official statement added that the elite multi-national force had been responsible for liberating more than 17,000 square miles of territory from ISIS. We at The War Zone have discussed in depth how intelligence gathering , especially airborne surveillance , has been central to counter-terrorism operations around the world. It looks as if American special operators and their partners will be continuing their missions in Iraq and Syria for the foreseeable future, as well. In November 2017, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis implied there could be a long-term mission for American forces in both countries. An MC-130J Commando II special operations transport refuels during a mission over Iraq or Syria in May 2017., USAF â€œThe enemy [ISIS] hasnâ€™t declared that theyâ€™re done with the area yet, so weâ€™ll keep fighting as long as they want to fight,â€ he told reporters at the Pentagon on Nov. 13, 2017. â€œWe’re going to have to make certain that 2.0 doesn’t pop right out of the ground.â€ It not entirely clear what form the mission, especially in Syria, will take on as it evolves though. The Syrian government , along with its Russian and Iranian benefactors, has called the American presence in the countryâ€™s Eastern provinces illegal and tantamount to an occupation. â€œWhat we will be doing is shifting from what I would call an offensive â€“ shifting from an offensive, terrain-seizing approach, to a stabilizing â€“ making certain the diplomats â€“ you’ll see more U.S. diplomats on the ground, for example,â€ Mattis stressed during another press conference on Dec. 29, 2017, though it was unclear if he was speaking about Iraq, Syria, or both. â€œThe military would move them around â€“ our diplomats around, make certain they’re protected.â€ Members of the US Army’s 5th Special Forces Group keep proficient with their vehicle-mounted weapons on an impromptu firing range in Southern Syria., US Army Special operations forces in Syria have also acted as de facto peacekeepers in the past, blocking certain movements by different factions. The United States also has a formal, if dubious agreement with Russia that has set a fixed boundary between the two countriesâ€™ operations. In his December 2017 comments, Mattis added that it would take a civilian-run effort in order to help local elements re-establish basic services and other civil institutions and restore â€œnormalcyâ€ to areas that ISIS previously occupied. The U.S. military has already officially turned over control of Raqqa to a local council, but continues to insist that it hasnâ€™t and will not take sides in Syriaâ€™s grueling civil war, instead relying on an internationally mediated peace process. In April 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did voice continued support for a final resolution that involved dictator Bashar Al Assad stepping aside as the countryâ€™s leader. The U.S. State Department has had a Syria Transition Assistance and Response Team, now based in Turkey , since 2012, with the stated goal of being on hand to aid in post-conflict reconstruction efforts. In the meantime, American special operators and conventional forces are focused on making sure ISIS doesnâ€™t have a chance to regroup. Persistent surveillance, including with discreet spy planes such as the Air Forceâ€™s CN-235s, will only continue be an essential part of that mission, especially as the militants goes back into hiding to launch terrorist attacks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2021",USAF Eyeing New Props and Upgraded Engines To Breathe Extra Life Into Old C-130Hs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly a decade of on-again-off-again testing, a one-of-a-kind C-130H Hercules airlifter from the Wyoming Air National Guard is on its way for an evaluation of its latest configuration, which includes upgraded engines and eight-bladed propellers with an advanced electronic control system. Refitting other H-model aircraft with the same modifications could potentially save the U.S. Air Force millions in operating costs, but it’s unclear when this might happen. On Jan. 6, 2018, the C-130H from the Wyoming Air National Guard’s 153rd Airlift Wing, serial number 92-1536, arrived at the unit’s home at Cheyenne Regional Airport in the state’s capital. The aircraft would receive minor repairs before heading to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida for two years of tests, according a report from the Wyoming Tribute Eagle . “It’s a culmination of years of effort for the [153rd Airlift Wing] and for the Wyoming Air National Guard,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Paul Lyman, commander of the Wyoming Air National Guard, told the Tribute Eagle . “All we have now is postulated data, but we will see performance [with the modified H model] that is on the par with the J model,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Kevin Campbell, the National Guard director of plans and requirements, added. Since 2008 , the 92-1536 has served as test bed for a number of proposed modifications to more than 130 other H-series aircraft still in service across the Air National Guard. The aircraft now has three particularly significant sets of improvements. The 153rd’s modified C-130H, serial number 92-1536., USAF The most noticeable is the addition of eight-bladed Hamilton Sundstrand NP2000 propellers to each of the four turboprop engines. These are already standard on the U.S. Navy’s E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft and C-2 Greyhound carrier on-board delivery (COD) planes. The new propellers vibrate less and make less noise and the aircraft gains increased thrust at equivalent engine torque settings, in turn improving fuel efficiency. A built-in balancing system reduces the need for ground crews to balance the prop manually at regular intervals and fewer vibrations mean less stress on the aircraft as a whole, further reducing the need for maintenance. As an added bonus, the NP2000 is a modular design that takes up less storage space in warehouses or room inside any aircraft, ship, or vehicle delivering spares to established bases or deployed locations. On top of that, the updated aircraft has an electronic propeller control system, or EPCS, that makes the units more responsive when the crew rapidly advances the throttle. This Air National Guard says this improves the overall reliability of the propellers by approximately 50 percent and removes a safety issue that had contributed to previous mishaps. The latest addition to 92-1536 is four Rolls-Royce T-56 Series 3.5 turboprop engines that are more fuel efficient and reliable, saving an estimated $250,000 dollars every year on the cost to operate each aircraft, according to the manufacturer’s website . The 153rd’s prototype C-130H during a test in 2016 of how the aircraft handled when carrying with the Modular Airborne Firefighting System II, or MAFFS II ., USAF The U.K.-headquartered engine maker completed flight testing of the uprated design in 2012 and the Air Force certified it in 2015. In addition to being an option for older C-130s, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has installed the engines on its WP-3D hurricane hunter aircraft. “We’re confident right now that we’ll see in excess of 12 percent fuel savings and upwards of 25 percent increased time on wing, which will reduce maintenance time,” Colonel Campbell said in 2016 . “Those are substantial, and would provide a fairly rapid return on investment. This upgrade would pay for itself; the real question is ‘how fast?’ We’re pretty excited about it and think we’re going to hit it at about the 5 year mark.” At present, the Air National Guard is hoping to modify 134 more C-130Hs to this standard as part of an upgrade program that will cost approximately $1.3 billion in total. Taken together, though, the modifications could potentially save millions in operating and sustainment costs for the aging airlifters. But it’s not clear when this project might wrap up, or even really get going. In February 2016, Rolls Royce did deliver the first Series 3.5 engine upgrade kits to the Air National Guard as part of a $36 million dollar contract, but which only covered the aircraft belonging to the 109th and 153rd Airlift Wings. As already noted, though, the first of these upgrades have been in the works since 2008. At that time, the main focus was updating the capability of the ski-equipped LC-130Hs of the New York Air National Guard’s 109th Airlift Wing, a fleet of unique aircraft that support the U.S. government’s Antarctic research missions. A modified LC-130H with the NP2000 propellers., USAF These aircraft rely on jet-assisted take-off, or JATO, to get off the ice for the return trip. The problem was that the Air Force had a dwindling supply of these rocket motors, which it first bought in the 1950s. The Air National Guard initially considered the NP2000 upgrade by itself as a possible solution, hiring Lockheed Martin to modify a small number of LC-130Hs before shelving the effort. There was also interest within the Air Force’s special operations community in the NP2000, the EPCS, and 3.5 Series engines, among other upgrades, which could have potentially expanded the capabilities of MC-130H Combat Talon II special operations transport and reduced its auditory signature. The latter point was of particular interest given the aircraft’s mission to insert and extract elite troops from austere locations with limited take-off and landing space within hostile territory. Though there would be a “high initial cost,” Air Force Special Operations Command estimated adding the NP2000s would have resulted in a three percent fuel saving across MC-130H operations, reduced the aircraft’s take-off run by between 500 to 1000 feet, increased its ceiling by 1,000 feet, and provided a five percent increase in reliability. The 3.5 Series engines could have led to an eight percent fuel savings and a more than 20 percent improvement in aircraft reliability, along with nearly 20 percent more thrust. A slide from a briefing describing various potential MC-130H (MCH) and J (MCJ) model upgrades., USAF via FOIA Another slide specifically discussing the NP2000., USAF via FOIA Those upgrades did not come to pass, however. In 2015, the Air Force retired the first MC-130H as part of move to ultimately replace the fleet with MC-130Js. That same year, the service retired the AC-130H gunship, as well. The H-based AC-130U and AC-130W remain in service, but the plan is for the new AC-130J to eventually supplant at least the U models. In August 2017, Inside Defense reported that the New York Air National Guard was in talks with Lockheed Martin about a potential LC-130J model to outright replace its older aircraft. All of this reflects a steadily, if slowly shrinking C-130H fleet across both the active Air Force and its reserve components, all of which could reduce the impetus to pursue the upgrade project. As of 2014 , the Air National Guard had a requirement to upgrade 154 H-models. The next year , this number had dropped to 135. By 2020, when the tests of the latest iteration of the Wyoming Air National Guard’s prototype upgraded C-130H finish up, the total fleet may have shrunk even more. The last active duty H-model headed to the Bone Yard in October 2017. In addition, the C-130Hs, which first entered service in 1974, are running up against separate airworthiness issues as the aircraft’s center wing box ages out. Between 2007 and 2013, Lockheed Martin received a more than $650 million contract to replace these sections on more than 100 H-model aircraft, but not nearly the entire fleet across the active and reserve components. The plan also involved slowing the C-130J production by taking newly made wing boxes off that assembly line and installing them in older aircraft. C-130H 92-1536 taxies during an earlier test., USAF Though the engine and propeller upgrades could expand their capability, the remaining C-130Hs might still need a another service life extension program in order to keep flying long enough for the cost savings to materialize. As of 2007, adding a new wing box cost to just one of the older aircraft an estimated $6.5 million . At the same time, Lockheed Martin is continuing produce the more advanced C-130J, as well as LM-100Js for the civilian commercial market. As time goes on, and unit prices drop, the Air Force may decide it is simpler and not significantly more expensive to just replace the older C-130Hs. The cost factor may be increasingly less an issue overall if President Donald Trump and his administration can follow through on their plans to dramatically expand the United States’ defense budget. All told, by the time the 153rd’s C-130H returns from Florida, at which point this modernization effort will have effectively been going on for more than a decade, the Air National Guard’s understanding of its future needs, and its available options, may have change significantly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 11, 2019",US Navy Expects Its Carrier Onboard Delivery Ospreys to be Fully Operational By 2024,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has revealed new details about its schedule to replace the C-2A Greyhound carrier on-board delivery (COD) aircraft with the CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor, what bases will host the new aircraft, and their missions. Though serious questions remain about just how well the Osprey is suited to the task, the service says it hopes new aircraft will be fully operational in 2024 and the transition will be complete by 2028. Navy pilot James Wallace recently shared an awesome in-depth look at what it was like to fly the C-2A Greyhound with The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway, which you can find here . At present, the Navy is hoping the first CMV-22B units will be operational by 2020 – a year earlier than it had planned in 2016 – and that the type will reach full operational capability four years later, ahead of the C-2A’s official retirement in 2026. The full fleet of 38 Ospreys is slated to take over for the 27 Greyhounds, which will reach the end of their official service lives by 2026, no later than 2028. The service-specific version of the tilt-rotor will have additional fuel and communications gear compared to the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps variants , as well as a public address system in the main cabin. Bell-Boeing concept art for the aircraft does show a very distinct “towel rack” radio antenna along the rear fuselage. “The increased number of [CMV-22B] aircraft … is needed because the current inventory of C-2A aircraft is not sufficient to meet the mission requirements,” the service explained in a draft environmental assessment it released earlier in January 2018, which USNI News was first to report on . “Facilities and support must be in place and operational at the first main operating base by October 2020 to support the first detachment’s unit level training, which would lead up to deployment.” This document is focused primarily on the service’s ongoing decision process about where to situate the one planned Fleet Replacement Squadron, or FRS, which will be responsible for training the CMV-22B crews. Since 1994, Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron One Two Zero (VAW-120) has conducted both E-2 Hawkeye and C-2A Greyhound training at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. A US Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey takes off from the aircraft carrier USS George Washington during disaster relief operations in the Philippines in 2013., USN VAW-120 has five Greyhounds, in addition to another 12 C-2As at Norfolk that are part of the operational Logistics Support Squadron Four Zero (VRC-40). Logistics Support Squadron Three Zero operates the remaining 10 aircraft from Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California, with three of these permanently deployed in Japan to support operations in and around East Asia. In the environmental assessment the Navy said it did consider consolidating all of its CMV-22B operations at a single base for logistical and cost-saving reasons. However, it determined that this simply would not work given the service’s world-wide demands . A C-2A Greyhound from VRC-40 lands on board the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in 2015., USN “Carrier on-board delivery requirements persist on each coast in support of rapid response to international events in Atlantic, Mediterranean, Persian Gulf, and Pacific theaters,” the review explained. “Single siting of Navy V-22 squadrons would diminish rapid response capabilities in a particular theater.” From locations on each coast, the C-2As provide carrier on-board deliver, or COD, support to the Navy’s supercarriers. The aircraft shuttle personnel, spare parts, mail, and other supplies to and from the ships and bases ashore. It’s an absolutely vital, but often thankless mission, which retired naval aviator and Greyhound pilot James Wallace was kind enough to share candid and granular details about with The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway in November 2017. From Wallace’s description, a replacement for the C-2A, a quirky design Grumman derived from the Hawkeye early warning radar plane in the 1960s, could be a boon to the COD community, as would having a training squadron dedicated to the mission. The Navy’s decision on where to situate the FRS will be an important part of keeping its present plans to replace the Greyhound on track. The first option the environmental assessment outlines is to put the CMV-22B school house at North Island. This would add an additional 13 aircraft to the site, along with more than 340 additional personnel, not to mention the added air traffic the training mission would bring. Norfolk, not surprisingly, would see a net loss of aircraft and sailors under this plan. A map showing the proposed changes to Naval Air Station North Island to accommodate the CMV-22B., USN The second possibility would be to situate the unit in Norfolk where VAW-120 is already conducting the COD training. Under this proposed course of action, both the base in Virginia and North Island would see increases in both airframes and personnel. Both alternatives would involve significant construction to either expand or otherwise modify the existing facilities to accommodate the new aircraft. An annotated map of North Island notes the Navy would need to demolish more than a dozen buildings if it decided to establish the FRS on the base. A map showing the proposed changes to Naval Station Norfolk to accommodate the CMV-22B., USN Perhaps more importantly, both sites would need significant repaving and heat treating on aprons and taxiways to handle the hot jet exhaust from the tilt-rotors, which blasts nearly straight down during engine starts and stops and as they maneuver to and from the runway. This will be an issue for the ships the CMV-22B will operate from, too. The cost of the construction at North Island will cost an estimated more than $130 million, while the work at Norfolk would have a price tag of less than $45 million. Inside VRC-30’s hangar at NAS North Island., Tyler Rogoway But whatever option the Navy chooses, it expects the FRS to take approximately a decade to establish, which will mark the end of the transition to the CMV-22B from the C-2A. In the meantime, the Marines will be responsible for training the Osprey pilots and crews. The Navy trainees will join the Marine’s own MV-22B training unit, Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron Two Zero Four (VMMT-204), situated at Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina. The Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training, also at New River, will serve as the initial pipeline for the service’s CMV-22B maintainers. A US Marine Corps MV-22B from VMMT-204 lands at Marine Corps Air Station New River., USMC Beyond just transitioning aircraft, the review also reiterated the Navy’s understanding that the shift from the C-2 to the CMV-22B will have a broader impact on the COD mission as a whole . The service contends that the tilt-rotor Osprey will be more flexible than the fixed-wing Greyhound and operate from more varied locations ashore. “Unlike the C-2A, the Navy V-22 would not be tied to runways ashore,” the assessment said. “Because the Navy V-22 can be refueled in the air, it can span vast ocean distances on deployment and achieve its carrier on-board delivery mission despite a paucity of land bases.” The CMV-22B will be able to land on carriers or other ships in the associated strike group and deliver cargo or passengers at night, as well, something the Navy does not do with the C-2A. Since it won’t require the use of a catapult for take offs or arresting gear to land, it will be able to perform its mission even if those systems are not operating, either because the rest of the air wing is not conducting active operations or for some other reason. It will also take less personnel to launch and recover the Ospreys in general. “It takes about six folks to launch and recover an Osprey,” Navy Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, the service’s top aviation officer noted in 2016. “It would take about 40 or so to man up the ship to bring in the [C-2A] COD.” On top of that, the Osprey will be able to aid in the vertical replenishment mission, as well as act as a shuttle between carriers and other surface combatants. At present, the MH-60R and -S helicopters within the carrier air wings perform these missions, as do other helicopters assigned to other ships. The CMV-22B could eliminate the need for the “hub and spoke” arrangement of distributing cargo and passengers from the COD aircraft to other ships in the strike group. An MH-60S from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt prepared to pick up cargo from the dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Amelia Earhart , USN The Ospreys have their own sling-load capability which gives it more overall lift capacity than the Greyhound, 10,000 versus 8,500 pounds, and offers additional options for maneuvering large or awkward loads. At least in theory, the tilt-rotors might give the carrier even more flexibility to support non-combat missions, such as non-combatant evacuation operations or disaster relief efforts, as well. “The Navy V-22 will be able to handle greater cargo weight capacity than the C-2A, fly at comparable speeds and land vertically on carriers and smaller naval surface combatant vessels,” according to the assessment. “These enhanced capabilities will ensure effective and efficient fleet logistics support in any theater.” Tyler Rogoway These assertions leave out some critical points, though. The claim that the Ospreys will have “greater cargo weight capacity” than the Greyhounds deftly avoids the criticism that the tilt-rotors might not be able to accommodate the same large and oddly-shaped loads internally, especially enclosed replacement engines for other aircraft. Former C-2 pilot Wallace brought this up specifically when talking about the CMV-22B as a replacement, saying : I know for their peculiar reasons the Navy wants the V-22 Osprey to do the COD’s job now. I don’t see it. Engines were our primary hauling job and it simply can’t do it, the Osprey doesn’t have enough cargo volume in the cabin. We had H-53s in our squadron as an experiment to do our job and it couldn’t do it either. This is not a minor issue. Bringing replacement parts, and complete engines in particular, is a critical wartime COD mission since the Navy expects its Hornets, Super Hornets, and forthcoming F-35C Joint Strike Fighters will rack up flight hours during any high-intensity conflict. Though carriers have on-board facilities to perform much of the required maintenance on the carrier air wing’s aircraft, getting fresh engines is critical to sustained operations and drastically speeds up the process of getting the jets back flying missions. This has been an issue for Marine Corps, as well, since the service has similar needs with regards to the F-35B Joint Strike Fighters on board the Navy’s amphibious assault ships. In 2015, the Marines did demonstrate the ability to use an MV-22B to carry modules of the jet’s F135 engine on a special skid. The B-model’s lift fan, which it uses to land and take off vertically, has to travel separately via sling-load. The Marines and the Navy refined the pallet’s design to make loading easier and engine maker Pratt & Whitney delivered the first production version of the system in August 2017 . Marines and sailors load an F135 engine onto an Osprey during a test in 2015., USMC But while the arrangement may be workable, it also exposes the engine to its surrounding environment without a protective shroud, and especially to corrosive sea air and salt water spray, during loading and unloading. The palletized load also requires ground crews to remove certain components in order for it to fit inside the Osprey, which maintainers would have to install again before putting the complete engine into an aircraft. The present shipping methods keep entire engines safely inside a container. There are concerns about just maneuvering the Ospreys around a carrier’s crowded flight deck, too. In 2016, the Marines provided four MV-22Bs for a proof of concept test aboard the USS Carl Vinson . What the Navy found was that the turn-around time for the tilt-rotors might be longer and might hog flight deck space and impede other simultaneous launch and recover operations and other activities. The main issue is that the Osprey’s engines are inoperable when its main wing and rotor blades are folded, meaning it can’t taxi to a parking spot in its most compact configuration. As such, the concept the service employed during the experiment was to load and unload right in one of two designated landing areas, one of which is right at the rear of the flight deck and would prevent any other aircraft from landing. At present, when the Greyhounds touch down on a carrier, crews fold the wings and move off to the side to load and unload, clearing the landing area. A C-2A starts up on the ramp at NAS North Island., Tyler Rogoway The CMV-22B is also not pressurized, limiting its operating altitude, especially with passengers riding in the back. The Osprey can already carry three fewer individuals in its main cabin compared to the Greyhounds. More importantly, this means bad weather is more likely to limit the tilt-rotor’s ability to conduct its long-range resupply mission. The C-2A with its pressurized cabin can simply fly above many storms and other severe weather patterns. This means crews do not have to fly circuitous routes around them, or risk going through them, in order to get to and from the carriers. The Greyhounds also simply fly faster than the Ospreys, which further extends the overall transit times for the tilt-rotors. In 2015, Navy planned to purchase 10 more V-22 types in total, as well, for a total of 48. It remains to be seen just how well the fleet of less than 40 CMV-22Bs, only a portion of which will be in operational units, will be able to tackle the world-wide COD mission. Of course, this will already be a substantial increase in total airframes assigned to the mission over the existing fleet of C-2As. In addition, any budgetary considerations that limited the size of the fleet may not be the same hurdle it once was, though, seeing as President Donald Trump and his administration have promised to significantly increase defense spending. As such, it is also possible that the Navy may find it easier to add additional CMV-22Bs to meet the additional demands. The Navy is fully committed to the replacement plan now, regardless, and has a firm idea of when it expects to make the shift, for better or worse.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has acknowledged an attack on its Khmeimim air base in Syria, but has disputed key details from an initial report, denying that seven aircraft had been destroyed in the incident. At the same time, unconfirmed pictures have begun emerging on social media showing significant damage to at least one Su-24 Fencer attack plane. On Jan. 4, 2017, the Russia’s Ministry of Defense, by way of state-run media outlet TASS , said militants had attacked Khmeimim, also known as Hmeimim or Hmeymim, and killed two Russian service members in the process. The Kremlin did not say if there were any other casualties, but insisted that earlier reports that the assault had destroyed seven aircraft were categorically false. On Jan. 3, 2017, independent Russian daily Kommersant had reported this detail and that the enemy force had wounded 10 individuals, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. “On December 31, 2017, at nightfall, the Hmeymim airfield came under a sudden mortar fire from a mobile militant subversive group,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said, according to TASS. “A report in the Kommersant newspaper on the alleged destruction of seven Russian warplanes at the Hmeymim airbase is fake. Russia’s air group in Syria is combat ready and continues to accomplish all its missions in full.” It is important to note that this denial does not say militants were not successful in destroying any aircraft, just that the report of seven aircraft destroyed in total is inaccurate. And the reported loss of aircraft would hardly render the Russian air contingent in Syria combat ineffective. Su-24 Fencer attack aircraft sit parked closely together at Khmeimim in 2016. , Maksim Blinov/Sputnik via AP According to Kommersant , militants had destroyed four Su-24 Fencer attack planes, two Su-35S fighter jets, and an An-72 tactical transport. Past satellite imagery has shown as many as six Su-35s and nearly a dozen Su-24s, along with a variety of other fighter and ground attack aircraft, such as the very active Su-25 Frogfoots , on the ground at the base. As we at The War Zone have already noted , this imagery also shows the aircraft parked very close together without any defensive bulwarks between them. As such, it is not at all implausible that a very limited attack could have set off a chain reaction of sorts leading to a number of aircraft ending up with severe damage. Live munitions have also often been seen stored in close proximity to tactical aircraft at the base. Additional unconfirmed reports and images have begun to appear on social media, most notably a post from war correspondent Roman Saponkov on the site VKontakte, or VK, a Russian-language analogue to Facebook. His post indicated that as many as a dozen of Russia’s fixed wing aircraft and helicopters had ended up with at least some damage, but that at least some of the Su-24s and Su-35s were back in action. Saponkov attached a set of photos that appear to show an Su-24 armed with live bombs and leaking fluid from where a piece of shrapnel had punctured the fuselage. Other pictures show the mangled tail section of an Su-24. The jet’s tail number, White 29, is reportedly the same as an aircraft that deployed from Shagol air base in Russia to Syria in the past. The images show a rainy environment, and the local weather has included precipitation as of late, and especially on the next morning following the attack. Significant questions about the incident still remain, however. Khmeimim is situated deep inside territory that Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies firmly control and rebel groups and terrorists lack the means to strike the site directly from areas in which they operate freely. The lack of revetments or other defenses at the base separating individual aircraft would seem imply that the Russians felt the site was essentially immune to a direct assault. To launch an attack with a mortar, the type of weapon that both Kommersant and TASS said militants used in the incident, would require the enemy force to get deep into a regime area, and near the highly patrolled air base itself, without detection. Aside from the primary narrative that this was an indirect fire attack, another possibility is that rebels or terrorists used a small quad- or hex-copter style drone with an improvised payload to launch the attack remotely. ISIS has already demonstrated this capability in both Iraq and Syria . There have also been rumors that Russian-backed insurgents in Eastern Ukraine, or the country’s own security services, used a very similar tactic to launch a devastating attack on an ammunition dump in the Ukrainian city of Balakliya. On the other hand, we do know that the base is defended by a very dense air defense network, including Pantsir-S1 point defense systems that are thought to be capable of detecting and taking down small, slow-moving drones. The system is also thought to be somewhat capable of shooting down incoming mortars and small artillery rockets as well, something Russia says it has done at the base multiple times in the past. That doesn’t mean these types of targets couldn’t have slipped by, or even that the system was online or in a spot to execute a firing solution at the time of the attack. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aJpKJ–ZPq8 The attack itself would seem to raise its own questions about whether Assad’s position is truly as stable as it increasingly appeared in 2017 . On Dec. 27, 2017, Chief of the Russian General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov, had said that Russia would keep a contingent in Syria for the foreseeable future “to maintain stability and territorial integrity,” as well as promote the Kremlin’s own interests in the Middle East. Russian personnel assemble bombs at the country’s base in Latakia in 2016., Maksim Blinov/Sputnik via AP Regardless, it would be a major achievement for any such group, especially in light of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit in which he declared total victory over terrorists in the country. As yet, though, no anti-regime factions, including ISIS or Al Qaeda-linked groups, have claimed responsibility for the attack. There is also a remote possibility that the incident was actually an accident. Kommersant ’s report said the attack had destroyed ammunition storage facility at the base, but this could have been the site of an initial explosion. This would seem unlikely, though, given the Kremlin’s decision to pin the attack on terrorists, despite Putin’s earlier claims about soundly defeating those groups. In addition, on Dec. 31, 2017, an Mi-24 gunship helicopter had crashed in Syria and the Russian government stressed that this had been the result of a technical failure rather than enemy action. Whatever the case, we will continue to follow this story and provide updates as additional information emerges.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",USAF Uses Textron’s Scorpion Jet As the Latest Testbed for Its Modular Sensor Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has conducted yet another test of its advanced AgilePod modular sensor pod , fit checking it under the wing of Textron’s Scorpion light jet . It’s curious that the service chose to use an airplane it has no official interest in buying to test this promising technology, but the partnership could offer other benefits for both parties. The experiment occurred at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio in December 2017 .  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has been working on AgilePod, a registered trademark the service owns, since 2016 . The pod is part of the larger Blue Guardian program, which is focused on exploring modular sensor suites and readily adaptable software and other systems to run them and potentially expand their capabilities in the future. “We showed the openness of the pod by taking an aircraft with a standard set of mechanical and electrical interfaces and attaching the pod,” Andrew Soine, an electronics systems engineer with AFRL Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, told the service’s reporters. “We demonstrated the AgilePod’s plug-and-play ability to rapidly integrate on an open architecture platform.” The ability to load up the pod and get it working with any aircraft, manned or unmanned, with the appropriate pylons and electrical linkages is a key part of the overall concept. The initial system itself consisted of multiple separate building blocks, either 28- or 33-inches long, each of which could accommodate different payloads. A complete pod would contain three to five of these individual units. AgilePod under the wing of Textron’s Scorpion in December 2017., USAF In October 2017, AFRL disclosed that it was working on a Mini AgilePod that would have the means to accommodate at least three different sensor systems within a single readily adaptable single section. The Air Force plans to eventually build small, medium, and large systems that better suited to different types of sensors and aircraft. The underlying idea is to give deployed units the ability to rapidly swap out systems as necessary to give aviators the best mixture of systems for their particular mission. The version the Air Force test fitted to the Scorpion had two separate sensor turrets that could contain electro-optical, infrared, or multi-spectral cameras, or some combination thereof.  By placing multiple sensors in a single pod, aircraft could improve their situational awareness while still keeping limited hardpoint space free for other stores. A diagram showing the Mini AgilePod concept., USAF With its modular and adaptable architecture, AgilePod’s capabilities will only grow, especially as sensor suites continue to shrink in overall size. The system might even be able to accommodate other types of equipment in the future, such as communication nodes , electronic or cyber warfare packages, or miniature munitions . The concept could be particularly game-changing for wide-area aerial surveillance missions, since individual sensors, such Elbit Systems’ SkyEye WAPS , are small enough to take the place of a typical camera turret, but can monitor multiple zones of interest at once. An AgilePod with more than one of these cameras would be able to collect imagery across a very broad area in a single pass. Separately, the U.S. military is working on artificial intelligence systems to help parse the visuals quickly for potential threats or other notable objects. Combining this capability with Textron’s Scorpion could make for a particularly cost-effective pairing, especially given the jet’s own modular design and open architecture payload bays. With more sensors or extra fuel internally and an AgilePod under the wing, the plane could be particularly useful for border patrols or maritime surveillance or to conduct more persistent intelligence gathering missions, especially in lower-threat environments. With one or more datalinks, it could feed targeting or situational information to other aircraft or troops on the ground or engage the enemy with its own precision guided weapons. After Saudi Arabia conducted a brief evaluation of the aircraft in November 2017, we at The War Zone took an in-depth look at the various missions the aircraft would be able to take on, which you can find here . The Scorpion light jet., Textron But it’s less clear why the Air Force decided to approach Textron about using the Scorpion in this particular test in the first place. The service did include the jet in its light attack experiment in 2017, also known as OA-X, but made clear that the aircraft did not have the desired capabilities to progress to a future second round combat evaluation. Ostensibly, the point of using the Scorpion was to see just how easy it might be to load up the AgilePod onto an entirely new platform on short notice. According to the Air Force, Textron had a week to make sure one of its demonstrators would work with the sensor system. “We met with the Textron Aviation Defense Scorpion team and discussed the possibility of doing a fit check with their Scorpion platform and the AgilePod,” Soine, the AFRL engineer explained. “We couldn’t miss this opportunity to show the AgilePod’s capabilities on a new class of aircraft.” It’s hard to imagine that the Air Force didn’t have more immediate access to other test and evaluation aircraft within the service or already on contract that it could have used to test the pod, though. As noted, Scorpion makes heavy use of standardized and open-architecture components, so there’s no indication that integrating AgilePod onto the jet would have been any more challenging than doing so onto any other available platform. A technician moves the AgilePod into position under the wing of the Scorpion during the test fit in December 2017., USAF The Air Force also said loading the pod onto the Scorpion was the first time they had fit tested it on a “commercially-built manned platform,” which is not necessarily true. While it is the first time they’ve experimented with the system on an in-production commercial manned aircraft, the first reported flight test involved a DC-3 test plane. AFRL’s main flight test goal doesn’t appear to be manned, either. The plan is to eventually integrate AgilePod onto an MQ-9 Reaper drone. A DC-3 test plane with the AgilePod mounted in 2017., USAF It is possible the two parties joined together as part of a cost-sharing or other cooperative engagement. This could have allowed the Air Force to continue exploring the capabilities of AgilePod, while Textron would have the opportunity to further demonstrate Scorpion’s multi-mission potential. It is possible that Textron could leverage the Air Force’s work on the program to expand the jet’s own modular capabilities. “This is a win-win situation for the Air Force as well as industry,” Air Force Captain Russell Shirey, the chief engineer in the Advanced Projects Branch, part of AFRL’s Sensors Directorate, said. “The AFRL Blue Guardian team has been developing rapid integration sensor technologies and standards, which are not only on the AgilePod, but are beginning to show up on aircraft as well.” There would be some precedent for this, given that the Air Force signed a so-called Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with Textron in 2016 to certify Scorpion’s airworthiness . This was the first time the service had ever certified an aircraft it otherwise had no intention of buying and it did so with an eye toward future public-private partnerships. The two parties may be expanding the relationship to utilize Scorpion as a more cost effective test bed compared to other military aircraft or more traditional arrangements with private contractors. And since the service has yet to release the results of the OA-X tests , it is possible that they include a recommendation for further evaluation of the Scorpion, either for potential Air Force use or as a option for military assistance packages to foreign nations in the future. We at The War Zone noted that the presence of observers from multiple different countries at the light attack experiment was a strong indicator of foreign interest in one or more of the participating aircraft. So, as the AFRL Blue Guardian program continues, we will undoubtedly see more of AgilePod and its scalable cousins. We may also see the Air Force increasingly work with Textron and the Scorpion on those tests, or entirely separate experiments, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 6, 2019",Watch The “Final Cut” Of A Glowing Film About The A-10 That The USAF Tried to Suppress,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another, more complete version of a small official documentary on the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft’s contributions in Afghanistan has emerged nearly four years after Combat Camera airmen shot the footage. The service had apparently tried to suppress the film, officially known as “Grunts in the Sky,” as it pushed to retire the planes for good despite their record of “saving guys on the ground.” The film quickly began to spread online in December 2017 and appeared on the unofficial Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook group. The existence of the video first became public in September 2015, after former Air Force officer Tony Carr posted an initial version , known as “Hawg,” on his blog John Q. Public. Carr had been and continues to be an outspoken supporter of the service and its mission, but a vocal critic of its leadership and many of their decisions. “It’s a pretty easy answer, too, in terms of ‘why are we here?’” one A-10 pilot says. “The number one priority is always saving guys on the ground,” another adds. The mini-documentary, which runs just over 20 minutes long, is interspersed with combat footage in the air and on the ground, well-shot B-roll of A-10s in Afghanistan, and particularly candid interviews with Air Force aviators and joint terminal attack controllers (JTAC) embedded with troops on the ground. It’s definitely worth watching if you’ve never seen it before. It’s also a microcosm of the Air Force’s complicated and often controversial relationship with the A-10.  The story of the production of “Grunts” and why it’s taken so long for it to see an official release are almost as interesting as its actual content. Since its introduction in 1977, the Air Force has repeatedly attempted to retire the A-10, arguing that other aircraft can adequately take over the role. Advocates in Congress, bolstered by support from troops on the ground, have repeatedly stymied those plans, though. By 2014, the service had already made it clear that their desire was to replace both its multi-role F-16 Viper fighter jets and A-10s with the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The debate over whether or not the stealthy jet is an adequate replacement for the Warthog had become increasingly tense. In December 2014, now retired Air Force Major General James Post had created a massive controversy over the issue by implying to his subordinates that it was “ treasonous ” to offer support for the A-10 to members of Congress. In response to public pressure, in no small part from Tony Carr , the Air Force eventually booted Post from his job at Air Combat Command, before quietly moving him to the service’s headquarters in the Pentagon, effectively a promotion. In this ironic picture, Air Force Major General James Post, at right, talks with a member of the 51st Fighter Wing in front of one of the unit’s A-10s at Osan Air Base in South Korea as part of his new job as Director of Current Operations in November 2015., USAF In February 2015, the Air Force had also released a set of cherry-picked statistics exclusively to USA Today that tried to paint the A-10 as responsible for the most friendly fire incidents, suggesting the aircraft was actually dangerous to troops on the ground. The next month, senior officials argued that the Warthogs were just too old to be relevant in combat or even safe to fly – not mentioning a deliberate decision to end critical life-extending upgrades, which remains an issue to this day . Later that year, the service also began poaching maintainers from the A-10 community in order to support the formation of new F-35 units, something the service has only recently backtracked on . These various maneuvers, all aimed at putting the venerable ground attackers on a final path to the boneyard, are only a small slice of the broader battle over the Warthog, especially between the Air Force and Congress , that continues right to the present day. In this context, it’s not hard to understand why the Air Force might want to bury a film that not only demonstrated the A-10’s unique contributions in combat, but included comments from its own service members underscoring just how important the aircraft were in contemporary operations. The subjects who sat down for interviews in “Grunts” do not mince words about their experiences. Below is the first iteration of “Hawg,” which appeared online in 2015: “To have boots on the ground, you need support and you need the right kind of support to have boots on the ground,” Air Force Technical Sergeant Sean Deam, a JTAC, says in the documentary. “It’s the A-10, honestly.” Deam indicated that troops on the ground just knowing A-10s were on station could be a major morale boost. His fellow service members and Army soldiers that gave interviews echoed these sentiments. “That sound it so distinguishable,” Staff Sgt. Joseph Hauser, another JTAC says, talking about the unmistakable noise of the A-10 firing its massive 30mm main gun. “It literally shakes the ground. It is amazing. You hear it first when it fires and then you hear it echo from the gun in the sky. That sound right there just drives 11-bravos nuts,” he adds, referring to 11B, the Army’s military occupation specialty code for infantrymen. Hauser says that the troops he worked with equated close air support with the A-10 more so than any other platform. He then gives the remark that lent the film its title, saying that Warthog pilots and troops on the ground share a unique bond and that “if you were to say that there’s a grunt in the sky, it’d be a Hog pilot.” Air Force JTACs wave to an A-10 during a training exercise., USAF In September 2015, Tony Carr updated the story by publishing more than 50 pages of internal Emails about the project on John Q. Public. These had come by way of another Freedom of Information Act request from Steven Mayne, a retired Air Force senior NCO. Although censors had almost entirely redacted the contents, the Email chains showed that some of the service’s most senior officials had been involved in the discussions about what to do with “Grunts.” There were some additional details hidden among the blacked out sections, as well. At one point, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Edward Sholtis, then a public affairs officer for the Air Force’s top command for operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, asked everyone involved to delete any existing copies of the video they had until his office had made appropriate edits. “Because the units supporting the project were reservists, we don’t want to feed paranoia that there’s some kind of rogue video project out there,” he wrote, implying that there was such a concern, either inside the Air Force or somewhere else, regarding the handling of the documentary. There are at least three versions of the film available online at present, including a version of the original “Hawg” that lacks any titles or other text to indentify its subjects and another edition closer to the final product in which all the faces are masked over. The Air Force had initially claimed that it could not release the video for security reasons. You can watch the second version, “Grunts of the Air” below: Tony Carr and others challenged this assertion since there had been apparently no issue in releasing a similar product highlighting the F-16 at around the same time. That the version the Air Force officially released under FOIA does not obscure the faces of an interviewees would seem to further suggest this was an excuse to withhold the video. The service did withhold names of the aviators involved, a standard practice when citing deployed personnel. It’s not entirely clear why the Air Force decided now to release the film, but it might simply be because there were no actual legal grounds to withhold it any longer. It could also be a reflection of apparent shift in at least the service’s public attitude toward the plane. In December 2017, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson had told legislators she was a “fan” of the Warthog and supported plans to reboot a critical re-winging effort that could keep the entire fleet airworthy through at least 2040. Unfortunately, it looks as if that might not happen soon enough to avoid having to ground dozens of A-10s. At the same time, we at The War Zone have confirmed the existence of draft requirements for a direct A-10 replacement and that they appear to be buried away in the Air Force’s bureaucracy. There is some indication that the service might seek to downplay or outright suppress the results of a separate light attack aircraft experiment, better known as OA-X, too. It’s clear that while the saga over “Grunts” may finally have come to close, the one over the future and ultimate fate of the A-10 is likely to continue in one form or another until the aircraft does go to its final resting place. Correction: The original version of this article indicated that the Air Force had released the “final” version of the film in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, but that was in error. The video emerged online, but a FOIA request to release the footage formally still remains unfulfilled. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","Trump to Kim Jong Un: My Nuclear Button Is Bigger, More Powerful, And It Works","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In his annual New Year speech, North Korean premier Kim Jong-un has declared he has a “nuclear button” at the ready in the event that the United States or its allies seek to overthrow the country’s Communist regime. Now, U.S. President Donald Trump has responded with his own trademark invective, which seems almost guaranteed to provoke some sort of response from the ever defiant Hermit Kingdom and will undoubtedly stir-up controversy here at home and abroad. Late on Jan. 2, 2018, Trump took to his preferred outlet, Twitter, to slam Kim over his pronouncement and mock North Korea’s growing nuclear weapons and missile capabilities. In the past, the President has made bold threats of “fire and fury” against the North Korean regime and suggested it might be necessary to “totally destroy” the country if the government in Pyongyang doesn’t abandon its advanced weapons programs. “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.'” Trump Tweeted out. “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 Kim’s comments had actually come three days earlier in a routine address in which the North Korean leader also touted his country’s relatively modest industrial achievements, including increased production of consumer goods, as evidence of the pariah state’s success in defying its international opponents. Many of those industries, such as automotive and chemical concerns , have a dual-purpose relationship to the country’s advanced weapons programs, though. These “ nuclear buttons ” are likely figurative, with such phrases usually referring broadly to complex nuclear command and control structures and the U.S. military’s nuclear arsenal is without a doubt far larger and more capable than North Korea’s. It doesn’t make the two pronouncements any less serious, especially when taken together, though. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway had already noted how uncertain the situation on the Korean Peninsula still is despite the relatively muted nature of Kim’s remarks, writing : The speech comes on the same day that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen gave a dire warning about the collision course the U.S. and North Korea are presently on. With Pyongyang unwilling to denuclearize and no real pathway being offered by the Trump Administration to enter into direct negotiations, the chances that there could be a peaceful deescalation through diplomacy seem increasingly slim. It also comes as allegations stack up against China and Russia that they are cheating on U.N. sanctions against North Korea by executing ship-to-ship transfers of contraband fuel reserves to the rogue nation. These developments are troubling to say the least and undermine the power the U.N. has when it comes to having its own members enforce its resolutions. Ships are now being seized and the whole affair seems to be inching toward a naval blockade of the country, a tactic we pointed out last September as a possible option to put extreme pressure on the North Korean regime. With North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs leaping far ahead of almost all estimates last year, and as a threat of an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific looming, not to mention tensions between the Kim regime and the Trump administration at an all time high, there is even more uncertainty surrounding the high-stakes standoff going in to 2018 than there was going into 2017. Earlier on Jan. 2, 2018, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had also warned North Korea against any more provocative missile tests.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 27, 2019",Brazil Is Reportedly Buying the Royal Navy’s Only Helicopter Carrier On the Cheap,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom has reportedly finalized the sale of the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean to Brazil for less than a third of what it originally spent to build the ship. The Brazilian Navy looks to be the big winner in the deal, which effectively ends the possibility of the Royal Navy having any interim aircraft carrier capability, no matter how limited, until HMS Queen Elizabeth enters operational service. On Jan. 2, 2018, U.K. Defence Journal reported that Brazilian Defense Minister Raul Jungmann had confirmed the purchase in December 2017. Brazil will pay almost $115 million for Ocean , but it is unclear if that cost will include any refit or refurbishment of the ship or if the government in Brasilia will have to come up with the entire amount at once. The United Kingdom still has yet to officially decommission the ship, which it expects to do in 2018, but the first rumors of the sale appeared in March 2017. The head of the Brazilian Navy, Admiral Eduardo Leal Ferreira, previously described the price tag as “convenient,” Brazilian journalist Roberto Lopes told U.K. Defence Journal. Brazil will send personnel to train on the ship in the United Kingdom prior to its delivery and the first four Brazilian officers will reportedly arrive before the end of January 2018. It is not entirely clear how Brazil plans to integrate the ship into her existing naval forces. In February 2017, the country’s navy finally retired its sole conventional takeoff and landing aircraft carrier, the São Paulo , after five nearly five years of attempts to return it to service . HMS Ocean moored in Greenwich, London in support of the 2012 Summer Olympics, Ottaky via Wikimedia Ocean would not be able to accommodate the fixed wing aircraft that had flown from that ship, such as the modernized AF1 Skyhawks , though. According to Roberto Lopes, the Brazilian Navy is already planning on re-naming its new ship something other than São Paulo in order to keep that moniker free for a more capable future carrier. Instead, the ex-British ship could become the new Minas Gerais . The last Brazilian ship of that name was an upgraded World War II-era Colossus -class light aircraft carrier that the country had purchased from the United Kingdom in 1956 and which served until São Paulo ’s arrival in 2001. The Brazilian aircraft carrier São Paulo , in the foreground, sails with the USS Ronald Reagan in 2004 during a training exercise., USN But even without a compliment of fixed wing aircraft, though, the Ocean could provide important capabilities for Brazil at home and abroad. The country’s Navy could fly any of its existing Super Cougar and Super Puma transport helicopters, the former of which have light attack and will gain anti-ship capabilities , or Super Lynx and Seahawk anti-submarine helicopters from the ship’s deck. As such it could serve as a sub-hunting platform or in a broader sea control function, as well as being able to support humanitarian assistance operations in the aftermath of a natural disaster. With the ability to carry small landing craft to get personnel and vehicles ashore even in the absence of established port facilities, it could also potentially support interventions or disaster relief operations throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, and even further abroad. As of 2018, Brazil was already an active contributor to nine different international peacekeeping operations and had been part of more than 50 such missions since the end of World War II. Throughout her service with the Royal Navy, Ocean has already demonstrated her capabilities to perform this wide array of tasks, most recently arriving in the Caribbean to provide aid to British possessions after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. These diverse capabilities in times of both war and peace have made helicopter carriers and amphibious assault type ships with similar flight decks increasingly popular around the world, especially among countries looking to expand their ability to project power and influence beyond their borders. On top of their more practical functions, this category of ships are often major symbols of national prestige and Ocean herself is presently the Royal Navy’s flagship. If nothing else Brazil gains a very flexible ship, which only entered Royal Navy service in 1993. The ship is less robust that other similar vessels, as it was made to commercial standards and could need significant overhaul before joining the Brazilian Navy. However, between 2013 and 2014, the United Kingdom put Ocean through significant refit that cost nearly $90 million. The vessel originally cost less than $200 million – but more than $390 million today – meaning that Brazil will get the ship at less than a third of its original price tag. Admiral Ferreira’s assessment that the purchase would be “convenient” would seem to be generous to the British. Of course, as we already noted, it’s not clear whether or not this includes any refit or if the ship will require new equipment after delivery. According to U.K. Defence Journal and Janes , the Brazilian Navy already expressed an interest in buying Ocean without its Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) self-protection systems, which it does not otherwise operate on any other ship. It is possible that Brazil could strip the short-range Simbad-RC surface-to-air missile systems , electronic support measures systems, and other equipment from the now decommissioned São Paulo . Simbad-RC, a twin launcher for the Mistral infrared-homing missile , would not offer a capability similar to that of CIWS, though, meaning the Brazilians might need to invest in additional defensive arrangements. Whatever happens, the loss of Ocean will be significant for the Royal Navy, leaving it without an operational carrier capability of any kind as it waits for HMS Queen Elizabeth to reach initial operational capability. The United Kingdom doesn’t expect this to happen until at least 2021, in part due to slow pace of getting the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter into service. As such, the country’s new supercarrier will go to sea for her first patrol with at least some of her air wing made up of U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs. The U.K. Ministry of Defense doesn’t expect the ship to reach full operational capability with British F-35Bs until 2023, while her sister HMS Prince of Wales looks set to spend most of her time in port in reserve. The supercarrier could deploy early if absolutely necessary , but would almost certainly have to do so without any fixed wing aircraft, greatly limiting its ability to provide local air defense or strike capabilities. In the meantime, the Royal Navy is also considering retiring its last two major amphibious warfare ships in order to free up both funds and personnel to man those carriers while it otherwise struggles to keep its dwindling surface fleet ready for actual operations. In December 2017, thanks to a confluence of factors, all but one of the Royal Navy’s destroyers and frigates were pierside. As such, in the event of any future contingencies or disasters, such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and without HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark , the United Kingdom will have to rely entirely on ships the quasi-military Royal Fleet Auxiliary , primarily the three Bay -class landing ships , for amphibious support. These smaller ships are significantly less capable than Ocean both in terms of flight and well deck space. The Bay -class landing ship RFA Cardigan Bay, which could soon be one of the United Kingdom’s only amphibious ships., Crown Copyright It’s not clear when the United Kingdom’s economic situation might improve. The U.K. government has already faced severe budget cuts as it heads toward its departure from the European Union, commonly known as the British Exit or Brexit. In addition to a contracting domestic economy in response to the decision, the country’s leaders are struggling with the prospect of having to negotiate a slew new international trade deals independent of the regional bloc. There has even been talk of attempting to raise funds for a new royal yacht to aid in doing so, but through a national lottery scheme since there is no actual funding available for such a project. If there is any silver lining to be had in the sale of Ocean for the Royal Navy, it might be that the ship’s CIWS and any other defensive systems might find their way on to Queen Elizabeth , which appears to be almost comically under-protected . The older helicopter carrier, which displaces approximately 22,000 tons, has three CIWS, along with four 30mm cannons to help beat back small boats and similar close-in threats. The new supercarrier, more than three times larger, has exactly the same number of both of these self-defense systems at present. What seems clear is that Brazil is getting the base ship at an absolute steal and that the Royal Navy is still years away from having another operational aircraft carrier.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 26, 2018",The USMC’s Beloved M27 Automatic Rifle Gets Another Job As The M38 Marksman Rifle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has quietly begun at least a limited test of a new version of its 5.56mm M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle , a specialized designated marksman variant called the M38. This is part of the service’s plans to buy and issue additional configurations of the M27, but it’s not clear how well suited the platform will necessarily be in all of its new roles . On Dec. 8, 2017, official photographers captured the M38 rifles in the hands of Marines from 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines as they trained on a firing range at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, which Soldier Systems was the first to spot online. The weapon’s nomenclature appears to be based on the unit designation , which had been the case with the M27. The Corps had tasked 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines with the trials of the Infantry Automatic Rifle, or IAR. The M38 seems almost identical to the existing M27 in most respects. The underlying gun is the same variant of Heckler and Koch’s HK416 5.56mm rifle with a 16.5-inch heavy barrel. The HK416 is itself a derivative of the AR-15/M16 family. The major difference is that the German-designed rifle uses a physical piston to cycle the action rather than the original so-called “ direct impingement ” system, which used the gas itself. The two Marine versions seem to differ primarily in the type of optic on top. Since 2011, the Marines have issued M27s to automatic rifleman with a Trijicon TA11SDO-CP Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) that has a fixed 3.5x magnification. A Marine on the range at Camp Lejeune in December 2017 with an M38., USMC The images show the M38, at least a present, features a Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T scope with a variable magnification ranging from 2.5x to 8x. This will give the shooter more flexibility to find their targets and make precision shots over longer ranges, something essential for designated marksmen who look to focus their fire on priority targets during a firefight. Each of the weapons also has a suppressor, which appears to be part of a separate Marine Corps experiment focused on more broadly issuing those devices to infantry units. The primary goal there is to reduce the noise and visual signature of small units to give them an added edge against opponents, especially at night , and to improve the ability of Marines to communicate vocally during combat . The idea of a dedicated designated marksman rifle is hardly new to the Marine Corps. Since 1992, the service has had a series of formal requirements, starting with a desire for a more appropriate weapon for spotters in its scout sniper teams. At the time, those individuals carried standard M16A2 rifles. A close-up of the M38’s Leupold scope., USMC At the same time, there was a desire to give small, regular Marine infantry units the added benefits of a rifle configured for a marksman role. This need only became more pronounced in the mid-2000s as the Corps found itself heavily committed to the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq, the daily routine of patrolling in dense urban areas demonstrated a need for fast, but precision rifle fire against fleeting targets. In Afghanistan, militants often initiated engagements beyond the effective range of standard infantry weapons, especially those without magnifying optics. Repurposing the M27 with a new scope is a relatively easy way to provide this type of capability. It has a heavier and longer barrel, making it inherently more accurate at longer ranges compared to the standard M4 carbine already. It also makes sense in the context of the Marine Corps’ overall plan to begin issuing more versions of the HK416 in general. Since at least 2016 , the service has been exploring whether or not the rifle could replacement the M4 across the board. In August 2017, the Marines announced they were interested in buying up to more than 50,000 M27s for regular infantry units. But it’s not clear how well suited the M38 will necessarily be in the designated marksman role. In 2001, the Marines began experimenting with a similar M16-based weapon known as the Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle , or SAM-R, which featured the same Leupold scope. The service also gave certain Marines unmodified M16A4 rifles with ACOG magnified optics, a far less intensive and much cheaper update over existing weapons. A Marine with an M16-based SAM-R rifle in Afghanistan in 2004., USMC The relative success of that weapon led in many ways to the M27. The U.S. Army and U.S. Special Operations Command both developed and fielded similar “accurized” rifles based on the M16 pattern in the mid-2000s. As time has gone on, though, there has been a growing consensus that the 5.56mm cartridge is of limited utility for precision fire, even at relatively modest ranges. This in turn led to the development and wider fielding of new and repurposed rifles firing larger rounds across the services. The Marines issued a number of rebuilt Cold War-era M14s, the last being the M39 Enhanced Marksman Rifle , or EMR, before buying the Army’s M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System for special operators, scout snipers, and other specialized personnel. A Marine special operator with an M39 EMR in 2009., USMC There have also been concerns that the 5.56mm cartridge is increasingly less capable against body armor . In 2017, the Army briefly explored the idea of buying an interim 7.62mm infantry rifle , until such time as it could decide on an all time cartridge, before cancelling the effort in favor of longer term small arms projects . Various services have also attempted to mitigate the limits of the 5.56mm cartridge by issuing specialized ammunition with heavier bullets intended for longer range shooting, but with mixed results. Soldier Systems noted that in the official photographs the Marines had set the scopes on the M38s specifically for the Mk 262 long range 5.56mm cartridge. This could help increase the capability of the weapon, but only if units received a steady supply of the rounds, which would also force them to effectively carry two different sets of ammunition. The Marine Corps has plans to adopt the U.S. Army’s M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) as its standard 5.56mm type, as well. This cartridge is supposed to provide better terminal performance at extended ranges over existing ammunition, but has reportedly done so at the cost of increasing the wear and tear on normal M4s. It’s not clear how well it might or might not work in the gas piston-operated M27. The M855A1 EPR and the bullet itself, showing the new ballistic tip that reportedly gives the round better terminal characteristics at extended ranges., US Army These potential issues could be significant for the Marine Corps, which has stepped up its role in Afghanistan again as part of a renewed push by U.S. forces to aid that country’s security forces against insurgents and terrorists. Marines expect to increasingly find themselves conducting joint patrols and other operations in the country where effective fire from designated marksmen could be an especially important capability. There is the possibility the Marines could upgrade the M38s, as well as the M27s, to fire new types of cartridges or entirely different ammunition at some point in the future. The firearms industry in the United States particularly has spent considerable effort exploring so-called intermediate cartridges, which have capabilities somewhere between 5.56mm and 7.62mm, which will work with the AR-15/M16 platform with modifications. Another readily available option would be for the Marines to simply purchase the larger HK417 rifle, which handles in much the same way as its 5.56mm cousin, but its chambered for the larger 7.62mm round. This, however, would require smaller units to carry two entirely distinct types of ammunition and could lead to additional strain on the logistics chain, especially when it comes to resupplying small units such as squads and platoons. Cost may be a deciding factor when it comes to any upgrades to the M38 and the Marine Corps’ broader plans to just buy more M27s, as well. Though the popularity of the HK416 platform has steadily grown within the U.S. military, the improvements mean those rifles are, on average, three times more expensive than the standard M4. A Marine removes the magazine from a standard M27 during a training exercise., USMC With President Donald Trump’s promises to substantially boost military budgets, the price point may be increasingly less of an issue in general. And the Marines seem to be convinced that the costs are justified, regardless. “At first contact you have the overwhelming superiority of fire from which all the tactics evolve,” Daniel O’Donohue, then a U.S. Marine Corps major general in charge of 1st Marine Division, told Military.com back in 2016 about the capability his units had gained just with the M27. “So it starts with the fire team and the squad, if you give them a better weapon with better fire superiority, you’ll just put that vicious harmony of violence on the enemy.” O’Donohue is now a lieutenant general and Deputy Commandant for Information. He is leading a separate push to expand the Corps’ intelligence, cyber, and information warfare capabilities. How well Marines end up like the M38, the Corps still wants to begin issuing more M27s or related rifles in 2018. The designated marksman rifles could be the first step in turning those plans into a reality. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Assault Rifles Land Small Arms"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 18, 2019",Here’s A Primer On What Is Going On With The Protests In Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Protests in Iran over a surge in the price of eggs have grown into broader political demonstrations, with some individuals even calling for an end to the Islamic Republic system of government. The rare outburst of public discontent will be an important test for U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration, which has made a particular point of taking a tough stance toward the regime in Tehran, as well as potentially having ramifications throughout the Middle East. On Dec. 28, 2017, hundreds of individuals turned out in Mashhad, Iran’s second most populous city, to protest the government and its apparent inability to control the rising price of basic goods. The cost of eggs in particular had risen up to 40 percent within a matter of days, with farmers in turn blaming their hikes on the increasing price of chicken feed. Public outcry over economic issues is not uncommon in Iran, but by Dec. 29, 2017, there were reports of new demonstrations across the country’s Northern provinces from East to West that had grown to include demands for greater political freedoms, changes to Iranian foreign policy, and an end to clerical control of government. “The nation is struggling in poverty; The leader is trying to act as God,” protesters chanted in the Western city of Kermanshah, according to U.S. government-funded Radio Farda , with “the leader” being an apparent veiled reference to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “Political prisoners should be freed,” they added reinforcing that at least some of the demonstrations had taken on a different and more political character. There were reports of similar gatherings in major population centers, such as Rasht, Ghazvin, Qom, Esfahan, and Hamadan. Iranian state media said that police in the capital Tehran had arrested 40 individuals for holding an unsanctioned rally there, which is particularly notable given the country’s well established internal security apparatus. A screen cap of video from one of the protests in Iran. , Via Fars News It appears that the rapid spread of public outcry was something authorities had not expected to occur even after the initial protests in Mashhad and elsewhere in the East. There are various reports, though, that police and other organizations, such as the quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij volunteer paramilitary militia , have swiftly moved out to crack down on demonstrators, potentially with lethal force. The IRGC has also reportedly begun jamming or otherwise blocking access to international media outlets, many of which are covering the protests. The jammers could also cut off cellphone signals, which protesters might use to coordinate their demonstrations and spread their message. “We consider protest to be the people’s right,” Hossein Heidari, head of the revolutionary court in Mashhad, said, according to the BBC . “But if some people want to abuse these emotions and ride this wave, we won’t wait and will confront them.” Revolutionary courts in Iran exist largely to protect the state and deal almost exclusively in crimes pertaining to treasonous activities, espionage on behalf of foreign powers, and blasphemy, as well as narcotics trafficking and other smuggling. Originally established to purge loyalists to the previous regime of the Shah, these judicial entities are now linked to the suppression of broader internal dissent against the regime in Tehran. As of yet, it remains difficult to gauge just how widespread the anti-government sentiment is among the protesters and how strong those feelings might be separate from the present economic situation. Not surprisingly, Iranian authorities have, without providing any evidence, been quick to accuse outside actors of sparking the unrest as part of a larger plot to undermine the country’s government. There have actually been rumors that the protests may have been a ploy by the country’s hard line political factions to undermine reformist President Hassan Rouhani, who has also been a target of protesters’ chants, which has now backfired. A moderate by the standards of Iranian politics, Rouhani has drawn criticism from the country’s conservative elements over plans for relatively modest increases in social freedoms and plans to increase foreign economic ties. In May 2017, he still managed to win a second presidential term, securing nearly 60 percent of the vote. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani., Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik  via AP “When a social and political movement is launched on the streets, those who started it will not necessarily be able to control it in the end,” Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, a Rouhani ally, told state-run outlet IRNA , reportedly referring to the president’s political opponents. “Those who are behind such events will burn their own fingers. They think they will hurt the government by doing so.” But whether initially staged or spontaneous, the protests do seem to be growing on their own now and could potentially draw the eye of foreign powers opposed to the Iranian regime. In particularly, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have made a taking a tough stance toward Iran a key part of America’s foreign policy agenda, announcing a new strategy toward the country in October 2017 and reiterating those plans within a new National Security Strategy earlier in December 2017. In addition, Trump has personally criticized his predecessor, President Barack Obama, in the past for failing to back a popular uprising in Iran in 2009. Known variously as the Green Movement , the Green Revolution, or the Persian Awakening, those protests erupted after a dispute over the Iranian presidential election that year. Reformist candidate and former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi declared victory and accused allies for the incumbent hard line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had rigged the results to give him another term. Authorities subsequently arrested Mousavi, as well as another opposition political leader Mehdi Karoubi, and a number of protesters subsequently died in unrest that lasted in 2010. Iranian protesters hold a banner with a picture of Mir-Hossein Mousavi during a demonstration in 2009., Sipa via AP More protests continued through 2011-2012 . As of December 2017, both Mousavi and Karoubi remain under house arrest, despite pledges from Rouhani to release them. In August 2017, Karoubi went on hunger strike to demand a public trial, but stopped his protest after the government agreed to remove secret police agents from his home. “If Obama would’ve backed the people of Iran two years ago when that county had a big, big problem—and the protesters were making headway—like he backed the protesters in the United States—as they call themselves occupy —we wouldn’t have any problems in Iran,” Trump said in 2011 video he posted on YouTube, but which is no longer available . “That country would’ve been turned over so fast, instead he abandoned those people.” In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Republican candidate Mitt Romney similarly accused Obama of being “silent” about the protests. Obama’s administration did criticize the Iranians for their crackdown in 2009, but did not explicitly call for regime change or otherwise offer any direct, public support to enable a more serious revolt. How Trump reacts to the situation in Iran and the government in Tehran, which he referred to as a “ murderous regime ” in his first ever speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, will be an important demonstration of his administration’s stance toward the country. At the time or writing, the White House had not issued a formal statement regarding the protests. The president himself had yet to use his outlet of choice, Twitter, to make any comments, either. “The United States strongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protesters,” the State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement on Dec. 29, 2017, mirroring the sort of language the Obama administration used to criticize the response to the 2009 demonstrations. “We urge all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption.” Beyond just criticizing the Iranian government and Supreme Leader Khamenei, the Trump administration could decide to use the opportunity to take more direct overt or covert action, such as finding ways to help protesters avoid or evade government controls on communicating and access to independent media, providing other support to Iranian dissident groups in the United States and elsewhere, call for additional economic sanctions , or even something more direct, such as launching cyber attacks on government institutions that could limit their ability to respond to demonstrations. There were reports that the Obama Administration had already developed plans for a wide ranging covert cyber warfare campaign against Iran in the event that negotiations over the county’s controversial nuclear program collapsed. Some have argued that the underlying economic situation is in part due to long-standing sanctions finally having an visible impact. On top of that, Iran has already been actively jockeying with its regional opponents, chiefly Israel , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates , throughout 2017. Any of these countries might see a similar opening to challenge the Iranian government’s standing or influence. Saudi Arabia, which is now in the midst of its own major political purge , has accused Iran of an “ act of war ” over allegedly supplying Houthi rebels in Yemen with ballistic missiles or the technology necessary to construct their own. That group has launched a number of these weapons at Saudi Arabia, including an attempted attack on King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud’s palace in Riyadh earlier in December 2017 . That same month, the United States presented what it said was conclusive proof of the connection to members of the press. Some experts questioned the extent of the link based on the evidence available, but there is little dispute that Iran is sending a variety of arms, including aerial and maritime drones and the means to construct naval mines , and other support to the Houthis. Qatar’s connections with the Iranian government are also at the core of that country’s on-going political dispute with the Saudis and its other Gulf Arab neighbors. For its part, Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of being behind a pair of ISIS terrorist attacks in Tehran in July 2017. Iran’s support for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, including through its proxy, the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, has also steadily drawn more ire from Israel. Israeli officials have stressed their intent to prevent Iran from gaining a foothold near their borders and have launched a number of punitive attacks over the years aimed at both the Syrian regime and Iranian-backed forces. Notably, Iran’s activities in Syria have been another apparent issue for at least some of the protesters, as is its support for Palestinian groups against Israel. According to BBC Persian , which was one target of separate crackdown in August 2017, the average Iranian has become 15 percent poorer while the country’s government has steadily increased spending on causes overseas in places such as the Palestinian Territories , Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. “Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran,” some chanted in Mashhad, according to BBC. “Leave Syria alone, think about us,” was another slogan Radio Farda reported. With so many different political agendas at play, inside and outside of Iran, along with the steadily evolving demands of the protestors, it’s hard to imagine these demonstrations subsiding quickly. Whether the Iranian government emerges relatively unscathed, as it did after the protests in 2009 and 2010, and if the Trump Administration actually takes a more active stance, remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 15, 2020",USAF Wants Swarms of Cheap “Gray Wolf” Cruise Missiles That Can Overwhelm Enemy Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has hired Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman to develop experimental low-cost cruise missiles that can act as a swarm in order to better navigate through or overwhelm enemy defense networks . As part of the project, nicknamed Gray Wolf, the service also wants a modular weapon that can readily accept updates and upgrades, as well as different payloads, ranging from conventional explosive warheads to electronic warfare packages . On Dec. 18, 2017, the Pentagon announced the Air Force had awarded Lockheed Martin a $110 million contract for the Gray Wolf science and technology effort in its daily contract announcements. On Dec. 20, 2017, the notice said the service had made an identical deal with Northrop Grumman. The Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Munitions Directorate at Eglin Air Force base is in charge of the project. “Lockheed Martin’s concept for the Gray Wolf missile will be an affordable, counter-IAD [integrated air defense] missile that will operate efficiently in highly contested environments,” Hady Mourad, the director of the Advanced Missiles Program for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, said in a press release the firm put out on Dec. 27, 2017. “Using the capabilities envisioned for later spirals, our system is being designed to maximize modularity, allowing our customer to incorporate advanced technologies such as more lethal warheads or more fuel-efficient engines, when those systems become available.” According to Lockheed Martin, the contracts cover the first of four development phases, which will run through late 2019. The official contract announcements indicated that the Air Force expected the complete effort to wrap up in 2024. Northrop Grumman has not yet released its own official statement on its participation in the Gray Wolf program. An F-16 Viper drops an AGM-154 Joint Stand-off Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb during a test. The Air Force plans to test the Gray Wolf designs first on one of these fighter jets., Raytheon An F-16 test aircraft will be the first to demonstrate the Gray Wolf missiles. The goal is to make the weapons compatible with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , the Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle , U.S. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18s , as well as the B-1 Bone , B-2 Spirit , and B-52 bombers . Otherwise, the Air Force has offered few in the way of specifics about the project. This isn’t particularly surprising for a science and technology effort, which will focus on exploring new concepts rather than producing a final production design. In April 2017, Jack Blackhurst, who is both director of AFRL’s Plans and Programs Directorate and head of the laboratory’s Air Force Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office, offered important details in a briefing at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Science and Engineering Technology Conference. According to the presentation, each of the spiral development phases will run for 18 months. The basic technology goals break down into two separate lines of effort. The Air Force is interested in a weapon system that is low-cost and has a relatively short manufacturing time, even in small quantities. In addition, the missiles have to be capable of semi-autonomous, networked operation in order to defeat integrated air defense networks. This latter point is an increasingly important considering as the U.S. military increasingly has to take these defenses into consideration with regards to potential near-peer enemies, such as Russia or China , and smaller hostile powers, including Iran and North Korea . USAF Blackhurst’s briefing mentions cheaper guidance and sensor systems and “affordable and efficient” engines as specific areas of interest. A low-cost system with a sensor package could turn the cruise missiles into disposable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets or loitering munitions that could wait for the best possible moment to attack. The seeker heads should be able to target the enemy in multiple modes, which would make the weapons more flexible and able to hit their mark, even in the face of layered enemy defenses or just bad weather. In addition to just being able to try and intercept incoming cruise missiles, hostile air defense networks increasingly include electronic warfare capabilities that could prevent the launching aircraft or other friendly assets feeding course corrections to the weapons or otherwise disrupt their functionality and GPS-signal spoofing that might throw them off course. In addition to the low-cost objective, an efficient engine could translate into more overall range for the weapon without increasing fuel load. Blackhurst stressed that this improved stand-off capability would be important to keep the launch platform safe from defense networks. Non-stealthy aircraft in particular are only becoming increasingly vulnerable to longer-range surface-to-air missiles with cuing from various radars and other sensors . Launching swarms of the weapons together and developing a system that allows them to act in cooperation with each other, potentially exchanging information among themselves on potential threats and other hazards, would make the missiles themselves more survivable, too. Another of the Gray Wolf project’s goals is to have the entire group be able to find and strike targets on their own after launch, based on a set of pre-set parameters. A B-1 Bone drops a Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) cruise missile during a test. The Air Force wants the Gray Wolf missiles to be compatible with these bombers, along with various other aircraft., Lockheed Martin Taken together, a swarm of low-cost cruise missiles could make it cheaper and easier for the U.S. military to launch distributed attacks across a wide area. At the same time, it would force the enemy to expend significant additional resources to try and counter this particular threat, overwhelming their air defense networks or otherwise shifting their focus. With a modular system , the Air Force could quickly add or reconfigure the missiles with electronic and cyber warfare capabilities, or just turn them into decoys mimicking the signatures of larger aircraft, all to further degrade the enemy’s ability to respond. This in turn could help defend other parts of the force package or pave the way for non-stealthy platforms to conduct follow-on strikes. The trick will be combine all these features into a weapon that is more cost effective than existing types and thus not prohibitively expensive to use in a swarm attack. Most existing air-launched cruise missiles already feature network capabilities that could allow them to act in concert with each other, but which also have unit costs near or above $1 million a piece. Lockheed Martin has working hard just to get the cost of the Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile, or JASSM , an air-launched land-attack cruise missile already in U.S. Air Force service, down to approximately $800,000 . “Can the Gray Wolf missile be produced at very low unit costs and what are  the associated design and manufacturing activities required to do so?” Air Force spokesperson Sharon Branick asked rhetorically in describing the Gray Wolf program to Inside Defense back in October 2016. “For example, are there innovative manufacturing concepts that would support low costs when built at low-rate quantities and  without long-lead time lines? What capabilities would need to be traded  off in order to maintain the low unit costs?” This will be an increasingly important consideration when it comes to future advanced precision stand-off weaponry in general. Conflicts against small non-state actors have already threatened to exhaust U.S. military reserves of certain precision guided munitions. In a broader conflict against a larger near peer adversary, the Air Force and its sister services could easily burn through cruise missiles at a prodigious rate, especially if they employ them in swarms to defeat defense networks. Rapid, but low-cost designs and manufacturing techniques, such as those Gray Wolf will explore, will be essential to make sure there will still be stocks of these weapons after the initial phases of an operation and that replenishing the inventory won’t require diverting funds and resources from other projects. One potential option is to have only a limited number of weapons in the entire group carry multi-mode sensors and then feed guidance information to the other missiles in the swarm. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has previously described this as a potentially lower-cost method of operating stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles, or UCAVs, writing in an earlier feature : With UCAV swarms you do not have to equip every UCAV with the same expensive sensors and subsystems as you have to with manned fighters. Using adaptable open architecture and “plug and play” design philosophies, a group of UCAVs can be outfitted for a particular mission or mission set. By adapting a single airframe for various roles via a series of unique configurations, great cost savings can be realized without greatly hampering the effectiveness of the swarm as a whole. In a single swarm “package” of UCAVs, you can have some airframes outfitted with advanced radars, some carrying networking, data-fusion and communications hardware, while others can carry highly sensitive electronic emissions sensing gear. Another set can carry bombs and missiles, while others can be outfitted with directed energy weapons (lasers) or advanced jamming equipment. Additionally, some can carry combinations of these capabilities. Because a package of UCAVs can act as a networked swarm and are constantly linked together via data link, each UCAV can share its sensor information with all the other UCAVs in its swarm and in real-time. When all this data is combined, a high-fidelity picture of the battlefield is rendered for the whole swarm to exploit. In other words, a UCAV that has no radar at all, can benefit from other UCAVs outfitted with such systems as if it were its own. Even working as a small swarm of say six UCAVs, three could be optimized as simple munitions mules, two can operate as sensor craft, and one can be outfitted as an aerial tanker and jamming support platform. Although the munitions mules may not be equipped with a radar or other targeting and situational awareness sensors, they are virtually equipped with them as the swarm’s collecting brain can “see” a fused “picture” of all the UCAV’s sensor information combined. Combining the weapons with a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle , or UCAV, could also further extend their range into denied areas and improve the survivability of the missiles as they head toward their targets. AFRL is already experiment separately with low-cost “attritable” drones as potential “weapon trucks” working in concert with other manned and unmanned systems. Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie is the test platform for that project. USAF Otherwise, much of the technology the Air Force is interested for the Gray Wolf missiles already exists publicly, at least to a certain degree, too. Lockheed Martin itself has touted many similar features in the design of its existing Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, or LRASM . This weapon is a derivative of the company’s JASSM cruise missile. It’s no surprise that Mourad, the head of the company’s Advanced Missiles Program mentioned both of those weapons in the December 2017 press release. He also cited the firm’s Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) 227mm GPS-guided artillery rocket as an example of its experience with low-cost precision guided munitions. Lockheed Martin, along with Raytheon, is also competing to build the Air Force’s more traditional Long Range Stand-off (LRSO) weapon, which will be a new nuclear-capable cruise missile. It is also possible that other companies may become involved in later development phases or that other, separate science and technology efforts or demonstrations might feed into the Gray Wolf project. In March 2017, AFRL had indicated it was looking to award “zero, one, or more contracts” for a then unnamed project matching subsequent descriptions of the notional Gray Wolf missile. At that time, it also indicated that there was $110 million in total available for contracts related to the program, an amount that appears to have increased given both the Pentagon contract announcements and Lockheed Martin’s press release. Earlier in December 2017, Aviation Week reported that Boeing, General Atomics, and Kratos had all expressed an interest in the project, along with two other unknown contenders. Those could have been Aurora Flight Sciences, now a division of Boeing, or Dynetics, which is building the GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition for U.S. Special Operations Command. General Atomics and Dynetics are both on contract to develop swarming drones as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Gremlins effort , as well. Whatever happens it seems clear that systems such as Gray Wolf, which can carry out distributed attacks or other missions, will only become more important as integrated air defense capabilities continue to improve around the world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 6, 2021",Air Force Is Buying Eight Of These Missiles That Are Set To Become Its First Hypersonic Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force plans to buy at least eight prototype AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapons , or ARRWs. This initial batch of these hypersonic missiles will support live-fire flight testing, set to begin in 2021, and could help give the service an early operational capability to employ the weapons a year later. However, there are risks of delays as the project is already a year behind schedule and has seen its total cost increase by almost 40 percent. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, included these and other new details about the ARRW program in a larger annual review of major U.S. military programs, which it released on June 3, 2020. The Air Force began the development of ARRW in 2018, awarding Lockheed Martin the contract to design the weapon that year. The Air Force conducted the first captive carry test flight of an AGM-183A test article in June 2019, using a B-52H bomber, which is set to be the primary launch platform . There are also now discussions about potentially integrating it onto the B-1B bomber using external pylons. “Program officials stated that they plan to deliver eight hypersonic missiles: four to conduct flight tests and four spares,” GAO’s report explained. “Specifically, [the] ARRW [program] plans to develop an operational prototype with solid-fuel booster, ordnance package, and specialized equipment to enable it to be carried on the B-52H.” “According to program officials, the program will build knowledge through the flight and operational testing of prototype units, as well as potentially provide an operational capability from the deployment of any remaining spare test units,” the review added. The complete ARRW missile primarily consists of the aforementioned solid-fuel rocket booster, with its pop-out tail fins, and an unpowered boost-glide vehicle. The rocket booster propels the vehicle to a specific speed and altitude, after which it detaches and glides down along a relatively level flight path to its target at hypersonic speed, which is defined as anything above Mach 5. The ARRW vehicle will be derived from a wedge-shaped design that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Air Force have been working on together as part of the separate, but parallel Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. DARPA has said in the past that expects TBG’s boost-glide vehicle to reach at least Mach 20. An artist’s conception of the AGM-183A ARRW showing the nose cone breaking away, revealing the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle inside., Lockheed Martin That kind of speed, combined a level atmospheric flight profile, as well as the boost-glide vehicle’s ability to maneuver in flight in an unpredictable fashion, make these kinds of hypersonic weapons, in general, a particularly attractive way to penetrate through enemy air defenses to prosecute short or no-notice strikes against time-critical or otherwise high-value targets. They are also much harder to spot, let alone attempt to intercept , compared to traditional ballistic missiles, which have more predictable flight paths. This, in turn, makes it difficult for opponents to relocate assets, seek cover, or otherwise defend themselves. However, the development of wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicles has proven to be difficult in the past. This has continued to be the case, with TBG having suffered a year-long delay that has, in turn, pushed back the ARRW program plans by the same amount of time. Aviation Week was first to report that the DARPA-Air Force effort was months behind schedule last month. GAO has also now revealed that, in March 2019, the ARRW program office announced its developmental cost estimates had grown by 39 percent. The total estimated program cost, at present, in Fiscal Year 2020 dollars, stands at over $1.1 billion, which includes the purchase of the eight prototype weapons, according to the watchdog’s report. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Army are presently working together to develop sea and ground-launched hypersonic missiles, respectively, which will use a common, conical vehicle that is lower risk than the TBG and ARRW designs, but is also less maneuverable. The Air Force had originally planned to adopt an air-launched hypersonic weapon using the common vehicle, as well. The service announced its desire to cancel that weapon , known as the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW), and use those funds for the ARRW effort, in its budget request for the upcoming 2021 Fiscal Year, which it released in February. A mockup of the conical-shaped common Army-Navy hypersonic boost-glide vehicle., US Army GAO warned in its report that “other schedule slips have cascaded through the program” and that there continue to be risks of additional delays. The Air Force acknowledged to the Congressional watchdog that its schedule for ARRW is “aggressive” and insists that it is on track to conduct the first live-fire test launch in October 2021. The service hopes that it will reach early operational capability with the AGM-183A in September 2022, which is also when it hopes to conduct the fourth and hopefully final flight test of a live prototype. Any of the four spare weapons left over from the test program would then form the core of the available missiles in the Air Force’s arsenal, meaning that this would be a very niche capability, at least initially. This is reminiscent of the service’s relatively small purchases of 30,000-pound class GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker-buster bombs, another very specialized capability that it maintains. In addition to acquiring steadily more MOPs, the Air Force has also continued to test and upgrade its stockpile of these weapons since they officially entered service sometime between 2010 and 2012. The ARRW program could proceed in a similar way after its early fielding, too. Whatever the case, with its plan to cancel HCSW, the Air Force is clearly committed to ARRW becoming its first operational air-launched hypersonic weapon in the next two years.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 4, 2021","Yes, The U.S. Navy Also Took The Spitfire Into Battle During World War II","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Supermarine Spitfire, which first took to the air 85 years ago today, is one of the few aircraft that can justifiably be termed iconic. While this classic fighter’s service in the hands of the U.K. Royal Air Force and its Commonwealth allies, and even with the U.S. Army Air Forces, has been recounted in numerous books, articles, movies , and other media, it’s far less well known that it was also taken to war by the U.S. Navy. The Spitfire’s exploits in World War II have made it a symbol of that conflict, and of its contribution to the heroic defense of the United Kingdom during the Battle of Britain in 1940, in particular. As the tide of the war turned, it helped lead the Allied charge into Nazi-occupied Europe, which is where the U.S. Navy entered the Spitfire story. Lieutenant Robert F. Doyle, US Naval Reserve (USNR), shakes hands with his wingman, Ensign John F. Mudge, USNR, both of Cruiser Scouting Squadron 7 (VCS-7), after their return from a gunfire-spotting and strafing mission over the German lines, in which they broke up an enemy armored column moving toward the Normandy front., National Archives On June 6, 1944, the biggest amphibious invasion force in history was assembled for D-Day , poised to begin the grueling work of liberating western Europe . The Navy, by then, had proven the ascendancy of the aircraft carrier as the ultimate arbiter of naval warfare, but it contributed none of these vessels to the Normandy landings. Instead, Naval Aviation was on hand to operate over the beachhead in support of the battleships and cruisers that would blast German positions along the French coast as the Allies headed ashore. This was the “air spotting” mission and it was traditionally provided by floatplanes, two or three of which could be launched from these warships by catapult, before recovering alongside after a sea landing. Their job was to observe the targets of naval artillery to see where the projectiles were landing, transmitting their observations back by radio so the guns could be corrected accordingly. Additionally, they could also work more like forward air controllers , reporting developments on the battlefield, to help neutralize counterattacks. Up until then, the air spotting task had been handled by the biplane Curtiss SOC Seagull and the monoplane Vought OS2U Kingfisher, which were rugged and reliable, but which were considered ill-equipped to defend themselves over the beachhead, where they could meet the latest variants of the Luftwaffe’s Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters. During operations in the Mediterranean in 1943, the SOC and OS2U had been shown to be vulnerable to fighter attack, and efforts were made to retrain the Navy’s spotter pilots to handle fighters like the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk or North American P-51 Mustang , which would give them the chance to fight back. A Curtiss SOC Seagull of VCS-7 beached at an English airfield after the unit had converted to flying the Spitfire, circa June 1944. Another SOC and a Vought OS2U are parked in the background., National Archives However, rather than getting their hands on any of the U.S. Army Air Forces’ (USAAF) latest single-engine fighters, it was decided that 17 pilots from Cruiser Scouting Squadrons (VCS) and Observation Squadrons (VO) assigned to battleships and cruisers would convert to ex-Royal Air Force Spitfire Mk Vb fighters. Having been introduced to service in 1941, these were hardly state-of-the-art by mid-1944 but were armed with a pair of 20mm cannons and four .303-caliber machine guns for useful defensive firepower. The aviators were brought together as VCS-7 (although some sources state that VOS-7 was the correct designation, contemporary accounts refute this). Regardless, available evidence suggests this was the only Navy squadron to ever fly the Spitfire. Perhaps, too, it was the shortest-lived Navy flying squadron. For its part, the USAAF was already well versed with the Spitfire, its units having taken it into battle during the invasion of North Arica in November 1942. Once they started to come back to England, they traded their war-weary British fighters for P-51s and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings . The remaining Army Spitfires were turned over to the 67th Tactical Observation Group, later the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, part of the Ninth Air Force. The 67th used the aircraft for artillery spotting, weather and photo-reconnaissance, and bomb damage assessment. They also flew daring low-level pre-D-Day invasion missions over northern France in the reconnaissance role. Training for the VCS-7 pilots took place with the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, which was flying Spitfires from Middle Wallop in southern England. The naval aviators were schooled in defensive fighter tactics, aerobatics, navigation, and formation flying, as well as their primary spotting role. A Spitfire Mk Vb of the 107th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. , NATIONAL ARCHIVES On May 28, 1944, VCS-7 was declared operational and moved to its new home at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Lee-on-Solent, on the southern English coast. Its Spitfire Mk Vb aircraft were all second-hand and wore RAF camouflage and markings; at least still one carried a kill marking below the cockpit from its previous operator. Black and white “invasion stripes” were added to wings and fuselages for easy recognition. At this airfield were no fewer than 10 squadrons, in total, all tasked with air spotting, or for tactical reconnaissance, and comprising five from the RAF, four Royal Navy, plus VCS-7. Collectively, these formed the Air Spotting Pool, 34th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 2nd Tactical Air Force. As well as Spitfires, these units flew the type’s carrier-borne cousin, the Seafire, plus Mustangs, and reportedly Hawker Typhoons. For D-Day itself, some of the aircraft were pooled, and VCS-7 was given Seafires and Spitfires.

Smith studies maps, second from the right., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Their work in the upcoming invasion would be to spot for the Western Naval Task Force, providing fire support to the U.S. troops landing at Utah and Omaha beaches, and the Eastern Naval Task Force, supporting the British landings at Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches. A map showing the Normandy invasion area including channels cleared of mines, location of vessels engaged in bombardment, and targets on shore, PUBLIC DOMAIN For VCS-7, operations began at 04:41 AM on June 6, for the first spotting missions of Operation Overlord, as the D-Day landings were codenamed. The tactics employed by the air spotters are described by Steven D. Hill in Spitfires of the US Navy : Typical spotting missions utilized two aircraft. The lead plane functioned as the spotter. The wingman, or “weaver,” provided escort and protected the flight against enemy aerial attack. The clocking, or ship control, method was utilized on the majority of spotting sorties. Standard altitude for spotting missions was 6,000 feet, but poor weather forced the spotter to operate between 1,500 and 2,000 feet. Occasionally, missions were flown at even lower altitudes. Drop tanks were used to increase range. A typical spotting sortie lasted close to two hours. This provided 45 minutes on station and one hour in transit. As it was, the Luftwaffe presence over the beachhead was not as bad as had been feared, although six or seven aircraft from Lee-on-Solent’s 34th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing were lost. Sources disagree whether these fell to anti-aircraft guns or were shot down by German fighters. Four VCS-7 pilots came under attack from Bf 109s and Fw 190s, but all emerged unscathed. It’s worth recalling too, that the Spitfire Mk Vb was, by this time, an aging model, inferior to the latest German fighters, and at least some of these particular airframes had likely seen heavy combat usage already in North Africa. VCS-7 pilots are briefed before flying a gunfire spotting mission over the Normandy beachheads. From left to right: Wing Commander Robert J. Hardiman, RAF, Commanding Allied Spotter Pilots; Ensign Robert J. Adams, USNR; Major Noel East, British Army Intelligence; Lieutenant Harris Hammersmith, Jr., USNR; and Captain John Ruscoe, Royal Artillery, Gunnery Liaison Officer., National Archives The only confirmed VCS-7 loss was to anti-aircraft gunfire, which claimed Lieutenant Richard M. Barclay of the USS Tuscaloosa (CA-37). His wingman made it back to base with severe damage to his aircraft. While Barclay’s is the only Normandy campaign loss recorded by the official VCS-7 combat report, there may have been more — other sources list a total of seven or eight of the squadron’s aircraft lost to enemy action throughout its existence, plus one loss not due to enemy action, over the course of 209 sorties. VCS-7’s own report lists 191 sorties between June 6 and 25, most of these on the first three days of the campaign. One of the VCS-7 pilots, Ensign Robert J. Adams, reportedly became the first Naval aviator to land in France after D-Day, when he landed his damaged Spitfire on an auxiliary landing field in Allied-occupied territory. By June 26, the Allied invasion force had advanced so far into Normandy that its spearhead was out of the range of the naval guns, and VCS-7 was disbanded. The aviators went back to their ships, bringing with them nine Distinguished Flying Crosses, six Air Medals, and five Gold Stars. Although it was only a brief, cameo appearance in the Spitfire saga, the U.S. Navy’s role in the story is one that is worth remembering, for the bravery of its pilots and their valuable contribution to the liberation of Europe, on this, the anniversary of the type’s maiden flight.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 29, 2021",Navy Mysteriously Cancels Plan To Arm Jets With “Screaming Arrow” Hypersonic Anti-Ship Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The latest in a seemingly endless line of U.S. hypersonic missile projects , which called for an air-breathing anti-ship weapon to arm the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet multirole fighter , has been announced and promptly canceled. The service revealed earlier this week that it was beginning research into the scramjet-powered weapon as part of the Screaming Arrow Innovative Naval Prototype program, before announcing today it had axed the project — at least for now. The original solicitation was posted online on March 2, in which the Office of Naval Research’s (ONR) Department for Aviation, Force Projection and Integrated Defense called for proposals for the development and testing of a hypersonic, air-breathing controlled test vehicle, or CTV, to be named Screaming Arrow. While the Navy said it hadn’t yet decided how fast it wanted the weapon to fly, hypersonic speed is generally defined as anything above Mach 5. An F/A-18E launches from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz . The Screaming Arrow innovative aimed to provide the Super Hornet with a hypersonic air-breathing anti-ship weapon., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Sarah Christoph Today, however, an amendment to the solicitation reads, simply: “The Special Notice is canceled in its entirety.” No explanation was given and there is no way to know, yet, whether the notice itself has been rescinded or the entire program has been terminated. There is also the possibility that Screaming Arrow has simply been given a higher classification and been moved into the “black world.” What we do know is that funds were to be provided by the ONR starting in Fiscal Year 2021, the Navy saying it wanted Screaming Arrow to include “likely three CTV launches” from land bases that would test the booster, interstage, and scramjet-powered cruiser components. The missile was to be small enough to be accommodated on the Super Hornet and be compliant with the aircraft carrier’s existing munitions storage and weapon-handling equipment. Another important consideration was that the weapon would be light enough for a fighter to recover on a carrier deck while still carrying it. These requirements seem to have been driven, at least in part, by Navy concerns that the U.S. Air Force’s Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM), in particular, could be too large for transport on the aircraft carriers’ weapons elevators. That could also explain why the Navy was pursuing Screaming Arrow and similar efforts in parallel to other Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force programs. The chosen scramjet propulsion typically only functions properly at high speeds, requiring some kind of booster, generally a rocket motor, to accelerate it to operating velocity. Then, the scramjet takes over. Previous applications in the United States have included the X-51A Waverider , an experimental air-breathing hypersonic vehicle. Following air launch, the Screaming Arrow flight profile required demonstration of controlled flight, CTV booster ignition and operation, separation of the booster from the cruiser, cruiser controlled flight, cruiser engine start, cruiser acceleration to cruise condition, cruiser at cruise condition, cruiser turndown, cruiser terminal phase flight trajectory, and finally cruiser flight impact. “Within both the Navy and OSD there is a desire to field a near-term hypersonic weapon system,” the solicitation explained. “For the Navy specifically, it is envisioned that Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) Increment Two (Incr 2) weapon be either a hypersonic or near-hypersonic weapon. For OSD, there is the broader desire and a Congressional mandate to develop and bring a hypersonic weapon into the U.S. inventory.” Should the Screaming Arrow tests have proven successful, this developmental missile could then be fielded in the future to fulfill the OASuW Increment 2 requirement under a program of record, although it might have still faced competition from other candidates. OASuW Increment 1, meanwhile, is the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), currently fielded by the Air Force and Navy . LRASM test articles are loaded onto an F/A-18E at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland., U.S. Navy In order to accelerate the new program, the Navy called for the leverage of existing hypersonic air vehicles and propulsion systems “with limited design changes” to create a prototype representative of a potential operational system. “The specific use case of Screaming Arrow is Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW),” the solicitation added, before explaining that the threshold target set included but was not limited to, surface combatants and capital ships. “The need for Screaming Arrow technologies arises from a capability gap in propulsion solutions for servicing adversary targets at range within a compressed time of flight, which is not achievable with today’s sub-hypersonic weapon approaches,” it read. A graphic from the solicitation providing the key design elements behind Screaming Arrow., U.S. NAVY Whatever its current status, Screaming Arrow was not the only scramjet-powered missile project the Navy is working on right now. Last October The War Zone reported that Boeing had won a contract to help develop a ramjet-powered high-speed missile demonstrator for the Navy under the Supersonic Propulsion Enabled Advanced Ramjet (SPEAR) program. Also intended to arm the F/A-18E/F, the first flight of a SPEAR demonstrator is planned for late 2022. Boeing believes that the design will help the Navy identify requirements for future air-launched missiles, perhaps including hypersonic weapons. Boeing is also active on behalf of the Navy in the hypersonic realm, with its HyFly 2 program, a dual-combustion ramjet-powered cruise missile. In October last year, the Pentagon included the company in a competition to build a Mach 6 cruise missile, funding a preliminary design review and ground testing of the dual-combustion ramjet. At the time, Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor, said the HyFly 2, like Screaming Arrow, “appears optimized for a carrier-based fighter.” HyFly 2 follows on from the original Boeing HyFly , a joint DARPA and Navy program that produced a demonstrator optimized for the F/A-18E/F and which resulted in three failed flight tests between 2007 and 2010. Boeing concept artwork of a re-engined B-52 carrying a little-known weapon known as Hammer, which bears a striking resemblance to HyFly 2., Boeing In another program, Boeing is also working with Australia on the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment , or SCIFiRE, which also aims to bring these types of weapons within reach of the F/A-18E/F. The ambitious program is intended to yield an operationally ready weapon within the next five to 10 years. In the United States, meanwhile, both the Navy and Air Force plan to award contracts for hypersonic cruise missiles in Fiscal Year 2022, and the Screaming Arrow and HyFly 2 appear well-positioned for the Navy requirement, at least. Other companies, too, will likely look for a share of this expanding market for scramjet-powered, hypersonic cruise missiles, including Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, both of which are providing demonstrators for the Air Force’s scramjet-powered Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program. In the past, the HAWC has also been pitched a potential air-launched weapon for the Navy, albeit arming the F-35C Lightning II . An artist’s concept of a follow-on to the HAWC missile for the U.S. Navy., JOSEPH TREVITHICK Whatever form a production version of Screaming Arrow might have taken — and of course, still might — the service determined that it wanted the F/A-18E/F to be able to carry up to four of the missiles simultaneously, on weapons stations three, four, eight, and nine. The Super Hornet has now entirely displaced the legacy F/A-18A-to-D Hornet onboard U.S. Navy carriers and, although the service has looked at stopping buying new Super Hornets in the past, it remains the cornerstone of the carrier air wing’s strike fighter community. Indeed, a significant number of Super Hornets are scheduled to go through the Block III upgrade program , which will add a host of advanced features that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Currently, the Navy Super Hornet relies upon the aforementioned LRASM as its primary anti-ship missile. While this is an advanced weapon in itself, with the ability to navigate autonomously around threats, even if its GPS-assisted guidance system and two-way data links might be jammed, and has stealthy features to evade enemy defenses, it is also subsonic. Clearly, hypersonic weapons are a growth area, and not only for the U.S. military. India, for example, conducted a flight of its air-breathing Hypersonic Technology Demonstration Vehicle testbed last September. In the anti-ship mission, weapons in this class offer particular advantages, above all, their speed, which provides the ship under attack with very little time to respond. Even if the ship can initiate defensive actions, there is a good chance that a missile will inflict some kind of damage. Against the frenetic U.S. activity in this field, China and Russia are meanwhile forging ahead with increasingly advanced anti-ship designs of their own. These include long-range anti-ship cruise missiles as well as air and surface-launched anti-ship ballistic missiles. Hypersonic threats , too, are a growing concern, as is the prospect of a major maritime conflict , especially in the Pacific region . The reported first test launch of the Russian Zircon hypersonic cruise missile against a naval target, which is said to have taken place last October ., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP With this in mind, it is understandable that the Navy would want to field similarly advanced anti-ship capabilities onboard aircraft carriers themselves, whose onboard air defense capabilities are often strictly limited. While providing the carrier air wing’s Super Hornet with a hypersonic — or at least very-high-speed — anti-ship weapon wouldn’t stop an incoming missile, it would at least help fortify the carrier’s defensive umbrella against surface threats. Alternatively, if the U.S. Navy carrier strike group was to go on the offensive, a barrage of hypersonic ship-killing missiles, launched from standoff range, layered together with other weapons, including subsonic LRASMs, would make it far harder for enemy ships to survive. Furthermore, should it progress, Screaming Arrow, or similar air-launched anti-ship weapons, could also be adapted to become long-range land-attack weapons, too, and may also attract the attention of the Air Force. Right now, confusion surrounds the Screaming Arrow program. Whether or not the program is shelved for good, restructured into a separate initiative, or actually makes a comeback at some point in the future, it is clear that the Navy is eager for a new air-launched anti-ship weapon, and high supersonic or hypersonic speed is a priority.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",What Is A Diamond DA42 Light Aircraft Doing At Russia’s Airbase In Syria?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent satellite image of the newly expanded Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, the main hub of Russian military aviation activity in that country, revealed an unusual visitor: an example of the Austrian-designed twin-engine Diamond DA42 light aircraft. Beyond being a popular private aircraft and trainer, it has also been adapted into a surveillance aircraft, and its operator is almost certainly Russia’s Federal Security Service, also known by its Russian acronym FSB, but the story of how this organization ended up with these aircraft is an unusual one. The satellite photo, dated February 26 this year, was brought to our attention by Twitter user Samir . The photo shows the regular complement of Russian Aerospace Forces tactical fighter jets at the base, with examples of the Su-24 Fencer and Su-34 Fullback strike aircraft as well as Su-35 Flanker multirole fighters. A pair of MiG-29SMT Fulcrum fighter jets are also visible, these having returned to Syria after an absence of around three years. Support assets are arranged around the tarmac as well, comprising single examples of the An-72 Coaler and Tu-154 Careless jet transports for conveying personnel both within the country and to and from Russia. Then there is the single DA42, parked alone on an otherwise empty flight line. Wearing the tactical code ‘421 Black,’ this is the FSB DA42M-NG with an electro-optical sensor suite. , VIA EN.TOPWAR.RU The DA42 is powered by Austro Engine’s AE300-E4 diesel engines that can also run on standard jet fuel. The aircraft features a Garmin glass cockpit with twin LCD screens and autopilot and can fly missions of up to 12 hours in duration, with the option of single-pilot operations. Economical to operate, the DA42 has become popular among private fliers, aero clubs, and training academies around the world. Although little-publicized, Russia has also been using the DA42 for some time now, although it’s not thought to have been previously seen in Syria. While most Russian DA42s are used for training, rather more secretive are the two DA42M-NG surveillance aircraft operated by the FSB, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB. One of these aircraft, wearing the Russian civil registration RF-68500, can be seen at the top of this story. Plans to acquire these aircraft were apparently first revealed on the website of Zakupki, Russia’s Public Procurement Institute, in 2016. Costing $10.2 million, the aircraft were scheduled to be delivered to a base in Stavropolsky Krai by May 2016; this would put the aircraft within reach of the troubled regions of Chechnya and Dagestan. The DA42M-NGs were assembled locally at the Urals Civil Aviation Works (UZGA) in Yekaterinburg. These particular aircraft appear to be a Russian version similar to Diamond’s own DA42 MPP Guardian , which can be adapted for a variety of missions, including border surveillance, reconnaissance, and aerial surveys. This Guardian version of the aircraft features modular payload bays for various electro-optical and infrared cameras, surveillance radars, communications packages, and other systems. A satellite data link allows it to share any of that information with personnel on the ground. A Diamond-owned DA42 MPP Guardian on display at the MAKS international air show outside Moscow in 2013., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons The indigenous mission suite for the Russian aircraft was apparently developed by RTI Aerospace Systems (RTI AKS) and as well as surveillance equipment includes broadband and satellite communications to transmit near-real-time imagery to ground stations. The two aircraft feature different sensor configurations, with one being optimized for electro-optical surveillance, using a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) turret under the nose. The other aircraft features the BLRK radar system that includes an antenna in a semi-recessed pod below the fuselage and an elongated nose. There are several options as to what the FSB uses these two aircraft for. Firstly, however, it’s worth taking a closer look at the little-known FSB aircraft fleet, which is significant in itself. The organization, which includes around 230,000 personnel, has a fleet of around 60 fixed-wing aircraft and approximately 130 helicopters. The most important aircraft types are the An-26 and An-72 transports, as well as a range of other transport types and a few trainers. One unusual FSB asset is the armed An-72P border patrol aircraft , a specialist paramilitary aircraft that can be armed with gun and rocket pods. An FSB-operated An-26 transport in the Kuril Islands., Igor Dvurekov/Wikimedia Commons The primary helicopter type operated is the ubiquitous Mi-8 Hip , but there are also a few heavy-lift Mi-26 Halos, around 10 Mi-24 and Mi-35M Hind assault helicopters, plus smaller utility rotorcraft. Drones and surveillance balloons are also operated. As Russia’s main security agency, the FSB uses its aircraft for internal and border security, as well as transporting counterintelligence and counter-terrorism units. For example, an FSB aviation unit at Vnukovo near Moscow is specifically tasked with the rapid deployment of personnel from the FSB’s special Vympel and Alfa teams. While the border guard duties were made separate and became the responsibility of the Federal Border Guard Service (FPS) between 1993 and 2003, they have now been brought back within the FSB remit. FSB personnel during a special operation in the Republic of Dagestan., RIA Novosti archive/Wikimedia Commons As to what the FSB is using its DA42M-NG aircraft for, as well as for border patrol, they are especially useful for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks in scenarios requiring a long time on station while maintaining a low profile. Not only does the DA42 offer very low noise emissions and limited infrared signature, but the appearance of the aircraft itself is also suitably anonymous when operating from civil airports, for example, which could be the case during high-profile events or particular law-enforcement actions. The FSB, which is charged with protecting the borders of the largest country in the world, regularly operates its aircraft from remote and environmentally hostile locations. The DA42 is a good fit here, as well, with straightforward maintenance requirements and all-weather capability. On the other hand, the two-aircraft FSB fleet suggests that the DA42M-NGs could be primarily used in a developmental capacity, testing new surveillance and satellite communications capabilities. This would also make sense bearing in mind the two specific configurations that have been identified. There have also been reports in the past of Russia developing an unmanned version of the DA42, and aviation website Scramble claims that the DA42M-NG could be used as a manned demonstrator, or surrogate, to prove the feasibility of this concept. Other drones, too, may benefit from this possible research, with the Russian military in the process of introducing a number of new unmanned types, ranging from jet-powered combat UAVs to the Predator-style Orion , and the ISR-optimized Altius-U . A still from a video showing the first flight of the Altius-U., YouTube Screencap Indeed, the Altius-U is a twin-diesel-engine design much like the DA42, and its manufacturer is UZGA in Yekaterinburg. It is intended to fly intelligence missions with an electro-optical and radar payload. Meanwhile, photos reportedly showing an unmanned—or more likely optionally manned—DA42B circulated back in 2018, including one intriguing image showing the aircraft armed with four 9М120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles below the fuselage. Reportedly, this photo was published by the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta and then retracted. UZGA apparently also issued a denial that it had armed the aircraft. 9M120 Ataka missiles under a DA42 platform in Russia., VIA EN.TOPWAR.RU It is uncertain, therefore, whether the image of the armed aircraft showed a manned, unmanned, or even an optionally manned DA42. What is clear is that serious thought has been given to arming the Russian DA42 in the past. It is possible, therefore, that the Syrian deployment involved some kind of weapons trials, too. Whether the DA42M-NG is being used to test systems and tactics for itself, or for some kind of drone, a deployment to Syria would be a logical development. After all, Russia has conducted limited trials of other new manned and unmanned aircraft in the conflict in that country, including the Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter and as well as weapons tests with the Orion drone . Other Russian weapons have been tested in Syria as well, including ground combat vehicles . The DA42M-NG is only suitable for operations in uncontested airspace but could be used for patrolling regime-held territory around Latakia province, where Khmeimim Air Base is located. A satellite image of Khmeimim as of December 14, 2020., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION On the other hand, Khmeimim Air Base itself has come under attack in the past, being subjected to a number of drone attacks in late 2017 and early 2018, as well as other types of nefarious behavior. The persistent ISR capabilities of the DA42M-NG could also be ideal for monitoring the areas around the base to prevent infiltration by rebels armed with mortars, rockets, or weaponized drones. With Russia lacking a surveillance drone in the same class as the Predator or Reaper , a manned DA42 variant could be a very useful gap-filler. If the type is unmanned, or if the Russians feel it is worth the risk, the type could venture into ‘hotter’ areas to provide critical overwatch and intelligence gathering capabilities for military operations. Russian Diamonds The story of how Russia came to operate the DA42 in the first place dates back to around 2010 when the Russian Ministry of Defense selected it as a twin-engine trainer: the aircraft is used for developing military pilots destined to fly transport aircraft, for example, or other multi-engine types. The DA42NG was chosen as the basis for a new design to be built under license by UZGA as the DA42T. A line of Diamond DA40s outside the UZGA factory., UZGA Reportedly, UZGA received the first Russian Ministry of Defense contract for the DA42T in 2013, together with single-engined Diamond DA40s. The deal came to wider attention only in December 2017, when, during a visit to the UZGA factory, Yuri Borisov, at the time Russia’s Deputy Minister of Defense, announced an order for 35 DA42T aircraft. By this time, however, it seems that at least the first three DA42Ts had been delivered and the remainder from this order had been handed over by 2019. While the 35 DA42Ts seem to have been ordered by the Russian Ministry of Defense, the first deliveries were made to the St. Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation located at the city’s Pulkovo Airport. However, Scramble also reports that additional DA42Ts have since been delivered to the Krasnodar Military Aviation College of Pilots, Russia’s only specialist fixed-wing military aircraft training establishment. These aircraft are based at Balashov, which specializes in multi-engine training, and also operates the An-26 Curl twin-turboprop transport . Another Western design used for training in Russia. A Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP from the St. Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation., Yuriy Ilyin/Wikimedia Commons Since it seems that the initial agreement for license production would have been concluded before August 1, 2014, the deal would have avoided the European Union arms embargo imposed on Russia in response to Moscow’s involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. On the other hand, the decision to allocate at least some of these training aircraft to a non-military organization means that they may have been exempt anyway: the sanctions specifically prohibit the supply of arms and services for military use or for military end-users in Russia. However, preliminary training of aircrew for the Russian military is by no means unusual and dates back to the Soviet era. Nowadays, prior to entering one of the Russian military flying schools, it is desired that the cadets have had previous elementary flight training on light aircraft, with a flying club, for example. The secretive nature of the FSB means we may well never know for sure what the DA42M-NG was doing during its time in Syria, but it serves as yet another signal that Russia is increasingly willing to test new and potentially innovative technologies in the war-torn country as part of its wider modernization effort. Regardless Syria certainly isn’t where one would think of stumbling upon a DA42. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 15, 2020",Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About The Navy’s Ever-Evolving Aegis Combat System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Aegis Combat System, aptly named after the shield of the Greek god Zeus, represented an absolute revolution in how naval surface warfare could be conducted when it first emerged in an operational form nearly four decades ago. At its core, Aegis was a monumental technological triumph made possible by combining advances in computers, sensors, weapons, communications, and human interfaces into a highly automated system the likes of which would have been considered science fiction not long before its arrival. Since then, Aegis has grown massively in capability and has largely dictated what is possible when it comes to the ability of warships to exert control over the massive volumes of air and sea surrounding them. While the system is still going strong today—it continues to serve aboard nearly all the U.S. Navy major surface combatants, as well as a number of allies’, its perpetual development has resulted in something of a blurry picture as to just how much it has evolved over the years and where it is headed in the future. With that in mind, The War Zone talked in-depth with Rich Calabrese, Director of Surface Navy Mission Systems for Lockheed Martin, in an attempt to bring clarity to the state of Aegis today, as well as to better understanding its past. And above all else, we wanted to learn about what is on the horizon for what is one of the most important, but often misunderstood weapon systems in the Pentagon’s portfolio. What we found out was downright amazing. So, without further ado, here is our exchange nearly in its entirety: Tyler: How has the Aegis Combat System evolved over nearly four decades since it first entered service aboard the USS Ticonderoga ? Are there any moves to create a new system or call it something else or is the Aegis legacy going to stay put for the time being? Rich: The short answer is, dramatically. What a lot of people don’t realize, is that we have been continuously evolving the Aegis architecture. There are a couple of points in time where the architecture has taken what I would call some step functions, but generally speaking, we do what we call “while we’re under the hood” changes. Essentially, as we add new capabilities, capabilities drive, form follows function, and a lot of times, that results in a change to the architecture, as well as the technology has changed. USS Norton Sound, originally built as a seaplane tender and later refitted as an Aegis test ship, seen in 1980. It was outfitted to test components of the Aegis system from 1973 on. The installation containing the fixed arrays of the AN/SPY-1A radar that can be seen mounted at the top of the forward superstructure. Aegis development goes back to the 1960s and was first fielded operationally in the early 1980s., USN If you think about back to when Aegis was first started and it was written in CMS-2 computer language , which is essentially like an assembly language, evolved through the introduction of COTS languages, C++ and Java, and now a lot of script languages and things like that. The processing power that’s available to us, all those things have contributed to a dramatic change in the Aegis Weapon System over the 40 years. The names remain the same in terms of what are the elements of the Aegis Weapon System, but inside of them, the changes that we have made, have made the software more modular, made it more flexible… and facilitated the integration of new capabilities, new weapons and sensors… As we look forward, the number of sources of information and the number of the data sources that we’re looking to incorporate are driving us to change some basic paradigms of how the system works and how it’s architected. An aerial port bow view of the U.S. Navy guided-missile cruiser USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) underway during Standard II missile tests near the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility, Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico (USA), on 9 April 1983. Ticonderoga was the first operational Aegis warship. , USN Tyler: I think one of the things that people don’t realize is it’s the same system, but it’s also really a totally different system. As time has gone on, there’s so much difference there that it’s the same concept, but it’s very much a different, modernized system compared to what existed 40 years ago. Would that be a correct assumption? Rich: Yeah, that’s correct and a lot of people don’t realize that. The other thing… Are you familiar with the Common Source Library? Does that term mean something to you? Tyler: Not off the top of my head, no. Rich: So, the power of the architecture really is demonstrated by what we call the Common Source Library or CSL. What the CSL does is it allows us to use a common computer program based on the Aegis computer program to support a large number of different ships. So, essentially, all the surface combatants now, LCS , the frigate (FFG-X/ Constellation class) which we’re developing, even the Coast Guard, Aegis cruisers and destroyers, international programs, they are all now built out of the same Aegis Common Source Library. CSL is the heart of all Aegis and associated installations across many types of surface combatants., Lockheed Martin Because the architecture has the flexibility and Lockheed Martin has the tools and knowledge of the domains, we’re able to deliver… I’ll say specifically tailored computer programs for each of those different missions. And if you look at that range of missions, a Coast Guard cutter whose job is primarily to do drug interdiction missions up to a Aegis destroyer who’s doing integrated air missile defense capability at the highest end is quite a range of—and in between, you’ve got LCS and ships like that—quite a range of missions and capabilities, different sensors, different weapons, all being driven by the same Aegis computer program in the form of the CSL. A Freedom class LCS is seen underway. These ships use a version of the CSL that is tailored to their more limited capabilities compared to a destroyer or cruiser. , USN That’s been a major change in the way we deliver capability, and we’re able to, like I said, tailor specific functionality and essentially, not to trivialize it, turn on and off functionality. So, in that way, if somebody later decides, “Hey, I would like that capability on my program, on my ship,” it’s already built into the CSL, we can effectively turn it on for that particular ship assuming they have the sensors and weapons that are necessary to support that mission. Tyler: Interesting. That’s a very automotive trend too, a standardized software platform where they can say just, “Yeah, you want the extra range in the Tesla? We can turn it on.” It seems like that’s bled over into your space, and obviously, software is being one of the biggest hurdles to any program these days… Aegis Baseline 9 allowed ballistic missile defense and defense against air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles and aircraft, simultaneously. Can you talk a little bit about that, what the challenges are to actually making something like that happen and how that is a game-changer for the surface combatants that receive it? Rich: Yeah, so the game-changing aspect of it is that prior to Integrated Air Missile Defense, the ships were either or AAW capability or ballistic missile defense capability . And essentially, for the longest period of time, separate computer programs were actually developed and you switch between the computer programs depending on the posture of the ship. With the introduction of Integrated Air Missile Defense, it allows you to conduct both missions. In the past, a properly outfitted cruiser or a destroyer could only conduct ballistic missile defense or anti-air warfare, not both at the same time. , USN The biggest architectural driver I would say is the Mission Planner, which allows you to set up your resources accordingly based on your ship position, your mission, priorities, and so forth, and helps you to set up and plan for how you need to allocate your radar resources to support both missions. Obviously, there’s a ripple effect throughout the system in terms of how the signal processor works, how the weapon control system works. Everything is tuned to be able to support the simultaneous execution of those two missions. But the biggest result being for the warfighter is them being able to simultaneously execute those missions as opposed to separately. Each of the functions of the Aegis Weapon System was evaluated to see what changes would need to be made internal to each of the components in order to support that integrated Air Missile Defense. And again, the Mission Planner is a key element of how we are able to manage those resources, and then obviously, we’re monitoring the performance against that plan and are able to react in real-time to the evolving mission. Tyler: If I’m in the CIC ( Combat Information Center —the nerve center of the ship) or whatever, I can say, “Hey, listen, the ballistic missile threat is prominent versus the air threat” and I could configure my operations based on what I perceive is the major threat at the time. Is that what the Mission Planner gives you in terms of tailored flexibility? Rich: Yeah, and you know your operating area, you know geographically where you are, you know what the threats are, so basically you are fine-tuning the system to be prepared to respond to the most likely scenario that you’re going to face that day. Inside the CIC aboard the cruiser USS Normandy (CG-60). , USN Tyler: With all this, we will be seeing, pretty soon, the introduction of an AESA technology, the SPY-6 radar , and then Aegis Baseline 10 configuration to go with it. What will that bring to the Navy? There’s obviously the next Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers, they’ll have that, but also there’s going to be potentially a back-fit program for some existing Flight II destroyers. What does that sensor upgrade and also Baseline 10 give for this next step we’re going to see in the evolution of the Aegis system? Rich: Yeah, so I’m not really the radar guy, but I’ll tell you, primarily, the difference from the radar perspective is performance—its ability of what it can see and what it can discriminate. So, I’ll leave it at that from a classification perspective, it’s going to buy you extra performance, it’s going to buy you some extra battle space and decision time. Of course, that’s needed as the threat is increasing. What’s different is that the radar is a task-based radar, so the combat system now is evolving, and we talked about how is it changing. Basic configuration for the Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers which will come equipped with the SPY-6 radar., GAO/Navy With Baseline 10, we’re introducing the ability to plan and manage a task-based radar so that you can tell the radar what it is your objectives are for it to perform, and it’ll go off and perform to the request of the combat system. That’s a big deal. The other thing is integrating that with all the other sensors and that’ll be on board. So the introduction of an Above Water Sensor Coordinator, that allows us to make resource determinations across multiple sensors on the ship, and again fine-tune your sensor posture for your environment, for your threat space, for your geography. That’s where the introduction of SPY-6 brings that task-based radar capability, it brings higher performance and sensitivities, and then the combat system has evolved along with it to be one able to control and manage the task-based radar. But also the next architectural step was really to abstract away all the specifics of the sensors to allow for effectively all data sources to be able to be used by the combat system in a similar way. The massive SPY-6 radar unit. , Raytheon Then we’ve architected it such that a non-task-based radar, back to the Common Source Library concept, that same software architecture can be applied to all of the Baseline 9 ships that will be out there. And we’re heading towards what we call CSL Continuity, which means there will truly be a single baseline of capability across the Baseline-9 and the Flight III ships that’ll be out there. So, the Flight IIs and the Flight III ships will have a common architecture, a common functionality, and performance will differ based on the radar. SPY-6 on a DDG will be different than a potential SPY-6 back-fit, which will be smaller, maybe even a rotating radar. Then there are other radar upgrades that are being looked at from a legacy radar perspective that Lockheed is working with the Navy on now to provide similar solid-state capabilities, as you would see on SPY-6, but on the legacy SPY-1 platforms. Tyler: Will Aegis fuse new sensors like infrared surveillance systems, or weapons like directed energy weapons ? What do you see being tied into the system in the future that maybe isn’t a priority now, or is at least not fielded now? Rich: Again, the short answer is everything. We’re continuously upgrading the multi-source integration infusion capability of the Aegis weapon system and looking to bring in new weapons and sensors and do coordinated hard kill and soft kill. Directed energy weapons… We’re really already integrating the Helios Laser Weapon System with the Aegis Weapon System CSL in our lab here in New Jersey. In fact, we’ve… The guy who’s now managing the laser program… He let me know the other day that we recently fired a laser here under the control of the Aegis Weapon System computer program. So, we’re building in the capability to do that weapon coordination and to do the hard kill, soft kill coordination in an automated fashion, working with the Helios Weapon System. USS Rancocas, “The Cornfield Cruiser,” Aegis lab located in New Jersey. , Lockheed Martin Similarly, EW (electronic warfare) with SEWIP and really even beyond all data sources, if you think of anything that could provide data to the ship, and traditionally, there was a harder boundary between what some would call C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) or C6I systems, C6ISR, whatever combination of letters you like, there was typically a segregation, there were some data sources that stayed in the C4 system and the Aegis Weapon System was primarily just driven by the SPY radar. Today, what we’re doing is fusing all of that data to create a better situational awareness, and we’re able to engage on data that’s non-traditional in the form of data that may come from, I’ll say non-organic sensors. Tyler: That level of automation would allow those at the controls to use the weapons they have more efficiently and to better classify, sort, and engage targets that are of higher priority than just having a bunch of federated systems or even those that are talking to each other in limited ways, but not actually fully fused into the system seamlessly. That’s the goal, correct? Rich: Yeah. So, the Above Water Sensor Coordinator gives us that level of automation that allows us to recognize, set the objectives for the mission and monitor against that, and then really essentially be more effective and more efficient with your weapons and your sensors. So, you’re not using all of your sensor resources looking at one thing. If you have another sensor that can give you the same information with the same… I’ll say our budgets, that allows us to trade-off again. Say maybe I don’t need to use all of the primary radar resources, if I have a SPQ-9 or something like that, that I can use to give me good enough data for the mission that I’m trying to achieve. Aegis is in service with six nations’ navies. , Lockheed Martin Tyler: We’ve seen Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile Block 2 and SM-6 that are networked and the moving away from having to rely on radar illuminators to paint targets for missiles to engage them in their end-game phase of flight. How is that going to change the system? Is this going to be able to simplify things in some ways, eventually not having to integrate target illumination using discreet illuminators aboard Aegis-equipped ships like U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers? Rich: Yeah, and it’s really on a mission-by-mission basis as to whether how much you can rely on the ‘fire and forget’ missiles. It’s certainly an assist to us to be able to perhaps get more missiles and missiles in flight if you’re not bounded by the illuminator resources [four on Ticonderoga class cruises, three on Arleigh Burke class destroyers]. But again, that comes into… What comes into play there is our weapon control architecture, which allows us to do smart weapon scheduling and trying to do the best weapon target pairing. That’s some of that automation that we talked about that’s built into the Aegis Weapon System. It is able to do that weapon selection and weapon target pairing, knowing what your resources are. “Hey, do I have… What’s my depth of fire? Do I shoot a long-range weapon at this thing and take it out early? Do I try to shoot the archer [the launch platform before it can fire]? Can I wait? If I wait, what am I using?” So, those are the kind of trade-offs in terms of which missiles I’m using against which targets. The fire-and-forget does give us a little bit more flexibility, but again, it all comes down to understanding the mission, the target, and the timelines involved. USS John Paul Jones test-fires an SM-6 which features an active radar seeker., USN Tyler: How automated is that process, if I’m there on the controls, is the system at a point now where it’s giving me recommendations as far as what it thinks is best? How does that work? Rich: It’s always been an interesting question to me because really from day one, automation… Aegis theoretically could operate fully autonomously it’s really a choice of the warfighters in terms of how much they trust the system. So, what’s improving now is that we’re providing algorithms that give you a little bit more confidence in the selections that the system is making and the system is giving, is putting up, is making decisions. We’re able to give you probabilities or the rationale behind the decisions that the system’s making so the operator can look at it. But frankly, the timelines are happening so fast, which is why we’re putting in things like Above Water Sensor Coordinators and Weapon Coordinators and things like that, that provide a high degree of automation, because there’s really no time for the operator to be in the loop. We talk about the operator being in the loop. So, they know what’s happening, they know why things are happening, and if they’re gonna negate something, they wanna do command by negation. They have information there that will allow them to do that. But more and more, they’re going to have to rely on the automation that’s, like I said, really been in the system since the beginning of the Aegis Weapon System. It’s just that we may have more information now through the fusion of data, we may have more options now in terms of the weapons that are going to go after it. So, the environment is certainly getting more complex, the threats are getting more challenging and so the reliance on the automation and the provision of things like decision aids that make some of those decisions for them, like balancing sensor resources or doing the weapon selection, and weapon-target pairing, just become more essential to the success of the mission. Senior Chief Fire Controlman Michael Cullinan monitors a radar console for air and surface contacts in the combat information center aboard the forward-deployed Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG-75)., USN Tyler: What if we were to take the Baseline 10 configuration and put it into an older ship? What does that look like? When we hear an upgrade happening, what does that include? Do you have to rip all the hardware out and then also put in new software with new hardware to support it? Or is this something that is more of a software transplant? Rich: Well, it depends on the state of the ship. So for example, in doing Baseline 9, we’re putting out hardware that is referred to as TI-12H and TI-16. Just think of those as a level of computing capacity and a generation of hardware that’s out there. What that enables us to do is a couple of things. If a Baseline 9 ship is already running that later hardware, then it’s primarily just a software back-fit to say, take Baseline 10 when it’s complete and put it back to a Baseline 9. Now, when you do that, of course, you may not have all the same sensors and weapons available to you on the ship, so you may not get the same performance, but you would get the same functionality and you can get commonality across Baseline 9 and Baseline 10 ships. If the ship hasn’t been updated then to date, what that has involved would be called a modernization. That would be typically taking out all the racks of old equipment and upgrading them with modern computing, something along the lines of what I would call a TI-16 hardware. That’s a bigger deal, that’s more of a ship impact in terms of the amount of time it takes and the cost associated with it, if you have to take out really old hardware. But what we’re providing now is that on those older ships, what we can do is we can bring a ‘virtualized’ Aegis Weapon System back, and the amount of hardware, the footprint required to run the virtualized Aegis Weapon System is significantly less. Aegis-equipped warships are designed to be networked together and work as a combat team. , USN So, for a while, we were looking at the Baseline 5 ships, for example, which were primarily BMD ships, they already had some computing equipment, they were talking about doing a tech refresh. That tech refresh would have brought the computing environment for essentially what would have been just adjunct computing, but because we’re able to use a smaller computing footprint with a virtualized Aegis Weapon System, we would have been able to bring a Baseline-9 or a Baseline-10 computer program back to those Baseline-5 ships without as much of a substantial hardware impact because the footprint is smaller than otherwise required with what prior modernizations used to require. Tyler: When you say virtual, what exactly is that? How is it defined in terms of Aegis? Rich: So, virtual meaning that we would have a set of virtual machines. A virtual machine is, think of it as a software representation of a computing platform. On the raw hardware, if you think of the bare-bones metal of the hardware, you would run these virtual machines, which is in a sense present to the computer, to the computer program, it presents the look of, you think you are running in the computer that you’ve always run in. So, if I used to run in a TI-16 rack of hardware, and I had a bunch of blade servers in there, well, it might not actually be on a bunch of physical blade servers anywhere because inside of a server, I may be able to create, I’m just making up a number, 10 virtual TI-16 blade servers. So, now I could run all of Aegis Weapon Systems software on a much smaller set of [computer hardware]… Taking advantage essentially of the horsepower that’s available to us now in the modern computing market, we can now run… So think of that stack, bare-metal hardware, virtual machine, which is a commercial product, native Aegis Weapon System computer program and operating systems, and so forth, sitting on top of that. Aegis and the CICs aboard ships equipped with the system have evolved along with advances in sensor, communications, and computing technology. But its interfaces have always looked like something out of a sci-fi military thriller. Now, with miniaturized computers with far more power than their predecessors, less space is needed to install far more capability.  Here is a photo of Aegis aboard a Ticonderoga cruiser from the system’s first decade of service. , USN This is a rare photo of the CIC within the cruiser USS Normandy today. As you can see, there are similarities, but overall it is a much more advanced technology space than it was years ago., USN So, that is what we’re using now, and a lot of deploying as I’ll say of Aegis, including some non-traditional form factors where there’s a desire to have an Aegis Weapon System on either a smaller platform or on a ground-based configuration… So, a lot of the things we’re doing now in terms of experiments like the upcoming Valiant Shield , the computer program that we’ll be delivering will be a single small box with a virtual Aegis Weapon System inside of it, and delivering all the same functionality, but without the same number of cabinets and racks… Tyler: You’re saying basically that the miniaturization of computer hardware has made it so the invasive, rip everything out and start from scratch, huge hardware refits aren’t maybe as necessary as they used to be to deploy these new Aegis capabilities on older ships? Rich: Yeah, it certainly reduces that effort. I won’t say that I’ve gone in and done the ship inventory, but we do know that in some cases, you might even be able to leave the old stuff there and bring in a smaller box if there’s space and run the virtualized Aegis Weapon System in there. The challenge becomes some of the legacy interfaces and we’re working solutions with the government to handle some of the legacy systems that may not be compatible with the newer networking technologies or the upgraded computing plants and virtualized configurations. Sailors track contacts in the CIC aboard the Aegis cruiser USS Shiloh ., USN Tyler: As far as future capabilities go, what is the future for the system when it comes to things like hypersonic missile defense and also being tied into and acting as the command and control node for unmanned vessels that will have their own weapon systems on board and will need some sort of control? Can you speak to those two leading-edge capabilities that we’re seeing actually coming down the line rapidly, and how that’s intertwined with Aegis? Rich: We’re already starting work on the LUSV, the Large Unmanned Surface Vehicle . So, we’re already defining what the combat system will look like between the controlling unit, which they call the UOC—Unmanned Operations Center—which will likely be on an Aegis or maybe a frigate platform. And the vehicle itself, the Large Unmanned Surface Vehicle, and looking to leverage the Common Source Library again. So, that the control of weapons will be on the remote unmanned vehicle under the control of an Aegis weapon system type of computer program or paradigm and controlled by the controlling unit, which would be another Aegis CSL instance. Sea Hunter has proven itself as a technology demonstrator and has jumped started a whole “Ghost Fleet’ initiative within the Navy, in cooperation with the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office, which focuses on fielding various unmanned ships that will work with existing ships in the fleet. As such, they will need remote command and control, not just of the ships themselves, but also the weapons they carry. Aegis will likely provide the groundwork for that capability. , USN It starts to become a family of Common Source Library instances communicating with each other… Really, you can think of it like as an extension of the magazine size of the ships. So, that’s already in progress now. And very early in the design of that, they just awarded the LUSV ship side of things, but on the combat systems side, the plan is to use a, I’ll call it a networked family of Common Source Library computer programs. As far as the threats are concerned, that’s a continuous upgrade. We have something that we call Aegis Speed To Capability or ASTOC. And ASTOCs look at the threats that are out there, look at any perceived gaps, anticipate some perceived gaps and then address them with short sprints of bringing capability faster to the fleet. One of those ASTOCs did look at hypersonic as far as tracking, and then there’s ongoing work, looking at engagement, engageability of hypersonics. So, it’s definitely a focus going forward and I probably can’t say much more about that at this point… Suffice it to say, Aegis has a continuing cycle of threat assessments working with the government. The government really defines what the threats are, the government defines what their priorities are. We use that information to inform our internal research and development and then we collaborate with the government to recommend changes architecturally, design-wise to the Aegis Weapon System to support, providing performance against those evolving threats. It’s a constant state of getting the intel and assessing what it’s telling us about the threats and ensuring that the Aegis Weapon System is keeping pace with those threats. A Ghost Fleet Overlord test vessel takes part in a capstone demonstration during the conclusion of Phase I of the program in September. Two existing commercial fast supply vessels were converted into unmanned surface vessels (USVs) for Overlord testing, which will play a vital role in informing the Navy’s new classes of USVs. , USN Tyler: On Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and the ability to network fires across different platforms—the Aegis system is, I believe, central to that. What is that looking like and what do you see that turning into for Aegis in the future? Rich: I think there’s going to be continued evolution. I think CEC was purpose-built and has some limitations. I think what we’re looking to do is really break the bounds of communication, so that the communication is not dependent on just CEC networking, but really any available communication sources that allow us to be a node in the network. Ultimately what our objective is, is that all of the CSL platforms, and we’re talking primarily about Aegis, but when I say Aegis, I’m really also talking about LCSs and frigates. And also going forward you may know that we recently won the Ship Self-Defense System, the SSDS contract. So, we’re also providing the combat system for the carriers and amphibs. And so what we’re looking to do is identify any areas of commonality across all of those and to make recommendations back in terms of what changes will be required to CEC, but also what other communication paths are available to us. Networking most everything in the battlespace to leverage distributed weapons and sensor capabilities is the primary goal of the Navy and the DoD as a whole going forward. Aegis is a critical component of that. , USN So, if you look at, for example, capabilities like NIFC-CA [Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter-Air]. NIFA-CA uses other communication paths in order to share data that can be used in the engagement of targets… Tyler: Is that something where if I’m on the destroyer or the cruiser, and there’s an F-35 150 miles away and I want to shoot a target maybe I can’t see at that time, I do so leveraging the F-35’s sensors via the network, is that something that the decision is made within the weapon system or how is the architecture set up for that? Rich: So the integration of F-35 is something that we did. We’ve done it in experiments , it’s not yet a program of record. But essentially the way the architecture is set up is that we created a component, which is able to receive the data that would come from the F-35 and provide it in a form that the weapon control system is able to use for engagement. It’s really more about using the F-35 as a, I’ll say, extended pair of eyes for them to be able to provide data from what they see, and they have terrific data fusion capabilities onboard their ships, some great sensors, and some great ability to fuse things. So, if we can take advantage of that data, and again, back to the fire-forget missile capabilities, you can start to extend the battlespace by making F-35 a part of the network that is shared with Aegis components or Aegis nodes. Tyler: We hear a lot that ‘Aegis light,’ known officially as COMBATTS-21 , and that it’s going into the new frigate, FFG-X, and a version of it is on LCS, as well and other ships. Can you explain really what the difference is between the two—Aegis and COMBATTS-21? Rich: It’s really just the decision on what functionality was required for LCS versus the Aegis platform. So again, COMBATSS-21 is just another instance of the Common Source Library. And to be honest, on the frigate, although some people think of it as a growth of the LCS program [the combat system], they’re actually calling it now the Frigate Aegis Weapon System, as an indication that the intention is that the frigate will be closer in capability to an Aegis ship than it will be to an LCS ship. An artist’s conception of a Constellation class guided missile frigate, formally known as the FFG(X)., USN The real primary differences are that the weapons… There was a more simplistic weapons complement on LCS that did not require the full weapon control system that we have on Aegis… You can think of COMBATSS-21, if you’re familiar with the terminology of Aegis, the C&D, which is the command and decision element, ADS which is Aegis Display System, and ACI, which is the Aegis Computing Infrastructure. It’s primarily those three elements or all that is part of an LCS configuration, and that gives them the ability to process the TRS-3D or 4D radar that’s on an LCS, and to control the gun and the RAM missile , that’s the weapons that are on an LCS. For what’s common for those elements, they’re effectively the same as what’s on an Aegis system. When you go to Aegis now, you’re adding in a SPY computer program and you’re adding in a weapon control system because it’s a more robust weapon complement and a more robust sensor suite. So, you add in those capabilities, but if you were to draw it out in like a Venn diagram, you’d see, again, a big common core, of Aegis, inside of an LCS with a label over it saying COMBATSS-21. And then the additional functionality that’s not needed by LCS makes up the difference between a COMBATSS-21 ship and what we would otherwise call an Aegis ship. Legend class National Security Cutters and Flight II Arleigh Burke class destroyers both share in the Aegis lineage, with each ship’s combat system being part of the CSL., USN Tyler: Do you see the Aegis system moving onto the future Large Surface Combatant initiative that they’re talking about? Would this be yet another iteration of the CSL? Obviously, you’d have a lot more real estate to play with on something like that. Tyler: Yeah, and again, the real estate is not a big deal for us in terms of the software, so our footprint is actually going down. The Navy’s plan is that the CSL will evolve to be the combat system for the future combat system, they call it the Integrated Combat System, which will go on the future combat ship… the Large Surface Combatant. And so back almost full circle, the continuing evolution, we’re doing things now to the architecture to bring it into a more componentized state and trying to do things which will increase the speed at which we can deliver capability to the hands of the sailor. So, we’re transitioning all of our elements into what they call continuous integration, continuous delivery, paradigm, which will allow us to introduce new capabilities faster in smaller increments and get it out to the fleet. So, instead of having the current large baselines which take multiple years from conception through verification, where we’re moving for the Large Surface Combatant and for the Integrated Combat System is more rapid introduction of incremental capability. And now you can think back to what I said about ASTOCs [Aegis Speed To Capability]. The Navy is desperately trying to expand its fleet size. While unmanned hulls will be a facet of this initiative, procuring more CSL-equipped traditional surface combatants is an extremely pressing issue. , USN Everything that we’re doing is pointed towards how we’re going to achieve the goals of the Integrated Combat System and the goals of a Large Surface Combatant and all the other LUSVs and the USVs, and all those other vehicles and platforms. It’s all centered around delivering capability faster to the hands of a sailor, meaning design time, compile times, delivery times all through like a DevSecOps pipeline . So, that’s going to be a continuous evolution because there are some elements of the Aegis Weapon System that we’re still working to get into the pipeline and we’re partnering with the Navy to do that. Tyler: Is one of those DDG-1000? Isn’t that on a separate system? It seems like that would be the only one left that isn’t… Rich: The DDG-1000 is the oddball out . We have ideas on how, again, leveraging the virtual Aegis Weapon System you could bring Aegis capability to a DDG-1000. Especially now that they’re looking at a back-fit of a SPY radar back to a DDG-1000 replacing the current radar. There would be a pretty straightforward approach that we’ve developed some concepts for and that would be ready to introduce should the Navy have interest in doing that. But yeah, currently that’s the sort of the odd duck out . That’s not a CSL, SSDS is not a CSL either. But because we’re working SSDS and frigate and Aegis, we’re able to look across all the programs and identify opportunities for sharing across the programs in both directions. USS Michael Monsoor. One of just three Zumwalt class destroyers. , DDG-1001 Facebook Page If there’s something that has been developed for the carrier that would be a benefit to an Aegis ship, great. If something on a frigate that would help SSDS, great. And so that’s why those programs are in my portfolio, so that we could take advantage of the synergy across all those surface Navy programs. And I look at DDG-1000 as an opportunity for further commonality because it is currently the one-off of the combat systems in terms of being able to take advantage of synergies across the programs. Again, I want to be clear, SSDS is not in the Common Source library, but it is in the family of combat systems that we’re working on. So, there’s the opportunity to share subject matter expertise as well as requirements, design, and hopefully even computer software. Tyler: Is there anything else you would like to add? Any other thoughts about Aegis and maybe people’s perception of the system? I’d just like to say is that this is not your father’s Aegis anymore. Aegis is now the center of a family of ships that share the Common Source Library pedigree, and we’re going to continue to evolve. We’ve evolved to get to this point. We’re going to continue to evolve the system to meet the new threats, but also to change and transform the way we deliver the capabilities so that we can get more capability faster to the hands of the sailors through the DevSecOps pipeline that we’re implementing now. We’re demonstrating that on Baseline-10 and on Baseline-9, both of those programs are demonstrating breaking up what traditionally was a large baseline into smaller incremental developments of capability that we can get out there faster.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged online of a UH-60 Black Hawk belonging to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s elite Hostage Rescue Team , or HRT, wearing a previously unseen gloss black paint job. HRT has at least six Black Hawks, which it acquired through U.S. Army contracts, examples of which had previously been seen wearing that service’s standard overall green scheme. The FBI’s Field Office in Little Rock, Arkansas, posted the pictures of the black-painted Black Hawk on Twitter on March 4, 2021, as part of a string of Tweets promoting working for the Bureau. It’s not clear where or when the picture was taken or if the armed agents in full tactical gear that are also in the photograph are all members of HRT. One of the pictures that the FBI’s Field Office in Little Rock, Arkansas Tweeted out on March 4, 2021., FBI HRT is a top-tier domestic direct-action counter-terrorism unit, but the FBI also has lower-tier Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams within its field offices and at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. HRT and the FBI’s SWAT Operations Unit (SOU), which oversees all of the Bureau’s SWAT activities, are part of the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). CIRG also includes various other units, including elements tasked with explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and even disarming or otherwise “rendering safe” nuclear weapons and dirty bombs . One of the individuals seen in the picture that the Little Rock Field Office posted online has an “EOD” patch on their rucksack. Another lower resolution picture showing personnel in full tactical gear rappelling from the gloss black UH-60., FBI CIRG also has intelligence and crisis negotiation components, among various others. The group, as a whole, is on call to help respond to various potential major contingencies. When it comes to the aviators who fly the FBI’s Black Hawks, “the pilots are required to adhere to strict rotation to be able to provide 24 hours, 7 days/week, and 365 day-per-year response capability,” according to a press release from Oak Grove Technologies, which won a contract last year to provide pilots for the Bureau’s UH-60 fleet. “Under the CIRG program, pilots are required to be available to depart within a very short period of time once notified. Along with preventing WMD [weapons of mass destruction] activity, they’re often flying into harm’s way to perform inserts and/or extractions in potentially contaminated areas, formation flights, and support MEDEVAC [medical evacuation] emergencies.” It’s not clear how many of the FBI’s UH-60s, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , may now be wearing this new black paint scheme. As already noted, the Bureau bought at least six UH-60M variants via Army contracts, starting in 2009. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had also obtained a number of older model UH-60s via the Army’s Black Hawk Exchange and Sales Team (BEST) program. It’s unclear if all of those went to the Bureau or if other federal law enforcement agencies under DOJ are now operating some examples, as well. At least one of the FBI’s Black Hawks had been seen as recently as 2019 still wearing a green paint job and other Army-style markings. Similar examples had been seen in use during realistic urban training exercises in Chicago, Illinois , and Miami, Florida , the previous year. An FBI UH-60 Black Hawk wearing an overall green paint scheme, along with US Army-style markings, seen during an exercise in 2019., FBI The glossy paint job does definitely give this particular helicopter a distinct non-military look and could be the result of a desire to avoid any confusion with Army Black Hawks. With this in mind, it’s worth noting that this black paint scheme is reminiscent to a degree of the ones worn by Black Hawks belonging to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). However, CBP UH-60s also have a high-visibility gold stripe that runs along both sides of the fuselage and up the tail. A CBP UH-60 Black Hawk comes in to land to pick up members of the Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue Unit (BORSTAR) and a mock injured individual., CBP Of course, while it might now look less like a military helicopter, it’s hard not to at least bring up how this UH-60 might look in the context of long-standing and entirely unsubstantiated conspiracy theories involving shadowy U.S. government entities conducting ultra-secret domestic activities using “ black helicopters .” Realistic urban training exercises , which provide valuable opportunities to practice in representative real-world environments for top-tier U.S. military special operations and law enforcement tactical units , but are often conducted at night with little public notice, already routinely prompt conspiratorial speculation . If gloss black UH-60s do now appear overhead somewhere in the future, we now know that one definite possibility is that these are Black Hawks belonging to one of the U.S. government’s most elite counter-terrorism units.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 2, 2020",Watch Russia’s Su-57 Felon Advanced Combat Jet Let Its 30mm Cannon Rip,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dramatic footage has emerged of Russia’s Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter unleashing its onboard cannon during ground firing trials. While the aircraft has previously been tested with a range of short-range and longer-range air-to-air missiles , and claims of trials involving more exotic weaponry also exist, it’s notable that the traditional gun remains an important part of its armory. The date and location of the firing trials shown in the footage are not clear, but the eight-second video appeared today on the Russian Telegram social media network, before being posted to YouTube . The Su-57 fires its onboard GSh-30-1 cannon. , YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The unpainted Su-57 used in the tests, which could be a dedicated static test example, is seen firing its improved 30mm GSh-30-1 cannon , also known as the 9-A-4071K. This single-barrel weapon is buried in the right forward fuselage side of the jet, ahead of the wing root, and is provided with 150 rounds of ammunition. Exactly what improvements have been made to the Su-57’s gun compared to the original GSh-30-1 is not clear, but, in its basic form, the weapon weighs 110 pounds and has a rate of fire of 1,500 rounds per minute. Russia, in contrast to the United States, has continued to arm most of its fighters with hard-hitting, heavier-caliber autocannons like this, in contrast to the faster-firing, multi-barrelled 20mm M61 Vulcan rotary cannon used on most, but not all , U.S. fighters since the 1960s. The M61 also features a far higher rate of fire and is usually paired with a substantially larger magazine than what’s found on the Su-57 and other Russian fighters. When not in use, the muzzle of the Su-57’s gun is concealed by an aerodynamic fairing, which would also help reduce the aircraft’s critical frontal hemisphere radar signature. For firing, the forward part of the fairing rotates to expose the muzzle and another hatch opens behind it, perhaps for releasing gun gases. A much larger aperture further behind, which could also provide access to the gun, is normally concealed in flight but was apparently removed for gun tests. A detailed view of the GSh-30-1 ready for firing, with ports open and with the rear panel removed., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Surprisingly, the GSh-30-1 is fired at a simple backstop. If this was a test to gauge the accuracy of the gun in any way, it would only really be good for monitoring the general grouping of impacts, which appears to have been measured using a simple cardboard target pasted to the wall. Test firing on the ground is an important part of proving the weapon’s reliability and accuracy, as well as determining if there are any adverse effects on the aircraft itself. Vibrations and impacts from the gasses and debris as a result of firing the gun can be major concerns for any airframe, let alone one that has low-observable features, some of which are delicate by their very nature. These tests will first occur before firing the gun in flight, but since we don’t know when the video was taken, the weapon may have already completed its evaluation. Indeed, imagery from 2018 indicates that at least one of the Su-57 prototypes has been used previously for firing trials, reportedly in flight. Of course, the GSh-30-1 — which is the same weapon used in the MiG-29 Fulcrum and the Su-27 Flanker families of fighters — is just one element of the Su-57’s weapons options. With a view toward low observability, the Felon’s air combat primary weapons carriage is internal, within two large internal bays in tandem between the engines, plus two smaller ‘quick launch’ bays within underwing fairings. While the larger bays are intended to carry beyond-visual-range R-77M and very-long-range R-37M air-to-air missiles, the smaller bays are restricted to single examples of the short-range R-74M2 air-to-air missile . A clip showing a Su-57 firing a short-range missile from one of its two small wing-root weapons bays . , RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE CAPTURE For aerial engagements, the internal gun remains a useful addition to these missiles, especially in an aircraft optimized for super-maneuvrability , as the Su-57 is. The aircraft’s aerodynamic layout ensures a high static instability, making the aircraft inherently more maneuverable, especially at supersonic speeds. In addition, three-dimensional thrust-vectoring nozzles add another extreme layer of agility, especially at slow speeds and when maneuvering at supersonic speeds and high altitudes. Beyond the kinds of close-quarters combat in which the Su-57 will likely excel, an internal gun is also valuable for certain air-policing scenarios, in which a warning shot might need to be fired, as well as for air-to-ground firing, or strafing . Guns also can’t be jammed or decoyed by an opponent. Finally, even if it only provides enough ammunition for a few seconds of firing, a gun is a lot cheaper to use than a missile. The Su-57 program has had its fair share of setbacks, including a dramatic fire suffered on the runway by the fifth prototype in 2014, the withdrawal of India from the project, and the loss of the first production aircraft in a flying accident in 2019 . Amid these difficulties, launch trials of internal weapons reportedly only began in 2016, six years after the first flight of a prototype. Now, however, with 76 aircraft on order for the Russian Aerospace Forces, and the first delivery of a production aircraft to a test unit last December, the Su-57 finally seems to be making progress. At the same time, measures seem to have been taken to improve the precision build quality of the fighters, including the use of augmented reality in the manufacturing process . Proving the reliability, compatibility, and accuracy of the gun, whenever that might have occurred, will have been another important milestone on the aircraft’s path to service with a frontline unit, currently expected sometime next year.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 15, 2020",Golden Horde Swarming Munitions Program Back On Target After Second Round Of Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s new swarming air-launched munitions program, Golden Horde , has been put to the test for a second time. The latest mission that we know about took place on February 19 and involved a two-seat F-16D Viper fighter jet from the 40th Flight Test Squadron, based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, dropping four of the specially configured Collaborative Small Diameter Bombs (CSDB). Although details remain limited, the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) today released four photos of the test, in which the jet is seen circling the target after “successfully dropping four CSDBs for the second Golden Horde test mission near Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico,” according to the captions. The CDSBs are Small Diameter Bombs modified to incorporate networked swarming technology. The F-16D circles as the four collaborative munitions hit their targets, leaving telltale puffs of smoke on the right., 40th Flight Test Squadron / Public Domain While the aerial imagery from the February 19 test clearly shows four puffs of smoke and dirt where the CSDBs impacted in close proximity, we don’t know for sure how successful the entire test was, or what kinds of parameters were involved. Still, the official photo release implied that they hit their mark. This Golden Horde test mission follows the first test, which took place on December 15 of last year but was only announced in early January, and which you can read all about here . On that occasion, the two CSDBs launched subsequently failed to impact the simulated high-priority targets due to an “improper weapon software load,” which meant “the collaboration guidance commands were not sent to the weapon navigation system.” In that first test, the weapons had been provided with pre-defined Rules of Engagement (RoEs) and determined that a GPS jammer was not the highest priority target. At this point, the weapons then collaborated to identify the two highest priority targets, although they ended up impacting a fail-safe target location as a result of the software failure. Another two CSDB flight tests were planned for early this year, using four rather than two collaborative weapons in each mission. 40th Flight Test Squadron / Public Domain It certainly seems as though the Air Force is steadily making progress with its ambitions to realize networked glide bombs that are able to work together collaboratively to prioritize and destroy targets independently of the launch aircraft. The Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Golden Horde program aims to develop artificial intelligence-driven systems that could allow the networking together of various types of precision munitions into an autonomous swarm . While the adapted Small Diameter Bomb has been utilized for these first tests, the Air Force doesn’t seem to have any plans to field the CSDB as an operational weapon. Instead, the technology that Golden Horde is pioneering could find its way into the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), or the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy , for example. A four-round Collaborative Small Diameter Bomb launcher., AFRL / PUBLIC DOMAIN In these previous articles , The War Zone has looked at how these “networked, collaborative, and autonomous” weapon capabilities, once perfected, could revolutionize the way aircraft attack their targets. But there are significant challenges involved, not least ensuring the weapons can sense and react to changes in the battlespace in real-time as well as “talk” to each other to optimize their attack profiles. 40th Flight Test Squadron / Public Domain A missile strike by a weapon such as the AGM-158 already presents a hostile air defense network with significant problems, but these would be compounded significantly if the same weapons were able to operate as a networked swarm, responding to changes in target priority, including those threats that appear once the missiles are in flight. Indeed, a swarm of missiles could be launched even before any particular targets had been identified, loitering and then attacking targets as they present themselves. In the same way, decoys, including electronic warfare jammers , could be added to the mix to bring further disruption to the enemy and better protect the launch aircraft. The latest Golden Horde test shows that the era of the air-launched swarming munition is growing closer to reality, although there will likely be more hurdles to come as the Air Force works to optimize this potentially ground-breaking addition to its arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",Everything New We Just Learned About The 2020 Iranian Missile Attack On U.S. Forces In Iraq,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has released never-before-seen aerial surveillance footage of Al Asad Air Base in Iraq during the unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes on that facility last year. The annotated video, shot by a drone orbiting overhead at the time, shows six Qiam-1 short-range ballistic missiles hitting the base. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which is the top command overseeing American military activity in the Middle East, declassified the video and provided it first to CBS News ‘ “60 Minutes” for a segment that aired this past weekend. The missile strikes themselves occurred on Jan. 8, 2020. Afterward, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said that 11 Qiam-1s had hit Al Asad, in total. Officials in Iraq’s northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region also said that at least two short-range ballistic missiles had been fired at Erbil International Airport, which also hosts U.S. forces , one of which failed to reach its target. U.S. Army Major Alan Johnson, who was at the base during the incident, told “60 Minutes” that intelligence had indicated Iran was preparing to fire as many as 27 missiles at Al Asad. The CBS News’ program also reported that a total of 16 missiles were ultimately launched at the base, with five failing to function as intended. Approximately 110 U.S. service members were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, but thankfully there were no fatalities. A US service member walks through a damaged portion of Al Asad Air Base in Iraq in the aftermath of Iran’s ballistic missile strikes on Jan. 8, 2020., Qassim Abdul-Zahra/AP The footage, which you can watch in full below, starts by identifying five ramps at Al Asad – named Bravo, Charlie, Foxtrot, Valley, and Voodoo – and how many aircraft were positioned at the time of the attack. The on-screen notes also there are usually 10 aircraft on the flightline and that 51 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters had evacuated the base ahead of the strikes. It was disclosed last year that U.S. early-warning satellites, later identified as the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) constellation, provided critical advance notice, giving time for personnel to evacuate and for others to seek shelter. A screengrab from the video showing the locations of various ramps at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, as well as other information., CENTCOM “60 Minutes” has now revealed that the U.S. government also had additional indications well before the missiles began raining down that strikes were coming from monitoring Iranian purchases of commercial satellite imagery of Al Asad. U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of CENTCOM, said he waited until intelligence told him the Iranians had downloaded their last commercial image of the base for the day before beginning evacuations and the movement of equipment. In doing so, they severely disrupted the effectiveness of the Iranian attack and likely saved many lives and lots of equipment in the process. The video then moves on to show two missiles hitting “expeditionary air maintenance facilities,” a formal term for “tension-membrane” clamshell-type hangars , on the Bravo ramp. A third missile slams into the Charlie ramp, damaging additional clamshell hangars, as well as offices, living spaces, dining facilities, and latrines. The first two points of impact (POI) at the Bravo ramp., CENTCOM The location of the third POI at the Charlie ramp., CENTCOM The fourth missile strikes the Voodoo ramp, hitting more clamshell hangars, as well as a fuel bladder. The last two missiles seen in the footage strike the Charlie and Valley ramps, hitting a rescue operations center, as well as maintenance facilities, a gym, and a dining hall. The fourth POI at the Voodoo ramp., CENTCOM The fifth and sixth POIs at the Valley and Charlie ramps, respectively., CENTCOM It’s not clear what type of drone filmed the video in question, but it is known that a number of U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagles were airborne at the time and that some were kept on station due to fears that a complex ground attack could follow the missile barrage. However, the strikes damaged fiber optic lines connecting ground control stations at Al Asad to satellite terminals, cutting them off from the unmanned aircraft overhead. This may also explain, in part, why only six of the 11 Qiam-1 impacts are seen in the footage. The full “60 Minutes” segment, seen below, also shows previously unseen video of troops on the ground, who had moved away from Al Asad into the relative safety of the surrounding desert when the strikes began, watching additional missiles careen into the base. Despite the early warning and the subsequent evacuations, there was still a need for at least some U.S. personnel to remain at the base. However, there were insufficient bunkers to shelter them all and many of those that were available were only designed to protect against smaller indirect threats, such as rockets, with warheads in the 60-pound-class or smaller, according to “60 Minutes.” The warheads in the Qiam-1s were in the 1,000-pound-class. “[It] knocked the wind out of me, followed by the most putrid tasting ammonia tasting dust that swept through the bunker. Coated your teeth,” Army Major Johnson, one of 28 service members who later received Purple Hearts for injuries sustained in the strikes, told “60 Minutes” about one of the missiles hitting near the bunker where he and others were initially sheltering. “The fire was just rolling over the bunkers, like 70 feet in the air.” “We’re going to burn to death. We start heading down 135 meters, make it about a third of the way there [to another bunker],” he continued. “The Big Voice, we call it, clicks in ‘INCOMING INCOMING TAKE COVER TAKE COVER TAKE COVER.’ I’ve got another football field to run. I don’t know when this next missile’s going to hit.” “Big Voice,” also called “Giant Voice,” refers to one of a number of loudspeaker public address and alert systems that are installed at U.S. military bases, as well as other U.S. government facilities, at home and abroad. You can read more about these systems in this past War Zone piece . Johnson and his companions did eventually make it to another bunker. However, they found some 40 other individuals there also trying to cram in. These shelters were designed to shield around 10 people at a time.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The Army officer described the feeling of the missiles crashing down around him “like a freight train going by you” and said that, in his opinion, “nobody should’ve lived through this.” His comments align closely with those from U.S. Air Force personnel at Al Asad during the strikes. That service released a compendium of personal stories from survivors of the strikes last year. “I was being forced to gamble with my members’ lives by something I couldn’t control,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Staci Coleman, the commander of the 443rd Air Expeditionary Squadron at Al Asad, said. “I was deciding who would live and who would die.” “The explosions finally stop, and I feel a collective sigh within the bunker,” Air Force Captain Nate Brown, in charge of the 443rd’s Engineer Flight, said afterward. “The next wave hits. Then the next, and the next. I have no idea if anyone is alive outside this bunker.” “No one quite understood the magnitude of what we might be facing,” Air Force Captain Adella Ramos, head of 443rd’s Airfield Operations Flight, also said. “But as the night carried on, there was an unspoken understanding that this might be it. We might not live through this.” US Army soldiers in the desert near Al Asad Air Base watch an Iranian ballistic missile, the white circle seen at the top, fall toward the base in January 2020., US Army via CBS News’ “60 Minutes” The U.S. Army subsequently deployed air defense assets to Iraq, including Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries, to help protect against further missile strikes. There were no such air and missile defenses at the base at the time, which became something of a scandal . More than a year later, tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as Iranian proxies throughout the Middle East, including Iraq, remain high. The “60 Minutes” segment notably aired less than a week after President Joe Biden ordered airstrikes on Iranian-backed Iraqi militias operating in neighboring Syria in response to a rocket attack on Erbil Airport earlier this year. That attack killed a contractor work for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, as well as wounded a U.S. service member and four more contractors, among other casualties. The Biden Administration has made clear that it is looking for rapprochement with Iran , including rejoining the controversial deal over Tehran’s nuclear program. At the same time, there are concerns that continued aggression from Iran, or its regional proxies, could lead to an escalatory spiral that could potentially result in something similar to the 2020 Al Asad strikes. It’s worth noting that that incident was the culmination of a series of events that had started with a fatal rocket attack in Iraq in December 2019, which subsequently prompted U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in that country and in Syria. That, in turn, led to a mob attack by Iran-backed groups on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which was then followed by the U.S. government’s decision to kill Iranian General Qassem Soleimani outside Baghdad International Airport just days later. The Iranian missile strikes on Al Asad and Erbil were in direct retaliation for the death of Soleimani, who had been the head of the Quds Force, the part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for external operations, including supporting and otherwise coordinating with proxies. Had Iran’s ballistic missiles killed any Americans, let alone a large number of them, it’s not hard to see how that could easily have sparked a larger conflict. “Had Americans been killed, it would’ve been very different,” CENTCOM boss McKenzie told “60 Minutes.” He added that it’s reasonable to believe that 20 to 30 aircraft might have been lost and 100 to 150 U.S. personnel might have died if not for the intelligence and other early-warning alerts ahead of the strikes. “We had a plan to retaliate if Americans had died,” McKeznie said bluntly. The video footage that we now have, combined with the various first-hand accounts, only underscores just how real that danger was at the time and remains now.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds have been down at Naval Air Facility El Centro —which serves as the U.S. Navy Blue Angels’ winter training grounds—to do some cross-team familiarization and training over the last week. The two flight demonstration teams have a tremendous amount in common, not just in their missions, but as to how they execute their routines. Now they have given the world a little surprise, debuting a super formation the likes of which we have never seen before called the “Super Delta.” The combined formation includes the primary six jets from each team, with the six F/A-18E/F Super Hornets that now make up the Blue Angels Delta at its center, and two formations of three Thunderbird Block 52 F-16C/D Vipers on each wing. It’s one impressive monster of a formation, as you can see in the images the teams have provided. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Cody Hendrix The two squadrons have become more closely knit than ever before after much of their 2020 show season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What followed was a tour across the country , with many high-profile stops featuring both teams flying complex routes over hospitals and other care centers to salute the men and women who fight every single day on the front line of the still ongoing nightmare of a public health calamity. Even during those intricate flyovers, they never pulled off a unique combined formation like this. For the Blue Angels, the 2021 season, whatever it turns out to look like, is a monumental one. The team has ushered in the era of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet after decades of flying the F/A-18A-D Legacy Hornet, as well as welcoming a new Fat Albert transport in the form of a far more capable C-130J that was procured second-hand from the U.K. Royal Air Force. The Blues have said goodbye to the Legacy Hornet. Here their new mount, the Super Hornet, breaks away from their old one., U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Christopher Gordon We can only expect that we will see more of this unique display which really highlights the enhanced cooperative spirit between the Pentagon’s most prolific aerial ambassadors that has grown out of the pandemic.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2021",Boeing Is Adapting Its Australian Combat Drone For The U.S. Air Force’s Skyborg Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days after the first flight of the Boeing Airpower Teaming System combat drone that’s being developed for Australia, the company confirmed this unmanned aircraft will also provide the basis for its offering for the U.S. Air Force’s Skyborg loyal wingman program . In the meantime, the Royal Australian Air Force, or RAAF, has doubled its order for the drone, now buying six examples in total, as the program continues to hit new milestones. More details of the Airpower Teaming System (ATS) drone emerged at a reporters’ round table event, following yesterday’s announcement of its maiden flight, which Boeing confirmed took place on February 27. Today also saw Australia confirm its follow-on order for another three of the ATS vehicles, at a cost of around $89 million over three years. The Airpower Teaming System drone conducts its first flight at Woomera Range Complex, South Australia., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The most significant revelation, although perhaps not necessarily surprising, is the fact that the ATS design will be leveraged for the USAF’s Skyborg program. Skyborg covers the development a whole range of systems that will form an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” capable of flying networked “loyal wingman” type drones and autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles, or UCAVs. Boeing, of course, was one of three companies — together with General Atomics and Kratos — that received contracts last December to build prototype airframes to carry systems developed under the Skyborg program. The fact that there are clear parallels between the RAAF and USAF programs had led to The War Zone predicting in the past that the ATS could emerge as a Skyborg contender. Jared Hayes, Senior Director of Autonomous Aviation and Technology at Boeing has now said that its Skyborg will share a “common core” with the RAAF’s ATS but that “what becomes unique is the missionization.” However, we don’t yet know what percentage of components will be common between the two designs. This last point references the fact that the ATS has been designed from the outset for modularity, allowing it to be rapidly reconfigured for different types of missions. Key to this is the eight-and-a-half-foot-long snap-on, snap-off nose, offering around 9,000 cubic inches of space to carry various payloads, as you can read about here . Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Exactly what future ATS and Skyborg drones will carry in terms of mission payloads remains a closely guarded secret. Potentially, however, the drones could be adapted to mount a wide variety of sensors, including radars and/or electro-optical sensors, communications gateways , electronic warfare payloads, or even defensive lasers . What kinetic weaponry it can carry, or even what type of payload configuration it can accommodate for munitions, also remains undisclosed. As yet, we know next to nothing about timelines, schedules, numbers of aircraft, or even where the ATS-derived Skyborg drones will be built. Little is actually known about the program in general, although the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, as the contract-awarding authority, has said it requires “missionized prototypes with the ability to fly in experimentation events while teaming with manned aircraft” and the initial drones are reportedly expected to be delivered no later than May this year. Intriguingly, however, Hayes also noted that the company is meanwhile taking into account “other global customer mission needs” as it continues to develop the ATS, suggesting that there may be other customers lining up beyond Australia and the United States. This is something The War Zone has stressed would be an eventuality since the program first emerged. Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Boeing confirmed that a second ATS vehicle for Australia is now also complete and has begun ground tests, with others in “various states of assembly,” according to Arnott. Some clues were also provided into how Boeing has managed to make significant strides in the ATS so rapidly. After all, it was only 14 months ago that the program was announced, while the first prototype emerged for ground tests last summer. Shane Arnott, the ATS Program Director, pointed to the company’s use of “digital twins,” highly detailed surrogate drones that exist only in the virtual realm, but which can be used in a way that parallels traditional flight test using real prototypes. In this way, Arnott explained, the program has got “a number of steps ahead,” including thousands of hours of development work already accumulated in a digital environment . When it came to the recent first flight of the real ATS prototype — which measures 38 feet long, with a wingspan of 24 feet — much of the groundwork had already been done in digital form. The first flight test profile was intended to validate basic flight functions and included a significant degree of autonomous operations. Boeing A human operator selected various commands and the drone then initiated those movements, including taxiing to the runway, takeoff, flight to the mission area, landing, and taxiing back to the ramp. For this first flight test, there was no mission payload, with the drone instead being fitted with what Arnott described as a “flight test nose” carrying instrumentation to record test data. According to the company, the ATS comes with a ferry range of 2,000 nautical miles, which compares favorably with a manned tactical fighter: the USAF quotes a ferry range of 1,740 nautical miles for its F-16C fighter jet . Already, Boeing and the RAAF are also looking at ways to operate ATS from more austere locations, include sites where they might use roads as runways, which could enable them to support distributed operations, as well. This, meanwhile, is already a key concern for the U.S. military in the Indo-Pacific theater and suggests that the RAAF might also be looking to follow suit, developing greater independence from potentially vulnerable airbases. On top of all this, the ATS is being developed according to the principles of attritability , with the manufacturer acknowledging that the customer seeks a vehicle with a cost point that means it will be “willing to lose the aircraft,” in Arnott’s words. All in all, these are exciting times for the ATS, and for the whole of Boeing’s combat drone enterprise. We have long anticipated that the ATS could bring a revolution to the way the RAAF uses its airpower. Now, with its entry to Skyborg, the same could be true for the U.S. Air Force.
