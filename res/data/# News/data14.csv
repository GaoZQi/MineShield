By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An estimated 16 million people tuned in to watch “ Dragonstone ,” the premiere episode of the seventh season of Game of Thrones . Unfortunately, this apparently wasn’t an option for at least one member of the U.S. Air Force, who, in keeping with the general tone of the show, decided to make their anger at missing the episode the last thing their enemies ever saw. “This is for making me miss Game of Thrones” they wrote on a GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), according to pictures that appeared on social media. Two other bombs in the pictures appear message-free. Armament technicians can assemble the GPS-guided GBU-31/B with a variety of 2,000-pound class warheads, including the bunker-busting BLU-109/B and the devastating thermobaric BLU-118/B . The Air Force is presently looking to buy new BLU-137/B penetrators to replace the older BLU-109s. You can read all about their various capabilities here . There is nothing in the pictures to confirm where or when the images were taken. However, the three  JDAMs are clearly mounted together under the wing of an Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber. This is a common loadout for BUFFs flying missions over Iraq and Syria out of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The lumbering bombers touched down in the region to take on ISIS terrorists in April 2016. The brutal extremists have become infamous for gruesome public executions and torture, widespread sexual slavery, draconian dress codes and other social restrictions, and more, all of which would be right at home in George R.R. Martins’ fictional land of Westeros. The group may not have liked some of the more recent episodes, which feature Daenerys Targaryen and her “air force” of nearly unstoppable dragons . Of course, writing slogans, insults, and other messages on bombs, shells, and other military hardware is an old and nearly universal tradition. Taunting one’s opponents before and during battle is probably as old as the notion war itself. Bomb and shell casings do seem to provide a particularly good canvas though, since the writing or pictograms are less likely to interfere with any existing camouflage or other important markings. In addition, when it comes to aircraft, tagging bombs and missiles can be a huge morale boost for ground crews, especially crew chiefs and ordnance technicians, who might not otherwise get to share much esprit de corps with their flying compatriots. By adding their own message to the weapons, these personnel get a direct and visible connection to the mission at hand that anyone and everyone, friend or foe, can see. It’s not the first time we’ve seen this in Iraq or Syria, either. After ISIS members carried out a series of deadly terrorist attacks throughout Paris on November 13th, 2015, pictures appeared online showing GBU-31/Bs, what appeared to be either 500-pound class GBU-38/B JDAMs or similarly sized laser-guided GBU-12/Bs, and Hellfire missiles, all with the “ From Paris, With Love ” written on them in English in various styles. At the same time, the Russian Air Force got in on the act, inscribing Za Paris – “For Paris” – and Za Nasheeh – “For Our People” – in the Cyrillic alphabet on a number of dumb bombs. Su-24 attack jets reportedly dropped these in “ revenge attacks ” against ISIS in Syria, though there is no way to confirm that they did end up hitting other rebel groups opposed to the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Assad and his Kremlin allies have labeled all groups fighting the government in Damascus as terrorists. Less than a month after the Paris attacks, someone at a Russian military exercise thought it would be funny to write World War II-era slogans Za Berlin – “For Berlin” – and Za Stalina – “For Stalin” – on their bombs, sparking a brief spat with Germany . https://youtube.com/watch?v=gtwNxl2a1tw Earlier in 2017, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense released video footage showing members of the country’s air force writing their own messages in Arabic on Hellfire missiles on board their AC-208 Combat Caravan light attack aircraft. One read “Announcement of Ministry of Defense: Mosul Belongs to Us,” while another had the name of the Iraqi operation to liberate Mosul, “Qademoon Ya Neinava,” as well as “The Euphrates River is Ours.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=P1KhxFnHYgQ And this sort of messaging hasn’t been limited to the Middle East. In May 2017, Islamist militants from the Maute group, who pledged fealty to Islamic State, claimed control of the city of Marawi in the southern Philippines. When government security forces moved in to retake the town, they were met with stiff resistance from fighters armed with machine guns and RPGs. In response, many troops added wooden planks to the sides of their wheeled armored vehicles in an apparent attempt to provide some stand-off protection against the shaped charge anti-tank rockets. These quickly turned into signboards, boasting a variety of Tagalog- and English-language slogans ranging from “To Protect and To Secure The Motherland” to “ISIS Hunter ” to “ Free Wi-Fi .” Another vehicle sported a front panel that said “ Mad Max ,” a clear reference to post-apocalyptic movie franchise which is heavy on car-based combat. The side of one LAV-300 armored vehicle implored troops to “Make Your Mamas Proud,” along with “DU30,” a slogan that the country’s firebrand President Rodrigo Duterte used during his election campaign. There have no doubt been many more over the years. Feel free to share your own favorites in the comments below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The USAF Admits It Isn’t Actually Working on an A-10 Replacement,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has long weathered criticism that it looking to retire the venerable A-10 Warthog without an adequate replacement . Now, despite statements to the contrary, the service appears to have confirmed that it not at work on a dedicated successor, or is deliberately slow-rolling the process. On July 16, 2017, in chat with Aviation Week , Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein offered updates on the status and future of the A-10 fleet, as well as progress toward a new, CAS-focused aircraft, commonly referred to as A-X. In the interview, the service’s top official ran through the usual talking points, explaining that other, multi-role platforms can perform the critical close air support (CAS) job, as well as blaming budget cuts and caps for difficulties in obtaining a direct replacement for the Warthog. As such, Goldfein said that the Air Force was “not yet” actively working on developing A-X, according to Aviation Week. When asked if this meant the service might ultimately retire the A-10 without a purpose-built replacement, he said “maybe.” Though not surprising, these remarks directly conflict with comments that General Mike Holmes, then Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Requirements, made at an Air Force Association breakfast on April 7, 2016. At that gathering, the officer, who is now head of Air Combat Command, stated unequivocally that the Air Force was in the middle of an active process to lay the groundwork for an all-new CAS-focused aircraft. USAF “My requirements guys are in the process of building a draft-requirements document for a follow-on CAS airplane,” Holmes explained. “I have seen a draft of it, it’s out for coordination. It’ll go to the chief [of staff] sometime this spring, and then we’ll fold that into the larger study we’re doing on the future of the combat air forces.” As a side note, shortly after seeing those comments, I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for various records regarding this requirements drafting process. As of March 2017, the Air Force was still processing that request. In July 2017, then Air Force Chief of Staff Mark Welsh described his ultimate desire for what he called a “ flying coke machine ” to replace the A-10. Though his concept was vague and seemed to imply something akin to existing proposals for a “ flying arsenal ship ,” possibly using unmanned stealthy drones, as well as an entirely revamped set of systems and procedures for conducting CAS missions, the suggestion seemed clear that the service was actively looking into what might come after the Warthog. Now, since Aviation Week paraphrased many key comments, there is possibility that Goldfein meant that there was not yet an active process in translating those draft requirements into an actual A-X program. It is also possible that Holmes’ office created generalized requirements and detailed various options to replace the A-10, and that the service decided to pursue alternatives to an A-X in the near-term. One of these recommendations could have been the service’s light attack experiment, also known as OA-X . USAF However, this all seems highly unlikely, especially since Aviation Week phrased their question broadly about whether “the service is taking steps to develop” an A-X aircraft at all. Slated to begin in July 2017, the existing OA-X demonstration project, which only involves aircraft significantly smaller and less capable than the A-10, could at best produce a partial solution. The Air Force says it would only ever expect to fly such a plane in an almost entirely permissive environments without significant enemy air defenses. As such, there is even talk about sending planes that perform well in those tests for a limited field trial in Iraq or Afghanistan. On top of that, the Air Force has continually stressed that the OA-X evaluations do not include a commitment to buy any aircraft, despite Congress’ plan to insert money into the service’s budget to do just that. There’s similarly no indication that even if it does buy a light attack aircraft that it will treat these planes as fulfilling any existing A-X requirements . And despite repeatedly discussion its possible features, the service has also said time and time again that it has no money for an A-X of any description. “We don’t think this would take that long to do,” Welsh said of his “ coke machine ” idea back in June 2016. “We don’t think it’s that complicated of a design problem, (but) we don’t have the money to do it. “So far I have read about this in the news. I have not actually seen a proposal on any of this that has come forward to me,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said the next month , already implying the notional A-X was so much vaporware. “So it sure is pre-decisional. It hasn’t been decided on. … Where would we get the money? Not at all clear to me.” What does seem clear is that whatever was in General Holmes’ requirements review, Air Force leadership has quietly decided not to pursue any portion that could be reasonably described as a dedicated Warthog replacement, at least for the time being. This would fit with the fact that we haven’t heard much about  Air Combat Command’s much-touted CAS Integration Group in months, though it is supposedly working on developing a “new” concept of operations centered on the F-16 Viper fighter jet and crews trained specifically for the CAS role. This revelation seems almost certain to generate criticism from the A-10’s most ardent supporters in Congress, who have repeatedly blocked the service’s attempts to send the decidedly unsexy “ blue collar ” plane and its uniquely powerful 30mm cannon to the bone yard. In 2015, members of the House of Representatives added a detailed provision to a draft National Defense Authorization Act for the 2016 fiscal year that would have required the Air Force run a comprehensive test of a new close air support plane before retiring any A-10s. You can read the exact requirements here . USAF While President Barack Obama ultimately vetoed that spending bill, he did sign a Senate version into law that contained the same clause. Notably, it required the Air Force to submit a report on its findings to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees no later than Sept. 30, 2016. If such a study exists, its findings do not appear to have made it into the public domain. It’s possible that the Air Force is hoping to wait until the results of a fly-off between the A-10 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, before making any final decisions regarding an A-X. Long in the works, this comparative test could begin in 2018 , according Air Force Brigadier General Scott Pleus, who runs the service’s F-35 integration office. USAF One of the longest standing arguments against the Warthog is that it simply cannot operate in high threat environments that demand a new, stealthy jet like the Joint Strike Fighter. General Goldfein seemed to allude to this in his recent interview with Aviation Week, while also highlighting the various platforms in addition to the A-10 that performed CAS in Afghanistan during his time as head U.S. Air Forces Central between August 2011 and July 2013. “If we can start having a conversation about that family of systems, and not which one weapon system is the most important, we’re going to actually have a 21st-century close-air-support discussion,” the Air Force’s top office said. “Before we have any conversation about replacements … we want to make sure that anything we talk about is moving us forward into new ways of doing business.” But the A-10’s Congressional backers, especially Martha McSally , a Republican Representative from Arizona and former A-10 pilot herself, have made it clear they have no intention of supporting Air Force efforts to retire the Warthogs without a functional plan for their replacement. On the Senate side, Senator John McCain, another Arizona Republican, has also been an outspoken critic of the service’s plans, outright accusing General Welsh of being “ disingenuous ” on the issue in 2016. These same legislators have already criticized the Air Force over its latest plan to begin cutting three of the nine Warthog squadrons in the near future. Lawmakers were quick to insert addition money into draft budgets for more new wings that the A-10 fleet desperately needs to keep up its availability rates and that would allow the jets to continue flying safely at least until 2040. Those issues already seemed to guarantee a new fight with Congress over the future of the aircraft. With the Air Force now admitting it is not actively working on a true A-X replacement, the A-10 saga looks set to be as fraught as ever.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Chinese Spy Ship Was Snooping Off Alaska For the First Time During THAAD Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) significant and continued expansion, both in terms of advanced ships and vital infrastructure , is one of the best indicators of China’s push to become an international military power.  But, as most eyes were focused on the departure of Chinese forces for their new base in Africa , the country made another important naval move, discreetly sailing one of its most advanced spy ships near the United States for the first time ever, just in time for an important American missile test . Some time on July 11, 2017, one of the PLAN’s six Type 815 North Star electronic intelligence-gathering vessels, China most advanced spy ships, arrived in international waters near the coast of Alaska, according to report by Epoch Times. That same day, the U.S. military’s Missile Defense Agency and numerous partners conducted the first ever test of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system against a mock intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) from the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska in Kodiak. Michael Kucharek, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told The Epoch Times that this was the first time a Type 815 had entered either command’s “area of responsibility,” which includes the coastlines of both the contiguous United States and Alaska. It was also the first time since 2015, when a PLAN task force moved through the Bering Sea as then-U.S. President Barack Obama toured Alaska, that any PLAN ships have transited near an American shoreline. It was unclear what the Chinese ship was actually doing at the time and the spy ship remained in international waters, according to Kucharek. However, it seems very likely that the spy ship was there specifically to watch the THAAD test. Though its unclear whether or not the North Star-class ships have the radars necessary to track missile flights, the vessel off Alaska surely vacuumed up a lot of information from electronic emissions, including signals from data links and other communication equipment connecting the various components of the THAAD battery, and from that battery to America’s greater missile defense “ecosystem” as well. The X-band AN/TPY-2 radar , and its emissions radiated during an engagement was also likely of great interest to the Chinese. This could provide Chinese analysts with a more nuanced picture of how the particular system, as well as the broader U.S. military missile defense apparatus, works as a whole, exposing weaknesses well beyond any deficiencies with the interceptors themselves. In particular, the signals could expose vulnerabilities to jamming and other electronic warfare not just in THAAD, but elsewhere in the U.S. missile defense shield’s broader networks. There could be evidence of cyber security gaps that Chinese specialists could exploit, as well. The Tianlangxing , a Type 815G. , Japanese Ministry of Defense Of course, the North Star class, originally known as the Dong-Diao or “East Investigate” class, is hardly new. The PLAN commissioned the first ship, now called the Beijixing or “Polaris,” in 1999. It originally featured large parabolic antennas similar to Cold War-era spy ships such as the U.S. Navy’s USNS Vandenberg and the Soviet Navy’s Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin , but at some point these gave way to radome-enclosed radars common to more modern designs. While the Beijixing remained the only member of its class for more than a decade, since 2010, the PLAN has added another five of the intelligence ships to its inventory. The first four were an improved Type 815G subvariant. The Kaiyangxing , which just entered service in January 2017, is yet another version known as the Type 815A. We don’t know what particular ship was near Alaska earlier in July 2017. Though historically tight-lipped about the Type 815s in general, the PLAN disclosed significant details about the class after commissioning Kaiyangxing . The Type 815A had a displacement of 6,000 tons and could reach a top speed of almost 23 miles per hour, Modern Navy , an official PLAN media outlet, announced, according to China Daily , an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. “The Kaiyangxing is capable of conducting all-weather, round-the-clock reconnaissance on multiple and different targets,” China Daily reported. “Until now, the PLA Navy has never made public so many details about its intelligence collection ships.” A PLAN press handout showing some of the Kaiyangxing’s radomes. , PLAN Though there is still a lot that remains unknown about the Kaiyangxing , or how it specifically differs from its sister ships, its basic size and shape is similar to the U.S. Navy’s now decommissioned USNS Observation Island , though it is much smaller than her replacement the USNS Howard O. Lorenzen . However, Lorenzen , obtusely classified as “ missile range instrumentation ship ,” is solely focused on spying on foreign ballistic tests and gathering information on US tests with its powerful electronically-scanned array-type radar rather than acting as a multi-role electronic intelligence collector. China has similar ships, known as the Yuan Wang class . USNS Howard O. Lorenzen , USN As such, the Type 815-class as a whole seems to share more with Russia’s still active Balzam -class or Nowary’s wedge-shaped Marjata . In 2016, the Norwegians replaced that vessel with a new spy ship, also named Marjata , which had a more traditional design. If the Type 815s have at all similar capabilities, the appearance of one off Alaska earlier in July 2017 is an important development, but not necessarily surprising. As already noted, the ships may be able to grab a wide variety of important electronic information associated with the test, which came four months after the U.S. Army began sending the ballistic missile defense system to South Korea . Though that deployment was long in the works, China had and continues to criticize those plans, arguing that the long-range AN/TPY-2 in particular threatens its nuclear deterrent capabilities by being able to provide persistent surveillance of Chinese skies. The massive Yuan Wang class. , Gadfium/wikicommons In theory, data from the Type 815’s trip near Alaska could end up informing new weapons designs or other measures to defeat THAAD in any potential conflict. There is always the potential risk that the details the Chinese grabbed could end up in the hands of North Korean intelligence agents, as well. Beyond the THAAD test, the arrival of one of the Type 815s off the American coast is significant in general. This type of world-wide sea-based electronic surveillance was a capability previously limited mainly to the American and Russian militaries. The Russian Navy has deployed its Balzam -class ships to snoop on large-scale military activities, including a notable appearance near Hawaii during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercises in 2016. In February 2017, one of the Kremlin’s smaller Vishnya -class spy ship appeared off the east coast of the United States, reportedly the furthest north the type had ever ventured along the American coast. In 2014, the original Type 815 Beijixing also snooped on the annual RIMPAC exercise, even as other PLAN ships directly participated in the event . Even if the ships are less capable than their American or Russian counterparts, having six of them can only improve China’s ability to collect electronic intelligence on a number of potential opponents from the sea, including South Korea, Japan, and the United States. On July 2, 2017, the Tianlangxing , a Type 815G, transited the Tsugaru Strait separating Japan’s Honshu and Hokkaido islands. The ship was moving in the opposite direction from the Korean Peninsula, where a flurry of missile activity occurred two days later. Regardless, the move through the Japanese territorial waters prompted a stern response from that country’s authorities, though it was unclear if the Chinese ship was actively collecting electronic emissions at the time. China countered that it was allowed to pass through the area under international law. Regardless, if the Type 815’s arrival off the American coast ahead of the July 2017 THAAD test is any indication, the U.S. military may increasingly have to take into account that Chinese could be watching future launches from off shore.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",The United States and Australia Quietly Test Hypersonic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hypersonic aircraft and missiles, which could fly as fast as a mile a second while maneuvering high enough to be safe from many existing air defenses, have the potential to transform warfare . So it’s no surprise that the United States continues to pushing ahead with research and development of these exotic flight vehicles, both gathering information on future weapon designs and conducting actual flight tests in cooperation with Australia. As of July 12, 2017, the U.S. military and its Australian partners had concluded a round of experiments as part of the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HiFIRE) program, including an unspecified number of actual test launches. Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne specifically congratulated the team – a partnership between the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Australian Department of Defense’s Defense Science and Technology Group (DST), BAE Systems Australia, Boeing Research and Technology, and the University of Queensland – “on another successful hypersonic flight at Woomera test range,” according to FlightGlobal , suggesting there may have only been one actual flight in this particular case. “We were pleased to support the DST with the successful flight trial; the most complex of all HIFiRE flights conducted to date, to further the fundamental scientific understanding of hypersonic flight,” BAE Systems Australia told FlightGlobal in a statement. “This flight trial is a significant step forward in proving this technology and enhancing our collective understanding of how it could be employed across a range of applications.” The United States and Australia have been quietly working on the project for more than eight years. Initially, the partnership also included the American space agency NASA. The very first launch of a HIFiRE flight vehicle, which simply validated the basic design, occurred in May 2009 . In March 2010, the multinational team fired a second version configured to gather scientific data. The two experiments also occurred at Australia’s Woomera Test Range . In both cases, a Terrier Orion sounding rocket boosted the unpowered, cone-shaped “vehicles” to hypersonic speeds, generally defined as more than Mach 5. The sounding rocket, normally used for exo-atmospheric testing, seems to have been chosen for convenience rather than as a surrogate for an actual operational launch platform. Many previous hypersonic tests, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Project Falcon , have employed rockets and missiles with a ballistic trajectories as an easy way to get the test shape up to the appropriate speed. A HIFiRE test rocket blasts off in 2012., NASA The goal of the initial tests was to “develop and validate technologies critical to next generation hypersonic aerospace systems,” according to one AFRL report . “Candidate technology areas include, but are not limited to, propulsion, propulsion-airframe integration, aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics, high temperature materials and structures, thermal management strategies, guidance, navigation, and control, sensors, and system components.” A diagram showing the components of the second HIFiRE test rocket., AFRL A diagram of the unpowered test vehicle used in the second HIFiRE launch., AFRL There were at least two further tests in 2012, which involved a powered design with a scramjet engine. Teams launched the rockets at the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the island of Kauai in Hawaii and at the Andøya Rocket Range in Norway. Though still initially launched using the Terrier Orion rocket, the flight vehicle reached a top speed of Mach 8, or more than 6,000 miles per hour, thanks to the added propulsion. Another launch in Australia, where the prototype flew to a height of 172 miles and reached a maximum speed of Mach 7.5, occurred in May 2016 . We don’t know what specific configuration the HIFiRE team employed in the 2017 flight test. What we do know is that an ultimate goal of the program was to gather information that could be “applicable to the design of next generation high speed strike weapons,” according to a 2008 U.S. Air Force contract announcement . “The technical data to be collected from this program will be used to extend the verification of current design tools and further Air Force efforts to buy down risk in the development of future weapon systems.” While there is no indication that the two are directly related, on June 29, 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s (AFLCMC) Armament Directorate did put out an official notice asking for information on potential hypersonic weapons. In this case, the Air Force was specifically interested in a weapon that could be air launched from either fighter or bomber type aircraft, though it did not specify any particular types. The service already does have some experience with a similar system. Between 2005 and 2013, AFRL tested an air-launched hypersonic test vehicle with a scramjet, known as the X-51A Waverider , using a B-52 bomber as the launch platform. Earlier in 2017, Lockheed Martin said it was very close to having a workable hypersonic aircraft . In May 2017, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agecny (DARPA) hired Boeing to build an new hypersonic spaceplane , referred to as the XS-1, too. Regardless, in this case the service just wants to get information from potential sources about their ability to put together an air-launched hypersonic “strike weapon” with a conventional warhead that an existing fighter- or bomber-type aircraft could carry and fire at unspecified targets, according to the notice. As such, anyone submitting a proposal has to prove they can both design and test a fully functional system under “representative operational conditions.” An X-51A hypersonic test vehicle under the wing of a B-52 bomber., USAF Since the objective is to solicit information as to what technology already exists, the Air Force did not provide any requirements or specific design parameters, either. However, as we at The War Zone have reported in depth before, hypersonic weapons could be a definite game changer. In June, I wrote : But more importantly, this air-breathing engine generates a very different signature from a rocket motor, meaning space-based surveillance assets might not be able to spot one as quickly or keep tracking it during flight, or even spot it at all for that matter. On top of that, prototype designs look much more like super-fast flying cruise missiles or drones, able to fly in more erratic ways well within the atmosphere, maybe even changing course in mid-flight relatively rapidly. This could make any such weapon more accurate, since it could make more corrections before impact, as well. A projectile flying at a mile a second would be too much to process in general for even the most fast-scanning surface- and airborne radars that exist at present, and even if they could be tracked, engaging something going that speed within the atmosphere represents a huge set of problems of its own. All of these features have made the concept attractive within the Pentagon, as potential opponents field increasingly more powerful radars, surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles, and other weapons that could deny existing, more conventional American military forces from getting close to their objective in the first place. The U.S. military has collectively dubbed these threats as “Anti-Access/Area Denial,” or A2AD. Hypersonic weapons could be the key to breaking through these protective layers, including knocking down an enemy’s integrated air defense system (IADS), during a crisis, maintaining America’s ability to hold its enemies under threat. A hypersonic system would have significant benefits in a time-sensitive strike scenario, whether it be taking out a terrorist at a particular location or quickly knocking out vital enemy weapons or installations during a larger conflict. The immense speed of one of these craft could dramatically shrink the time it takes to go from first identifying any target to actually hitting it with a weapon, which in turns gives opponents significantly less time to notice they’ve been spotted and attempt to reposition, get into cover, or otherwise improve their defenses. Of course, the Air Force made it clear that all it wanted from its June 2017 request was “market research” and that there were no existing plans to actually purchase a hypersonic weapon of any kind. Interested parties would not have to submit any actual prototypes either, but would have to send in a detailed written statement outlining their capabilities and possible offerings. Representatives from CUBRC, Ingenium Aerospace, L-3, Northrop Grumman, and SI2 Technologies had all indicated their interest in the announcement on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, though this does not necessarily mean they submitted any information. It also doesn’t mean other firms, such as Boeing or BAE, have not submitted their own white papers. But between the latest HIFiRE test and the information request, the Air Force seems eager to keep moving toward the goal of a real, operational capability. These latest developments may have been spurred in part by criticism by some members of Congress that the U.S. military as a whole isn’t doing nearly enough in this area or to defend against threatening developments in Russia and China. “I’m concerned about Chinese and Russian hypersonic weapons development, and I expressed those concerns in the right places,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, assured Congress during a hearing May 2017. “What we can do is to develop our own hypersonic weapons and improve our defenses against theirs.” For anyone interested in submitting their weapon proposal, the Air Force wants the details no later than July 14, 2017.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2018",France and Germany Want to Build Their Own 5th Generation Fighter Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. France and Germany have announced their intention to work together to develop a new advanced “ European ” fighter jet. Though the final plan is still in the works, the decision appears to be wrapped up in a number of political and economic considerations and could potentially see the end the German military’s interest in the controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The deal emerged in a larger document the two countries published following a joint cabinet meeting on July 13, 2017. In addition to the new fighter jet, the white paper outlined Franco-German cooperation on an upgraded Tiger attack helicopter, air-to-ground missiles, drones, heavy tanks, and artillery, according to Reuters . The complete Franco-German fighter jet plan reportedly calls for a combination of manned and unmanned aircraft to ultimately replace France’s Dassault Rafales and Germany’s Eurofighter Typhoons . The two countries will come up with a shared “roadmap” by the middle of 2018, but there is not a clear time frame for when the new aircraft could or should enter production or be ready for combat. Both countries have an interest in developing successors to these aircraft. Though they are among the most advanced fighter jets in active service anywhere in the world, the basic Rafale and Typhoon designs date back to the 1980s. Development of fighters since then has increasingly focused on adding low-observable features, such as stealthy overall shapes, to defeat steadily improving, networked air defenses. A German Eurofighter Typhoon., Bundeswehr The Franco-German plan actually sounds very similar to Airbus Defence and Space’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) concept. The European aviation consortium, headquarters in Germany, first revealed this proposal in July 2016. FCAS itself was a response to a joint German-Spanish requirement, dubbed the Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS), which those two countries unveiled six months earlier. That proposal envisioned the new aircraft entering service sometime in the 2030 to 2040 time frame. A French Dassault Rafale B., USAF Though Airbus included concept art of a stealthy-looking fifth generation fighter jet in its FCAS presentations, the core revolved around data sharing and manned-unmanned teaming . This is very similar to how the U.S. military increasingly sees itself operating the F-35 . The fighter component of the system would act as the controller for unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) carrying additional weapons and sensors. All of these aircraft would be able to share information back and forth, as well as draw additional information from other networked platforms, such as dedicated spy planes or unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. All of this would give pilots better situational awareness and more options to reach their targets, while reducing exposure to enemy air defenses. Depending on the size and number of the armed drones involved, the “ swarm ” of aircraft might even be able to overwhelm the defenders. Concept art of the fighter component of Airbus FCAS., Airbus It’s not immediately clear whether or not the new Franco-German agreement will involve any other partners, such as the Spanish. However, the two countries would likely be keen to bring in Spain and other European countries, especially smaller NATO members, which are looking for a new fighter aircraft but have not yet joined the F-35 program. This cooperation allows for cost and industrial base burden sharing, which could reduce costs, while still boosting national economies. For decades, European have banded together to form consortiums to design and built combat aircraft – such as the SEPECAT Jaguar , Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet , Panavia Tornado , and Eurofighter Typhoon – for exactly these reasons. A diagram showing FCAS’ proposed manned-unmanned teaming., Airbus However, the decision of the French to drop out of the Typhoon development program and pursue its own aircraft, which became the Rafale, had soured Germany and many others on a new joint project for years. At present there are four European-designed multi-role jet aircraft still in active service with multiple countries on the continent, the Rafale, Typhoon, Tornado, and the Swedish-made Saab Gripen . France alone continues to operate a number of older Mirage 2000 jets, as well. There are also a number of European UCAV projects in the works, including the French Dassault nEUROn – which was a pan-European project as the spelling implies – and the BAE Taranis . Now it appears that the political climate has shifted, especially in light of the United Kingdom’s plans to leave the European Union , more commonly known as Brexit, and strained relations between countries in Europe and President Donald Trump’s administration in the United States. Brexit in particular could threaten to scuttle an Anglo-French project to jointly develop a successor the nEUROn and Taranis, also confusingly called FCAS . So, perhaps, not surprisingly, in June 2017, ahead of the annual Paris Air Show, Airbus said it would welcome French participation in the NGWS/FCAS project. “I really hope that France will be involved,” Fernando Alonso, in charge of head of Airbus Defence and Space’s military aircraft division, told reporters on June 9, 2017. “We have to do this in Europe. There’s no place to do two or three different systems. … The time is right for us in Europe to decide and to decide to build something together and be available for all of us,” In addition, it’s uncertain how this agreement will effect’s Germany’s plans to replace its aging Tornados. This swing-wing design dates back to the 1970s and the Luftwaffe is desperate to replace the aircraft, which are increasingly becoming a maintenance nightmare . The main goal of the NGWS program was actually to replace the Tornado first and worry about the much more modern Typhoons later. Similarly, in May 2017, it emerged that German officials had begun inquiring about joining the Joint Strike Fighter program , but apparently only as a potential Tornado replacement. U.S. defense officials had briefed their German counterparts on the issue just days before the Franco-German announcement on the new fighter jet. “The F-35 is one of many options we are exploring,” a spokesman for the country’s Federal Ministry of Defence said, according to Reuters on July 11, 2017. We don’t know whether or not the outcome of that meeting, or the tensions between Germany and the United States over a host of issues, had any impact on the decision to start the project with France or if this truly ends German interest in the F-35. “The times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over,” Merkel said at a political rally in May 2017, in what many saw an indirect, but clear reference to the United States. “We Europeans have to take fate into our own hands.” The announcement also did came as Trump touched down in France for a state visit, but there’s no firm evidence the two events were related. German Tornado ground attack aircraft., Bundeswehr Regardless of the national political or economic considerations, any new Franco-German fighter could run into trouble simply because of the already complex international market for such aircraft, which is full of advanced fourth generation designs and fifth-generation proposals and early-stage development programs. South Korea , Turkey , and Japan are all reportedly considering their own 5th generation stealthy fighter designs, in addition to the growing dominance of the F-35. Though there are no planning to purchase the final aircraft, the U.K.’s BAE Systems has joined Turkish Aerospace Industries to work on its TFX jet. On top of that the Rafale still enjoys considerable export success , as do a number of new variants of older American designs , including the F-16V , F-15 Advanced Eagle , and F/A-18E/F Block III Super Hornet. Saab is actively promoting its latest Gripen E. Then there are Russian and Chinese fourth and fifth generation designs, including Russia’s advanced derivatives of the Su-27 Flanker, as well as the T-50, and China’s F-35-look-a-like the FC-31 . All of this could impact potential export sales of any Franco-German development, which would be an important consideration. Foreign sales could help further reduce costs to both parties and would be a major incentive for the development of their own new fighter type. There’s also the question of whether France’s looser export policies might put off German sensibilities, which have become increasingly critical of arms sales to repressive regimes such as Saudi Arabia . The French government has had no qualms about sending advanced weapons or considering such deals with the Saudis, as well as the Egypt , the United Arab Emirates, and other countries regularly accused of human rights abuses. And then there’s just the difficulty of designing a fifth generation fighter jet in the first place. So far, other examples, such as the F-35, show the process is often decades long and potentially exhaustively expensive. Even the development of the Rafale and Eurofighter spanned multiple decades, and those jets are still receiving capabilities that were long planned.  With this in mind, there’s a good chance that by the time any new manned fighter jet design matures, let alone is combat ready, UCAVs will have become similarly advanced , offering a cheaper and in many cases more capable alternative for many missions that are currently executed by manned fighters. Also as noted, France has already begun investing heavily in this technology and Germany’s existing NGWS concept incorporates these future developments. On top of that, domestic political and economic concerns could delay timelines further or even scuttle projects altogether. Both Germany and France are trying to embark on politically and economically complicated defense spending increases. In a speech on July 13, 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron announced his country was planning on a significant increase in military spending in order to reach the NATO target of all members spending two percent of their gross domestic products on defense by 2025. “It’s a considerable effort, considering the the current context of budgetary constraints,” the recently elected French president explained. The announcement of the agreement is an important first step and a significant sign of increasing Franco-German ties. However, unlike other shared arms programs the two countries included in their plan, it may take significantly more effort to get going on a new, joint fighter jet project.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 12, 2019",A Primer On The Raging Battle For A New Pentagon Space Corps,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Congress is seriously considering creating a dedicated Space Corps, which would be the first time it has created an all new military branch in seven decades.  Despite the need to reform how the U.S. military treats operations in space , there is already a serious political battle brewing between lawmakers in favor of the proposal, other legislators who feel blindsided by the proposal, and the U.S. military itself. On July 11, 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis wrote an unusual letter to specifically asking for support in killing the proposal . The retired Marine Corps general who commands immense bi-partisan support sent his message to Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces and is a member of the separate Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. The Space Corps plan only became widespread public knowledge in June 2017, when the House Armed Services Committee included the provision in their draft of the annual defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year. At the time of writing, it only exists in the House’s version of the proposed legislation , which lawmakers would have to reconcile with the Senate’s own draft bill before it could become law. “I do not routinely comment on potential floor amendments of pending legislation. However, this particular issue warrants a response,” Mattis reportedly explained in his letter to Turner. “I strongly urge Congress to reconsider the proposal of a separate service Space Corps.” Air Force personnel inspect the X-37B experimental mini space shuttle after a mission., USAF What is a “space corps”? To rewind quickly, here are the key components of the existing House plan. It calls for the creation of a Space Corps no later than Jan. 1, 2019. Though technically an independent service, this branch would be placed under the Department of the Air Force. The new Chief of Staff of the Space Corps would report to the Secretary of the Air Force, but would have equal authority within the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This proposed structure is virtually identical to the relationship between the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps. But before anyone starts thinking about heavily armed “ Space Marines ,” the overall concept is much more focused on streamlining the management of existing military space assets and the acquisition of new space-based capabilities. There’s no fantastical talk for troops or spaceships to stand watch or fight in orbit. “Nothing in this section would authorize or require the relocation of any facilities, infrastructure, or military installations of the Air Force,” the draft text declares. The Secretary of the Air Force would also retain their so-called “ Milestone Decision Authority ” with regards to the Space Corps’ acquisition of new systems, which would give them the ability to conduct the final review of “cost, schedule, and performance” of any particular program. This 1960s Army concept art is NOT what some American lawmakers are thinking when they talk about a new “space corps.”, US Army At present, the Air Force has its own Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) to handle these functions. The other existing branches have their own space components, as well. Though not specified in the House’s draft language, there is the clear suggestion that these other elements – including U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), Naval Network and Space Operations Command (NNSOC), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), and U.S. Marine Corps Forces Strategic Command (MARFORSTRAT) – could see reduced roles or possibly be shuttered altogether. The proposal only promises not to prevent individual services from developing their own specific means of linking to space systems, which would include items such as terminals to connect to satellite communications and intelligence systems. In addition, the provision says it would have no impact on the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the U.S. Intelligence Community’s main satellite intelligence arm, or the National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Pentagon’s top map makers. It would eliminate the position of the Principal Department of Defense Space Advisor and the Defense Space Council. You can find the full text here . An artist’s conception of the future XS-1 spacecraft., DARPA The need to get serious about space The plan, which could see the first new U.S. military service since the creation of the Air Force in 1947, is the brainchild of chairman of the House Armed Services Committee’s Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Alabama Republican Mike Rogers, as well as the subcommittee’s ranking Democrat, Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee. It already has significant bi-partisan support, including from the House Armed Services Committee’s top chairman, Texas Republican Mac Thornberry, and his Democrat counterpart, Washington State’s Adam Smith. “We have seen time and again that our ability to meet new challenges in space is lethargic at best,” Rogers said in an interview with Space News in April 2017, in which he alluded to his plans for what was then described as a “space force.” “What I want to do is take the organizational construct that currently exists, and start pulling out some of the problems.” “You may have seen a hearing I had where I had the staff put together a chart of who all is involved in the acquisition process for space,” he continued. “It’s 60 different people who can say, ‘No’ – and yet nobody owns it. Nobody owns responsibility for what doesn’t happen, or doesn’t happen in a timely manner.” From that complaint, it’s not hard to see how Rogers and his colleagues arrived at their specific Space Corps proposal. And the Congressman is right to highlight the growing importance of space to the U.S. military and its operations at home and abroad, both defensive and offensive. American forces are increasingly reliant on GPS for navigation and targeting , satellite communications, and space-based intelligence and early warning systems to both gather information and maintain a functional deterrent against potentially hostile countries. Countries such as Russia and China are well aware of this trend and have begun developing weapons and tactics to defeat these technological advantages in any future, high intensity conflict. “When you look at China and Russia and how aggressive they’re being in space, we’ve got to outpace that,” Rogers told Space News . “We can never let ourselves become peers with those folks.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=j-ZBLFhb_lg The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has explored these steadily emerging issues in depth, including in December 2016, where he wrote : The Pentagon is facing threats in emerging mediums of combat. Cyber warfare may be grabbing all the headlines lately, but space—the place where so much of America’s unique combat capability is enabled from—is the US military’s glaring achilles heel. China and Russia are rapidly developing new capabilities to destroy, disable, blind or even hijack American satellites in orbit in an attempt to level the playing field should a peer-state conflict breakout. The US is slowly trying to adapt to this new reality by spinning up new ways to navigate and target in GPS-denied combat environments —as well as coming up with new communications techniques that work around reliance on satellite relays. For years, anything but kinetic anti-satellite weaponry remained on the dark fringes of the defense world. Now these concepts and capabilities are emerging into the mainstream. These range from the mysterious X-37B miniature space shuttle , to DARPA led initiatives aimed at servicing other satellites in space or using space junk to create cheap communications satellites. Any of these could be used to monitor, jam, or even destroy enemy satellites without creating terrible debris fields that will limit future access to space. Other highly classified space technologies also likely exist. Giving military space a seat at the table to equal land, sea, and air forces, along with creating a single manager for the Pentagon’s broad space-based capabilities, does definitely seem like a reasonable idea. It is the same basic logic behind a parallel debate about giving the same authority and stature to the American military commander in charge of cyber security. And, at base, the U.S. military is in broad agreement that improvements need to be made in how it handles this unique “theater of operations.” In May 2017, DARPA chose X-37B maker Boeing to build a new, potentially revolutionary military space plane called the XS-1. “There is absolutely nothing we do as a joint force that isn’t enabled by space. I repeat: nothing,” U.S. Air Force Gen. John W. Raymond, head of AFSPC, wrote in an op-ed , which also detailed his opposition to the Space Corps concept. “Protecting and defending our space capabilities is a national imperative.” An Atlas V rocket carrying an NRO satellite blasts off from the Vandenberg Air Force Base’s Space Launch Complex-3 in march 2017. , USAF Pushback against a new branch But between Mattis’ letter and comments from Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein since the formal proposal first emerged, the U.S. military feels a new Space Corps is not the right path forward. The broad contention is that if Rogers’ thinks 60 people is too big a bureaucracy, adding a brand new 61st doesn’t help things at all. The proposal could only lead to a “narrower and even parochial approach,” Mattis noted in his letter . The most obvious potential problem would be all new fighting for shares of the overall defense budget battles as the Space Corps and its parent service the Air Force debated the appropriate amount of money to include and where to put it in what would likely be shared funding requests. “The Pentagon is complicated enough,” Secretary Wilson unequivocally told reporters on June 21, 2017. “This will make it more complex, add more boxes to the organization chart, and cost more money. And if I had more money, I would put it into lethality, not bureaucracy.” “If you’re saying the word ‘separate’ and ‘space’ in the same sentence, you’re moving in the wrong direction,” General Goldfein said on the same day. “The secretary and I are focused how do we integrate space.” Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, center, and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, right, stand in front of a model of the X-37B., AP The Air Force insists that it has identified the problem of lagging behind when it comes to development space capabilities and is working to address it. In April 2017, the service unveiled a plan to create a new three-star deputy chief of staff, as well as an associated staff, in an office referred to as “A-11” to “normalize” space issues. This new organization would speed up the decision making process with regards to procuring and employing space-based systems and improve the training and managing of the units involved in the mission. Separately, U.S. Strategic Command is working to expand its own joint space headquarters , with the Air Force’s top space officer in charge of the new organization. “The Air Force … is once again leading the effort to meet these new strategic challenges and has made significant advances over the past couple of years,” General Raymond added in his op-ed . The officer went on to argue in favor of giving the Milestone Decision Authority to the Air Force rather than a new branch, as well as increasing the portions of the defense budget set aside for space activities. The pushback isn’t limited to the U.S. military, either. Rogers has faced criticism from his own colleagues, many of who felt the proposal had come out of nowhere without the appropriate discussion and debate. “This is honestly the first time I’ve heard about a major reorganization to our Air Force,” Representative Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican, retired Air Force officer , and member of the House Armed Services Committee, said as she and her colleagues went through their proposed defense budget on June 28, 2017. “This is sort of a shocking way to hear about a very major reorganization to our military, and I think it deserves at least a couple hearings and discussions on the matter at the full committee level.” Afterward the markup process concluded, Representative Turner said he had admonished his staff for not knowing about the proposal sooner, but still called for additional time to fully review the idea and to hear from Mattis on the matter. “I chastised my staff and said, ‘How could I not know that this was happening?’ he said, according to Federal News Radio . “Maybe we do need a space corps, but I think this bears more than just discussions in a subcommittee.” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., AP Space Corps supporters push back Rogers has been incensed by the criticisms and calls to slow down his plans. He said that if anyone was in the dark about the proposal, it was the own fault, since he had started work on the idea back in September 2016. During the markup meeting nine months later, the Alabama lawmaker also pointed out that the idea of restructuring the military space chain of command first came up in 2001 under Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. In addition, the Government Accountability Office, a top federal watchdog, had conducted at least three separate reviews of the options, proposing among other things a companion to the Missile Defense Agency for space issues. “I don’t know where my friend from Ohio has been,” he directed at Representative Turner specifically. Then, at a hearing on June 22, Rogers slammed the Air Force’s reaction, literally saying he was “ pissed ” in prepared remarks. “The Pentagon always resists change,” he declared. “It resisted the creation of the Air Force itself – great irony there. Now the Air Force leadership would have us trust them: I don’t think so. They just need a few more years to rearrange the deck chairs: I don’t think so. This is the same Air Force that got us into the situation where the Russians and the Chinese are near-peers to us in space.” After the public meeting, he followed up his complaints with a threat to cut the Air Force out of the chain of command altogether. “Maybe we need a Space Corps Secretary instead of an Air Force Secretary leading space,” Rogers’ said, making it clear he has no intention of backing down on the proposal. Vice President Mike Pence visits the 50th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado in June 2017., USAF So far, beyond Mattis’ letter, it’s unclear how President Donald Trump and other members of his administration feel about the proposal. Depending on their opinions on the matter, they might be able to sway the debate for good. The Trump administration, especially Vice President Mike Pence, has made it clear they see a need to improve and expand America’s military capabilities and other activities in space in general. “I can assure you, under President Donald Trump, American security will be as dominant in the heavens as we are here on Earth,” Pence said in a speech at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 6, 2017. “We will beat back any disadvantage that our lack of attention has placed and America will once again lead in space.” Whether that leadership includes a Space Corps or not is still up for debate.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 26, 2018",No Military Units Have Free Time to Grab that Downed Global Hawk Off Mt. Whitney,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force remains tight-lipped about a now weeks old crash of a RQ-4 Global Hawk drone in California. However, updated plans for hiring a private contractor to recover the wreckage, as well as official comments to The War Zone, provide additional details about the crash site, such as safety hazards and environmental concerns, including an explanation for the decision to go with a private contractor for the job at all. On June 30, 2017, Air Force Test Center (AFTC) at Edwards Air Force Base first announced it was looking for a contractor with a heavy lift helicopter to retrieve pieces of the wreck via FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website. At the time of writing, the center had updated the post three times to include new information. Still, none of these updates had answered what was perhaps the biggest question, which was why the Air Force needed a contractor to do the work in the first place. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as reserve components including the California Army National Guard, all operate helicopters that appear to meet the contract’s requirements, such as the CH-47 Chinook and CH-53E Super Stallion . Many of those units train to recover downed aircraft . “The Air Force has coordinated with the California National Guard and other Active Duty units for support,” Christopher Ball, chief of media operations for the 412th Test Wing at Edwards, which also handles queries about AFTC, told The War Zone in an Email. “These units were unable to support our requirement for various reasons.” Though we still don’t know what those exact reasons are or were, it is true that the California Army National Guard’s aviation elements are busy fighting forest fires in the state, as well as other requirements. Though headquartered in Washington State, the active Army’s 16th Aviation Brigade is deployed to Afghanistan, too. West Coast-based Marine heavy helicopter squadrons may have similar operational or training conflicts. Pulling units from elsewhere in the United States might not work with the Air Force’s truncated schedule for getting at the downed Global Hawk. The Skycrane, which once served with the US Army as the CH-54 Tarhe, is still in high demand today., US Army As such, the Air Force’s preferred solution remains a contractor flying the old, but still capable Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane , which can carry up to 20,000 pounds of cargo under optimal conditions. The revised statement of work clarifies the aircraft AFTC considers to be acceptable, adding the Boeing Model 234UT to the list by name, which we at The War Zone had already mentioned in our previous update. This twin-rotor “utility transport,” a derivative of the CH-47 Chinook, has similar payload capabilities to the Skycrane, according to Columbia Helicopters , an operator of the type. Unfortunately, high altitudes combined with hot weather and associates changes in air pressure can dramatically limit the performance of many helicopters, reducing their maximum load carrying capacity and range. Summer temperatures in nearby communities, such as Lone Pine, California, have consistently been above 80 degrees Fahrenheit since the crash. Based on new information, these will all be factors in and around the crash site. In responses to questions from prospective vendors, dated July 6, 2017, AFTC confirmed government officials had not yet physically been to the crash site, but disclosed that it is at an altitude of almost 10,000 feet. Authorities had been able to reach an area above the crash, one imagines by helicopter, at approximately 11,500 feet, before descending 1,500 feet to a spot “just above the site.” Other officials had climbed up from an unspecified starting point below, but only made it to a height of 7,400 feet. Photographs taken by witnesses and local media after the mishap suggested the drone ultimately slammed into the side of California’s Mount Whitney . The Air Force had been able to determine that parts of the Global Hawk were strewn across an area of approximately 400,000 to 500,000 square feet that is a mile across at its longest point. More problematically, much of this sits on a steep 60 to 70 percent grade. The largest visible remaining section of the RQ-4 is a 20 to 25 foot long portion of the fuselage, or roughly half of the unmanned aircraft’s full length , according to the questions and answers document. The service estimates this portion alone could weigh up to 5,000 pounds. The Global Hawk’s full weight is nearly 15,000 pounds. U.S. Marines continue building a landing zone using AM2 panels as a CH-53 comes in to land., USMC So it makes perfect sense that the Air Force wants someone with a heavy lift chopper to get in and grab the remnants of the RQ-4 from this remote site. But, likely due to the range and capability limitations of any suitable helicopter while carrying these potentially large loads while operating in the aforementioned “hot-and-high” conditions, the Air Force plans to provide a temporary landing zone using Aluminum Matting-2 (AM2) within 5 miles of the crash site where contractors will first deliver any components their retrieve. “Edwards AFB’s crash recovery team worked with the U.S. Forest Service, BLM [Bureau of Land Management] and other agencies to identify the nearest area to the crash site that would work well as a landing zone,” Ball explained in his Email. “Any parts recovered from the mountain will be relocated to this staging area temporarily before being transported back to Edwards AFB where they can be examined by the accident investigation board.” Beyond that, the Air Force provided additional details about the safety and environmental concerns to the updated statements of work and in its answers to contractor questions. “The crash site/fire is entirely within the congressionally designated John Muir Wilderness , ‘where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain,'” the revised statement of work on July 8 noted. The contractor would need to be mindful of an endangered animal species and candidate endangered plant species, the Sierra Nevada Big Horn Sheep and Whitebark Pine respectively, as well as concerns from more common wildlife, such as bears. Also, “do not collect prehistoric or historic artifacts” and “report all cultural resource discoveries and protect/secure the discovery location,” the statement of work adds. A map showing the John Muir Wilderness within the Inyo National Forest., US Forest Service All in all, it sounds like it will be a complicated operation. Given all of these factors, the Air Force has stated unequivocally that “the Government will not put the vendor in a position that would potentially jeopardize the crew or aircraft during performance of the mission” and that it would agree to halt work by mutual agreement with whomever they ultimately hire if the situation becomes too dangerous. RQ-4 Global Hawk, Northrop Grumman Otherwise, the Air Force continues to decline to release official photographs of the wreckage or offer a more granular description of the basic circumstances surrounding the accident.“The cause of the crash won’t be known until the accident investigation board completes its investigation,” Ball wrote. “The board first gathers all available evidence from all sources that can be located and then examines and compares all the data available before drawing any conclusions and completing its report.” Since it can take months for investigators to complete these reports and for the Air Force to review them for release to the public , it may be some time before we get the full story on what exactly happened to the RQ-4.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 26, 2019",U.S. Navy Kicks Off Biggest Ever “Sea Breeze” Exercise In The Black Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every year, the U.S. Navy leads an international flotilla of warships, along with other naval forces in the air and on the land, through a series of frills in and around Ukraine’s Black Sea coastline as part of an exercise nicknamed Sea Breeze. This time, in the face of heightened tensions with Russia , the American contingent is significantly more powerful, including both the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Carney and the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Hue City . Exercise Sea Breeze 2017 officially began with a ceremony in Ukraine’s coastal city of Odessa on July 10, 2017. This is the seventeenth time the U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet has run the event, which dates back to the 1990s. With more than 3,000 service members from 17 nations, including approximately 800 Americans from various U.S. military branches, this iteration is the biggest and most involved version to date. The practice scenarios cover maritime interdiction operations, air defense, anti-submarine warfare, damage control tactics, search and rescue, and amphibious warfare, according to the U.S. Navy . Usually, American personnel also conduct civic action missions, such as refurbishing schools or other municipal buildings, and engaging with the local public, in between the training sessions. “We are all stronger together,” U.S. Navy Captain Tate Westbrook, the commander of U.S. 6th Fleet’s Task Force 65, the fleet’s main surface force, and head of all American personnel participating in Sea Breeze 2017 scene, said at an opening press conference . “We will finish this exercise all smarter, all better, and more prepared as a team and as individual navies.” Most importantly, this year, the U.S. Navy has sent both Carney , which is forward deployed to Spain , and the Hue City , detached from the USS George H.W. Bush ’s carrier strike group. The George H.W. Bush is presently conducting operations from the Mediterranean Sea. Both ships have capable land attack , anti-ship, and air defense weaponry , advanced sensors, and, if armed with the appropriate missiles, ballistic missile defense capabilities . Part of Carney ’s role in Europe is specifically to act as part of the regional Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) shield. USS Carney , in the foreground, shares a pier with USS Hue City in Odessa, Ukraine during Sea Breeze 2017., USN In addition, the U.S. Navy has deployed a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane, as well as SEALs , explosive ordnance disposal personnel, specialized divers, and Seabee construction elements. The Marine Corps has added members of its Europe-based rapid-response Fleet Antiterrorism Team, or FAST to the exercise as well. Also a number of U.S. Army personnel will also be on hand, rounding on the American contingent. A P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, one of which will also take part in Sea Breeze 2017., USN While two ships may not seem like much, sending Carney and Hue City into the Black Sea at the same time is a big deal and a notable increase in the firepower on display over previous Sea Breeze gatherings. Per the more than eight decade old Montreux Convention , countries that do not have a Black Sea coastline are limited in how many warships they can send into the body of water at any one time. You can read the exact method of measuring the total displaced tonnage here , but suffice to say it prevents American supercarriers and amphibious assault ships from entering at all. Other capital ships from non-Black Sea states that do meet the requirements may not remain there for more than 21 days per the agreement, to which the United States is a party. USS Carney DDG-64, USN So, in the past, the U.S. Navy has generally contributed one Arleigh Burke -class destroyer to the afloat portion of the exercise, as well as other, smaller elements for other components on land. In 2016, the U.S. Navy had added the landing ship dock USS Whidbey Island to the mix. Other participants, including those who do have Black Sea boundary, have generally only sent frigates and smaller warships. In short, having both Carney and Hue City in the tightly controlled and relatively small area sends a powerful message – one that message seems firmly directed at the Russians. “The ships of my squadron will continue to operate in the Black Sea to reassure our partners,” U.S. Navy Captain Westbrook said in his opening remarks. “We are here to stay.” “Our task… is to fight as one team,” Ukrainian Navy Captain Oleksii Neizhpapa, the director of the exercise, added. “The joint force will have the number one goal: to secure the neighborhood.” Ukrainian Navy Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko speaks during the opening of Sea Breeze 2017., USN Securing “the neighborhood” means securing it from the Russians. Every other country on the Black Sea – Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine – is taking part in Sea Breeze 2017. Three of those five – Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey – are NATO members. In 2008, Georgia and Russia fought a brief war over the status of two break-away regions, an issue that remains unresolved. In March 2014, Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea region and subsequently began actively supporting separatists fighting the government in Kiev. While Sea Breeze occurs on the other side of the country from fighting in eastern Ukraine, the international training mission has taken on an entirely new character over the past three years. Now, the Ukrainian and U.S. Navy co-host the seemingly ever expanding drills. In addition, the bulk of the $4.5 million necessary to pay for the 2017 gathering, which doesn’t include the cost of operating the two American warships, came from the United States’ European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). The ERI covers broad American efforts to calm its allies and partners in the face of Russia’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy in Europe. The fund includes money for exercises, new facilities, and other security cooperation tasks both with both NATO allies and other regional partners, such as Ukraine. “This exercise, which is co-hosted by Ukraine, exemplifies our collective resolve to upholding international law, and to maintaining peace and stability in the Black Sea,” U.S. Navy Commander Peter Halvorsen, Carney ’s commanding officer, said after the ship arrived in Odessa. Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko greets U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his visit in July 2017., AP This year, Sea Breeze also follows a major diplomatic engagement between the United States and Ukraine. On July 9, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s made his first visit to the country in an official capacity and met with President Petro Poroshenko. America’s top diplomat pledged continued support to the Ukranian government in their fight against Russian-backed separatists. “I think it is important to be very clear on what our goals are, the United States’ goals are, with respect to the situation here,” Tillerson said during a joint press conference with Poroshenko. “And first and foremost, it is to restore Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and integrity. … I’ve been very clear in my discussions with Russian leadership on more than one occasion that it is necessary for Russia to take the first steps to de-escalate the situation in the east part of Ukraine, in particular by respecting the ceasefire, by pulling back the heavy weapons, and allowing the OSCE observers to carry out their responsibilities.” A Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet intercepts a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber over the Baltic Sea., DOD The Russians were already sure to take notice and a foreign navy shadowing an American-led exercise is hardly out of the ordinary. It’s a prime intelligence gathering opportunity for all parties involved.  Moscow conducts its own exercises to show off its considerable military capabilities in the region, too. It’s worth noting that the small confines of the Black Sea would easily play to the Kremlin’s strengths in an actual conflict. Shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles such as the Bastion-P , as well as networked air defenses, which could impede a counter-attack, would pose a significant threat to one or two U.S. warships attempting to operate independently in the area. In 2016, Russia threatened to put some of these weapons into action and knock down Ukrainian missiles during tests, though they never followed through. However, since the Ukraine crisis began in 2014, there has been an increasing number of tit-for-tat engagements throughout Europe, including a number of incidents with U.S. military aircraft and ships that American officials have categorized as “ unsafe ” or “unprofessional.” Since January 2017, many these interactions have occurred in and around the Baltic Sea . In one particularly notable instance, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet photo bombed a massive formation of NATO aircraft that the alliance had put together for members of the press as part of the annual Baltic Operations maritime exercise, or BALTOPS. It’s not hard to imagine a similar interaction over the Black Sea, especially after Tillerson’s comments and the remarks at the start of Sea Breeze 2017. It wouldn’t be the first time either that there have been tensions surrounding the exercise or American activities in the region, either. In April 2014, a Russian Su-24 attack aircraft buzzed the Arleigh Burke -class USS Donald Cook in the Black Sea. Five months later, another one of the planes made similar passes near the Canadian Halifax -class frigate HMCS Toronto as it made its way to Odessa for the start of Sea Breeze 2014. Another naval incident occurred in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in June 2016, when the Russian Navy claimed an American destroyer, USS Gravely, cut off on of their frigates in international waters. U.S. relations with Russia are especially cool for other reasons, including the Kremlin’s continued support for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. American personnel in Syria, ostensibly fighting ISIS terrorists, have come into increasingly dangerous contact with forces loyal to the regime in Damascus. Assad himself enjoys the protection of Russian forces in his country, who effectively shield him from punitive attacks. The United States also accuse authorities in Moscow of having sought to influence and possibly sway the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Whatever happens, the U.S. Navy’s deployment of both Carney and Hue City clearly underscores America’s commitment both to its European allies and partners in general and to Ukraine in particular.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 4, 2019",Missile Defense Agency Says THAAD Has Destroyed Its First Mock IRBM,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first ever attempt by the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system to intercept a mock intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) was been successful, according to the U.S. military’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and defense contractor Lockheed Martin. The long-planned test , known as Flight Test THAAD-18 (FTT-18) had taken on new significant after months of increasingly worrisome North Korean missile launches. In its official press release , MDA did not give the exact time or location of the intercept, which occurred on July 11, 2017. Situated at Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska in Kodiak, Alaska, a U.S. Army crew from the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss, which controls all the operational THAAD batteries , detected, tracked, and intercepted the surrogate IRBM somewhere over the Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii. A U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane air dropped the target missile during the experiment. Previous missile defense tests have also employed this air-drop method. “This test further demonstrates the capabilities of the THAAD weapon system and its ability to intercept and destroy ballistic missile threats,” MDA Director U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Sam Greaves said in a statement. “THAAD continues to protect our citizens, deployed forces and allies from a real and growing threat.” “With this successful test, the THAAD system continues to prove its ability to intercept and destroy many classes of the ballistic missile threat to protect citizens, deployed forces, allies and international partners around the globe,” Richard McDaniel, vice president of Lockheed Martin’s Upper Tier Integrated Air and Missile Defense Systems said in a separate press release . U.S. Army crews shoot a THAAD interceptor in an earlier test., MDA Representatives of the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the Ballistic Missile Defense Operational Test Agency, and the Army Test and Evaluation Command were all on hand for FTT-18. In addition to the Army and the Air Force, U.S. Strategic Command’s Joint Forces Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense (JFCC-IMD) and the U.S. Coast Guard participated in the event. This was the first time THAAD had ever intercepted a target representing an IRBM and was the system’s 14 successful intercept since a revised testing regimen began in 2005. As intended, “the THAAD system then developed a fire control solution and launched an interceptor that destroyed the target’s reentry vehicle with sheer force of a direct collision,” according to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin “The successful demonstration of THAAD against an IRBM-range missile threat bolsters the country’s defensive capability against developing missile threats in North Korea and other countries around the globe and contributes to the broader strategic deterrence architecture,” MDA added. In March 2017, the U.S. military began deploying THAAD systems to South Korea. Among its otherwise rapidly expanding ballistic missile arsenal, the reclusive regime has at least two working IRBM types. The technical definition of this class of weapons specifies a maximum approximate range of at least 1,850 miles and no more than 3,420. The first is the BM-25 Musudan, also known as the Hwasong-10, which has an estimated range of approximately between 1,550 and 2,485 miles. The North Koreans first successfully tested that missile in June 2016 . The other is an elongated version of Hwasong-10, called the Hwasong-12, which experts believe can hit targets approximately 2,300 to 3,700 miles away. If accurate, that upper limit would actually place the weapon out of the IRBM category. North Korea demonstrated the Hwasong-12 in May 2017 , the same month the U.S. military declared the first THAAD elements operational in South Korea. Both the Hwasong-10 and -12 are road-mobile, making them harder for U.S. and South Korean forces to track. On July 4, 2017, North Korea also fired a longer range intercontinental ballistic missile (IBCM), known as the Hwasong-14, for the first time. A North Korean Hwasong-12 IRBM lifts off in a test in May 2017., AP Even after FTT-18, it is still not entirely clear how successful THAAD might be against a real IRBM threat. “Soldiers operating the equipment were not aware of the actual target launch time,” MDA’s statement noted. However, there was no indication of what other information, such as heading, flight envelope, or other factors, the personnel may have received before the test. The War Zone has previously reported on the THAAD’s potential difficulties in shooting down an incoming ballistic missile, especially in the cramped confines of the Korean Peninsula. Most importantly, the system may be deficient against missiles flying in extremely high apogee flight profiles, which North Korea has used in testing, but which would also likely be the flight envelope for an attack on targets in South Korea or Japan. There are also concerns about the AN/TPY-2 radar’s ability to track objects outside a narrow cone, as well as the limitations of other supporting sensors. You can find our analysis of these issues in greater depth, which we wrote ahead of the launch, here . It’s also worth noting that the U.S. Army had deployed a THAAD battery to Guam in 2013, specifically to counter the BM-25, more than three years ahead of the system’s first actual test against an IRBM target. Regardless of the results, MDA already has plans to continue testing. At present, the agency hopes to conduct the next THAAD experiment, FTT-15, sometime before the end of 2017. This launch will be focused purely on gathering data rather than intercepting a target missile, however. The Agency is planning to pit the system, along with the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and land-based Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, against another surrogate IRBM sometime between 2017 and 2018, as part of a test called Flight Test Operational-03 Event 2, or FTO-03 E2. Many, even within the U.S. government, say this test schedule is too slow, especially given the pace of North Korean ballistic missile developments. “We are not going fast. We are so risk-averse that we only test every 18 months,” U.S. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, told Stars and Stripes in an interview earlier July 2017. “The best way to build rockets, the best way to move fast, is to build it, test it, instrument it, learn from your failures,” So, it is entirely possible that, buoyed by this success, the Pentagon may add additional tests of THAAD or other systems to its plans in the coming months in order to find and fix potential problems and make sure they are truly ready in a crisis.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Marine Corps KC-130 Hercules aerial tanker has crashed in rural Mississippi. Local news coverage shows the plane as a totally destroyed burning hulk laying pancaked in a field. The mishap reportedly occurred sometime around 4:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) near Greenwood, Mississippi, along a stretch of Highway 82 that runs near the boundary between the state’s Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Initial reports were unclear as to who owned the aircraft, first identified only as a C-130 Hercules. The U.S. Marine Corps later confirmed on Twitter that one of its KC-130 aircraft was involved in the accident. The official Tweet did not include any details, stating that “further information will be released as available.” Later we found out that 16 souls were aboard the stricken aircraft and all perished in the crash. The service did not specify whether the plane was an older KC-130T or a new KC-130J model and it was not immediately apparent what variant was involved from photographs and video. The Marines use these aircraft for mid-air refueling, as well as basic cargo hauling duties. There is a also a roll-on/roll-off kit that can transform the newer KC-130J models into armed weapons and surveillance platforms, called Harvest Hawks . An early report indicated that the aircraft had originally taken off from Naval Support Activity Mid-South Base situated in Millington, Tennessee, but this is unlikely as the facility does not have an airfield. However, it is located near Millington Regional Jetport, which had been a Naval Reserve base until 1993. Mississippi officials had not apparently confirmed the aircraft’s point of origin as of around 7:00 PM CST, according to a story from local NBC affiliate WCNC . As casualty counts became more defined, and rose well beyond the few Marines rumored to have been killed shortly after the crash, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a post on Facebook: “Please join Deborah and me in praying for those hurting after this tragedy. Our men and women in uniform risk themselves every day to secure our freedom.” A USMC KC-130T lands in Afghanistan. These aircraft are capable of so many missions, including aerial refueling, but are maybe best known for their starring role as the Blue Angels’ “Fat Albert” transport plane. , AP Though the Marine Corps has not released any details, the aircraft may have suffered a “structural failure” at 20,000, Alan Hammons, an official with Mississippi’s Greenwood Airport, told local CBS affiliate WNCN . MSNewsNow , citing unnamed “investigators,” said the presence of debris on both sides of Highway 82 suggested a mid-air explosion. Who those individuals would have been is unclear, however, since the National Transportation Safety Board confirmed it was not involved since the aircraft was property of the U.S. military. Other reports state the aircraft may have suffered an explosion mid air before it fell to the ground. UPDATE: 9:25am PST- The USMC has confirmed that the aircraft that crashed was a KC-130T from VMGR-452 based out of Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. 15 Marines and one Navy Corpsman were onboard the aircraft when it went down and all perished. The aircraft’s flight originated from MCAS Cherry Point in North Carolina. The aircraft and its passengers and cargo were on their way to NAF El Centro in California . There was small arms ammunition and other light weapons onboard the aircraft when it crashed. The entire USMC statement can be found here .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 7, 2019","In a Blow to LCS, the US Navy Finally Admits it Needs a Real Frigate","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released the first formal requirements for a proposed new frigate design, which it is now referring to as Guided Missile Frigate Replacement Program or FFG(X). The plan leaves open the possibility the service will buy a clean-sheet design in lieu of an “up-gunned” variant of the much maligned Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Whatever happens, the new ships will finally include a robust area air defense capability. On July 10, 2017, the Navy released a request for information regarding the planned FFG(X) project, outlining a number of basic parameters and desired features. The service did not include any cost limits, but said prospective ship builders should include detailed estimates, as well as mitigating factors, for a fleet of up to 20 ships in notional 2020 dollars. Budgets permitting, beginning in the 2020 fiscal year, it could potentially buy one hull a year for two years, followed by two each year for the next nine years. The first mission of the final frigate design is to “fully support Combatant and Fleet Commanders during conflict by supplementing the fleet’s undersea and surface warfare capabilities, allow for independent operations in a contested environment, extend the fleet tactical grid, and host and control unmanned systems,” the overview noted. Second, it should “relieve large surface combatants from stressing routine duties during operations other than war.” In order to meet these mission requirements, there are 11 “desired” systems prospective vendors will want to assure make it into their proposals. The most important by far is the inclusion of an undefined “self defense launcher” in the final design. The Navy specifically said it was interested in available “trade space” for a system that could potentially launch the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2). The most obvious choice would be an array of Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cells somewhere on the ship. These can accommodate single SM-2s or quad-packed ESSMs. This would be a major capability upgrade over the existing LCS. Even the up-gunned LCS concept, also known as the Small Surface Combatant (SSC), lacked any real air defense capability, making it effectively a sitting duck in almost any real combat scenario, despite adding $70 million to the ship’s price tag. A model of the “up-gunned” Freedom -class LCS, showing both VLS and deck-mounted missile launchers., Joseph Trevithick In March 2017, as part of a series of recommendations for how the Pentagon might reorganize its naval modernization priorities, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway highlighted this issue, writing : This specific capability would come in the form of a vertical launch system (VLS) capable of firing RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles . This feature alone, paired with the proper radar and combat system upgrades needed for targeting, would allow these ships to operate independently of multi-billion dollar and already over taxed Aegis-equipped cruisers and destroyers in medium and even high-threat environments. This way the frigate could not only do anything the LCS can do, but it can also take the pressure off America’s most capable and expensive surface combatants for many missions, like convoy escort duties and protecting key elements that support the sea basing concept. Beyond being far more versatile and able to operate much more independently than the standard LCS, this ship will be able to confront the growing anti-ship missile threat, one that it is rapidly proliferating among non-state actors . It will also feature other improvements, like the ability to fire medium-range land-attack and anti-ship missiles. The current LCS configuration—a giant jet boat meant to supposedly fight in the littorals where the anti-ship missile threat is most unpredictable—simply will not do. And that is not to mention the baseline LCS’s many other design and conceptual deficiencies and failures. The other 10 desirable systems for the notional FFG(X) include the COMBATSS-21 battle management system, a three-face fixed array Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), the SLQ-32(V)6 electronic warfare suite, two four-round canisters with over-the-horizon anti-ship missiles, a SeaRAM self-defense system, the Mk 53 Nulka anti-missile decoy system, and more. There should be space on each FFG(X) for at least one MH-60R multi-mission helicopter, as well as an MQ-8C Fire Scout drone or similarly-sized unmanned aircraft, too. A prototype MQ-8C Fire Scout drone during tests about the Independence -class LCS USS Montgomery ., USN Lockheed Martin’s COMBATSS-21 leverages components from the larger and more capable Aegis system found on Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and Ticonderoga -class cruisers. Raytheon’s EASR shares features with the radar the Navy will install on the future Ford -class aircraft carriers. It’s an eminently scalable system made up of a number of self-contained radars each inside a two square foot container. A full system can have any number of these individual, electronically scanned units, each able to perform individual functions or operate linked together to focus their combined energy on a single task, a concept that the video below explains in more depth. The EASR on the FFG(X) will have a three-by-three-by-three arrangement with three panels each with nine of the smaller radars each. Using a VLS array for the self defense launcher requirement could have the potential to supplement or even replace the containerized anti-ship missile requirement, too. The Navy’s request specifically asks for vendors to mention if they can include “strike length” cells in the self defense launcher. The service is already separately looking to purchase this over-the-horizon weapon, which could be either containerized or vertically-launched. At present, however, the service’s existing requirements are so narrow that both Boeing and Lockheed Martin have withdrawn their submissions, suggesting certain advantages in their products wouldn’t be taken into consideration. This has left a partnership between American defense contractor Raytheon and Norwegian firm Kongsberg, offering a version of the latter’s Naval Strike Missile (NSM) , as the only major team still taking part in the competition. The existing versions of the NSM are container launched. A model of the Kongsberg-Raytheon NSM., Joseph Trevithick On top of all that, there is an entire second tier of equipment that would add even more functionality. There 14 systems in this category, such as AN/SLQ-61 Light Weight Tow (LWT) and AN/SLQ-62 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) linked together with the centerpiece AN/SQQ-89F underwater warfare system, the Mk 110 57mm gun with the Advanced Low Cost Munition Ordnance (ALaMO) projectile, Longbow Hellfire capability, and other radars and sensors. In February 2017, the Navy demonstrated the vertically-launched Hellfire module onboard the Freedom -class LCS USS Detroit . Still in development, the Navy hopes ALaMO will give the Mk 110 gun the ability to better take on unmanned aerial vehicles and swarms of small boats. Together, these systems would address many of the existing LCS’s deficiencies, which prevent them from independently operating in even low-threat environments at present. Equipped for its main functions, the new FFG(X) would be able to seamlessly integrate into larger task groups, including aircraft carrier strike groups and amphibious expeditionary strike groups, as well as provide escort for logistics convoys and other formations. The ships should have weapons and equipment that complement and enhance the existing anti-ship, air defense, and electronic warfare capabilities of those groupings. As an independent surface combatant, the frigates would be able to operate in low to medium threat environments, hunting submarines and taking on other surface ships under certain conditions, as well as performing less intensive security cooperation and humanitarian assistance missions as necessary. The second tier of possible equipment includes provisions for two rigid hull inflatable boats, which could help the ship support anti-smuggling and special operations support missions, as well. The USS Independence. , USN There is no word yet on whether the new FFG(X) will have additional armor compared to the existing LCS, which has been another major issue, but it likely will. Even the proposed “up-gunned” LCS derivatives featured more armor in critical areas. On October 2016, Yemeni rebels effectively destroyed the ex-USNS Swift , an aluminum hulled catamaran vessel with a hull similar in construction to both LCS variants, with a shore-launched anti-ship cruise missile. “Grade A shock hardening for propulsion, critical systems, and combat system elements to retain full air defense and propulsion capabilities,” was the only vulnerability requirement outlined for the future frigates in the Navy’s request for information. The USS Freedom ., USN Notably, the Navy did not specify a minimum or maximum displacement for the final ship design, either empty or with a full load and its complement of no more than 200 sailors. With full loads and maximum crews of less than 100 individuals, the existing mostly aluminum Independence -class LCS displaces approximately 3,100 tons, while the steel-hulled Freedom -class variant displaces 3,500 tons. Modern warships classified as frigates have a wide range of displacements, but generally no more than 7,500 tons on the extreme end. The FFG(X) should be able to travel at least 3,000 miles at a cruising speed of at least 16 knots, while being able to sustain a speed of least 28 knots during combat. “This is an effort to get the design right up front,” Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall, the service’s director of surface warfare, said in an interview with Defense News. “We’re looking to have a dialogue with industry to get the most capability for the best price.” This all leaves open the possibility for contractors to offer ships that do not use one of the two existing LCS hull forms. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the Navy will buy an all-new ship. On possibility would be the Ingalls Patrol Frigate concept , which is based on the U.S. Coast Guard’s already in production Legend -class National Security Cutter. Another option would be to simply join with Saudi Arabia’s planned purchase of a much improved derivative of Lockheed Martin’s Freedom -class LCS known as the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC). This design has many of the features the Navy is asking for in its FFG(X) request for information, such an improved radar array, the COMBATSS-21, a 16-cell Mk 41 VLS and containerized Harpoon launchers, as well as a much more capable 76mm main gun. The Kingdom is already on track to buy four of the vessels for $6 billion and the design will likely be ready to go into production within the Navy’s FFG(X) timeline thanks to the continued interest in Riyadh. Above all else, the Saudis would have paid for all, or at least a large portion of its development cost. https://youtube.com/watch?v=09PFcj3m6Fo Foreign options also exist that can be adapted to the Navy’s FFG(X) requirements. But buying a foreign design, even one modified to accommodate US systems and to adhere to other requirements, as well as being built domestically—is somewhat unlikely. However, the Navy’s does leave open the possibility it will continue to push ahead with yet another variant of the SSC concept. “A competition for FFG(X) is envisioned to consider existing parent designs for a Small Surface Combatant that can be modified to accommodate the specific capability requirements prescribed by the US Navy,” the new request for information explains right up front. Lockheed has already proposed a frigate variant of its Freedom -class LCS that is a less substantial upgrade than the MMSC, but still provides many of the Navy’s desired features. Of course, there’s still time for the service to refine and clarify these requirements, especially based on the responses they get from shipbuilders. A request for information is just that, rather than a fixed plan to buy a system. Still, the request is a clear admission from the Navy that despite more than a decade of struggling with LCS, it finally understands it needs a real frigate, and one with robust air defense capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Sikorsky Gathering Data To Expand SB>1 Defiant’s Flight Envelope In Additional Test Flights (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing and Sikorsky are gathering more propulsion system data on the ground to support further flight testing of their SB>1 Defiant advanced compound helicopter. After three successful flight tests, starting with the helicopter’s first flight in March 2019 , the two firms are making tweaks to expand the helicopter’s flight envelope. Update: This story has been significantly updated from the original. See details at the bottom of this story. Chris Van Buiten, Vice President of Innovation at Sikorsky, which is now a division of Lockheed Martin, offered the update on the Defiant’s flight test plan during a media event at the company’s flight test facility in West Palm Beach, Florida, on June 24, 2019 . Boeing and Sikorsky have been working together on the SB>1 as part of the U.S. Army’s Joint Multi-Role (JMR) advanced technology demonstration program and the two companies are proposing the design for the follow-on Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program, which The War Zone has previously covered in detail here . FLRAA is part of the over-arching Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, which is seeking replacements for all of the Army’s existing helicopters. “We’re going through a tweak right now and the PSTB [propulsion system test bed] is running with some modifications and we’re about to restart the flight tests and, you know, we hope to march right through the speed points and you know, you’ve seen it in the past,” Van Buiten said . “We moved the speed out [in] 20-, 40-knot increments.” The goal is for the Defiant to eventually demonstrate a cruising speed of 250 knots, substantially faster than traditional helicopters in the same general weight class, such as the Army’s existing UH-60 Black Hawks . The SB>1 uses a compound helicopter configuration with a pair of co-axial main rotor blades on top, as well as a pusher propeller in the rear, to achieve this high-speed flight. The design is based on lessons learned from the similarly configured Sikorsky’s X2 demonstrator and S-97 Raider compound helicopters. The S-97 has a demonstrated speeds up 220 knots, though it is significantly smaller than the SB>1. Earlier this year, The War Zone conducted an in-depth interview with a number of Sikorsky representatives, including Van Buiten, discussing all three of these helicopters in detail, which you can find here . The video below shows the S-97 putting on an impressive performance at the recent media event in Florida. During the first two tests in March and April 2019, “the team proved out the expected speed for these tests: 10 knots forward, left, right and rearward,” Van Buiten told reporters . “It also proved out hover performance maneuverability, pedal turns, and a hover ladder from ground level up to 30 feet altitude.” Bell’s V-280 Valor tilt-rotor, the other aircraft flying in the JMR technology demonstration, which is also set to be an FLRAA competitor, has been flying since December 2017 and has already demonstrated speeds in excess of 280 knots. A chart showing the evolution of Sikorsky’s advanced compound helicopters leading to the  SB>1., Lockheed Martin “In advance of envelope expansion, as planned, we are first increasing the power levels on our PSTB,” Melissa Chadwick, a Sikorsky spokesperson, told The War Zone in an Email. “We remain consistent with our development process, testing out these higher power loads on our PSTB before conducting additional maneuvers in flight. Upon successful PSTB endurance envelop expansion, we expect to be positioned to quickly expand the aircraft flight envelope later this summer.” Boeing and Sikorsky had hoped the first flight would occur in December 2018, already a year behind schedule, but pushed that date back again after coming across unspecified issues during earlier testing of the PSTB. Sikorsky has underscored that the use of the PSTB to gather additional data, in this case, does not reflect a new delay in the flight test schedule. The SB>1 Defiant during its first flight., Sikorsky “Over the summer of 2019 we expect to expand the envelope in flight tests with additional speed and maneuverability and provide the U.S. Army with the necessary, robust, and relevant data in a timely manner that will enable them to make fully informed decisions as they pursue the Future Vertical Lift program,” Van Buiten explained at the media event. The JMR program is set to end this year . The Army is already moving ahead with the follow-on FLRAA and is looking to pick a final design in 2021. The Army’s goal, as it stands now, is to begin replacing its UH-60 Black Hawks with whatever aircraft it picks by 2030. Author’s note: This story is significantly different from how it originally appeared, which framed the new developments as a possible delay given past issues with the SB>1 Defiant’s drivetrain. After publication, Sikorsky reached out to offer substantial clarifications about the test schedule and the pre-planned nature of ground-based testing using the PSTB, as is now reflected in the story above.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 4, 2019",US Preps for THAAD Missile Test Against IRBM As North Korean Threat Rises,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) says it will conduct another flight test of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system sometime in July 2017. Though planned long in advance , the experiment has taken on a new urgency after North Korea conducted the first successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could potentially reach the state of Alaska on July 4, 2017, not to mention the successful firing of a intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) back in April 2017 . On July 7, 2017, MDA confirmed it would fire a THAAD interceptor from the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska in Kodiak, Alaska at an unspecified target by the end of the month. The test, known as Flight Test THAAD-18 or FTT-18, Chris Johnson, an MDA spokesman, told multiple news outlets that the agency would not release the time or date of the test beforehand and offered few details about the upcoming event. However, in a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee’s Strategic Forces Subcommittee on June 7, 2017, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral James Syring, then head of MDA, offered considerably more information. “In FTT-18 THAAD will demonstrate an intercept of a separating IRBM target using the THAAD radar, launcher, fire control and communication, interceptor operations and engagement operations,” he explained. IRBM stands for intermediate-range ballistic missile, a type of weapon that North Korea had already successfully demonstrated by that time. With a operational IRBM, which technically would have a range of between approximately 1,850 to 3,420 miles, North Korean forces could reach targets anywhere in South Korea, Japan, or even the American island of Guam, home to significant U.S. military facilities, with these potentially nuclear-capable missiles. MDA According to Syring’s testimony, by the end of 2017, MDA also plans to conduct an endo-atmospheric test of a THAAD interceptor against a mock medium-range ballistic missile – defined as having range a range of between 620 and 1,860 miles – as well as “associated objects,” possibly simulated decoys. This experiment, FTT-15, is only intended to gather data. By the end of 2018, the agency hopes to have completed yet another test involving THAAD, in cooperation with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, against a surrogate IRBM. This proposed flight is known as Flight Test Operational-03 Event 2, or FTO-03 E2. THAAD has had a long and often troublesome development since the 1990s and these continued tests are critical, since successful employment of the system is a complicated proposition even if the system works perfectly. The entire process relies primarily on the trailer-mounted AN/TPY-2 X-band radar to track a re-entry vehicle falling at potentially hypersonic speeds towards its target so the interceptor can blast it out the sky. This is best described as trying to hit a bullet with another bullet. Lockheed Martin THAAD has a number of potential limitations, as we at The War Zone noted when the system first appeared in South Korea in March 2017: For the interceptors to be truly effective, commanders have to position the launchers near potential targets, along likely flight paths, pointed opposite where the warheads might fall. Based on publicly available information , the weapon can only pinpoint and fire at targets in an 120-degree cone and over a finite range. Not just that, but THAAD has not been thoroughly tested or lacks engagement capability against targets that fly extreme apogee flight profiles, a tactic North Korea could use to hit targets in Seoul and military bases not too far south of the DMZ. Even if the battery is situated properly, that might not be enough. The single THAAD battery in South Korea has just two launchers, each with eight interceptors at the ready. In any realistic future attack scenario, North Korea would launch dozens of missiles or more at targets across the southern portion of the peninsula and potentially beyond , using both road-mobile weapons , and in the not so distant future, even ballistic missiles launched by submarines . Those submarines will also likely voyage outside of THAAD’s engagement envelope before launch. Both of these launch methods are very hard to track, often alerting U.S. early warning satellites only as the missiles take flight, leaving little time for missile defenders to reorient themselves towards the threat. American and allied forces would need dozens of launchers and a constantly active constellation of space, surface and ground-based sensors spread across East Asia to have a reasonable chance at not getting overwhelmed by the ensuing barrage. In May 2017, the U.S. military declared that the initial system in South Korea was operational . Since then, South Korea’s new President Moon Jae-in has halted the deployment of additional interceptors pending an environmental review. The U.S. military has additional THAAD interceptors and at least one AN/TPY-2 radar on Guam . The United States and its allies, most notably the United Arab Emirates, have placed or plan to emplace various components of the system in the Middle East, too. The U.S. Army has its own AN/TPY-2 radars, but no THAAD interceptors, at sites in Turkey and Israel . Of course, THAAD is just one component of the U.S. military’s layered ballistic missile defense apparatus. Unfortunately, the other components are similarly in need of additional tests and refinements. In May 2017, MDA concluded the first test of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system against an ICBM-class target, which was apparently successful. However, there was limited information about the exact parameters of the experiment, making it difficult to judge the results conclusively. Regardless, U.S. officials will have to repeat the feat multiple times before anyone could reasonably conclude the system is reliable. MDA expects the next GMD flight test will come in the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. Then in June 2017, there was a setback as a Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile failed to destroy a mock MRBM in a test over the Pacific Ocean. The first intercept attempt in February 2016 had been successful. The mid-course intercept SM-3 Block IIA and other parts of the Aegis BMD system, fill the range and capability gaps between the terminal phase intercept Patriot and THAAD systems and the mid-course intercept GMD. Though intended primarily to defeat IRBM and MRBM-class weapons, SM-3 Block IIA may be able to knock down ICBMs under certain conditions.  If all goes according to plan, Aegis radar-equipped warships such as the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and land-based configurations, known as Aegis Ashore, will ultimately be capable of employing these interceptors. At present, the only Aegis Ashore sites are in Europe, but Japan is looking to field the concept in light for North Korea’s expanding missile arsenal. Critics of the U.S. military’s missile defense plans cite these spotty track records and drawn-out test schedules as evidence of the overall concept’s inherent problems. The added difficulty of differentiating real warheads from metallic balloons and other decoys has only underscored these concerns. Additionally, broad coverage systems, like ground-based interceptors, rely on a rickety constellation of space , ground and sea-based sensors and communications nodes in order to just begin an engagement sequence. It’s far from clear if testing of any component America’s ballistic missile defense scheme has replicated real-world conditions, where the whole system isn’t primed for an intercept, and usually looking in the right direction to make it happen. Suffice to say, the idea that the U.S. has a reliable missile shield is fantastically optimistic at best. “It’s at least as good as a coin toss,” Henry “Trey” Obering, a retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General and former head of MDA, who now works on directed energy issues for Booz Allen Hamilton , told The Financial Times in July 2017. Still, the U.S. military contends that these issues just show a need to speed the process up, fund additional research and development, and accept more failures on the path to eventual success, especially in light of rapid ballistic missile advancements in potentially hostile countries, such as North Korea. North Korean premier “Kim Jong Un has gone very fast, and we have to step up and go fast in response,” U.S. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, told Stars and Stripes in July 2017. “We are not going fast. We are so risk-averse that we only test every 18 months.” In 2017 alone, North Korea has tested at least a dozen ballistic missiles of various types, including successful launches of four heretofore unseen types , one of which was the Hwasong-14 ICBM and another the Hwason-12 IRBM. There were other notable tests of the solid-fueled KN-15 MRBM , and an improved Scud-type SRBM with what appeared to be a maneuverable re-entry vehicle . North Korea has begun using very steep parabolic flight profiles for its longer-ranged missile tests, too. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PK2YS02-jc0 “We’ve seen things like, ‘He launches and fails, launches and fails. He [Kim] is a fool. He doesn’t know what he is doing,’” he continued in the interview. “No, that is actually the way you build rockets. The best way to build rockets, the best way to move fast, is to build it, test it, instrument it, learn from your failures.” Hyten’s complaints echoed similar comments Vice Admiral Syring had made in June 2017. “I would not say we are comfortably ahead of the threat, I would say we are addressing the threat that we know today,” Syring told the assembled American legislators. “It is incumbent upon us to assume that North Korea today can range the Unites States with an ICBM carrying a nuclear warhead. Everything we are doing plans for that contingency.” Of course, North Korea has the benefit of being an insular dictatorship that can continue development of missiles regardless of cost or failures, even to the detriment of its own people. The United States is a democracy beholden to its people and has an active free press willing to criticize defense spending priorities. As such, the U.S. military will always be more concerned about the optics of failed tests, even if they provide vital data that ultimately helps make missile defense systems such as THAAD viable. On top of that, unable to keep things as hidden away as a repressive totalitarian government, American officials know that repeated failures, whatever the results, can only feed into North Korea’s often belligerent propaganda . A THAAD launcher arrives in South Korea in March 2017., USAF But U.S. lawmakers would appear to agree that more tests are worth the risk, and did so before North Korea’s latest missile test , with both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees looking to add significant amounts of funding for missile defense into the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year. In June 2017, Representative Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republic and head of the House Armed Services Committee, had said he was “ astonished ” by how little money President Donald Trump’s administration had allocated for these programs in their initial proposal. Before that, in May 2017, a bi-partisan group of Senators had introduced the Advancing America’s Missile Defense Act of 2017 , which, if passed into law, would promote continued development and expansion of the U.S. missile defense shield and calling for expanded purchases of interceptors, radars, and other systems. Perhaps most importantly, there have been renewed calls for a long-stalled GMD site somewhere on the east coast of the United States. At present, there are only GMD interceptors situated in Alaska and California. MDA is also considering adding an all-new layer to the missile defense scheme in the form of drones armed with lasers to destroy missiles during their initial boost phase. In 2011, the Pentagon had canceled a previous boost phase intercept program centered on a modified Boeing 747 airliner with a massive turreted laser. Congress is still in the process of finalizing the annual National Defense Authorization Act, but it seems likely that these missile defense additions will remain in place given North Korea’s recent activities. There’s also the real possibility we may begin to see more active testing of those systems, whether they’re ready or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2019",We May Finally Know What JADE HELM Has Stood For All Along,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two years after the U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Jade Helm training exercise inflamed conspiracy theorists , prompted Texas to order its state guard to monitor federal troops, and otherwise became a national news story, the latest iteration of the event has come and gone with little acknowledgement of any kind from the U.S. government or the public. And yet, the U.S. military has still found a way to make it weird, including the suggestion that Jade Helm is actually a very long acronym. Jade Helm 2017 reportedly occurred, at least in part, between May 2 and 5, 2017, according to one official U.S. Air Force news item . The story explains how the service supplied C-130J and C-17 airlifters to help move and airdrop at least 40 personnel and more than 120,000 pounds of cargo in support of the practice session. The crews flew some of the missions to and from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and Joint Base Charleston in South Carolina. None of this sounds out of the ordinary for a training exercise within the United States, especially given that the 2015 version of Jade Helm involved separate events in multiple states designed to simulate various so-called irregular and unconventional warfare scenarios throughout a fictional region containing friendly, enemy, and neutral “countries.” Irregular warfare is essentially another term for guerrilla warfare, relying on indirect actions to win the support of a specific population. Unconventional warfare is the U.S. military’s broad term for working with local forces to resist an occupying force, undermine a hostile government, or just support conventional military activities. These are core missions for American special operations forces and are common subjects for training exercises. In February 2017, American special operators joined their colleagues from the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to stage a mock guerrilla war in West Virginia called Ridge Runner 2017. But then things get a little odd. There only appears to be one official news story on this exercise at all and it’s available on the website of Air Mobility Command’s Eighteenth Air Force, situated at Joint Base Charleston. At the time of writing, a google shows that there were more than a half dozen more copies on other Air Force pages, as well as number of photographs. For some reason, someone appears to have taken these offline or otherwise broken all the links. Using Google to search the Defense Video Imagery Distribution System , which is the main U.S. military’s public affairs hub, brings up more broken links . Amusingly, the only place on the web that seems to have the bulk of the public domain pictures from Jade Helm 2017 is stock photo site Alamy , which has them available for purchase. One of the official Jade Helm 2017 images, showing a Humvee backing onto a C-130J airlifter, which was mirrored on another website., USAF Oh, and unless there’s been some sort of mistake, JADE HELM actually stands for the amazingly obtuse Joint Assistance for Deployment Execution Homeland Eradication of Local Militants. A separate web search for this phrase does not turn up any other results. These are exactly the sort of vagaries that provide space for conspiracy theories. In particular, the phrase “Homeland Eradication of Local Militants,” the official meaning of which no one ever explains in the Air Force story, sounds almost engineered to provoke the same concerns from same communities that came up surrounding the 2015 exercise. The leaked map of the Jade Helm 2015 operating areas that touched off a number of conspiracy theories., SOCOM For those who don’t know – or have thankfully forgotten – that training exercise prompted a laundry-list of conspiracy theories, including a particularly complex idea that the United Nations was mobilizing a Chinese military force to sneaking into Texas from Mexico via tunnels leading into abandoned Walmart stores. No, really . At the height of the public interest in the exercise, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, wrote this : I can’t deny that Operation Jade Helm sets up a ripe canvas for which conspiracy theorists can paint their biggest nightmare scenarios. In reality, it is just another exercise in a never ending list of DoD and homeland security drills that deal with everything from huge earthquakes and multi-national air wars to counter-terrorism offensives and zombie infestations . Yet even the Texas Governor’s office is getting on the conspiracy theory bandwagon to some extent, commanding the volunteer reservists of the Texas State Guard to keep close tabs on the exercise as some constituents are demanding. While at War Is Boring, I followed up on this monitoring mission, finding that the State Guard had done the absolute bare minimum to keep tabs on the situation. Thanks to the Texas State Public Information Act I obtained a transcript of a series of almost hilariously banal text messages between Texas State Guard commander Brigadier General Gerald “Jake” Betty and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Pawlak, a U.S. Army Special Forces officer with the thankless job of acting as the main spokesman for the exercise as it increasingly became a public relations nightmare. Pawlak even held a number of town hall style meetings with local groups in an attempt to allay fears that had gotten a certain legitimacy not only because of the actions of Texas Governor Greg Abbot , but also thanks to comments from Texas Senator Ted Cruz and notable celebrities, including Chuck Norris . U.S. Army special operators train in 2013., US Army Just as in 2015, there is absolutely nothing to suggest the latest Jade Helm exercise is actually in any way a cover for something nefarious. These types of training exercises are common and routine. However, as in this case, the haphazard way in which information about them is released or otherwise communicated to the public, also seems to be an unfortunate, but regular occurrence. In 2008, residents of Portland, Oregon were disconcerted to see special operators in helicopters over head, with an alert about the training exercise only going out to the general public an hour ahead of time. Media attention subsequently became so intense that the organizers had to move whole event to another area entirely. Similar incidents occurred in Miami, Florida and Galveston and Houston, Texas in 2012. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9fkRSUWhEZs The biggest part of the problem seems to be the delegation of authority for informing the public at large. As a rule, SOCOM doesn’t put out public missives itself about what’s going on so as not to encroach on local authorities. It’s also designed to help protect their tactics and procedures from unwanted attention, as happened in Portland in 2008. “We try to protect most of our tactics, techniques and procedures for operational security reasons,” SOCOM spokesman Ken McGraw told me in an Email in January 2017. “USSOCOM units do provide information to the media concerning Realistic Military Training.  The information is usually released by the local law enforcement organization that is working with the USSOCOM unit.  The information is generally released for general public awareness or public safety reasons . USSOCOM units generally comply with the advice of local officials or law enforcement when to release information and what information to release.” SOCOM via FOIA I had inquired as to the procedure after obtaining the two official notices regarding the 2012 practice sessions in Florida and Texas. In both cases, censors redacted the list of individuals who had been briefed on the events, referred to simply as “Realistic Urban Training” or RUT. At the bottom of both notices, which give a basic overview of what locals could expect to see and hear, there is a boilerplate line, with emphasis added, reading “We request this information NOT be released to the press.” A special operations sniper moves into position during a competition in 2012., US Army Of course, as Pawlak’s town halls show, sometimes things require military spokespersons to go out and clarify things. Unfortunately, this seems to occur mainly when relations with the public have already been strained by poor communication on the part of state or local officials, many of whom have likely been in the know the whole time. They have to be for safety reasons. It otherwise seems that when these exercises go off without a hitch, you don’t even hear about them until months after the fact. All in all, it seems like a system that could do with some improvement, whether it be a standardized mechanism for alerting the public or a more clearly defined chain of responsibility for doing so. Until then, it seems like that these otherwise benign training events will continue to be a regular source of consternation. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 5, 2020","After Friendly Chit Chat, Trump and Putin Cut Syrian Ceasefire Deal","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States and Russia plan to implement a ceasefire in southwestern Syria following talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Depending on the exact terms of the deal, it could usher in a new stage in the Syrian conflict . On July 7, 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Dmitri Lavrov both independently announced the plan, which is set to go into effect on July 9, 2017. The final terms were part of a wide-ranging discussion between Trump and Putin, originally scheduled to last between 30 and 40 minutes, but which went on for more than two hours. â€œIt is (a) well defined agreement on who will secure this area,â€ Tillerson told reporters afterwards , noting that there were still details left to negotiate and that the final deal would come within a week . Lavrov said that the halt in the fighting will cover the Syrian governorates of Daraa, Quneitra, and Suwayda, while Tillerson simply described the area a â€œvery complicated part of the Syrian battlefieldâ€ integral to the territorial security of Syriaâ€™s neighbor Jordan. All three governorates border Jordan, which is a key member of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, as well as being home to a number of American military facilities and other shared government sites. The Hashemite Kingdom also hosts to significant number of Syrian refugees and has been a key part of diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict. During the lengthy meeting, Trump and Putin and their respective teams reportedly talked through a host of issues, including Russiaâ€™s involvement in Ukraineâ€™s simmering civil conflict and the Kremlinâ€™s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election . In addition to the Syria plan, the two declared their intention to open a channel on Ukraine, set up a shared cybersecurity working group, and appoint new ambassadors. AP â€œWe’ve had a very long discussion with the U.S. president,â€ Putin told reporters after emerging from the session, according to RT . â€œMany issues accrued, including Ukraine, Syria, and other problems, as well as some bilateral issues.â€ WATCH: Putin, clearly prepared for the meeting, gestures to journalists and says ""these are the ones hurting you?"" pic.twitter.com/ujg4WK7Egs — Yashar Ali ğŸ˜ (@yashar) July 7, 2017 The meeting had begun earlier in the morning after the two leaders shared amicable chit chat during a brief photo op for the press. Trump, well known for his overly aggressive hand shake, offered his hand to Putin in a much more relaxed gesture. At one point, Putin leaned in and said either â€œthese are the ones who insulted you?â€ or “these are the ones hurting you?”, pointing directly to the assembled members of the press, after which both men made some additional comments and laughed. Trump has repeatedly accused the American media of being unusually unfair to his administration and himself personally, despite evidence to the contrary . Many believe that Putin is responsible, at least indirectly, for the murder of a number of journalists . But the ceasefire agreement in particular would be a significant achievement for both men, who have both suggested on numerous occasions , that the United States and Russia might be able to work together to resolve the brutal Syrian civil war, which has raged since 2011, and the final status of dictator Bashar Al Assad.Â The fighting has prompted the rise of a number of terrorist factions, most notably ISIS, and involved a host of regional and international actors, many of whom appear to have wildly differing agendas. The United States and Russia both insist that they are not seeking to fight each other in Syria and that their respective military contingents are battling terrorists. In Germany, Tillerson also reiterated the U.S. government’s long-standing position that Assad would need to ultimately leave power, something the Russians are unlikely to support in the near- or long-term. The War Zone has reported many times , in detail about the exact nature of these complex issues . Russian military trucks, one with a banner showing Putin and Assad, carrying humanitarian aid to the city of Aleppo in February 2017., AP Though there are few details released yet as to the terms, it seems likely the plan will follow on from earlier Russian-sponsored plans for â€œ de-escalation zones ,” which also have the backing of Iran and Turkey. First announced in May 2017, Moscow’s proposal also called for ceasefires in portions of Daraa, Quneitra, and Suwayda governorates, but did not cover the contested Golan Heights area bordering Israel to the west. However, when Russia and its partners met in Kazakhstanâ€™s capital Astana earlier in 2017 to discuss the final implementation of these ceasefire zones, they failed to reach a definitive agreement. At the same time , the Syrian government unilaterally declared a ceasefire in the southwestern corner of the country, which is due to expire right before the U.S.-Russia proposal would take effect. A map of de-escalation zones that Russia first announced in May 2017, including a buffer along the Syrian border with Israel., Russian MoD There was already evidence of the deal before the meeting, as well. â€œThe United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on the ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,â€ Tillerson had previously said in a statement ahead of the G20 summit on July 5, 2017. â€œIf our two countries work together to establish stability on the ground, it will lay a foundation for progress on the settlement of Syria’s political future.â€ Israeli troops patrol near the Syrian border after a brief skirmish in September 2016., AP On top of that, Trump and Putinâ€™s arrangement also reportedly has the support of authorities in Israel and Jordan, who have been especially concerned about the Syrian civil war spilling over into their territory or otherwise inflaming regional tensions. In June 2017, there were reports that Brett McGurk, a former American diplomat now working as the U.S. special envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, and U.S. envoy to Syria Michael Ratney had been secretly holding three-way discussions between Russia, Israel, and Jordan about a possible way forward on the crisis. Highlighting the especially complicated nature of the situation, Israeli and Syrian officials have exchanged increasingly bellicose rhetoric in recent years as Israelâ€™s military continues to attack arms shipments bound for Lebanese Hezbollah terrorists fighting on behalf the regime in Damascus. More recently, the fluid nature of the fighting led to an actual skirmish between the countries along their disputed border in the Golan Heights. A similar incident occurred in September 2016. Officials in Tehran have been supporting Hezbollah and other militia groups in Syria, as well. For its part, Israel has stressed it cannot accept an Iranian or Iranian-backed presence along the border, in general. As such, a U.S.-Russia plan that creates a buffer in this tense tri-border area would likely be the only option acceptable to the government in Jerusalem. Still, itâ€™s not entirely clear how well a Russian-guaranteed ceasefire would be able to control other factions supportive of Assad. A ballistic missile takes center stage at an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ rally in support of the Palestinians in Tehran in June 2017., AP â€œThe United States believes Russia, as a guarantor of the Assad regime and an early entrant into the Syrian conflict, has a responsibility to ensure that the needs of the Syrian people are met and that no faction in Syria illegitimately re-takes or occupies areas liberated from ISIS’ or other terrorist groups’ control,â€ Tillerson had added in his earlier statement â€œRussia also has an obligation to prevent any further use of chemical weapons of any kind by the Assad regime.â€ However, the wealth of existing evidence shows that Russia is either disinterested or incapable of exerting any meaningful control over either the Syrian regime or its Iranian allies, including the use of chemical weapons. In June 2017, American fighter jets shot down two Iranian Shahed 129 drones that attacked U.S.-supported rebel forces near At Tanf close to the border with Iraq, as well as a Syrian Arab Air Force Su-22 Fitter attack aircraft that was attacking similar groups much further north near the strategic Tabqa Dam . A view of the Syrian city of Zabadani, outside of the capital Damascus, in the southwestern portion of the country., AP In all three cases, U.S. military commanders in the region attempted to use a hotline with their Russian counterparts to call off the attacks and de-escalate the situation, without success. Similar attempts to use this communications channel to get Iranian-backed militias to stand down from advancing on the At Tanf garrison also had no appreciable impact on the situation. Beyond that, the Kremlinâ€™s forces in Syria aren’t shy about providing an effective shield against foreign action for Syrian government troops and their allies. â€œI think this is our first indication of the U.S. and Russia being able to work together in Syria,â€ Tillerson seemed to tacitly confirm after the July 7 meeting at the G20 summit. â€œAs a result of that we had a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria that we can continue to work together on to de-escalate the areas.â€ Weâ€™ll just have to wait for more information to better analyze the ceasefireâ€™s actual goals, as well as how well it ultimately lives up to expectations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018","The USAF Tested an Advanced, Modular Sensor Pod on a Vintage Airliner","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is testing a state-of-the-art sensor package, called AgilePod, which it hopes will ultimately offer all-new capabilities for surveillance aircraft and drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper . But the service picked a decidedly less advanced platform for the initial flight tests, the venerable Douglas DC-3. In June 2017, the Blue Guardian Program, part of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Sensors Directorate, revealed that it had sent a prototype AgilePod – which is a registered U.S. government trademark by the way – aloft on a contractor’s DC-3 ahead of plans to install it on an MQ-9. As such, they had dubbed the experiments Project Harvest Reaper. “AgilePod is a game-changer,” Air Force Captain Russell Shirey, the Blue Guardian Program Manager, declared to the service’s reporters. “Current sensor capabilities on aircraft are built for specific mission tasks, such as close air support or targeting, using proprietary software and hardware. Open system architecture standards combined with a single AgilePod having ‘plug-and-play’ capabilities and configurations enables one pod to perform hundreds of different mission sets.” In short, the “Lego-like” unit is more of a shell than a system unto itself. It has the space and linkages to accommodate a variety of sensors and connect them to the aircraft. The pod is made of between three and five sections, each 30 inches wide and 30 inches tall, plus two aerodynamic end caps. The individual blocks can be either 28 or 33 inches long to accommodate different systems, giving it an overall length of between seven and 15 feet depending on the total number of sections. The experimental AgilePod under Airborne Imaging’s DC-3., USAF Designed for relatively small aircraft like the Reaper, using Airborne Imaging ’s DC-3 seems to have simply been a matter of both convenience and practicality. The Texas-based firm has supported various U.S. military projects in the past. The Defense Intelligence Agency is known to have tested its Shadow Harvest multi-sensor system – which has no obvious relationship to the Harvest Reaper or AgilePod programs – using a DC-3, as well. “The ability to rapidly test multiple configurations on the DC-3 aircraft gives us a ‘Lab-In-The-Sky’ concept and allows our team to wring out any issues before we move forward to the unmanned MQ-9, where we will not have the luxury of engineers in the cockpit,” Shirey added. In its final form, AgilePod could conceivably carry various types of still and full-motion video cameras able to collect imagery during the day and at night, as well as signal detecting or communications listening equipment, and other electronic intelligence hardware, at once. Many of these systems have an inherent dual use when paired with jammers or other electronic warfare tools, too, opening up the possibility for even more functionality. The pod itself attaches to a pylon or other hardpoint using standardized lugs. “Common connections and standards allows a greater suite of sensors to be rapidly integrated on the pod, enabling new capabilities,” the Blue Guardian program’s lead engineer Luke Borntrager explained. “Having standards helps ensure an operator can successfully command a sensor to turn on or off, left or right, similar to turning a key in the ignition in a car, without having the change the other aspects of the system.” A Hermes 900 drone with the SkyEye WAPS system., Elbit Systems With sensors suites becoming smaller and smaller, there will only continue to be more options for AgilePod. It’s even possible that it could take over game-changing “ wide-area aerial surveillance ” (WAAS) functions, as well. This usually involves a complex set of cumbersome cameras that record multiple video feeds simultaneously, building a mosaic of a particular target area. Analysts can track potentially hostile movements and other significant changes on the ground below both in real-time or even retroactively. In June 2017, Israeli firm Elbit Systems unveiled its relatively small SkyEye WAPS system, which can capture full-motion video of up to 10 separate “regions of interest” at once with just one sensor turret. The Air Force does already have MQ-9s configured for this role, but it requires carrying two large sensor pods that form the core of a system called Gorgon Stare . This essentially precludes the aircraft from doing anything else. Official photographs show the experimental AgilePod carrying two independent electro-optical turrets during at least one of the test flights. An MQ-9 in Afghanistan carrying the Gorgon Stare wide-area surveillance system., USAF This level of modularity makes perfect sense. If the AgilePod works as intended, during actual operations, crews on the ground could quickly swap out gear to better fir the situation at hand rather than having to prepare an entirely different aircraft or even just install a completely different pod. This would reduce the total number of aircraft a unit might need to be able to perform the different mission sets, as well as potentially speeding up the process of getting the appropriate equipment into the air. It would be especially useful for units at forward locations where existing infrastructure and resources may be otherwise limited. With multiple sensors in a single pod, aircraft with limited hardpoints, such as MQ-9 with only four pylons, may be more readily able to bring additional equipment on missions and still have the a place to carry precision guided missiles or bombs to immediately attack any targets they uncover. It’s entirely plausible that AgilePod might be able to carry miniature weapons itself in the future, reducing the need for dedicated racks and launchers. Extended range versions of the Reaper already give up one of their pylons to an external fuel tank. Other services are sure to be interested in how well the system performs. In particular, the U.S. Army could use the pods to expand the capability of its own MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones , which have many of the same features and limitations as the Reaper. An MQ-9 with one pylon already taken up with a fuel tank to extend the drone’s range., USAF Of course, individual manned or unmanned aircraft would only be able to perform the missions that the pod is configured for at any one time. However, the multiple stations inside the AgilePod would allow it to carry more than one type of sensor during each mission, which would still provide additional flexibility over some existing configurations. ARFL already has a number of examples within the Air Force and elsewhere in the U.S. military it can look to for evidence of the benefits of similar modular architecture. USAF In particular, the iconic U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane has remained in service for decades in no small part because of its ability to take on new roles with relative ease. The aircraft has a number of standardized sections , most notably the so-called “Q bay” underneath the fuselage behind the cockpit, which can accommodate palletized sensor packages and other equipment . In addition, the planes can carry various different nose sections, each with different equipment. Still, changing out any of this gear is nowhere near as easy as simply loading up a different AgilePod. Airdyne Another good example would be the sensor pod on the U.S. Marine Corps’ KC-130J Harvest Hawk gunships – again no obvious direct relationship to Harvest Reaper or AgilePod. The turreted camera fits onto the back of a standard underwing fuel tank simplifying the installation without necessarily reducing capability. There’s also the aforementioned, but more secretive Shadow Harvest program. Various private companies , such as Airdyne have also produced modular sensor pods to expand the capabilities of aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules airlifter. Notional configurations for the pods Airdyne offers with its Special Airborne Mission Installation and Response (SABIR) mounting system look very similar to the AgilePod in basic concept. U.S. Special Operations Command and the Air National Guard have both tested the SABIR mount. And there are increasing numbers of similar modular equipment pods for fighter aircraft, including Lockheed’s Legion Pod , which can combined infrared search-and-track functions with other sensors, as well as the Air Force’s Talon HATE unit, which has IRST capabilities and networked data links. The Air Force hopes to test the AgilePod on an MQ-9 by the end of 2017. If those tests are successful, they could begin working on integrating the system onto other aircraft.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019","After North Korea’s ICBM Flies, U.S. and South Korea Say ‘We Have Missiles Too!’","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are still serious questions about how the United States plans to respond diplomatically and militarily to North Korea’s successful demonstration of its Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which could potentially carry a nuclear warhead. The first signal, however, was a combined show of force with the South Korean military. Following North Korea’s missile test, on July 4, 2017, the U.S. Army and the Republic of Korea Army fired off their own ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. A brief official video clip of the exercise showed American and South Korean troops launching one Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missile and one Hyunmoo-2A missile respectively from a beachfront site. The ATACMS – pronounced “attack-ums” – can carry a 500-pound warhead to targets approximately 186 miles away. Though the South Koreans are tight-lipped on its exact capabilities, the Hyunmoo-2A reportedly has similar specifications. The same wheeled launcher can also fire the longer-range -2B and -2C variants . “Self-restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war,” U.S. Army General Vincent Brooks, in charge of all American forces on the Korean Peninsula and head of the U.N. Command that has been in place since the Korean War, said in a written statement in both English and Hangul. “As this Alliance missile live fire shows, we are able to change our choice when so ordered by our Alliance national leaders. It would be a grave mistake for anyone to believe anything to the contrary.” “Despite North Korea’s repeated provocation, the ROK-U.S. Alliance is maintaining patience and self-restraint,” Republic of Korea Army General Lee Sun-jin, the country’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added in the joint statement. “As the combined live fire demonstrated, we may make resolute decisions any time, if the Alliance Commanders in Chief order. Whoever thinks differently is making a serious misjudgment.” The United States and South Korea remain in a technical state of war with North Korea after an armistice ended major combat between the parties on the Korean Peninsula in 1953. The U.S. military continues to station more than 28,000 troops in South Korea and leads a shared command structure that would put it in overall command of all forces in the country, including South Korean troops, during an actual war. General Brook’s is also the commanding officer of this so-called Combined Forces Command. Hyunmoo-2A being launched following North Korea’s ICBM test., AP In June 2015, the U.S. military and its South Korean counterparts transformed the U.S. Army’s 2nd Infantry Division headquarters into the lead element of the first-ever “ Combined Division ” with forces from both countries. This move was specifically done to further enhance the ability of both parties to work together in the event of a crisis, such as a North Korean attack. A number of South Korean troops already serve in American units as part of the Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army (KATSUA) program and other exchanges. M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) self-propelled launchers from the 2nd’s 210th Field Artillery Brigade took part in the July 4 exercise. It is not clear whether or not the Hyunmoo-2A launchers are or were assigned to this partnered division. KCNA: Kim Jong Un: ""Frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees as ever so that they would not feel weary."" — Jonathan Cheng (@JChengWSJ) July 4, 2017 It’s also unclear what, if any, impact the forceful demonstration had on the situation. According to North Korea’s state media , after the test of the Hwasong-14, premier Kim Jong-un reportedly called it a “gift” to the “American bastards” and “as handsome as a good-looking boy and was well made,” before prodding his forces to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees as ever so that they would not feel weary.” Since January 2017, the North Koreans have test fired at least a dozen ballistic and other missiles, including a number of heretofore unseen types such as the Hwasong-14. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PK2YS02-jc0 As we have written about before at The War Zone many times before , North Korea’s propaganda machine relies heavily on being able to cast America and its “ puppet ” allies in countries such as South Korea and Japan as the aggressors. It frames its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs as driven by the need to escape the “ nuclear blackmail ” of the U.S. military and assure the country gets equal treatment in any international negotiations. North Korean state-run news outlets routinely demand a halt to “provocative” American-led “ war exercises ” in South Korea, which they describe as simple test runs for attacks against the regime in Pyongyang. Whether North Korea’s leadership actually believes any of this is true, the American and South Korean tit-for-tat display can only feed into this viewpoint. Its fair to question just how useful the exercise was in general, especially given that it only involved well-established, decades-old capabilities. Neither is in any way equivalent to the Hwasong-14. On top of that, the ATACMS missile itself is long out of production meaning that every one the Army launches, whether it be a full-up round or just a training version, is one less it could employ in future practice sessions, tests, and actual combat. The entire event seemed to be hastily arranged and with little consideration for how Pyongyang might exploit the optics of the demonstration or how it might look to other parties in the region more broadly. Of course, General Brooks’ and General Lee’s use of the phrase “self-restraint” in their statements was clearly chosen to try and counter these arguments and differentiate American and South Korean actions from those of the North. Unfortunately, this may be increasingly difficult to square with the hard line rhetoric coming from U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration. “The era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed,” Trump said during joint statements with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in on June 30, 2017. “And, frankly, that patience is over.” This was a rephrasing of a similar talking point Vice President Mike Pence had first used two months earlier during a visit to South Korea. “Global action is required to stop a global threat,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson then said in a statement after the ICBM test on July 4. “Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime. All nations should publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons.” The United States subsequently called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, undoubtedly to discuss a stern response to North Korea’s actions. But as the War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has already pointed out, American diplomats may find some of the other members, notably Russia and China, unreceptive. Authorities in Moscow and Beijing have proposed a “ de-escalation plan ” that would see North Korea abandon any nuclear or missile tests in exchange for South Korea and the United States halting military exercises on the Peninsula. North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 These are terms neither side is likely to accept given their respective domestic political climates. One good indication of this was The Wall Street Journal ’s editorial board releasing a statement after the Hwasong-14 test effectively calling for regime change in Pyongyang, describing it as the only acceptable course of action left. It seems hard to imagine that Trump or his administration would be in a conciliatory mood after months of statements admonishing North Korea, Russia, and China over the situation. Before his inauguration, Trump famously took to Twitter to declare that under his leadership North Korea wouldn’t be able to develop or build a nuclear-capable weapon that could reach the United States. On July 5, 2017, he castigated Chinese officials on social media for increased trade with North Korea, implying they had an inability or unwillingness to reign in Kim Jong-un’s actions. Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us – but we had to give it a try! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2017 Of course, as we have already seen, the increased rhetoric has not necessarily translated into dramatic changes in American policy. Though the missile exercise is uncommon, after past North Korean missile and nuclear weapons tests, the U.S. military has sent long-range heavy bombers, including the iconic B-52 Stratofortress and stealth B-2 Spirit, on fly-overs of South Korea  and had carrier battle groups and ballistic missile submarines sail nearby, all to show both countries’ resolve. At the end of June 2017, South Korea also test fired its latest Hyunmoo-2C missile , which can reach targets anywhere in North Korea. The U.S. Army is working on its own all-new tactical ballistic missile to finally replace the ATACMS. The Pentagon has tried to downplay the significant of the North Korean achievement and its potential threat, as well. “We’ve still not seen a number of things that would indicate a full-up threat,” U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on July 5, 2017 , adding that the danger from the Hwasong-14 was “limited. “We do have confidence [in our ballistic missile defense capabilities],” he continued . Earlier in 2017, the United States began the long-planned deployment of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) interceptors and the associated AN/TPY-2 long-range radar to South Korea. Still, “we must never forget that Korea is not at peace, and Eighth Army remains prepared to ‘Fight Tonight’ – daily,” the official website of the Eighth U.S. Army, situated in South Korea, had declared well before the Hwasong-14 lifted off. Other U.S. military elements on the Korean Peninsula have similar mission statements. Given that a new war would be almost certainly disastrous for both the North and South, as well as the region as a whole, we can only hope that neither side will decide to put these preparations to the test.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019","USAF Wants Someone With A Helicopter To Recover Its Downed Global Hawk, ASAP","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On June 21, 2017, a U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk crashed near Mt. Whitney , which lies on the boundary between Sequoia National Park and the Inyo National Forest in California. It’s rugged, heavily forested terrain, and now the service wants someone to go in there and recover parts of the drone. On June 30, 2017, the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) at Edwards Air Force Base in California announced via the Federal government’s main contracting website it wanted to hire a team with at least one heavy lift helicopter for “unmanned aerial vehicle parts retrieval” related to the mishap. The massive pilotless surveillance aircraft was en route to Edwards from Beale Air Force Base, situated more than 350 miles to the northwest, when it went down. Details about the cause of the accident remain sparse after more than a week. “Parts of the aircraft are spread-out (refer to grid coordinates),” the contract’s statement of work explained. “Environmental operating conditions will be defined by weather conditions, fire conditions, terrain, and health of personnel before, during, and after the detail.” Censors redacted the grid coordinates, as well as possible locations for the contractor to establish a base camp and photographs of the crash site. There is no description of exactly what parts the Air Force specifically wants them to extract or if they simply intend to recover as much as possible. With less than 50 Global Hawks in total, and after investing in $10 billion in the program overall, anything recoverable has an inherent value. Airmen load an RQ-4 on a C-5 cargo plane., USAF Depending on what the aircraft was doing at Edwards for the AFTC, it could also have been carrying modified or unique equipment. Earlier in 2017, the service had begun testing the MS-177 multi-spectral camera on at least one Global Hawk. The Air Force has long been interested in expanding the aircraft’s sensor package in general. This picture further illustrates the size of the Global Hawk drone., USAF “The aircraft also has an optical lens which is impregnated with thorium to enhance optical properties (similar to many commercial optics),” the contract document added. “Thorium is a radioactive material and decays through alpha emission. … If the lens has been burned or it has been melted the potential for alpha radiation exposure is higher.” There are also warnings that moving the wreckage might chuck fiberglass particles into the air, cause fuel spills or disturb broken nickel cadmium batteries, all of which could be environmental hazards. “All wreckage, including any contained hazardous substances shall be moved to a nearby government designated landing zone, while taking measures to minimize any additional releases to the environment,” a revised notice the Air Force published on July 2, 2017, noted. “Contractor shall record and report to a designated government point of contact the location on any evidence of environmental impacts encountered at the wreckage sites.” An Erickson Air Crane S-64 lifts part of Toronto’s CN Tower into position in 1975., via Wikimedia Whatever the Air Force actually wants from the crash site, it’s big enough that their preference would be to hire someone with a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, also known by its U.S. military designation as the CH-54. With less than 150 S-64s ever made, most during the 1960s, there are only a few operators of this type left anywhere in the world. In 1992, longtime Skycrane operator Erickson Air Crane, now called Erickson, Inc. , purchased the rights to the design and upgraded a number of aircraft. Siller Helicopters has at least another four models of various types. Howeer, able to lift oversized loads up to 20,000 pounds under the right conditions, it would be a perfect choice for this situation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=R4fOSxU6kgI The Air Force says it’s also willing to consider companies flying other heavy lift types, especially Sikorsky models “S-61 through S-65.” They likely only mean the S-61 and the S-65 though, since the S-62 would be far too small for the job and the S-63 never made it into production. Various firms operate the S-61 for passenger and cargo hauling duties, but there are no civilian operators of the S-65, the model number for the early models of Sikorsky’s CH-53 family. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook and its civilian version, such as the heavy-duty Model 234UT , might be suitable depending on the exact situation. A Boeing Model 234UT., Columbia Helicopters Whoever they hire, the Air Force wants them to get started quickly. Part of that no doubt has to do with the aforementioned “fire conditions.”  It’s the season and there are already a number of individual forest fires burning in California. The contract notice points out there are two going relatively close to the crash site. These could destroy the wreckage as easily as they could houses and other property. Coupled with high pressure weather on the mountain that might cause turbulence and other unsafe conditions for helicopters, this job could turn out to be pretty dangerous. Whatever happens, it’s clear the Air Force wants to get some of all of the drone out of the forest as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 4, 2019",This F-16 Unit Battling ISIS Has Legendarily Rebellious Revolutionary War Roots,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every year around July 4th, U.S. military units record greetings and write messages to celebrate the country’s independence. In their annual salute to the nation, members of the Vermont Air National Guard decided to share their state’s own connection to the American Revolution by holding a distinctive flag not everyone might recognize. The 158th Fighter Wing is nicknamed “ The Green Mountain Boys ” after a militia that fought on the side of the United States during the Revolutionary War. In the blinding sun at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, five members of the wing and its 134th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron held up that group’s distinctive green and blue banner. “It’s The Green Mountain Boys, live from Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar,” one of them says in the brief recording. The unit, with its F-16 Viper fighter jets, has been in the region fighting ISIS as part of the U.S.-led coalition since December 2016 . Now, of course, there were no air forces or fighter jets during the American Revolution. Officially, the 158th traces its direct lineage to the 134th Fighter Interceptor Squadron and the formal recognition of the Vermont Air National Guard in 1946. But the wing highlight’s Vermont’s unique place in America’s formative history with its moniker. The Green Mountain Boys, and their leader Ethan Allen , was an important factor in the Revolutionary War and the creation of Vermont itself. The militia and its grievances with British royal authorities actually predate the formal beginning of the colonial revolt that ultimately gave birth to the United States. In 1749, Benning Wentworth, the royal governor of what was then the Province of New Hampshire began issuing landing grants west of the Connecticut River. One had to pay to get one of these “New Hampshire Grants” and Wentworth was more interested in making money than anything else. As such, he had no qualms about allotting territory that was already claimed by individuals from the neighboring Province of New York. The official insignia of the 158th Fighter Wing, Vermont Air National Guard makes its historical association clear., ANG The emblem of the Vermont Air National Guard 134th Fighter Squadron., ANG The resulting land disputes became so pronounced that King George III officially stepped in and decreed that the land belonged to New York in 1764. Many of the settlers from New Hampshire were outraged at the decision, which stripped them of their property, and began an armed revolt. Ethan Allen, his brother Ira Allen, their cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker, and other like-minded individuals formed what became known as The Green Mountain Boys at Catamount Tavern in Bennington . Taverns were a common meeting place at the time, with similar establishments having hosted the creation of The Sons of Liberty and the U.S. Marine Corps . The Green Mountain Boys spent the subsequent years defending their claims and harassing officials and other “Yorkers.” By the time the Continental Congress declared independence from the British Crown in 1776, New York authorities had long had warrants out for the arrest of Ethan Allen and his “ Bennington mob .” But while this might have made it seem as though a union between the militia and the rebellious colonists would have been an easy decision, this was far from the reality. Via Wikimedia Though his years of armed defiance of both authorities in New York who saw his claims as illegal and officials in New Hampshire who sought to reign in the Green Mountain Boys, Allen had alienated many on both sides. Revolutionary governments in both regions were in no rush to legitimize the group or its aspirations. As it turns out, a revolutionary force made of militia from Massachusetts and Connecticut were the first to enlist his aid as they pushed into what is today upstate New York. An engraving of Ethan Allen at Ft. Ticonderoga., Via the Vermont Historical Society Allen and The Green Mountain Boys joined the group, ultimately under the command of the infamous eventual traitor Benedict Arnold, for the assault on and capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. Afterwards, the militia made several independent attempts to seize control of Fort St. Jean in Quebec. These all failed, squeezing the force to the point that it effectively disbanded. In June 1775, Allen and Seth Warner traveled to Philadelphia to propose the formal creation – with formal supplies and formal paychecks – of a “ranger regiment” from men in the New Hampshire Grants. The Continental Congress agreed, but effectively placed the resulting unit under the authority of New York’s new provisional government. In an apparent attempt not to upset their newfound legitimacy, the reformed Green Mountain Boys resoundingly elected Warner to lead the force, appointing Ira Allen and a third brother Herman to other important positions, but cutting the divisive Ethan out of the organization completely. An artist’s rendition of a Green Mountain Boy., Via the Vermont Historical Society After some creative bargaining with General Philip Schuyler, head of the Continental Army’s Northern Department, Ethan Allen secured the right to accompany his men as a civilian. His ambitions quickly got the better of him and as American troops began their invasion of Canada he found himself increasingly unwelcome. Repeatedly sent out to try and rally Canadians and Native Americans to join the rebellious colonists against British rule, his hubris eventually took over and he tried to capture the city of Montreal in September 1775. Though he had the element of surprise, his company of 100 men was simply no match for the loyal defenders. “I am very apprehensive of disagreeable consequences arising from Mr. Allen’s imprudence,” Schuyler reportedly wrote after learning of the debacle, according to Michael Bellesiles Revolutionary Outlaws: Ethan Allen and the Struggle for Independence on the Early American Frontier . “I always dreaded his impatience and imprudence.” An engraving of British forces capturing Ethan Allen and his men in Montreal. , New York Public Library via Wikimedia Initially sent to a prison in Cornwall, Allen spent nearly three years bouncing from prison to prison after King George III decided he and other revolutionaries should be held in the colonies as prisoners of war. So, despite his previous run-ins with British officials, his sentence was relatively light as he received the substantial rights and limited parole befitting a captured officer. In May 1778, the British traded him for one of their own. In the meantime, in January 1777, upset at their continued political limbo, a convention of individuals within the New Hampshire Grants decided to declare their own independence, separate from both Great Britain and the rebel colonists. First named the Republic of New Connecticut, the small country renamed itself the Republic of Vermont – a sort of portmanteau of the French phrase les verts monts , or Green Mountains – six months later. Despite Ethan Allen’s imprisonment and his militia’s complicated affiliation with the Continental Congress, they adopted his flag as their official symbol. The flag of the Green Mountain Boys and the Republic of Vermont., Via Wikimedia Effectively a rogue province within two rogue provinces, neither British nor continental authorities recognized the decision. And while the new government was keen to take property from individuals loyal to the Crown, they also welcomed deserters and others fleeing the conflict, becoming a sort of maroon community in the mountains. Many of the Allen family became major players in the new country’s politics and military affairs. In 1778, Ethan Allen himself petitioned the Continental Congress to let Vermont join as an independent state. The New York delegation was especially resistant to this idea, with no amount of ongoing civil war warming them to the idea of ceding their claims to the region. In 1779, revolutionary Governor of New York George Clinton offered to drop all claims to property in New Hampshire Grants if the Vermonters would agree to accept his state’s authority over the area. Incensed at the offer and acting as lead negotiator, Allen not only flatly rejected it as an attempt “to deceive [the] woods people,” but subsequently negotiated in secret with British officials in Canada about rejoining the United Kingdom in exchange for becoming a new, separate Crown province. Those overtures, backed by generous prisoner transfers, failed to generate any support from King George III or other officials. Allen’s treasonous actions meant that even after the new United States made peace with Great Britain in 1783, Vermont continued to operate as an independent country. The British had given up their claim to the territory, but the new U.S. government, perhaps ironically, had no intention of welcoming them into the union. F-16s of the 134th Fighter Squadron., ANG The last stanza of John Greenleaf Whittier’s poem The Song of the Vermonters, 1779 highlights this fiercely independent nature: Come York or come Hampshire, come traitors or knaves, If ye rule o’er our land ye shall rule o’er our graves; Our vow is recorded—our banner unfurled, In the name of Vermont we defy all the world! Only after his death in 1789 did the situation begin to change, though there is no indication the two events were directly connected. The next year, New York and Vermont finally settled their differences, with an agreement to reimburse New Yorkers for their claims. Vermont paid $30,000, a not significant amount at the time, and on March 4, 1791 joined the union as the 14th state. In an ominous portent of things to come, the decision was motivated in part by the need for a free state to serve as a counterweight to the proposed admission of slave-owning Kentucky. But as the Vermont Air National Guard’s Independence Day message highlights, the state remains very proud of its brief time as an independent country, and of Ethan Allen’s and The Green Mountain Boys’ spirit of freedom. Until 1960, Burlington International Airport was actually called Ethan Allen Air Force Base. Today, the Vermont National Guard as a whole carries the Green Mountain Boys name, as well. “I am the dream of Ethan Allen, soaring above the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War from Bennington to Fort Ticonderoga,” the first sentence of the 158th Fighter Wing’s official history proudly declares. It continues the “legacy of the original Green Mountain Boys.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Americas Around The Globe History News & Features U.S. Homeland"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 9, 2019",Here’s What Taiwan Would Get In $1.3B Arms Deal With U.S.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States has approved more than a billion dollars in potential arms sales to Taiwan, a move that has already drawn unsurprising criticism the People’s Republic of China. However, there is no clear indication when these deliveries, which the Taiwanese military sorely needs to maintain a credible deterrent, might actually occur and some fear the U.S. government might choose to use them as a bargaining chip with their counterparts in Beijing. On June 29, 2017, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the Pentagon’s top arms broker, announced that the U.S. State Department has cleared seven separate arms deals, totaling more than $1.3 billion, for what it referred to as the “Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the United States.” This entity represents the Republic of China government on the island of Taiwan, which the U.S. government does not technically recognize, but which it reserves the right to sell weapons to under the Taiwan Relations Act, also known as Public Law 96-8. Each individual DSCA notice said both that “this proposed sale is consistent with United States law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96-8” and that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.” The latter statement is canned language that the Pentagon office includes in almost all of its arms sales announcements. These are the first sales to Taiwan the U.S. government has approved under President Donald Trump. DSCA last announced proposed arms deliveries to Taiwan in 2015 , which, at the time, were the first such deals in more than four years. The “provision of defensive systems … increases Taiwan’s confidence and ability to maintain the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said through her official Twitter account . “We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Beijing, and promote positive developments in cross-strait relations.” Two of Taiwan’s four Kee Lung -class destroyers., 玄史生 via Wikimedia The “defensive” weapons are all clearly focused on improving Taiwan’s parity to forces on the mainland, which have been rapidly modernizing in recent years. The single largest item is $400 million to maintain and upgrade the Taiwanese military’s Surveillance Radar Program (SRP). The integrated systems are “a key component to the recipient’s Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance architecture,” according to DSCA. “[Taiwan] will use the requested updates and sustainment as a defensive deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.” Then there’s another $80 million to upgrade the AN/SLQ-32(V)3 Electronic Warfare Systems aboard the Taiwanese Navy’s four Kee Lung -class destroyers . These ships, laid down in 1978, had formerly served in the U.S. Navy as the Kidd -class, an advanced derivative of the Spruance -class. The 1970s vintage “ slick-32 ” has a radar warning component to alert the crew they are being targeted, as well as a jamming capability to defend against enemy systems. It can also take in signals from friendly radars, providing a passive targeting capability itself. The DSCA notice does not explain what specific changes Taiwan wants to make to its systems. The other five deals are for missiles and torpedoes and associated components, spare parts, and other support services. Two separate packages contain 50 AGM-88B High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM) and 56 AGM-154C Joint Stand-Off Weapons (JSOW). Both of these would be important armament options for the Taiwanese Air Force’s fleet of F-16 Viper fighter jets. In particular, the JSOW could give them a desperately needed stand-off capability against Chinese forces, including those still on the mainland. The Taiwan Strait is barely more than 100 miles wide at some points. When released from a high altitude, the AGM-154C can reach a maximum range of 70 miles. The weapon also has a two-stage penetrating warhead that can break through some hardened targets. JSOW is especially useful for going after an enemy’s key air defense nodes and command and control hubs. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zLFAJuGa93U Another missile delivery would include 16 Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) Block IIIA surface-to-air missiles, plus additional components either as spares or potentially to upgrade older versions of the weapons that Taiwan already has in inventory. The country’s Kee Lungs are armed with SM-2s. Manufacturer Raytheon says the Block IIIA variant is capable of intercepting subsonic and supersonic aircraft and cruise missiles at high and low altitudes. However, this type of standard missile does not have any anti-ballistic missile capability however, nor would its ships have the radar or other systems necessary to prosecute an intercept. Given the ranges involves, integrated air defenses on land and sea would be essential to holding off a Chinese invasion, especially given that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has the potential to simply overwhelm Taiwan’s own air arm. USN Lastly there are two potential batches of torpedoes and associated upgrade parts. One possible deal has 46 Mk 48 Mod 6AT heavyweight types. The other has enough components for Taiwan to upgrade 168 older Mk 46 Mod 5 lightweight torpedoes into the more advanced Mk 54 configuration. The Mk 48s would be for the Taiwanese Navy’s pair of Dutch-built Hai Lung -class diesel electric submarines. The “Advanced Technology” Mod 6 versions combine a modified, quieter-running version of an earlier propulsion system with a new guidance and control unit. The United States has already sold these types to Brazil and Turkey for their diesel electric submarine fleets. The lightweight Mk 54s, primarily an anti-submarine weapon, would arm Taiwanese surface ships and maritime patrol aircraft. Taken together, these would be Taiwan’s first lines of defense against China’s underwater fleet, which includes dozens of boats, includes both nuclear-powered and advanced diesel-electric types. One of Taiwan’s Hai Lung -class submarines., Republic of China Navy These weapons would be significant and important additions to Taiwan’s inventory given both the aging state of much of its own equipment and military modernization on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. In recent years, the various branches of the People’s Liberation Army have been working hard to obtain aircraft carriers , advanced surface warships and submarines , stealth multi-role jets and improved air-to-air weapons , a host of new intelligence and surveillance aircraft and drones, a wide array of ballistic and cruise missiles , much more . A day before the Pentagon announced the potential arms packages for the Taiwanese military, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) launched its first Type 055 destroyer , which will be the most advanced surface combatant the country has ever put into service. All of this seems geared to help the country expand its military prowess well beyond its borders into contested areas such as the South China Sea and the East Sea, which would only serve to further isolate Taiwanese authorities from their allies in an actual conflict. By comparison Taiwan’s military often appears accident prone and is in desperate need of upgrades across the board. But the island’s complicated diplomatic position has often stalled U.S. arms deals in spite of the Taiwan Relations Act and broad support for the policy in Congress. Taiwanese F-16A and B fighter jets., AP Notably, after years of attempting to convince various U.S. presidential administrations to let it buy new, advanced F-16 fighter jets, Taiwanese officials finally compromised and agreed to instead purchase an upgrade package for its older F-16A/B Vipers. Similarly, there has been much talk of , but little movement on adding new submarines to the fleet, which still operates two World War II-era ex- Tench -class boats in a training capacity. On that front, in addition to DSCA’s announcements, the Senate Armed Services Committee did include a provision to aid Taiwan in developing new subs in its proposed annual defense spending bill . The most immediate problem has historically been that no American shipyard currently makes diesel electric submarines and the United States isn’t interested in selling Taiwan nuclear-powered submarines. The proposed sales DSCA announced in June 2017 had already been in the works under President Barack Obama, but his administration deferred to incoming President Donald Trump and his team. The Trump Administration has since accused Obama of trying to kill the plan entirely, but there are similar concerns that the deal might still be in danger. Then president-elect Trump did call President Tsai after her own election win in January 2017, widely seen a breach of protocol both for an incoming president and with regards to U.S. government relations with Beijing. Tsai’s Ing-wen’s Democratic Progressive Party has advocated in the past for policies seen as taking Taiwan down a path of complete independence from China rather than seeking to continue claiming its authority over the mainland. The government in Beijing, which insists the island is little more than a rogue province, labeled Tsai an “ independence extremist ” in response to some of her past statements. President Tsai Ing-wen aboard one of Taiwan’s Hai Lung-class submarines in March 2017., AP However, after meeting with Chinese premier Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida four months later, Trump appeared to adopt a conciliatory tone one the issue, backing down from any obvious support for Taiwan in any status. “I think he’s [Xi] doing an amazing job as a leader, and I wouldn’t want to do anything that comes in the way of that,” Trump told Reuters in an interview after the meeting. “So, I would certainly want to speak to him first.” After hearing of DSCA’s announcements, Chinese officials specifically cited the “ Mar-a-Lago summit ” in their objections to the planned arms sales. It is worth nothing that the China always complains about any such arrangements on principle , as it does not recognize the authority of the government on Taiwan to make such deals or otherwise engage in foreign affairs. But with the Trump administration talking tough on North Korea and repeatedly stressing the importance of China in getting the reclusive regime to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, there has been speculation that he might offer to scrap or slow-roll the arms deals to secure their support. Separately, the Trump administration appeared to effectively halt so-called “Freedom of Navigation” patrols, or FONOPs, near Chinese-occupied islands in the contested South China Sea for months. In May 2017, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Dewey performed the first such mission in more than six months , sailing near Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, challenging Chinese claims. Still, the Trump’s relationship with the Chinese may be cooling again, as officials in Beijing have shown themselves unable or unwilling to control North Korean provocations. Late on June 29, 2017, his administration announced new sanctions against two Chinese citizens and two businesses in the country, the Dalian Global Unity Shipping Company and the Bank of Dandong. U.S. authorities specifically accused the financial institution of helping North Korea launder money. In the meantime, Taiwanese officials will undoubtedly lobby their own supporters in Congress, which still has to approve the sales. Since Taiwan enjoys broad, bipartisan support among American lawmakers, it seems unlikely there will be any problems on that front. Ultimately, Trump will have to decide how to proceed and that decision could be one of the clearest indications yet of his administration’s actual stance on Taiwan.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 31, 2019",“Identity Intel Ops” Turn US Special Operators Into Combat Detectives,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you hear a report about an American counter-terrorism operation, especially one that results in the death or capture of some apparently notable militant in a hot spot around the world, you’ll often hear about how important intelligence was in tracking them down. What you won’t hear much about is exactly what this “intelligence driven” process necessarily entails in any detail. The War Zone has now obtained a document through the Freedom of Information Act that gives a more in depth look at how U.S. special operators are becoming combat detectives, gathering vacuuming up forensic details during missions that could lead them to their next target. Though it’s just one piece of the intelligence puzzle, so-called “identity intelligence,” or I2, has become an essential part of the action cycle, which broadly involves gathering information, tracking individual terrorists, neutralizing them, and then repeating the process with any new data obtained during those raids. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has codified these concepts what it officially calls Directive 525-40, Identity Intelligence. Thanks to the FOIA, we received what appears to be the most recent edition of this document, which is dated April 7, 2017. This replaced a previous version the Pentagon’s top special operations command had published four years earlier. That special operations forces “will conduct more multinational, intelligence driven, I2 Ops supporting the range of military operations,” is the guide’s number one assumption. “I2 Ops … deny anonymity to the adversary, and protect U.S. and allied assets, facilities, and forces.” In short, identity intelligence can scoop up information with an eye toward identifying a particular enemy target – not necessarily just individuals, but also groups, objects, facilities, and other items of interest – or helping conceal a friendly element by determining what exactly an opponent might know. The main focus is definitely on hunting down terrorists and objects of interest, though. From the directive, the ability for special operations to quickly spot potential useful items in the field and otherwise collect vast amounts of largely physical data during operations is critical. US special operations forces collect identity intelligence during an exercise., US Army However, the different services each set the specific identity intelligence requirements for their own special operations forces. Each one – Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force – as well as the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), is responsible for training its personnel in the relevant skill sets. SOCOM’s top intelligence division coordinates the actual operational aspects between the different elements and runs the central collection points for the information, but the U.S. Army Special Operations Command has the lead role in shaping the basic requirements and policies surrounding this particular mission. The actual tasks sound a lot like something straight from an episode of a procedural crime drama on television. The document outlines six specific types of identity intelligence elite forces should be looking to gather at all times: biometric live scans, latent prints, DNA, facial images, trace materials, and documents and media. This information can be taken from individuals and sites that U.S. special operators in the course of “sensitive site exploitations” during operations, as well as from any potential person of interest, local employee, or foreign national who comes onto a facility run by elite forces at home or abroad. In the latter case, this is done to help establish those individuals as “trustworthy,” no doubt an attempt to safeguard against enemy infiltration and insider attacks , according to the directive. Officially, the guidelines require the process to adhere to any official procedures and local laws applicable to the particular situations, in order to protect individuals’ rights and privacy. SOCOM via FOIA Still, the official descriptions make it clear that, if the circumstances at all allow it, elite troops are supposed to be collecting a significant amount of data. The biometric live scan, intended to be collected from living person as its name implies, sounds particularly comprehensive. The full profile includes full, rolled prints of all of the subject’s 10 fingers, scans of both of their irises, and a frontal view photograph. If “time and bandwidth are constrained” – all of this data is subsequently uploaded digitally to a central point for analysis – special operators may only take quick, flat prints and a photograph instead. SOCOM via FOIA SOCOM via FOIA As we just mentioned, the information then goes straight into a set of larger databases and may even be checked against existing information. So, during a raid, U.S. forces can quickly check a person’s identity against watch lists of terrorist suspects. SOCOM maintains at least one “gray list,” defined as “foreign personalities of operational interest whose inclinations and attitudes toward the political and military objectives of the U.S. are unknown,” too, according to the directive. The photographs from the biometric live scans, as well as the specific facial images go into recognition databases with automated search functions. The other intelligence doesn’t necessarily require a special operations forces locate any individuals at all. Collecting latent prints and DNA samples can help establish the presence of suspect or suspects at one or more locations, or a pattern of their movements and activities, just like they can in traditional law enforcement. “Items of interest such as bomb and drug making materiel, ignition systems, metal fragments, cups, furniture, etc, should be checked for fingerprints,” the directive notes. “DNA can be collected from anywhere.” A US special operator practices using a portable biometric scanner., EUCOM During a site exploitation, elite forces should grab as much trace evidence as they can, too. “Unknown substances, whether bulk, trace, solid or liquid, should be collected,” according to the official guidance. “Trace substances or materials arc easily overlooked but may be vital in linking a person to an item, location, or event. The same goes for documents and media. The U.S. Intelligence Community runs a centralized National Media Exploitation Center that provides its own, separate handbook on the exact types of items any military forces should be on the lookout to grab. Poring over cell phones, diaries, audio and video tapes, and other items – a process called Document and Media Exploitation, or DOMEX – can reveal immense amounts of information about a target. SOCOM via FOIA All of this information gets sent to SOCOM’s “I2 Exploitation Cell” via a network of classified and unclassified websites. You can even take a look at the relatively bland log-in page for the unclassified “ identityops.com ” yourself. The protected parts of the web-based network won’t show without the proper credentials installed on your computer. The system also lets SOCOM share the information with other elements of the U.S. military, as well as with the members of Intelligence Community such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation, and vice versa. All of this feeds the “F3EAD” targeting cycle, which stands for “Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate.” There is no common standard for how long information remains stored in SOCOM’s own databases, with a “forensic triage” process guiding that decision in each case. At that time, officials also determine how and when analysts can legally look at information and for how long and when and how the information gets shared with approved third parties. After analysts finally began to pick over the data, the targeting cycle would really kick in. “If we can scoop somebody up alive, with their cell phones and diaries, it really can help speed up the demise of a terrorist group like ISIS,” Dell Dailey, a retired Army officer who once commanded JSOC and is now chairman of West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center, told The New York Times in June 2017. US Army We know from numerous high-profile counter-terrorism raids that identity intelligence has been important, if not essential, both before and after. After the mission that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011, American officials used facial recognition technology and DNA testing, based on information collected at the Al Qaeda leader’s compound in Pakistan, to confirm his identity . The raiding force also scooped up all manner of computers, thumb drives and more – including an apparently extensive collection of pornography – to aid in tracking down his associates. Though the U.S. government has released some of the information it gathered at the scene, much of it remains classified as it is still apparently operationally relevant. Other records the author obtained via the Freedom of Information Act showed that documents and media, and cell phones in particular, were key drivers of targeted strikes against insurgents in Afghanistan, at least during 2013 . “SSE results = JP/TD,” an Email from a member of the Air Force’s 16th Special Operations Squadron declared, using acronyms for “sensitive site exploitation,” “jackpot,” and “touchdown.” The U.S. military uses the term “jackpot” to describe a successful strike against a particular individual, while “touchdown” refers to a an attack focused solely on a specific electronic signal, such as a particular cell phone or radio. US Army Since at least 2015, a JSOC element known publicly as the “Expeditionary Targeting Force” has been conduct intelligence driven operations against ISIS. That year, special operators had grabbed various physical materials during another mission in Syria that killed the terrorist group’s “emir of oil and gas” Abu Sayyaf. The elite troops did capture his wife, Umm Sayyaf, alive, and they undoubtedly processed her additional identity intelligence. The June 2017 New York Times story also described how even though a secretive raid in Syria two months earlier had killed ISIS moneyman and fixer Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, preventing interrogators from quizzing him directly, the mission netted significant amounts of identity intelligence that could lead to additional raids. There have been other raids in both Iraq and Syria that likely used and produced similar information and it seems reasonable to assume it’s been a key part of other direct action operations against terrorists elsewhere around the world , too. All in all, it seems that the SOCOM directive’s top assumption appears to be more of a fact. Intelligence driven operations have become the norm and identity intelligence looks set to continue being a key part of the decision-making cycle.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2019",Senators Add Big Bucks for a Fleet Of Light Attack Planes to the Defense Budget,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of the U.S. Senate want to add more than billion dollars to the annual defense budget for a fleet of light attack aircraft , most likely for the U.S. Air Force. The proposal could push the service to finally buy a type of plane it desperately needs, which might spur action in other branches , as well. After a long day of deliberations on June 28, 2017, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed an initial vote on their proposed defense budget, clearing one of the first hurdles toward the bill becoming law. An executive summary gave basic details on its contents, which included an authorization of $1.2 billion for “a fleet of Light Attack/Observation aircraft.” The statement did not provide an estimate of how many airframes the budget would pay for or offer any details about the aircraft requirements or the intended recipients. This funding is not readily apparent in any part President Donald Trump’s original U.S. military spending request, which the Pentagon unveiled in detail in May 2017, but the Senators did not say this item was in addition to those plans. The Senate Committee’s overview included a note in all other instances where it added money over the Trump Administration’s plans. A similar requirement is not present in any of the services’ unfunded priorities “wish lists,” either. The most obvious answer is that this budget line creates a funding stream for whatever aircraft comes out on top of the Air Force’s light attack aircraft experiment , more commonly known as OA-X. In July 2017, the service expects to begin evaluating at least three different planes – Sierra Nevada Corporation’s (SNC) and Embraer Defense & Security’s A-29 Super Tucano and Textron Aviation’s AT-6 Wolverine and Scorpion – at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. There is always the possibility that other firms will get invitations to join the tests, too. An A-29 Super Tucano., USAF On top of that, in January 2017, Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who just so happens to be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released a white paper titled “ Restoring American Power .” It recommended purchasing a fleet of 300 “low-cost, light-attack fighters that would require minimal work to develop,” with the first 200 entering service by 2022. “These aircraft could conduct counterterrorism operations, perform close air support and other missions in permissive environments, and help to season pilots to mitigate the Air Force’s fighter pilot shortfall,” McCain explained. Based on existing cost data , the $1.2 billion figure fits in well with this earlier proposal. The Pentagon has already helped purchase A-29s for the air forces of Afghanistan and Lebanon, with each aircraft costing approximately between $10 and $15 million. These deals have all included various spare parts, support services, training courses, and other ancillary items, meaning the exact cost of the planes specifically has not been immediately apparent, but more than a billion would easily cover a full fleet of dozens of aircraft. The Senate plan makes perfect sense. For years, the Air Force in particular has been fighting a string of low-intensity conflicts against opponents with limited air defense capabilities primarily using high-performance aircraft, including multi-role fighter jets, as well as drones. This has proven to be an expensive proposition and taxing on an already strained fighter force, as Senator McCain noted in his white paper. But for nearly a decade the service only gave lip service to the idea of buying light attacker to fly these missions on the cheap. That institutional mindset seemed to be changing earlier in 2017. OA-X could be “a more sustainable model for the future that would be less costly [and] that I could entice foreign partners and allies and coalition members to partner with us on,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein explained during a talk at the American Enterprise Institute on Jan. 18, 2017. Still, the Air Force has made it abundantly clear it has no clear goal for the OA-X experiment or existing idea of how it might integrate any “winner” into its existing force structure. The project is “is not a procurement, it’s an experiment,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said during a talk at the Air Force Association Forum in Washington, D.C. on June 5, 2017. A defense budget that funds a light attack fleet could be the prompt service needs to actually lay out a coherent plan for how OA-X becomes a fully fledged procurement program. There are, unfortunately, risks with this strategy, as well. The Senate only needs to look at the outcome of the Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program. After individuals within Air Combat Command, the Air Force’s main warfighting command, drafted the initial OA-X concept in December 2008, the service had begun budgeting for this fleet of approximately 15 light attack aircraft, before bringing the project to an inglorious halt in 2012. A big part of why this happened had to do with budget cuts and the process known as sequestration, which imposed caps on defense spending. Contract squabbles were another factor, which also threatened to scuttle a parallel project to send similar planes to Afghanistan – which did ultimately result in purchases of A-29s. Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine., Texron However, even if the Air Force had overcome these hurdles, it had no idea where the light attackers would go . Federal statutes and internal rules meant units tasked with training foreign air forces, such as the 6th Special Operations Squadron, were the only ones who could do the job the service intended for the aircraft. But with a host of non-standard planes already, they weren’t particularly interested. Air Combat Command did have a certain level of interest, but had no authority to fly them. In addition, it wasn’t entirely clear where the personnel for the new squadron would come from or who would ultimately pay for its upkeep. If the Air Force doesn’t rise to the Senate’s new proposal, this new OA-X fleet could end up “homeless” within the service just like the proposed LAAR aircraft. A similar situation arose with the C-27J airlifter, all of which ended up horse-traded to U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Forest Service. Textron’s Scropion light jet., Textron However, if the program does run into problems, the Air Force could work with other services to share the burdens and keep things moving forward. For years now, the Marine Corps has considered creating a composite training force that includes a similar type aircraft. Its concept has the planes helping tactical air controllers on the ground and forward air controllers in the air practice calling in and coordinating close air support missions. The existing plans do not include a combat role for these planes at present. USMC First mentioned in the Corps’ 2016 master aviation plan, the idea reappeared in the 2017 version . However, the Marines have been interested in this concept since at least 2009, when the Navy coordinated a similar demonstration program nicknamed Imminent Fury involving a Super Tucano. That project subsequently transitioned to a special operations light attack experiment, ultimately resulting in the deployment of a pair of modified OV-10 Bronco aircraft to fight ISIS in Iraq in 2015. As The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway wrote in March 2017, the Marine Corps training program could be a stepping stone to a broader, deployable light attack capability within the service, as well as the U.S. Navy. USN A joint Air Force-Navy-Marine Corps OA-X program might actually make the most sense in both the short and long terms. It would help share the burden of paying and manning the resulting units and give the Air Force space to develop plans to absorb its share of the aircraft. At the same time, the Marines could leverage the Air Force’s own experience working with these types of aircraft in cooperation with Afghanistan and Lebanon, which includes both pilot training and managing logistics chains. Of course, the Senate Armed Services Committee’s spending proposal is just that and not guaranteed to become law in its existing form. But with the extra push from members Congress, who clearly support this cost-effective idea, the U.S. military could finally move toward fielding a real and valuable light attack capability.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the Royal Navy’s newest carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth , begins her initial sea trials in the North Sea, further south personnel are training to eventually join her air wing. With the United Kingdom having only received a small number of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters so far, all of which are in the U.S., these future flight deck crews are practicing with a “mini air force” that includes four full-scale mockups of the stealthy jets. On June 28, 2017, the Royal Navy revealed these impressive substitutes had previously joined the training force at Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose, which is situated on Cornwall’s Lizard Peninsula. With the F-35B slated to be Queen Elizabeth ’s primary weapon when she enters service in 2026, it’s essential that sailors get a chance to work with something similar now. “To be ‘carrier-ready, we need to practice moving all different shapes and sizes of aircraft,” Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer Paul Ranson, who leads the training program at Culdrose and will eventually take over as Queen Elizabeth ’s Captain of the Flight Deck, told the service’s reporters. “Ninety-nine percent of handlers have never been near an F-35B yet or moved anything nearly that large on a flight deck.” Made by Gate Guards UK, the model jets – reportedly nicknamed “the faux fighters” – are non-flying, but replicate many of the Joint Strike Fighter’s basic features, such as its undercarriage. This allows trainees to practice hooking them up to tugs and pulling them around on the tarmac. Crown Copyright Crews can fill large tanks inside the predominantly fiberglass training aids with water in order to up the total weight to between 16 and 24 tons in order to simulate varying loads of fuel and ordnance. Two of the four have realistically opening canopies so teams can practice getting an injured pilot out of the cockpit in an emergency. “We need to provide as realistic training as possible before the trainees go to sea,” Ranson added. “There is no margin for error when operating with live aircraft on a real flight deck at sea.” A Merlin helicopter flies near a pair of “faux fighter” F-35Bs at Culdrose., Crown Copyright Of course, Ranson and his charges have few other options for reasons we at The War Zone explored in depth in our profile of the Queen Elizabeth ’s first trip out to sea. To make a long story short, in light of the Joint Strike Fighter programs delays and increasing costs, the U.K. Ministry of Defense continues to review just how many of the fighters it intends to buy in total for both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy’s Fleet Air Arm. The U.K.’s defense establishment has not yet offered an official estimate for how much it expects its full Joint Strike Fighter purchases to cost and it is unclear how much it has already invested in the American-led program. As of January 2017, the United Kingdom was still officially committed to at least purchasing 138 jets. However, in June 2017, The Times of London reported that the Fleet Air Arm might ultimately receive as few as 48 F-35Bs. The present configuration of the Queen Elizabeth -class – which will include the namesake ship and her sister HMS Prince of Wales – only supports short/vertical takeoff and landing capable aircraft such as the Joint Strike Fighter’s B model, as well as helicopters. Manufacturer Lockheed Martin says it has delivered and has on order fewer than 10 of the stealthy jets in total to the United Kingdom. All of these are or will be committed to flight training and developmental duties. One of the model F-35Bs in front of a retired Sea Harrier also in use at Culdrose as a ground training aid., Crown Copyright So, before the fiberglass substitutes arrived, the deck handling trainees had been running through their practice sessions with a relatively ad hoc group of aircraft including at least one tired, “unwanted” Sea Harrier jump jet. The aircraft is at least semi-functional, able to run up its engine enough to give crews a sense of the “the noise and the smell” of working on an actual flight deck, according to Ranson. He noted that the aircraft was no representative in any other way of the F-35B, which is substantially larger and heavier. “The new training aids are really life-like and above all they give a sense of realism to the training here,” Ranson explained. “To have these life-size replicas of the real thing is so important, invaluable actually.” Crown Copyright Pictures show that even with the new mockups, crews are still working with the Sea Harrier, which is more than a little ironic. In a particularly controversial decision , the Royal Navy sold off nearly all of these perfectly good jump jets after retiring its last aircraft carrier, the HMS Ark Royal , in 2011. Maintaining these aircraft would have guaranteed the new flattops had at least some fixed-wing capability if there were delays in getting sufficient numbers of F-35s. Now, even with the Queen Elizabeth now out for her first set of open sea evaluations, the service effectively has no fixed-wing aircraft ready for carrier operations. Officials actually put another fiberglass model , this one from Lockheed Martin itself, on the ship’s deck during its official naming ceremony back in 2014. The training program at Culdrose does have at least one Merlin helicopter for personnel to practice with, a type that is in active service and will be another important part of future carrier air wings. Another model F-35B sits on Queen Elizabeth ‘s ski jump during her naming ceremony in 2014., AP The Royal Navy does hope to integrate real F-35Bs into the practice sessions as soon as they’re available. The U.K. Ministry of Defense’s Strategic Defense and Security Review in 2015 stated that the RAF and Royal Navy should be sharing a fleet of at least 42 jets by 2023, with 18 set aside specifically for various training purposes. In the meantime, the faux fighters at Culdrose will continue to be an essential tool to prepare sailors for their future duties aboard Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Congress Could Throw Millions Into the Defense Budget for New A-10 Wings,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Congress moves forward crafting the next annual defense budget, the House of Representatives looks set to add more than 100 million more to continue the desperately needed re-winging program for the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Warthog ground attack jets. However, it’s not clear whether the proposals will include additional language compelling the service to maintain the size of the fleet overall . On June 26, 2017, the House Armed Services Committee released Chairman Mac Thornberry’s mark of the proposed Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Bill. The proposed plan adds $103 million for an unspecified “unfunded requirement” for the A-10s. However, this is an identical figure to the one the Air Force said it needed for more Warthog replacement wings in its so-called “ unfunded priorities list ,” a wish list it sends to Congress every year, which the service released earlier in June 2017. It’s not clear what this amount pays for exactly. When Boeing won a previous contract to re-wing the A-10s, it reportedly cost less than $10 million per aircraft. According to the Air Force’s unfunded requirements document, this infusion of money is enough to pay for an initial batch of four sets of wings. This suggests most of the funds will actually go to rebooting the production of the spans to begin with. The Air Force has said it will hold a competition to select who will built the components, rather than just giving the new work to Boeing again, according to Defense News . There’s no indication of when the work would actually start. Still, “their wings don’t all run out of service life at the same time, it depends on the individual airplane,” Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of head of Air Combat Command, the service’s top warfighting command, had told Defense News on June 8, 2017. “We have the money in the unfunded list to get another contract for wings and to get a batch that would help us work through a period and give us time to buy more wings for the rest of the fleet if we are unable to go forward to drop down to six squadrons.” USAF Aircraft that have already received the wings now have enough estimated flight hours to stay airworthy through at least 2040, which is good considering the near constant demand for the low- and slow-flying planes. As of 2017, the Air Force had more than 280 A-10s across nine “combat-coded” squadrons in both its active component and the Air National Guard. The venerable jets were actively flying combat missions in Iraq and Syria against ISIS, as well as standing guard on the Korean Peninsula. In recent years, the iconic ground attackers had deployed to various locations in Europe to deter Russian aggression , as well as the Philippines for training exercises that pointedly challenged Chinese claims in the South China Sea. But while Congress’ plans to add more money might keep the re-wing project alive, it doesn’t necessarily put a stop to any new Air Force shenanigans. As we at The War Zone have reported many times before , the Air Force has a long and complicated relationship with the aircraft and has repeatedly attempted to retire it, even in the face of opposition from Congress and elsewhere within the U.S. military. When the service released a detailed outline of its latest budget request in May 2017, it stated that the A-10 fleet was “ fully funded ” for at least five more years. What it didn’t spell out was plans to cut three full squadrons by 2030, a process that would likely begin years earlier. This emerged at House Armed Services Committee Hearing on June 7, 2017, where Air Force Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Requirements, and Air Force Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the service’s top uniformed acquisition officer, discussed the overall budget proposal. “It’s the first time you’ve publicly said that you are going to go down to six squadrons,” Representative Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican and former Warthog pilot, said after hearing these comments. “I’d really like to know what those planning assumptions are of the six squadrons.” Even with the additional re-wing funds, it’s important to note that if money does indeed only covers wings on four aircraft, there are dozens of aircraft still in need of the new spans to continue safe flying. In addition, this doesn’t take into account the need for other upgrades to make sure the aircraft can continue to talk and share data with other aircraft and ground forces, as well as make the jets themselves more survivable. In late 2016, the Air Force had to shift money around in order to add the V12 Lightweight Airborne Recovery System (LARS)/Combat Survivor Evader Locator (CSEL) to less than 20 aircraft headed to Iraq and Syria. The system lets the pilots better communicate with downed aircrew, pararescue personnel, and joint terminal air controllers, as well as providing their GPS coordinates to help prevent friendly fire incidents. “If funding is not received, time to locate/recover downed personnel could increase, along with increased risk of injury, death, or hostage situations,” the Air Force declared in its request to Congress to reappropriate the necessary funds. A separate request in 2016 asked for additional funding for improvements to the Warthog’s self-protection and electronic warfare equipment, a project that had first started in the 2014 fiscal year. “Currently, the A-10 aircraft is incapable of using self-protection flares and chaff while landing gear is down during take-offs and landings due to the lack of an effective weight on wheels indicator,” the Air Force explained. “Additionally, Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) pods are not currently connected to the Electronic Warfare (EW) Multiplex (MUX); therefore, the A-10 aircraft is lacking critical EW capability. If additional funds are not provided, aircraft and pilot survivability are threatened.” USAF Beyond that, there is no indication that any re-wing program will fundamentally change the Air Force’s existing plans as it remains committed to replacing the A-10 with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Congress has not been swayed by this argument in the past, including language in annual defense spending bills halting any changes to the Warthog fleet until the service has proven it has a viable alternative to the jet’s as yet unmatched ability to provide close air support to troops on the ground. In January 2017, Air Force Brigadier General Scott Pleus, the head of the service’s F-35 Program Integration Office, said a planned fly-off between the Warthog and the Joint Strike Fighter could begin as early as 2018 . At the same time, the Air Force is pushing ahead with an experimental light attack aircraft test , commonly referred to as OA-X. There is no clear indication how the results of either of these evaluations will impact the service’s future force structure and there is no money available yet to buy any OA-X aircraft. With legislators like McSally on the House Armed services Committee, it seems almost a given that the final fiscal year 2018 national defense authorization act will again include steps the Air Force needs to take before it can send any A-10s to the Boneyard for good. But, especially given the Air Force’s historical attitude, the bigger issue will likely be the general condition of the remaining Warthogs in the meantime.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 21, 2019",Legislators Want To Know Fate Of Navy’s Reserve F/A-18 Aggressor Squadrons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has already announced plans buy more F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and upgrade others to a new, even more capable Block III configuration. Now Congress wants to know what the service plans to do about its oldest Hornets. On June 26, 2017, the House Armed Services Committee released Chairman Mac Thornberry’s mark of the proposed Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Bill. In it, the Texas Republican pointed out his committee’s concern about the “health and readiness” of the U.S. Navy Reserve’s fleet of more than 30 aging F/A-18A+ Hornets and included language that would require the service to brief legislators on a plan of action no later than Dec. 1, 2017. Here are the bulk of the comments: The committee remains concerned over the health and readiness of the Navy Reserve combat air fleet. The committee is aware that the Navy Reserve tactical aviation squadrons provide critical adversary support and strike fighter weapons training to Active Duty forces, and must maintain a high mobilization readiness level as the sole strategic reserve available to the U.S. Navy. The committee understands the Navy Reserve currently operates 33 legacy F/A-18A+ aircraft that are currently shared between 2 squadrons. The committee notes that with an average airframe age of 30 years and onboard systems that are no longer compatible with today’s Carrier Air Wing, these aircraft are increasingly less capable than the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The committee believes this could impact the ability of these two Navy Reserve squadrons in meeting requirements for advanced strike employment, as well as simulating current advanced threat aircraft. The committee also believes these legacy F/A-18A+ aircraft need to be recapitalized with next generation capability in order to provide realistic threat representative training for naval aviators and to maintain operational readiness that provides a relevant and deployable backstop to the Active Duty air wings. Fighter Composite Squadron One Two (VFC-12), situated at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, and Strike Fighter Squadron Two Zero Four (VFA-204), based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans in Louisiana, are the two units in question. The version of the Hornet they fly is among the oldest anywhere in the U.S. military, having rolled off the production line in the 1980s. The “+” nomenclature refers to aircraft that had a faster scanning and generally more powerful AN/APG-73 radar instead of the original AN/APG-65, which required a modified nose section. The planes also had other more minor improvements. That upgrade project began in 1992. One of VFC-12’s F/A-18A+ aircraft., USN As noted in Thornberry’s mark, the primary job of both of these squadrons is to provide fleet adversary support various training exercises. Most of VFC-12’s and VFA-204’s aircraft even wear camouflage schemes similar to Russian fighter jets , along with small red stars and other markings, in order to complete their adversary look. VFA-204 has a secondary job of acting as a reserve force in times of crisis, proudly boasting in its annual histories, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, that it is “the Navy Reserve’s only remaining Strike Fighter Squadron available for contingency deployment.” This means VFA-204 has to head to the boat for carrier qualifications from time to time. Based on those historical records, here’s a year in the life of the New Orleans-based squadron. In 2015, detachments attended a total of 11 different training events worthy of mention in the annual chronology, taking place in Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, and Virginia.  During these deployments, the reserve aviators prepared active duty units for deployment overseas, acted as the adversaries during other air-to-air exercises, and helped Joint Tactical Air Controllers call in mock air strikes. In addition, the pilots also participated in a live-fire exercise to keep their own skills up, firing a total of seven missiles of unspecified types – almost undoubtedly a combination of AIM-9 Sidewinders and AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, the aircraft’s main air-to-air weapons. One of VFA-204’s F/A-18A+ aircraft during carrier qualifications., USN But as Thornberry explains in his mark, the F/A-18A+ in its present form simply cannot touch the performance of the Navy’s current Super Hornets. Without substantial improvements, the jets are even lacking in comparison to slightly newer legacy F/A-18C/D Hornets, which have, among other things, more powerful engines and improved avionics. This brings up questions about whether or not the jets are even still representative in training scenarios where they are supposed to mimic current and emergent threats. And then there’s just the basic safety of the jets. In the past few years, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy Blue Angels have been literally flying their C/D models to pieces. The Marines, who have picked over aircraft in the Boneyard and at least one in a museum in desperate attempts to keep their legacy Hornet fleet ready, complain that roughly 70 percent of their Hornet force cannot fly at any given time. There is a real concern that without a substantial overhaul, the Navy Reserve planes may simply start falling out of the sky. USN via FOIA Of course, this isn’t a new issue, as both squadrons have been flying these jets for years now. A 2014 Naval Air Reserve Force briefing, which the author also obtained through FOIA, made it clear that without any plans to recapitalize the A+ model hornets, the squadrons would be at half strength by 2022 at the latest and their jets would be “all dead by 2028.” So, if the National Defense Authorization Bill passes into law with this language intact, it seems likely that the Navy would present at least three options to Congress to redress this issue. The first and most obvious option would be to upgrade VFC-12 and VFA-204’s Hornets to the existing A++ configuration , which includes additional improvements that make the aircraft much closer in capability to the latest C/D models and which extends the aircraft’s service life out to 10,000 hours. According to the Navy’s own budget request for the 2018 fiscal year , the existing A++ jets have an average of more than 2,200 hours of service life remaining, while the older A+ versions generally have less than 300 hours left on their airframes. An F/A-18E Super Hornet., USN This limited upgrade, combined with existing Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) plans, would probably make the most fiscal sense, especially for two squadrons that do not regularly see active duty or combat. It may even make sense to refocus VFA-204 on the training mission entirely, joining the ranks of a number of heavily tasked dedicated aggressor squadrons in both the U.S. Air Force and Navy. There is a good argument to be made that continuing to train for emergency deployments, whether embarked on carriers or situated at forward land bases, is a distraction from units’ core proficiency. However, there is a lot of evidence to suggest the Navy Reserve will push hard to replace the jets entirely with F/A-18E Super Hornets. This has been their preferred recapitalization plan since at least 2014. With the passage of the Budget Control Act in 2011 and mandatory caps to defense spending as part of a process known as sequestration, the Navy continually deferred on the matter. Instead, the request for 24 all new jets at a cost of more than $1.3 billion repeatedly ended up in unfunded requirement “wish lists” for National Guard and Reserve Equipment (NGRE). USN via FOIA Since lawmakers and the Trump Administration are now both advocating for significant increases in defense spending, both Congress and the Navy may be more inclined to consider this option. The service has already announced its intention to buy dozens more Super Hornets, and F/A-18E’s would give these units the ability to represent emerging threats far better than their tired A+ Hornets. However, legislators may still not be convinced that spending more than a billion dollars to buy state-of-the-art jets for the reserve units is a good investment, especially considering the more pressing need of active duty squadrons still flying aging legacy C/D model Hornets. The last option, of course, would be to shut down VFC-12 and VFA-204 entirely. Especially in light of the previous budget cuts, there had already been talk that this route might be the most fiscally responsible. However, the squadron leaderships in particular resisted this push, arguing that their adversary experience was irreplaceable. Without VFC-12 and VFA-204, and with the Air Force having trimmed its own similar specialized air-to-air aggressor units , the Pentagon would have to rely even more on private contractors to provide these services. The Navy Reserve would still retain two additional aggressor squadrons with the F-5N aircraft , along with the active duty Hornets and Vipers assigned to Topgun. Getting the F/A-18E would be a major leap in capability for VFA-204 and VFC-12, including the introduction of a highly-capable AESA radar, more advanced avionics, including the latest data-links and a helmet-mounted sight. The E would also provide longer endurance, the ability to field an IRST and better reliability. Still, the F/A-18A+s are among the most nimble Hornets ever built, but the low-speed handling qualities of the Super Hornet would allow for better replication of advanced Flanker threat profiles ., USN But Congress deciding to take this route is really very unlikely. Both reserve units are heavily tasked with adversary support missions, and if anything the Navy needs more capacity in this realm, not less. Even the Marine Corps is looking to expand itt F-5E fleet and add turboprop aircraft just to attempt to stay on top of its organic aggressor support needs. There’s still no guarantee this provision will make it into the final National Defense Authorization Act. If it does, Thornberry and his committee will have to decide whether it makes sense to get the Navy Reserve Hornet squadrons new or just upgraded planes – or if it makes sense in the end to keep them around at all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 9, 2018",All You Need To Know About The Royal Navy’s New Carrier And Its Maiden Voyage,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has set sail for the first time ever for her first sea trials, an event the United Kingdom, its allies, and potential opponents such as Russia will surely be watching intently. However she performs, the Royal Navy still has a long way to go in getting the flattop combat ready, especially given that it has not yet taken delivery of a substantial number of the ship’s most important weapon, the F-35B . On June 26, 2017, Queen Elizabeth pushed off from her moorings at Rosyth Dockyard on the Firth of Forth in Scotland. The ship will undergo approximately six weeks of tests and evaluations in the North Sea before returning to the shipyard to correct any issues. Afterwards, she is set to move to her home port of Portsmouth and enter service. “I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,” Royal Navy Captain Jerry Kydd, the carrier’s commanding officer, said ahead of the event, according to the BBC . “Submarines you can’t see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection.” It’s true that aircraft carriers are especially symbolic of a country’s military power. The simple movement of U.S. Navy carriers toward a hot spot is often enough to prompt speculation of increased tensions or an imminent conflict. The Queen Elizabeth -class, which will also include the HMS Prince of Wales , will be the Royal Navy’s first aircraft carriers since the service decommission HMS Ark Royal in 2011 in no small part due to budget cuts. The U.K. Ministry of Defense also plans to retire HMS Ocean , a smaller helicopter carrier and current Royal Navy flagship, in 2018, some time before either of the new flattops are ready for action. AP If all goes according to plan, they will be significantly more capable than either of these older ships. Ark Royal had a displacement of 22,000 tons and an overall length of just less than 690 feet. By comparison, the Queen Elizabeth -class have a displacement of 65,000 tons and a length of more than 900 feet, which will make them the largest ships to ever serve with the Royal Navy. The new British flattops are still smaller than American supercarriers, with the up-coming Ford -class having a displacement of approximately 100,000 tons and a length of nearly 1,110 feet. They will use a ski jump to help launch their F-35Bs, and the jets will recover via vertical landing or a short rolling landing when the mission is over . While this configuration has traditionally meant it takes longer for multiple planes to get airborne, the ship’s large, open flight deck has the potential to speed up the process considerably. ACA Given the sheer size of the ship the Royal Navy and shipbuilding consortium Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) – a public-private partnership that includes the U.K. Ministry of Defense, BAE Systems, Babock International, and Thales UK – have already had to spend considerable time planning just how to get Queen Elizabeth out of port. They even made a more than two minute long animated video to show the process of moving the ship from Rosyth into the Firth of Forth and finally out onto the open seas. A small armada of nearly a dozen tugs got her out of the dockyard, where she had less than 150 feet of clearance with the seabed and at times came within less than 120 feet of the shore. Afterwards, she needed to wait for the tide to go down in order to squeak under four fixed bridges before finally making it out onto the North Sea. The ship’s design had a folding masthead specifically to deal with this issue, as well. The U.K.’s Ministry of Defense had to spent considerable time and money in order to upgrade Her Majesty’s Naval Base Portsmouth in order to accommodate the new ships, including dredging more than 81 million cubic feet of clay, sand, and gravel from both the harbor itself and the channel that connects it to the sea. “They are the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy,” the Royal Navy’s official website for Queen Elizabeth declares. “Four acres of sovereign territory, deployable across the globe to serve the United Kingdom on operations for 50 years.” Since the ship itself, as well as its first trip to sea, is so monumental, there is an expectation that the Russians will at least shadow the carrier’s trials. The Royal Navy routinely tails the Kremlin’s warships as they pass through the North Sea and the English Channel . But in light of cool relations between the Kremlin and NATO as a whole over Russia’s continued interference in the conflict in Ukraine and support for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, there is also the concern the Russian forces may be more inclined to snoop more closely on the evaluations or even harass the ships. Since 2014, Russian aircraft have performed unsafe maneuvers near both NATO warships and planes in and around the Baltic and Black Seas and other locales. But Captain Kydd and the rest of Queen Elizabeth ’s crew, as well as the Royal Navy as a whole, may be more focused on performing well in front of domestic critics. In March 2017, the U.K.’s National Audit Office, a top government watchdog akin to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, reported that the aircraft carrier program was entering “critical phase” and still had a number of risks left to mitigate. The sea trials are already three months behind schedule due to largely unspecified technical problems. A big question surrounds the basic issue of whether or not ships like Queen Elizabeth are worth the cost – 6 billion pounds for the pair, or more than $7.5 billion at the exchange rate at the time of writing – given the United Kingdom’s strategic priorities and the kind of conflict’s the country’s military has been involved in for years. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were and continue to be characterized in large part by manned and unmanned aircraft and special operations forces. Budget austerity and fears about the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union, more commonly known as Brexit , only raise additional questions about whether the country can really afford two supercarriers and enough planes and helicopters to make them truly useful. This latter point may be the most important factor. At the 2017 Paris Air Show, Royal Navy Rear Admiral Keith Blount, the Fleet Air Arm’s Head of Fighting Arm, disclosed that the Queen Elizabeth ’s full air wing would ultimately include just 24 short/vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35Bs, even though it could accommodate as many as 36 of the jets. A typical U.S. Navy carrier air wing has between 44 and 48 F/A-18C/D Hornets or F/A-18E/F Super Hornets at present. There’s a question of whether the ship can even support In addition, he added that the ships may operate instead as amphibious assault ships without any Joint Strike Fighters at all. In this “Littoral Manoeuvre” or “Lit-M” configuration, British Army Apache gunships and Royal Navy Wildcat light helicopters would provide support for up to 12 transport choppers. The entire force would be able to rapidly deploy up two companies of Royal Marines in an initial assault during expeditionary operations. HMS Ocean has performed similar duties in the past, including during the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011. However, as Queen Elizabeth takes to the sea, the United Kingdom effectively has no aircraft for it or Prince of Wales. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy together expect to receive a total of 138 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters from American plane-maker Lockheed Martin. As of 2017, the country had received or had on order less than 10 of the jets, all of which are set aside for developmental and training purposes. British pilots have also been training on American aircraft. AP Delays and cost overruns have bedeviled the American end of the F-35 program. Even though Lockheed and the Pentagon say they are now making steady progress, both the U.S. Air Force and Navy have begun investing considerable time and money into upgrading existing fourth-generation fighter aircraft. The U.K’s Ministry of Defense has declined to release an estimate on how much its expects the full fleet of F-35s will ultimately cost, despite reports in February 2017 that Great Britain had just contributed another 4 billion pounds to the program. There is the very real potential the British may decide to trim their own purchases, too. Earlier in June 2017, The Times of London reported that the Royal Air Force was pushing for a reduction in the planned purchases of F-35Bs in order to free up funds for the conventional F-35A model. The proposal would potential cut the total number of B models to as few as 48. “Decisions on the precise details will be taken at the appropriate time to ensure the most appropriate capability and the best value for money,” was all the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense would say on the record to The Times . An RAF F-35B takes off from Edwards Air Force Base in California in January 2015, USAF A fleet of 48 F-35Bs would prevent both Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales from operating with a full complement of strike aircraft, based on the official plan, especially since its unlikely the Royal Navy would have all of its Joint Strike Fighters embarked at any one time. The Royal Navy has already said what it would do with its first 42 F-35Bs, which were supposed to be in operation by 2023. Under the scheme 24 will be used for the deployment on carriers and 18 will be used for training. Relying on a ski jump and vertical landings instead of catapults and arresting gear to launch and recover aircraft, the ships require a short take-off and vertical landing optimized aircraft like the Joint Strike Fighter’s B version, too. So if something happens to the Royal Navy’s F-35B plans, there are no readily available alternatives. The service sold off its entire remaining fleet of perfectly capable Harrier jump jets after announcing it would retire Ark Royal in 2010. There’s no getting them back, either, since the U.S. Marine Corps promptly snatched up the aircraft to help sustain its own Harrier fleet. AP So, it’s more than a little ironic that the Royal Navy has turned to the American Marines to help make up this obvious and apparently long expected short-fall in actual aircraft. In December 2016, the two parties agreed that the Marines, who also fly the B model and have declared their jets have reached initial operational capability, would operate from the deck of Queen Elizabeth during her first operational patrol. Rear Admiral Blount confirmed this plan in his presentation in Paris. It’s not clear when that might be, but the U.K. Ministry of Defense insist the ship and its air arm will be fully operational by 2026. Even with a full contingent of F-35s, the rest of the Air Wing, made up entirely of helicopters, might not be able to keep up or adequately support the ship’s fixed wing operations. Unlike the U.S. or the French and their E-2 Hawkeye radar aircraft to provide airborne early warning functions, the British carriers will rely on Merlin Helicopters carrying the mechanically-scanned Crowsnest radar for air and surface search duties. The Queen Elizabeth’s air arm lacks any airborne tankers or carrier onboard delivery aircraft, too. This could hamper offensive operations and slow resupply for such a big ship, especially in time critical situations. Though an expensive option, the Royal Navy could possibly piggyback on the U.S. Navy’s CMV-22B Osprey program, which that service hopes will perform the critical carry onboard delivery mission. USN The Osprey could also perform tanker duties for F-35Bs and even embarked helicopters. It could also perform the airborne early warning function in a far more capable manner than the low-flying and short-ranged Merlin. There are configurations in the works for the Osprey to do just that and the UK previously considered an airborne early warning aircraft based on the V-22. Once again, the investment may be steep, but the Osprey is uniquely suited to enable the Queen Elizabeth class in so many ways, and not procuring the type will handicap these ships and their aircraft. Lockheed Martin The idea of a supercarrier without aircraft may not be what anyone had in mind, though. There were rumors earlier in June 2017 that the situation had led to dangerously low morale among the sailors chosen to join Queen Elizabeth ’s first crew. A report in The Telegraph based on statements from unnamed sources blamed some of the delays in getting the ship out for sea trails on service members “abandoning” the assignment because it was “dull” and what was effectively a skeleton crew meant more work for everyone. According to ACA, the two new carriers will ultimately have a full crew of 1,600, including air wing personnel during cruises, but Queen Elizabeth is heading out with its core crew of 700 for her initial evaluation which won’t include any air wing personnel. Even taking into account its smaller size, compared to a typical U.S. Navy carrier with its embarked air wing, both of these figures seem low. A Nimitz -class carrier has a crew of 3,200 without the air wing, which raises the final total to over 5,500 personnel. Beyond the issues with carrier’s aviation element, there is just the matter of what it takes to support one carrier, let alone two. No matter how their air wings are configured, the Royal Navy would need to commit significant numbers of escorting ships, such as destroyers, frigates, logistical ships and submarines to each deployment. A typical U.S. Navy carrier battle group includes a guided missile cruiser, three destroyers, and at least one Los Angeles -class attack submarine, not mention the logistical ships that support the Strike Group. As of 2017, the Royal Navy had six Type 45 destroyers and seven Astute – and Trafalgar -class attack submarines in total, plus another 13 Type 23 frigates . This all calls into question the ability of the Royal Navy to operate both ships by itself and may imply a need for increased cooperation with allies, such as the United States, for expeditionary or forward-deployed operations. ACA Perhaps this might help explain why ACA has been particularly proud of the ship’s ability to feed the full crew complement. An official infographic noted each carrier would be able to store 64,800 eggs, 28,800 strips of back, and 12,000 cans of baked beans, key components of a traditional English breakfast. The ability of the ship’s kitchens to churn out meals for the 700 initial crew within 90 minutes – or just 45 minutes with personnel at “action stations” – was among nine major official figures BBC cited in its profile of the ship’s first sea voyage. With its key capabilities under seemingly perpetual review, there might not be much else to talk about. In short, the Queen Elizabeth -class has a lot to offer, but a lot of its actual operational capability will depend on how the Royal Navy decides to operate both ships. And for Ministry of Defense’s budget constrained force, a new model of close cooperation or shared operation with allies might become essential for getting the most of these carriers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2019","U.S. Threatens Syria, Russia, and Iran Over Potential Chemical Attack","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The White House appears to have issued a new ultimatum regarding the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons without consulting U.S. military commanders. At the same time, the Pentagon is already struggling to keep its activities in the country focused on ISIS and not let the situation explode into a multifaceted fight involving dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies. Late on June 26, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement warning of a potential new Syrian military chemical weapons strike aimed at innocent civilians. The notice included a threat pointed directly at Assad and his military. “As we have previously stated, the United States is in Syria to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,” Spicer wrote. “If, however, Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price.” Other members of President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed the message, which was akin to President Barack Obama’s infamous “red line” comments on the Syrian regime’s use of chemical warfare in the country’s long running and brutal civil war. The U.S. military had already conducted a punitive and largely ineffectual cruise missile attack on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base after an earlier chemical weapons incident in the town of Khan Shaykhun on April 4, 2017. USAF In that strike, the Pentagon had alerted Russian forces ahead of time via a hotline the two had previously established to deconflict air operations the region. There were reports that the Kremlin had advisers at the base at the time, but it was unclear if they knew or were otherwise involved in the employment of chemical weapons. In a Tweet, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley made it clear the Trump Administration would hold Russian and Iranian authorities equally responsible for any future incidents. “Any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people,” she declared. Not surprisingly, Syria and Russia denied planning any chemical weapons attacks. the Kremlin decried the White House message as “ unacceptable .” Relations between Washington, Moscow, and Tehran are already cool for a variety of reasons. With regards to Russia, American officials have repeatedly accused the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , and remain unhappy with Moscow’s continued interference in Ukraine and support for Assad. Officials in Washington have long condemned Iran’s continued nuclear ambitions, ballistic missile developments, and support for terrorist groups aboard. On June 15, 2017, the U.S. Senate voted for its latest round of sanctions on both countries. All of this has recently become wrapped up in a broader crisis in the Middle East , centered on a political dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, too. But more importantly, it wasn’t entirely clear what prompted the flurry of threats. According to Fox News, unnamed U.S. defense officials confirmed intelligence showed new “activity” near a hangar associated with the April 2017 chemical attack. They did not seem to suggest the information implied an imminent movement of weapons ahead of a new strike. Buzzfeed News said they reached five more anonymous sources , who all said they were unsure what specific information had led the White House to make the announcement. One individual, reportedly from U.S. Central Command, the U.S. military’s top warfighting headquarters for the Middle East and Central Asia, said they had “no idea” about the content of the press release or its origins. The Pentagon, the State Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have all referred journalists seeking answers to the White House. “We are letting the statement speak for itself,” Marc Raimondi, a National Security Council spokesman at the White House, told The New York Times . U.S. special operators in Syria ride in a Pandur armored vehicle., DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images All the indications are that, while there may be intelligence evidence to support it, the Trump Administration went ahead with this statement without coordinating with its military officials at home or in the region. This is especially concerning given that American troops in Syria, ostensibly working with local rebels to fight ISIS terrorists, have continued to creep closer to a broader conflict with the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers, all of who the White House has now threatened publicly. It also seems to fly in the face of recent comments Secretary of Defense Mattis had just made on the need to keep focused on the counter-terrorism mission. “How do you avoid mission creep?” Mattis said on June 26, 2017 en route to Germany and Brussels for meetings with NATO allies. “You stay focused on where the enemy is and you set up any number of coordination efforts if you’re getting near converging forces, either Assad regime or Russian. You have to assume there are either Iranian officered or Lebanese Hezbollah elements with them. So what we do is we keep moving against ISIS.” “‘As you mix more forces more closely together,’ the risk increases,” he continued, according to Stars and Stripes . “You’ve got to really play this thing very carefully. … The closer we get [to defeating ISIS] the more complex it gets.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=9uPJD7DwPBA He’s definitely not wrong. That the United States is only in Syria to fight ISIS and has no desire to violently unseat Assad, who has waged a separate and brutal civil war against his own people since 2011, has long been the Pentagon’s official line. American forces operate under a complicated and sometimes dubious set of legal authorities. The primary justification is the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, which turned the U.S. military loose against Al Qaeda and its affiliates worldwide. The U.S. government’s position is that ISIS is just the latest incarnation of Al Qaeda’s franchise in Iraq and therefore covered under the existing statute. To aid in this counter-terrorism campaign, however, the Pentagon and American intelligence agencies have enlisted the help of Arab and Kurdish rebel groups who have or may even continue to express a desire to ultimately see Assad deposed and a new Syrian regime emerge. In the case of Kurdish groups, specifically the People’s Protection Units, more commonly known by its acronym YPG, they may even have designs on a new, independent state. SDF fighters look out over the city of Tabqa in Syria in April 2017., AP On the other side, Syrian government and its allies insist there is no meaningful distinction between “terrorists” battling the Assad regime and Islamist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda. Conspiracy theories abound about the United States and its allies, chiefly Saudi Arabia, actively sponsoring terrorists. They also question the true motives of officials in Washington, especially after the missile strike on Shayrat. Russian and Iranian motivations to support the government in Damascus seem more rooted in strategic geopolitical calculations, as we are The War Zone have already written about extensively. As ISIS’ shadow state crumbles and the group increasingly goes underground, the conflicting goals of these different actors have become increasingly apparent. Assad and his partners know that once the terrorists cease to be a significant threat, the same groups the United States supports are likely to turn their attention back to the regime. American forces have already found themselves in the middle of an on-again off-again battle between its NATO ally Turkey and Kurdish forces. Turkish officials have been less than convinced by U.S. government pronouncements that it can recover weapons from Kurdish groups it sees as enemies of the state. So it’s not surprising that since the beginning of June 2017, U.S. troops in the country have increasingly come under threat from both the Syrian regime and Iranian-backed militias. On June 8, 2017, the U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle shot down an apparent Shahed 129 drone that attempted to attack an American-supported garrison in the southern Syrian town of At Tanf, a strategic location near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. The unmanned aircraft may have attempted to drop a small precision guided munitions on Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) forces and their U.S. advisers. On June 20, 2017, another Strike Eagle blew up a second Shahed 129 in the same area. In between, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet blasted a Syrian Arab Air Force Su-22 Fitter ground attack jet out of the sky after it struck Syrian Defense Force (SDF) elements – a coalition of groups including the SAC and the YPG – near the equally important Al Tabqa Dam . All of this has only further inflamed existing tensions. After the Su-22 shoot down in particular, Russia initially threatened to target American warplanes with its own air defenses in Syria, including its long range S-300 surface-to-air missile batteries. Officials in Moscow later walked these statements back, which only served to highlight just how fluid the situation could be on the ground and in the air. Another attack, especially one that kills U.S. troops, could easily spark a major international incident where all the parties involved might find it difficult to deescalate away quickly or at all because of their past public statements. To further underscore the dangers inherent in the Pentagon’s operations Syria, despite official statements , its attempts to use the deconfliction hotline with the Russians to prevent these incidents to begin with appear to have largely failed. Realistically, how could it be any other way? The connection only exists because of a fragile agreement between U.S. and Russia and only links their regional commanders at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Latakia Air Base in Syria respectively. It does not offer any direct communication between American personnel and Syrian, Iranian, or militia forces. The Pentagon routinely confirms as much in the language of its press releases, saying thing such as “The Coalition has made it clear to all parties publicly and through the de-confliction line with Russian forces ” – our emphasis added. This means a representative of U.S. government calls an individual answering on behalf of Russian authorities and Russian authorities alone. The American can insist that they pass the information along to their partners, but there is no indication there is any follow-up or repercussions if the message doesn’t go through or doesn’t have the desired effect. It seems unwise to rely at all on this mechanism to halt aggressive movements against U.S. forces or their partners, especially after the attack on Shayrat, which only seemed to push Russia and Syria closer together. “We just refuse to get drawn into a fight there in the Syria civil war,” Mattis insisted to the reporters traveling with him to Europe. Unfortunately, while the United States might not be interested in getting involved in the Syrian civil war, that conflict is increasingly poised to involve Americans, whether they like it or not – if it hasn’t already. The Trump administration’s threat, especially in light of Trump’s own criticism of Obama’s “red line” statement, only makes it harder for the Pentagon that war separate from its campaign against ISIS.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 17, 2019",The U.S. Air Force Wants to Buy More Reliable Bunker Buster Bombs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is moving ahead with plans to buy new 2,000-pound class bunker buster bombs, built around an improved warhead called the BLU-137/B. This type will ultimately replace existing weapons in this category, which have already been a key part of the fight against ISIS. On June 22, 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center issued a formal request for proposals looking for vendors who are interested in building an initial limited run of 1,000 munitions, plus four additional full production lots of 1,000 bombs each. The service had first released a draft version of the contract in December 2016. “The [U.S.] Government has a requirement to replace the BLU-109/B and BLU-109C/B with the BLU-137/B penetrator warhead to obtain necessary improvements to capability and survivability of the 2,000lb class penetrator,” according to the solicitation’s statement of work. “Foreign participation is not authorized,” the notice on FedBizOpps, the U.S. federal government’s main contracting website adds. In development since at least 2015, there aren’t a lot of details about the BLU-137/B or its features. However, the Air Force’s 2018 fiscal year budget request did add one important piece of information: “The BLU-137 will increase fuze survivability when used against bunkers, aircraft shelters, and reinforced targets.” In short, this new model will more reliability explode after punching through its target. The proposed budget also noted that, at present, the BLU-137/B will only work with a modified Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS guidance kit including a new tail assembly with an Arming Generator Relocator Adaptor (AGRA). This new rear portion costs more than a traditional JDAM tail assembly for 2,000 pound class bombs, but helps ensure the fuze functions and the weapon detonates properly, likely by moving the power source away from the impact point. The BLU-109/B series works with both the Paveway-series laser guidance and the JDAM kits. On March 30, 2017, the Air Force announced it had hired Boeing to design this new tail version specifically for the improved penetrator. The initial contract was worth up to $7,367,000 for work on at least 1,000 tail units. The BLU-109 a la carte. , USAF All JDAM bombs with 2,000 pound class warheads of any type are known as GBU-31/Bs, with different warheads indicated by subvariant nomenclatures. For example, the GBU-31(V)3/B contains the BLU-109/B. We do not know what the specific GBU-31/B designation is when armament teams build the full bomb with the new BLU-137/B. We don’t know for sure that this is the only upgrade over the older BLU-109s, which has been in service since the 1990s, either. All of these existing 2,000 penetrators have a one inch hardened steel shell. The standard BLU-109/B has approximately 530 pounds of explosive packed inside and can break through four to six feet of reinforced concrete. The BLU-109C/B substitutes the older Tritonal explosive filler for the insensitive AFX-757, a specialized Air Force blend that is less likely to accidentally explode. Airmen work on GBU-31/B bombs., USAF In addition, according to the Air Force’s budget proposal for the 2017 fiscal year, the weapon was the result of a project known as the Advanced 2000 Pound Warhead, or A2K. That program’s requirements called for a bomb body that retained the same basic dimensions as the older BLU-109/B series. A further goal was to provide the improved features without dramatically changing the weapon’s overall mass. Keeping the dimensions and weights roughly the same would reduce or eliminate the need for additional modifications to aircraft or ground bombing handling equipment, or the purchase of all new systems, in order to use the bombs. It’s also not clear whether or not the new tail is a dramatic enough to impact how pilots will employ the weapon or if ground crews will have to go about loading them up onto aircraft any differently. The A2K requirements said the final weapon had to be able to at least work with both the F-15E Strike Eagle multi-role jet and B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Given the Air Force’s recent experience battling ISIS in Iraq and Syria, it’s very likely that they would want to quickly give other aircraft the ability to carry JDAMs with these new warheads. After the aerial campaign started in 2014, GBU-31/Bs with both standard 2,000 pound warheads and the BLU-109/B penetrators quickly became essential as the U.S. military as a whole began targeting terrorist-controlled tunnel networks and other infrastructure, including command centers inside of large buildings and oil extraction and processing facilities. As the U.S.-led coalition stepped up its bombing campaign, ISIS increasingly turned to tunnels to avoid detection and simply shelter from the bombardment. In Iraq, “Daesh continue[s] using extensive tunnel networks … as a means to avoid detection before conducting harassing attacks,” a declassified U.S. Air Force intelligence summary from July 2016, which the author obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, explained, using another common term for ISIS. In Syria, “Daesh effective use of tunnel networks … hinders effective coalition targeting,” another section of the same report noted. An A-10 Warthog ground attacker with a GBU-31/B on the centerline pylon., USAF The BLU-109/B was be a good way to get at those buried pathways and supply caches. By burrowing into specific targets, above and below ground, the bombs could potentially contain much of their blast effects closer to the point of impact, reducing the danger of collateral damage, too. This would have been a particularly important consideration in missions over densely populated cities like Ramadi and Mosul. So, it’s no surprise that official photographs have shown F-15Es, B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers, and even A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft carrying GBU-31/Bs. The GBU-31/B has been a regular part of the B-52’s load out in particular since the aircraft first arrived in theater to fight ISIS in 2016. There was no mention in the June 2017 contract announcement about whether the U.S. Navy, which has used the BLU-109A/B and BLU-109B/B in past, has expressed an interest in obtaining these new munitions. Both of these versions use another insensitive explosive, PBXN-109. In its own strikes against ISIS, the service has generally employed smaller 500- and 1,000-pound class bombs. Separately, the Air Force is also working on a replacement for the larger 4,500-pound class BLU-113/B bunker buster, too. This Advanced 5000 Pound Warhead, or A5K, does not appear to have a formal nomenclature yet. The Air Force expects to start replacing the BLU-109C/B first with the BLU-137/B beginning in either 2017 or 2018. In the meantime, you can expect to see Air Force aircraft continue dropping existing GBU-31/Bs on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",South Korea Tests Ballistic Missile That Can Hit Anywhere Inside North Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has successfully fired a fourth prototype Hyunmoo-2C short-range ballistic missile , which can reach any target in North Korea. The country’s new President Moon Jae-in lauded the test, which follows months of North Korean missile launches and escalating rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula , as in line with his administration’s foreign policy plans. On June 23, 2017, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) conducted the test at its own facility approximately 120 miles southwest of Seoul. Video of launch showed the system’s standard semi-containerized truck-mounted launcher onboard either a ship or a sea platform. ADD, the country’s state-run military research and development arm, has been responsible for developing the Hyunmoo family , which includes both ballistic and cruise missiles, since at least the late 1970s. The Hyunmoo-2C “will be a key component in our kill chain to counter possible North Korean missile attacks,” Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for President Moon’s office said after the launch . “The president’s inspection of the test firing was aimed at sending a clear warning against North Korea’s repeated provocations.” Since Moon won a special election in May 2017, following the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, North Korea has test fired five ballistic missiles, including a successful launch of a new, elongated version of the BM-25 Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile. The prototype Hyunmoo-2C flew an unspecified distance before hitting its target at sea, according to South Korean officials. The missile’s maximum range is understood to be approximately 497 miles, which is the farthest it could go under an existing U.S.-South Korean missile limitation agreement. In 1979, the United States agreed to share ballistic missile technology with its Korean ally in exchange for guarantees it would not exceed certain weight and range restrictions. This resulted in the Hyunmoo-1 ballistic missile, which South Korea derived from the American-made Nike Hercules surface-to-air missile. In the 1980s, the two parties renegotiated the terms of the agreement leading to the first versions of the Hyunmoo-2. The A model could fly 186 miles, while the B version had a range of 310 miles. In 2012, the U.S. government agreed again to up the maximum allowable characteristics, resulting in the -2C with its nearly 500 mile range. The South Korean military says that it only needs two more successful test launches before it can declare the system operational. At that time, it will have a combat-ready ballistic missile with the ability to hit anywhere inside North Korea. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and other officials watch the Hyunmoo-2C test in June 2017., AP This new test may come as a surprise to many who saw Moon’s election victory as a clear path toward de-escalating tensions between North and South Korea. He is head of South Korea’s liberal Democratic Party, which had been responsible for the so-called “Sunshine Policy” in the 1990s. Critics slammed this policy, which included increased diplomatic and economic interaction with the North, as simply enabling the brutal, repressive Communist regime and Moon seems unlikely to adopt anything similar in the near future. Instead, his opinion seems to be that improved diplomacy with the government in Pyongyang requires the security a credible deterrent capability. “I am a believer in dialogue, but I also know that dialogue is possible when we have a strong national defense,” the president, who served in the South Korean Army’s elite Special Forces during his mandatory conscription, said after the Hyunmoo-2C test. “A policy of embracing North Korea is possible when we have a defense capability that surpasses that of North Korea.” “In that sense, I believe the weapons systems ADD is developing are the means to enable dialogue and peace, instead of means to destroy or kill, and so you well deserve to take pride in ensuring our security with the strength of science,” the president continued. Truck-mounted launchers for the Hyunmoo-2, in front, and Hyunmoo-3 on parade during South Korea’s Armed Forces Day in 2013. , AP Regardless, it’s still not entirely clear how Hyunmoo-2C fits into that overall military posture. Though a ballistic missile with a conventional warhead could be useful for holding North Korea’s most remote military facilities and missile launch sites under threat, South Korea’s military can already do that with conventionally-armed cruise missiles. Seoul is not party to any deals with the United States or anyone else that limit the ranges of those low-flying weapons, either. In development since at least 2010, the Hyunmoo-3C land attack cruise missile, seen as an analogue to the American Tomahawk, has nearly twice the range of the -2C ballistic missile. With truck-mounted and submarine launch capabilities, the South Korean military has a very credible second-strike capability in the event of a North Korean surprise attack. A further improved version reportedly in development, referred to as either Hyunmoo-3D or Hyunmoo-4, could have a range of up to 1,864 miles, giving the country a regional strike capability. A Hyunmoo-3 truck-mounted launcher rolls through Seoul during the country’s 2013 Armed Forces Day, AP The War Zone has examined this issue in the past, when reported surfaced in 2016 that the South Korean Navy’s up-coming 3,000-ton Jangbogo III -class diesel-electric submarines might be able to fire variants of the Hyunmoo-2 in addition to the Hyunmoo-3. At the time, Tyler Rogoway wrote: Still, why would South Korea really need this capability at all? It already has a conventional second-strike capability , via its submarine-launched cruise missiles, and the country is not a nuclear power. Plus, South Korea is already protected under America’s nuclear umbrella. It is true that even a conventionally tipped ballistic missile is tougher to defend against and hits much harder than an air-breathing cruise missile. Maybe South Korea sees the capability as a unique conventional second-strike deterrent. after all, ballistic missiles are more capable than cruise missiles of destroying deeply-buried North Korean bunkers. This capability could make the North Korean regime more vulnerable to a decapitation strike. Then there’s the possibility that South Korea is baking future nuclear ambitions into its submarine designs. As the North Korean nuclear threat grows, and as the American presidential campaign floats potential changes in America’s military presence in the region , South Korea could make a grand strategic pivot and begin developing its own nuclear weapons . The ability to slap a few nuclear warheads onto a ballistic missile and load them into an advanced, long-diving submarine is one very powerful way to independently deter a North Korean nuclear attack—with or without America’s nuclear umbrella overhead. Whether or not it was true then, this latter point about South Korea moving away from complete reliance on America’s nuclear deterrent may be an increasingly important consideration now. Moon’s political platform includes a stated plan to adopt policies that served the country’s interest first and appears more than willing to be critical of the United States. In January 2017, he published a book that reportedly included a passage saying South Korea should learn to “say no to America.” On the campaign trail, he reiterated this point , say he would be the man to do just that if elected president. Since taking office, Moon has already shown he can stand up to American officials, halting the deployment of additional Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense systems pending a new environment review . A scandal had erupted after the country’s Ministry of National Defense allowed four more launchers into the country, deliberately declining to inform the president’s office of the move. With all this in mind, and with North Korea rapidly expanding its own ballistic missile and nuclear weapons arsenals, Moon seems likely to continue supporting development of the Hyunmoo-2 series.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 29, 2019",Lockheed Made A Three Minute Long Cartoon Just To Explain F-35’s ALIS,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A squadron of U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters is grounded due to problems with the software in its central cloud-based computer brain, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). But then again, you know something is pretty complex when the manufacturer needs a three minute animated video presentation just to explain the most basic elements of how the system is supposed to work – and doesn’t mention any potential vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. On June 22, 2017, the Marine Corps announced that it had halted Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Two One One’s (VMFA-211) flight operations at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona because of unspecified “anomalies” in the ALIS software. The unit had recently installed an upgrade within the latest software build – effectively a patch to a patch – called Version 2.0.2. Afterwards, the system began spitting out bogus maintenance codes, potentially confusing ground crews and erroneously sidelining aircraft unnecessarily. “There is nothing wrong with the performance or safety of the aircraft itself,” U.S. Marine Corps Major Kurt Stahl, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing’s director of public affairs, insisted in a statement, according to Defense News . “But it is imperative that we ensure the ground-based ALIS system is working properly before flight operations continue.” Without knowing the specifics of the situation, it’s impossible to say how significant the issue actually is for VMFA-211 or its ability to conduct missions if necessary. The faulty update appears to be isolated to the Arizona-based squadron. In this particular case, it could be more of an annoyance than anything, akin to driving your car for weeks on end with the “check engine” light on despite mechanics telling you everything’s fine. But Stahl’s comments hit at the deeper core of the issue. In spite of its name, if and when it works as intended, ALIS serves as the core operating system for software handling an amazing array of functions, streamlining and speeding up operations and possibly reducing costs in the long term. You often hear about just how many lines of actual computer code there are inside it. After sending out the Version 2.0.2 update to F-35 operators in April 2017, Lockheed subsequently released a video online detailing the system’s vital role in the stealth fighter’s day-to-day activities. “Think of ALIS like a smartphone,” the narrator says. “It has more than 65 applications that do everything from managing operations and training to maintenance and supply chain.” The “ground-based ALIS system” Stahl mentioned is Lockheed’s Standard Operating Unit (SOU), which serves as a central terminal for collecting info from the Joint Strike Fighters and supporting personnel back at base. The U.S. military refers to this segment as the “Squadron Kit.” According to the Maryland-headquartered defense contractor, each squadron is supposed to have an SOU to help prepare data to upload on the jets or analyze information downloaded after missions. Ground crews use mobile terminals, basically militarized laptops, to actually get that data in and out of individual aircraft. USMC F-35Bs, USMC And like your phone, tablet, or computer, ALIS’ servers on the ground are constantly sending information back to Lockheed so it can study the “usage statistics.” In theory, this would allow the company to see whether certain parts wear out faster than they expected, spot unforeseen issues before they impact operations, and just be better able to respond to the needs of F-35 operators not just in the U.S. military, but in any of the nearly a dozen other foreign services that are flying the fighters or are expecting to in the near future. Additional countries are considering signing up to get Joint Strike Fighters. The U.S. military also uses ALIS to push updates, like Version 2.0.2, down to both American and foreign operators through a centralized network. We don’t know if ground crews need to make an active decision to install the patches or whether the updates load up automatically like automatic software updaters on your home computer. “The F-35 provides more maintenance data through its sensors than any other fighter and ALIS converts that into actionable information to keep F-35s mission ready,” the infomercial explains. “During flight, the F-35 collects data on a wide range of systems and once the flight is complete, maintainers then download that data into ALIS to determine what actions need to occur.” USAF Even more importantly, beyond logistics and preventative maintenance, the system is also critical to pre-mission planning and post-mission debriefing. Units use the system to upload mission planning details onto individual aircraft, including information about potential threats and hazards, routes and other details about where they’re flying. After a sortie, ground crews can download similar information from the jet’s extensive sensor suite for further examination. This has the potential to turn every F-35 into an electronic intelligence sponge on every mission, which could help American forces or their allies map integrated air defense networks and other threats ahead of future operations automatically and on an incredibly grand scale. The aircraft should even be able to do all this even during routine transits . Unfortunately, it’s ALIS’ vital and interconnected nature that has prompted concerns about the danger of cyber attacks on the system for years . The threat is real and we don’t know how well fortified the various parts of the system are against hacking or other intrusions. It’s not clear how many aircraft have the the latest cyber defense upgrades, whatever they may be, either. Thanks to a process known as concurrency , the U.S. military already owns hundreds of F-35s and has been upgrading them as necessary . In order to declare the jets combat ready , the U.S. Air Force and Marines both adopted truncated and rigid development schedules, as well. Still, in 2012, a team working for the U.S. Navy reportedly broke into some portion of the ALIS network, prompting a major fix to the system. The incident also highlighted fears that a enemy might be able to get into the system, or other parts of the F-35 program, indirectly through one of Lockheed’s many subcontractors. Third party companies in 45 states and Puerto Rico , as well as additional foreign firms, support the Joint Strike Fighters. “Even if Lockheed has top-notch cyber security, it’s still vulnerable if its subcontractors are vulnerable,” Ben Freeman, a national security investigator with the non-profit Project on Government Oversight, told Reuters at the time. “You have to be continually assessing the risk,” Raphael Mudge, a former Air Force engineer and independent cyber expert, added. Marines look at engine test data on a portable terminal during an operational evaluation aboard the USS Wasp in 2015., USMC Then, in December 2015, the Pentagon’s main F-35 program office delayed an important cyber warfare test specifically because they were worried about it damaging the existing software build and impacting operations. In 2016, VMFA-211 did participate in a cybersecurity exercise, with opponents apparently trying to break into or otherwise disrupt their SOU, which was running Version 2.0.1 software at the time. Specific details about the event or its results are not publicly available. “The cybersecurity testing in 2016 showed that the [F-35] program has addressed some of the vulnerabilities identified during earlier testing periods,” the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation wrote in his annual review of the Joint Strike Fighter project for that year. “However, much more testing is needed to assess the cybersecurity structure of the air vehicle and supporting logistics infrastructure system … and to determine whether, and to what extent, vulnerabilities may have led to compromises of F-35 data.” The nightmare scenario would involve an opponent causing a disruption during an actual crisis by either actively feeding bad information into the ALIS system or otherwise disabling some portion of it or its overarching architecture. The interconnected nature of the arrangement might allow a localized breach to infect larger segments of the F-35 fleet both in the United States or abroad or vice versa. It’s not hard to imagine the time and energy needed to sort out real inputs and outputs from fake ones hampering or halting operations entirely under the right circumstances. Given the jet’s low-observable characteristics, advanced defensive systems, and other sensors, a cyber attack would be an attractive option for any enemy force. Why would an enemy use a $500,000 air-to-air or surface-to-air and put their personnel and equipment at risk in an attempt to down an F-35 when a simple worm may be able to do the same to a whole fleet of F-35s? It could also do so with plausible deniability, something kinetic weapons are far less adept to. USN American allies, who have to rely on U.S.-based software labs to develop updates and other data packages, would have similar concerns. It’s worth noting that Israel had secured the unique and unprecedented rights to tinker with its F-35Is, operate its ALIS systems outside of this centralized network—and possibly operate the F-35s independent of ALIS totally—and is in the process of developing its own software to sit on top of the existing applications. The Israeli Air Force has even purchased a special dedicated test aircraft to serve as the testbed for these and other future modifications . Israeli officials have said that they pushed for this level of autonomy from the rest of the F-35 program, in no small part because of fears that operations could grind to a halt in the middle of a conflict if they suddenly found themselves cut off from the central ALIS network. “The ingenious, automated ALIS system that Lockheed Martin has built will be very efficient and cost-effective,” an anonymous Israeli Air Force officer told Defense News in 2016. “But the only downfall is that it was built for countries that don’t have missiles falling on them.” To be fair, there’s a lot we don’t know about the latest ALIS issue. There is no doubt that ALIS offers some very attractive features, but in an age where cyberspace is increasingly becoming the front lines of international conflict, ALIS could also offer an incredibly attractive Achilles heel for enemy hackers to sink their teeth into. We can only hope all the data the complex, interconnected system is vacuuming up helps rather than hinders the development of a fix to the critical system.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2017",Canadian Sniper Destroys Record For Longest Kill With Over Two Mile Shot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A sniper from Canada’s most elite unit, Joint Task Force (JTF) 2 , has completely demolished the record for the longest confirmed kill. The shooter killed an ISIS fighter in Iraq at a distance of over two miles. On June 21, 2017, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that the individual had made the shot “within the last month. JTF 2 is the Canadian military’s so-called “Tier One” special operations element, roughly analogous to the U.S. Army’s Delta Force or the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team Six. “The Canadian Special Operations Command can confirm that a member of Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target at 3,540 metres,” the Canadian Armed Forces said in a statement. “As stated multiple times in the past, members of the Canadian Special Operations Task Force do not accompany leading combat elements, but enable the Iraqi security forces who are in a tough combat mission. This takes the form of advice in planning their operations and assistance to defeat Daesh through the use of coalition resources.” Daesh is another common term for ISIS. The Canadian Armed Forces declined to provide any more details on the record-breaking shot and did not name the individual responsible, citing operational security. Anonymous sources told The Globe and Mail the sniper had used a .50 caliber McMillan Tac-50 to make the shot and that it took less than 10 seconds for the bullet to find its mark. Major League Baseball star Albert Pujols hold a Mk 15 sniper rifle, similar to the C15, during a tour of U.S. Naval Special Warfare facilities in San Diego in 2009., USN This American-made bolt-action rifle weighs 26 pounds and is 57 inches long overall. The weapon is popular with special operations forces around the world, including in the U.S. military, which adopted a version it calls the Mk 15. In Canadian service it is known as the C15 Long Range Sniper Weapon. The rifles can accept a variety of long-range, precision scopes, as well as night vision and thermal imaging equipment for operations at night. Various companies have built sights with built-in lightweight ballistic computers for long-range shooting, too. But even with a well-built rifle and an advanced optic, it takes extreme skill to even consider taking a shot at a target so far away. McMillan doesn’t list a maximum effective range on its website as it’s as much about the shooter as anything else. The company does, however, say the rifle has an average accuracy of 0.5 Minute of Angle (MOA) when firing specialized, long-range ammunition. A Canadian sniper uses a hand-held ballistic computer., Canadian Armed Forces Rifle accuracy is commonly expressed in MOA , which can be understood as a cone expanding outward with its point at the tip of the barrel. One MOA translates to one inch for every 100 yards. A rifle that is 0.5 MOA accurate should be able to hit within 0.5 inches of the point of aim at 100 yards or a space five inches in diameter at 1,000 yards. At more than three times that distance, a bullet could hit anywhere inside a space more than a foot in diameter and still be just as accurate. Just seeing a man-sized target at that range would be difficult. Just take a look at the video below to see retired Delta Force operator Larry Vickers attempt a mile-long shot with a less power .338 Lapua Magnum rifle. The Globe and Mail’s Sources told them “the kill was independently verified by video camera and other data.” Regardless, JTF 2’s snipers are likely among the best trained in the world. It’s hard to say for sure, though, since in addition to being the Canada’s most specialized force, the unit is also its most secretive. “There’s a lot of hype about what we do,” the unit’s official website says. “Most of it we can tell you, some of it we need to keep private.” “We do what the Government asks of us, but please respect that we can’t tell everyone how we complete it,” the description continues. “We are by our nature secretive because we need to be discreet.” Every so often, some details do squeak out, such as this impressive long-range kill. In March 2017, the Canadian Armed Forces released a number of rare photographs of JTF 2’s early history, after which The War Zone wrote a brief profile of the unit. You can read more about the elite formation’s evolution from a more police-style counter-terrorism element to a more multi-faceted special operations force here . Since its formal establishment in 1992, JTF 2 has reportedly supported operations in the Balkans, in Haiti, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In a particularly rare public announcement, the Canadian government actually confirmed the special operators’ participation in the secretive missions in Afghanistan in October 2001. In June 2015, a video accidentally revealed the unit was back in Iraq – though it was perhaps not particularly surprising given how active the U.S.-led coalition’s special operations element has been in the fight against ISIS. Canadian troops, including a sniper with a .338 C14 Timberwolf bolt-action rifle, train in Portugal in 2015., Canadian Armed Forces Now, the Canadian Armed Forces have officially confirmed this deployment in order to take credit for this shot. There are additional reports that say at least three Canadian sniper teams were in the theater at the time, one from JTF 2 and two more from the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, which is broadly comparable to a cross between U.S. Army’s Special Forces Groups and the 75th Ranger Regiment. Both Canadian units are part of the Canaidan Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM). Canadians now hold claim to three of the top five longest confirmed sniper kills. Two snipers from Princeess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry scored the third and fourth longest shots in Afghanistan in 2002. The number two shooter, the previous record holder, is the British Army’s Craig Harrison, who shot a Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan 2,475 meters away in 2009. The soldier, then with the Blues and Royals regiment, used a .338 Lapua Magnum L115A1 bolt-action rifle to make that kill. At number five is U.S. Army Sergeant Bryan Kremer, a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment, who killed an Iraqi militant 2,300 meters away with a semi-automatic .50 caliber Barrett M82A1 rifle in 2004. He hold the record for the longest kill by an American sniper. With coalition special operators actively gunning for ISIS fighters in both Iraq and Syria, there’s still time for someone else to break the record, but it would require even more impressive shooting. At some point, one has to wonder if there’s just a limit to how far away a sniper with a conventional rifle, no matter how big or precise, can take out an individual opponent.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 27, 2019",South Africa’s Gripen Fighter Jets Will Stalk Rhino Poachers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rhino poachers operating in South Africa, especially along the country’s border with Zimbabwe, will soon face a new opponent, the Gripen fighter jet, according to a report from FlightGlobal . The revelation followed another announcement that the South African Air Force (SAAF) had finally gotten nearly all of its Swedish-made aircraft out of storage and back onto the flightline. On June 18, 2017, Lieutenant Colonel Josias Mashaba, head of the SAAF’s 2 Squadron gave details about the state of his country’s Gripen fleet during an annual meeting of the Swedish Air Force Fan Club – yes, fan club – in Paris, France. The event was tertiary to the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, but did bring together officials from the Swedish Air Force, Gripen manufacturer Saab, representatives from world-wide operators of the fighter jet such as Mashaba, and members of the press, all eager to chat about the aircraft. “They are smart, those guys, they are not stupid, but we find them,” Mashaba said of the poachers. 2 Squadron flies nearly all of the SAAF’s remaining fleet of approximately 19 single-seat Gripen C and two-seater Gripen D aircraft at Waterkloof Air Base in country’s administrative capital Pretoria. The fighter jet’s main tool in its new surveillance role will be the Litening III targeting pod . Israeli defense company Rafael designed the system, which it continues to produce for the country’s air arm, as well as export customers like South Africa. American defense contractor Northrop Grumman makes additional variants in partnership with the firm for the U.S. military and foreign buyers. Saab Intended for spotting and then pointing precision guided munitions at enemy targets on the ground, the unit has a sensor turret with day- and night-vision cameras, as well as a combination laser range finder and target designator. The Litening III variant has additional surveillance capabilities in that a pilot can capture still images for further analysis. South Africa’s Gripens have a domestically produced data link, called Link ZA, which could potentially share this information with command centers on the ground or even groups of wildlife rangers, as long as they have the appropriate equipment. Regardless, it’s not unusual for air forces to use targeting equipment for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes, with the U.S. military referring to such missions formally as “Non-Traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance,” or NTISR. Mashaba conceded that the mission might not be the best use of the fighter jet’s capabilities, but pointed out that the anti-poaching sorties would just be one part of his squadron’s duties. It’s also not the first time a country has sent high performance aircraft to help with domestic law enforcement functions. As late as 1994, the California and Nevada Air National Guards were flying RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft, based on the F-4C Phantom II fighter jet, looking for illicit drug crops within the United States. Eventually, the Air National Guard as a whole transitioned primarily to the less expensive RC-26 twin-engine turboprop for counter-narcotics missions. In and outside of the United States, however, military surveillance aircraft , radar planes , fighter jets, drones, and even bombers have supported interdiction missions for America’s so-called “War On Drugs.” With little threat to the aircraft from the drug smugglers in most cases, these operations essentially offer low-risk training opportunities against real world targets. Other countries have executed similar operations, and have used their fighters for tertiary domestic surveillance roles. In South Africa, looking for rhino poachers would be a good way to keep pilot flying proficiency up and maintaining critical skill sets while providing a valuable service. The AHRLAC prototype., Warbirdsfly via Wikimedia South Africa could ultimately transition to an aircraft better suited to this unique role, such as the long-in-development AHRLAC , standing for Advanced High Performance Reconnaissance Light Aircraft. American plane maker Boeing and South African designer Paramount Group have now teamed up to continue flight testing on a militarized version they’re calling the Mwari . The push-prop aircraft will be able to carry light weapons and sensors while also providing the crew with good visual visibility of the ground during low-level flight. “And if we do nothing, the rhinos will all be gone,” Mashaba said. Poachers and other illegal hunters killed more than 1,000 of the endangered animals in both 2015 and 2016, primarily for their horns, which end up as black market luxury items, ingredients for holistic medicines, or just plain old trophies. South Africa is reportedly home to approximately 75 percent of Africa’s total rhino population, including 2,000 of the critically endangered black rhinos. In addition, any new missions might add additional impetus to an ongoing push to revitalize the SAAF in general. In 2013, the service had to send at least a dozen jets into what amounted to long-term storage because it simply could not afford to fly them. This was the case even though the cost to fly the jets was relatively modest, between $6,000 and $8,000 per flight hour, according to Mashaba. Though we don’t know what the officer’s figure actually includes, the U.S. Air Force spends tens of thousands of dollars per flight hour to operate the F-16C Viper when one takes into account a variety of secondary and tertiary supporting costs. “Every country has its ups and downs and has budget cuts,” Mashaba told the gathering in Paris. “We have overcome them and we basically have all our Gripens up and running.” According to FlightGlobal, South Africa is has a goal of eventually spending two percent of its gross domestic product on defense, but has yet to break the one percent mark. However, the existing budget increases were enough to not only get the Gripens back in action, but also add Link ZA to the country’s BAE Hawk 120 advanced trainers. This means trainees will know how to use the system before transitioning to the Gripen and that pilots can exchange information between the two platforms, if necessary. “We ‘Gripenised’ the Hawk,” Mashaba explained. “When you are flying the Hawk, you are able to see the Gripens around you.” The Gripen E prototype at a roll-out event in May 2016., Saab On top of that, Saab is likely to see South Africa’s expanding military budget and active Gripen fleet as a good reason to pitch the country on its new Gripen E variant, at least one day. Derived from the earlier Gripen Next Generation demonstrator, the E model has a new engine and improved avionics and mission systems, among other upgrades, making it significantly more capable than earlier versions. On June 15, 2017, the prototype made its first flight , flying for 40 minutes before returning to the company’s airfield at Linköping. In particular, its Italian-built ES-05 Raven radar is a fast-scanning active, electronically-scanned array (AESA) unit that can track multiple targets at once. Installed on a moving mount, pilots can also focus the beam independent of the aircraft’s flight path , letting them maneuver without necessarily losing their radar picture. In order to make the jets more attractive to potential buyers, Saab says the plane’s physical and software architecture are inherently flexible, allowing countries to install their own gear, which could include indigenous systems such as the Link ZA. Saab As it stands now, unfortunately, South Africa doesn’t appear to be in the market for a new fighter jet. In addition, Saab continues to support the older C and D models, so there might not be a need for the country to upgrade immediately. The Swedish firm has already secured a deal with Brazil for the new E model, and has submitted formal offers for Gripens of various types as part of ongoing fighter competitions in Finland, India, and Indonesia, among others. In the meantime, Mashaba’s pilots will fly their existing Gripens to help protect South Africa’s embattled rhino herds.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An F-16 Viper has intercepted a Russian aircraft carrying the country’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, briefly escorting the Tu-154 VIP plane as it flew over the Baltic Sea. Soon after, a fully armed Su-27 Flanker zoom in and appeared to warn off the NATO fighter jet. The incident follows a significant uptick in aerial incidents in the region amid a flurry of military maneuvers and cool relations between Moscow and Washington and other NATO members. The Russian military’s official television channel Zvezda released video of the incident, which occurred on June 21, 2017. At the time of writing, the Russian Defense Ministry has not issued any statement regarding the flight in English. “Russia’s Sukhoi Su-27 fighter, one of the aircraft escorting Shoigu’s plane, then displayed its weapons, prompting the F-16 to retreat,” according to state-run news outlet Sputnik . Russia’s top officer was en route to the geographically separated enclave of Kaliningrad, which shares land borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania, at the time. “As the aircraft did not identify themselves or respond to air traffic  control, Nato fighter jets scrambled to identify them, according to  standard procedures,” an unnamed NATO official said in a statement according to the BBC . “NATO has no information as to who was on board. We  assess the Russian pilots’ behaviour as safe and professional.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=MCROh09OPzY Though you can’t see any national markings on the Viper in the video footage, it is likely an F-16C Block 52+ from the Polish Air Force. On May 2, 2017, Poland and Spain took responsibility for the alliance’s rotating Baltic Air Policing mission. However, the Spanish Air Force flies the visually distinct Boeing EF-18A+ Hornet. If it was indeed a Polish jet on patrol, it would likely have been armed, as well. The intercept is just the latest in a series of encounters between NATO and Russian aircraft, some of which have been more serious. On June 19, 2017, another Flanker reportedly flew within five feet of an RC-135U Combat Sent electronic intelligence aircraft as it passed through international airspace above the Baltic. A pair of polish F-16C Block 52+ fighter jets, including one with conformal fuel tanks, fly over the Baltic Sea in June 2017., USAF U.S. officials told Fox News , who was first to report that incident, that the Russian pilot was acting in a “provocative” manner and moving “erratically” near the much larger and less maneuverable Combat Sent. The Kremlin subsequently blamed the American crew for the unsafe maneuvering. “When being accompanied, the RC-135 plane made an attempt at approaching the Russian fighter jet making a provocative turn towards it,” the country’s Defense Ministry said in a statement via state-run outlet TASS. These were hardly the only instances where NATO and Russian warplanes have met over the Baltic Sea in recent weeks. On June 20, 2017, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry reported that the alliance’s jets had made more than 30 interceptions in the previous week . Russia’s aerial activity included sorties by Su-27s and the advanced Su-34 Fullback derivative, as well as Su-24MR Fencer multi-role aircraft. In particularly notable incident on June 16, 2017, NATO jets joined together with their counterparts from Finland and Sweden, who aren’t part of the military bloc, to shadow a huge group of Russian planes, which included Flankers, Fullbacks, and Fencers, along with a Tu-160 Blackjack supersonic bomber, A-50 radar plane, and an Il-22 airborne command post. Finnish authorities subsequently released a series of photographs of the Kremlin’s aircraft. Since Russian forces seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in March 2014 and subsequently began actively supporting separatists battling the government in Kiev, NATO has stepped up activates along its shared border with Russia. This has in turn prompted tit-for-tat responses from Moscow. The Kremlin’s aviators have performed numerous intercepts since then, including others described as unsafe or unprofessional. This increased activity has extended beyond Europe, with a pair of U.S. Air Force F-22s flying out to meet a flight of Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jets and Tu-95MS Bear bombers near Alaska in May 2017. A Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet flies near a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber over the Baltic Sea earlier in June 2017., DOD These latest incidents came as NATO members conducted major naval and ground exercises throughout the Baltics, as well as in Germany and Poland. The Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) maritime training sessions and the Saber Strike war game on land, both included impressive displays of aerial force, including American B-1 Bone and B-52 Stratofortress bombers conducting mock attack runs and mine-laying sorties. On June 9, 2017, the alliance gathered together representative aircraft for an impressive photo op over the Baltic. A Russian Flanker promptly photo bombed the formation in full view of the press. It’s very likely that these encounters will continue in the coming months, with both Russia and NATO’s continuing a busy exercise schedule. Most notably, approximately 100,000 Russian and Belorussian troops are set to take part in a massive war game along their boundary with NATO this fall. These Zapad exercises happen every four years and pit the two countries against a notional large scale opponent, largely seen as a stand-in for NATO. The name simply means “West” in Russian. “We are treating these as exercises as such, nothing more, but of course, on the local level, some risks are here,” Lithuanian Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis said during a visit to the United States to meet with his American counterparts earlier in 2017. “We need to also be prepared for surprises … they could, say, go to a different direction than planned, and there also may be some tests of how the border protection is working, etc.” This goes beyond NATO, as well. Russia has made a number of veiled threats toward both Finland and Sweden in recent years, as both countries becoming increasingly interested in the collective security of the alliance. If Swedish officials decide to join the military bloc, “we will interpret that as an additional threat for Russia and we will think about how to eliminate this threat,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told TASS earlier in June 2017. On the same day in June as Russia’s unsafe intercept of the American RC-135U, the Swedish Air Force said one of their signals intelligence aircraft had a similar run-in with a Flanker. There may also be an additional surge in intercepts as the Kremlin seeks to retaliate indirectly for American activities in Syria. In spite of international condemnation of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his regime, Moscow has continued to support the leader in exchange for strategic access to the country’s territory, an issue we have discussed in detail in the past. In nearly three weeks, the U.S. military has shot down two Iranian-made Shaheed 129 drones and a Syrian Air Force Su-22 Fitter attack jet. The confrontations have many worried the United States is inching closer to a broader and more dangerous confrontation with the government in Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies. In April 2017, following a reported chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians, the U.S. Navy did fire a number of Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles at Syria’s Shayrat Air Base . However, by most accounts, American officials went to great lengths to avoid hitting Russian personnel at the base. After the Su-22 shoot down, Moscow took a hard-line stance , suggesting, at least initially, that it would effectively include Syrian forces under the protective umbrella of its own fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles. With all this in mind, the Baltic Sea definitely seems like a potential hot spot to keep an eye on, whether the activities are related to what’s going on in Europe or developments further afield. UPDATE- 2:15pm EST: New details have emerged showing the intercepting aircraft was actually an F-16AM from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The Dutch fighter also had an impressive combat load of four AIM-120 and two AIM-9 air-to-air missiles. UPDATE- 8:20am PST 6/22/2017: Apparently Polish Vipers did the intercept yesterday. The confusion came from a archive photo ran by the AP showing the a Dutch F-16 through a airliner cabin window.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 7, 2019",Israel Just Launched A Containerized Ballistic Missile From The Deck Of A Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though the concept has yet to find its big break, defense contractors continue to expand on the idea of highly mobile weapon systems that meet the size and weight restrictions of standard shipping containers . Now, Israel has tested such a system and says it has buyers already in line. On June 20, 2017, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) said it had successfully test-fired its Long-Range Artillery (LORA) system from a containerized launcher on the back of a truck sitting on the deck of a cargo ship. The state-operated firm first unveiled the mobile ballistic missile back in 2006 . The experiment, which destroyed a pre-planned target, was part of final trials ahead of “several deals that involve the system,” according to a press release . “This was one of the most complexed [sic] trails [sic; trial] we held over the past few years and a technological breakthrough for IAI’s missile development operations,” Boaz Levi, the company’s Executive Vice President and General Manager of Systems, Missiles & Space Group, said. “The trail [sic; trial] was held according to a full operational outline, including an assessment of the system’s maneuvering, assault and precision capabilities.” According to IAI’s website and a company fact sheet , the 3,500-pound solid-fuel LORA can hit targets nearly 250 miles away within 10 minutes thanks to an unspecified “supersonic velocity.” The missile has a penetrating warhead of some type and relies on GPS and inertial navigation to get it to the target area. However, once it’s there, an operator can course correct using a command-to-target television guidance system giving the missile incredible accuracy. This dual-mode configuration has become a staple of Israel missile technology and is very similar to that found on the Delilah cruise missile and the much smaller Spike NLOS missile from Israeli government-owned company Rafael. The man-in-the-loop terminal guidance technique was developed over decades, with weapons like the Popeye/Have Nap paving the way for this current generation of highly advanced dual-guidance missile systems. It also means that if need be, the weapon can hit targets in spite of bad weather, smoke, or other obscurants that would interfere with a laser or optical terminal guidance arrangement. IAI According to IAI, a notional complete containerized LORA battery would include a command and fire control container and four launchers, each with four missiles, plus four reload vehicles. On land, trucks would carry these components, giving them additional mobility and the ability to escape a first strike. At sea, the self-contained nature of the system means a customer could easily load it onto any vessel with the appropriate space, quickly turning it into a stand-off weapon platform. Since the command section has all the equipment necessary to launch the missiles, no other modifications to the ship are necessary. In a maritime environment, the obvious benefits of these systems are relatively low cost launchers and the lack of need for a dedicated missile-armed vessel. A system with this type of range could provide precision strikes and timely fire support deep into enemy territory without the use of fixed-wing air power and the risks that go along with it. A military could purchase only a small number of LORA systems and simply move them from ship to ship as necessary. Depending on the defensive capabilities of the opponent, logistics ships or other auxiliaries could suddenly become impromptu combatants, freeing up purpose-built and better defended warships for tasks in more dangerous environments. The LORA’s cruise-missile-like range could potentially keep even less well protected ships out of the way of shore-based defenses altogether. There’s a long-standing fear that rogue states or other enemy forces might use innocuous, civilian-styled container carriers to launch sneak attacks , too. Tal Inbar via Wikipedia Of course, using civilian or civilian-style ships as missile boats in a pinch isn’t a perfect solution and presents its own possible complexities. Standard container carriers and the like are not intended for military operations and lack any real defensive considerations. They aren’t meant to hide or otherwise conceal themselves and don’t have the sort of systems on board to detect, avoid, or neutralize incoming threats or search out potential targets. To be fair, surface-to-air missiles, close-in-weapon systems, surface search radars, and other sensors could all fit inside containers, too. Many of these concepts could be quickly lifted from existing sea base-type ships, which the War Zone has already written extensively about in the past. But these are especially important considerations given the proliferation of land-based anti-ship cruise missiles, with ever increasing range and speed .  Many countries, particularly Russia and China, appear to be pursuing so-called Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) strategies, which combine these types of weapons with long-range radars and integrated air defense networks, which could turn whole regions into no-go areas for foreign air and naval forces during an actual conflict. Still, hiding in plain sight so to speak has its grand advantages and its own tactical justification in itself depending on the scenario, and for lower intensity conflicts such a capability would be both effective in cost effective and remarkably easy to deploy. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qyrg9AnMM1c It’s important to note that containerized weapons are not new, nor are such missile launchers with naval applications specifically. In 2010, Russian began advertising a four-round launcher for the 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missile , variants of which have a similar range to the LORA, hidden inside a shipping container. They revealed a version of the complete system, commonly known as Club-K , to the public at the annual MAKS air show in 2011. There are also much shorter-range systems, too. These include a containerized version of Patria’s 120mm NEMO breech-loaded mortar and a Chinese system that can accommodate 122mm unguided artillery rockets, as well as cruise missiles. Theoretically, almost any truck-mounted artillery or missile system would have very similar flexibility as long as there was sufficient room on a ship’s deck. But no one has put these into active service to our knowledge. Based on available concept art, Russia is planning to employ a system like the Club-K on its up-coming Ice -class icebreaking corvettes . And the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are both actively looking at the potential to use the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) as an anti-ship weapon, possibly afloat on U.S. Navy ships. Our own Tyler Rogoway posited installing it on the Navy’s ammo-less Zumwalt- class stealth destroyers. The HIMARS launcher can already fire the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS, and pronounced “attack-ums”), which has similar range to the LORA, as well as the small but more plentiful and highly accurate M30/31 guided artillery rockets. Raytheon is working on a replacement for the out of production ATACMS, called DeepStrike . Unlike Israel, however, U.S. cruise and ballistic missiles are limited by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, more commonly known as the INF, which it signed with the Soviet Union in 1987. Russia and the United States have agreed to abide by the terms, though U.S. officials accuse their Russian counterparts of breaking the deal , which says neither party can build missiles with maximum ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles. Over and under are just fine, and Raytheon’s goal is a missile that can fly right to the edge of minimum allowable distance, but no further, significantly further than the range of ATACMS. Raytheon Still, the truth is that LORA and similar containerized weapons systems may revolutionize how naval warfare is executed and how ships that are meant to execute it are built. Building simpler, cheaper surface combatants with areas for containerized weapons may be commonplace in the future. The U.S. Coast Guard wants to follow in Russia’s footsteps and put containerized cruise missile systems on their future icebreakers. There has been talk about integrating similar modular systems on future lower-end U.S. Navy ships. This type of capability, and even existing concepts such as the Phalanx CIWS-based Centurion defense system, seem extremely well suited for America’s various sea basing and special operations support platforms . So could the Navy of the future include an armada of container toting ships? It is a real possibility. IAI claims it has actual customers for the naval LORA system, but there’s no indication that the U.S. military is among them. Since there is only the press release to work with, it is important to remember those deals could still be pending to some degree and might not proceed. Depending on who actually gets the launchers, and if they actually employ them in a naval setting, it might give other countries such as the United States added impetus to move ahead with their own similar projects.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 13, 2019",Blackwater Founder Erik Prince’s Armed Crop Duster Is At The Paris Air Show,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the market for crop dusters converted into light surveillance and attack aircraft continues to expand, another contender has appeared on the market at the annual Paris Air Show at the French capital city’s Le Bourget Airport. However, potential customers might be turned off by the company’s already sordid reputation, which involves accusations of dubiously legal business practices, potential violations of international embargoes and sanctions, and a connection to infamous mercenary Erik Prince. On June 19, 2017, the first day of the show, a modified Thrush 510G agricultural aircraft sat out in the sun at Le Bourget. Bulgarian firm LASA Engineering had brought the plane, called the T-Bird , to display at the famous trade show, no doubt hoping to woo buyers looking for a cost effective means of performing tasks such as monitoring borders and conducting internal security missions against insurgents and terrorists. “If your defence budget doesn’t run to an A-10, or even a Super Tucano – you might need this…,” a blog post on the Royal Aeronautic Society’s page covering the Air Show declared. “This year at Le Bourget sees not just one, but two armed agricultural aircraft on display at the show – as militaries around the world look for low-cost attack aircraft to fight insurgencies.” Thrush Aviation is the current company producing the 510G, which is a low-wing, single-engine turbo-prop intended for crop-dusting and other agricultural work. In that configuration, a pilot would generally fly between 90 to 150 miles per hour, per the firm’s website. It can fly as slow as 55 miles per hour and only needs 1,500 feet to take off when loaded to a gross weight of 10,500 pounds. With its four-blade, variable-pitch propeller in full reverse, it can land in just 350 feet. The LASA T-Bird., LASA Engineering These basic attributes make it a great underlying platform for a counter-insurgency-focused light attack and surveillance plane. I’ve written extensively on the history of this concept , which dates back the 1980s when the U.S. State Department – yes, the State Department – bought a fleet of modified Thrushes for the War on Drugs in Latin America from the then manufacturer, Ayres Corporation. Though unarmed, these so-called Narcotics Eradication Delivery System (NEDS) versions had armor plating around vital components and bullet-proof windshields and windows. Ayres and its competitor, Air Tractor, eventually expanded the concept to include armed variants, followed by even more impressive derivatives. LASA’s version follows a general trend. The aircraft has six underwing pylons for weapons, plus a day and infrared night-vision camera turret mounted under the fuselage. Austrian company Airborne Technologies is responsible for this sensor suite. There is likely armor added to the certain parts of the fuselage and wings and bullet-proof windows around the main cabin. Inside the T-Bird’s cockpit., LASA Engineering Notably, at the 2017 Paris Air Show, LASA decided to display their offering with a variety of Soviet-era weapons strapped to the aircraft. The plane had two 16-round UB-16-57 and two 32-round UB-32 rocket pods, both able to fire the 57mm S-5 rocket, plus two UPK-23 gun pods, each with a twin-barrel 23mm cannon inside. These armament options might be more appealing to certain countries in the Middle East, Central Asia, Africa, and elsewhere that have large stockpiles of Soviet-style weapons and ammunition already on hand and are less concerned with collateral damage. And with other companies in Bulgaria still making many of these products, it would also be easier for LASA to offer a package deal with this armament. Other similar aircraft, such as the Air Tractor AT-802U , the IOMAX Archangel, and L-3’s OA-8 Longsword commonly arrive at trade shows and other events fitted with Western weapons, including precision guided munitions. But there’s nothing to suggest these firms wouldn’t be able to accommodate a buyer who wanted a version that could handle these older weapons. And anyone looking to buy a plane like this might not be thrilled to be dealing with LASA regardless. See, if any of the previous details sound familiar, it’s because they should. LASA’s aircraft is almost the exact same configuration as one Airborne Technologies had put together for an “unnamed client” in 2014. That individual turned out to be Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who had gone on to found Blackwater, a private military company that ultimately shut down, with various divisions ending up rebranded or taking on new lives of their own , after a series of controversial incidents and lawsuits . In April 2016, The Intercept published a detailed expose on the entire Thrush affair. Airborne Technologies’ Linx., Airborne Technologies According to various sources and leaked documents, Prince reportedly intended to deliver a fleet of the aircraft to the South Sudanese government in violation of American and other foreign regulations surrounding the transfer of military equipment and training services. After it became clear Austria’s defense export rules would halt his plans, he moved the operation to Bulgaria. There an associate, Zachary Botchev, founded LASA, which stands for Light Armed Surveillance Aircraft, using what appeared to be a bogus address. The company now has an additional facility at Kazanlak Airfield, a grass strip in the center of the country that mainly serves actual crop dusters working in the country’s famous Rose Valley , among other areas. While in Bulgaria, Prince reportedly toured one of the country’s premier arms manufacturers, Arsenal, to view its line of aircraft weaponry. Arsenal’s website does not list the UPK-23 or any of the S-5 rockets or rocket pods among its products, so it’s unclear what they would have showed the American military contractor. And despite having the sensor turret, briefing slides show the plan was for pilots to actually aim any main weapons, at least in part, using a EOTech Holosight, a holographic gun sight more commonly found on individual and crew-served firearms. LASA’s TR-Pod., LASA Engineering Frontier Services Group (FSG), an separate “aviation and logistics” company Prince had also founded with the Chinese state-operated investment firm Citic Group in 2014, subsequently registered the first modified plane in San Marino. The small European city state rescinded the registration, T7-SAW, after pictures emerged online showing a military-style aircraft that did not match the civilian description in FSG’s application. As of April 2016, this aircraft was reportedly grounded at an unspecified location in East Africa. Airborne Technologies had moved a second aircraft, almost certainly the one that has now appeared at Le Bourget, to LASA’s facilities in Bulgaria. In a meeting with FSG executives, Prince reportedly denied any connection to LASA, though he disclosed his relationship with Airborne Technologies. The Chinese-based company told The Intercept that it had no involvement in the project and ‘would not “engage in activities that require U.S. government licenses.” Airborne Technologies’ SCAR Pod., Airborne Technologies So, the exact relationship between the two firms remains murky. Both offer armed Thrush 510Gs on their websites and even use some of the same pictures of the aircraft, which appear to be identical except for the branding. LASA says Airborne Technologies supplies the “ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] equipment and Airborne LINX package.” The Bulgarian company offers the Austrian firm’s Self Contained Aerial Reconnaissance (SCAR) sensor pod as the TR-Pod . Both can accommodate electro-optical cameras, signals intelligence gear, and radars, among other systems. LASA’s website does not mention Botchev among its four-person team.  By 2016, Prince was reportedly the subject of numerous U.S. government investigations into his attempts to offer mercenary services to foreign governments, money laundering, and possibly links to Chinese. He has repeatedly denied involvement in any illegal activities and insisted his businesses are legitimate. Since then, the retired special operator and brother of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, has become entangled in the swirling intrigue relating to President Donald Trump’s shadowy links to Russian government officials. What is clear is that Prince’s armed crop duster is on display at Le Bourget and LASA is open for business, whatever involvement the American still has in the project.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 30, 2019",We Don’t Know Much About the Fitzgerald Collision and That Seems Odd,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A freak, deadly accident between a U.S. Navy destroyer and a civilian cargo ship is already prompting conspiracy theories online. That being said, with relatively little official information on the circumstances so far, it’s hard not to feel like the entire situation is a bit weird. Here’s what we do know. On June 17, 2017, the container ship ACX Crystal collided with the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Fitzgerald in international waters 56 miles off the coast of Japan’s main island, Honshu. Both ships suffered significant damage, but the far less massive American warship came out of the incident decidedly worse for wear. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet forward deployed in Japan, described the extent of the incident during a press conference on June 18, 2017, after which the Fitzgerald had returned to Yokosuka Harbor under its own power. He said: The ship suffered severe damage rapidly flooding 3 large compartments that included 1 machinery room and 2 berthing areas for 116 crew. The Commanding Officer’s cabin was also directly hit, trapping the CO [commanding officer] inside. The crew’s response was swift and effective, and I want to point out – as we stand by the ship – how proud I am of them. Heroic efforts prevented the flooding from catastrophically spreading which could have caused the ship to founder or sink. It could have been much worse. The crew navigated the ship into one of the busiest ports in the world with a magnetic compass and backup navigation equipment. 1 of 2 shafts were locked. Because of the tireless damage control efforts of a resolute and courageous team, the ship was able to make its way back to port safely on its own power last evening. The side of USS Fitzgerald after the collision., AP Later that day, divers had an opportunity to inspect the damage more thoroughly and located the bodies of seven crew members the Navy had initially listed as missing. Based on the language in the official statement , it appeared they had tragically drowned in their berthing spaces after the Crystal struck the destroyer. The ages of many of those sailors killed in the incident is a stark reminder that these powerful, multi-billion dollar warships are largely run by kids just entering into adulthood. Here are their names, titles and where they are from: – Gunner’s Mate Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, from Palmyra, Virginia – Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, from San Diego, California – Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, from Oakville, Connecticut – Gunner’s Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez, 26, from Weslaco, Texas – Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, from Chula Vista, California – Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, 24, from Halethorpe, Maryland – Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37, from Elyria, Ohio During the immediate response to the accident, Japanese Coast Guard helicopters had conducted two separate medical evacuations, one for Navy Commander Bryce Benson, the Fitzgerald ’s commander, and another for two as yet unnamed sailors. The rescue teams took all three individuals to Naval Hospital Yokosuka, where they were reportedly “alert and under observation.” The United States has promised three separate investigations of its own into the incident. The Navy’s Judge Advocate General (JAGMAN) will conduct one into the basic circumstances of the accident, while the service will also perform a separate safety review. The U.S. Coast Guard will perform another so-called “marine casualty investigation” into the conduct of the Crystal and her crew. Japanese maritime authorities will go through their own investigative processes. But, so far, neither American nor Japanese authorities have provided an official narrative of how the accident occurred or granular details as to what mission Fitzgerald was performing at the time. “I will not speculate on how long these investigations will last,” Vice Admiral Aucoin added during his press conference. So, it’s perhaps not surprising then that conspiracy theorists have emerged to start filling in the gaps. Of course, it’s important to note immediately that there is no hard evidence of any kind to substantiate the idea that the collision was intentional. However, as more details come out from independent reports and research, there are definitely parts of whole situation that do seem a bit weird. Firstly, MarineTraffic , an online ship tracking service similar to aircraft watching sites like FlightRadar24, showed the Crystal making what appeared to be an emergency turn at 1:30 AM on July 17, 2017, deviating widely from its established course. The website can also generate a graph of the container ship’s speed, which in this case shows a sudden drop from 14 knots to zero, possibility indicating the time of collision. It then appeared to speed up to a similar speed shortly after. It’s another important data point, even if we cannot independently verify the accuracy of the satellite tracking data. At 2:25 AM, the Philippine-flagged ship reports the accident and five minutes later suddenly makes a 180 degree turn and heads back to what is now know to be the collision site. Some speculated this might have been the result of an autopilot error or failure. The Japanese Coast Guard, who initially said the incident happened at 2:20 AM based on this information, is reportedly looking into why it took the civilian vessel’s crew an hour to inform marine authorities – the equivalent to a sort of high-seas hit and run. As of June 19, 2017, it was unclear whether the U.S. Navy was still sticking by the original timeline. “Because it was in an emergency, the crewmembers may not have been able to place a call,” Nanami Meguro, a spokeswoman for NYK Line, who own the Crystal , speculated, according to CBS News . There is no explanation as to why the crew of the Fitzgerald did not immediately contact their higher headquarters afterwards, which would have quickly set the record straight. A Japanese Coast Guard helicopter flies over the USS Fitzgerald after the collision on June 17, 2017. , AP Then there’s the actual chain of custody of the Crystal , which is a matter for debate in of itself, further fueling speculation that there might be more nefarious forces at play. The ownership traces its way through a number of wholly own subsidiaries within Japan’s keiretsu monopoly system , as well as and separate parties. Officially, Asia Container Express (ACX), a subsidiary of NYK Line, operates the ship and claims ownership. However, it appears that Dainichi-Invest Corporation, an investment firm specializing in ships technically holds the vessel’s title. NYK line is itself a subsidiary of Mitsubishi.  And though NYK Line has taken responsibility for the vessel, they reportedly have bare-boat chartered it to a shipping company in the Philippines since 2014. This means the ship itself is leased to the other party, who then provide the crew, fuel, and other supplies to actually operate it. The various maritime authorities have released practically no information about the Crystal ’s crew or how they fared during the accident. On top of that, there are unconfirmed rumors that the Crystal was sailing without its running lights on and its maritime transponder, intended to help prevent such accidents, switched off. However, since MarineTraffic uses unencrypted transponder data to populate its maps, which showed the ship before, during, and after the collision, the latter claim seems highly unlikely. There has been speculation about the status of Fitzgerald ’s radar and other surveillance systems during the incident, as well. The bow of the ACX Crystal after the collision., AP “There is – at this writing – a lot we do not know about how the destroyer USS Fitzgerald came to collide with a heavily-laden freighter in the waters off Japan in the middle of the night,” John Kirby, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who served as the top spokesman for the Department of Defense under President Barack Obama, and is now an analyst for CNN, wrote in an op-ed on June 18, 2017.”We do not know whether the warship’s radars were operating sufficiently. We do not know what decisions the men and women who were standing watch aboard the destroyer made – or failed to make – that could have averted the danger. We do not know what actions, if any, were taken by the crew of the freighter to either cause or avoid this tragedy.” With all this in mind, plus the apparent angle of the collision based on the damage, the prevailing conspiracy theory is that for some reason the Crystal , which features a bulbous bow that would be well suited to ramming a smaller ship, deliberately plowed into the side of the Fitzgerald . To follow this logic, one of the more likely bad actors in such a scenario would be North Korea, which does have a history of using its own cargo ships , front companies , and unscrupulous foreign firms to move illicit or restricted cargoes to and from the reclusive country. In addition, there has been steadily escalating rhetoric between officials in Washington and Pyongyang, as well as more active incidents, such a bizarre and still largely unexplained scuffle between agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and North Korean diplomats at New York City’s JFK International Airport on June 18, 2017. North Korea has not shied away from covert actions against its enemies, including the assassination of Kim Jong Nam , half-brother of the country’s premier Kim Jong Un, in Malaysia in February 2017. The cargo vessel was heavily laden at the time of the collision. , AP But, as we’ve already said, there are no factual details that definitely support this scenario. It’s just as likely that the crew of the Crystal was engaged in some much more mundane criminality or that they were operating without some necessary paperwork, prompting them to try and flee before the magnitude of the situation became clearer. And it’s entirely possible it really just was a freak accident that will be blamed on some technological or mechanical failure or just old fashioned gross human error.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2019",U.S. Special Operators Are Ready to Ride Into War On Horseback Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. They’re iconic photos, U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers and other special operators riding on horseback in Afghanistan as they helped Northern Alliance rebels rout the Taliban in 2001. It was also a teachable moment, reminding America’s elite troops about just how useful animals could still be even in an age of helicopters and lightweight vehicles . In a completely unsurprising move, the Army subsequently put together a manual on the subject, a version of which we’ve obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The 2014 document, officially known as Army Training Publication (ATP) 3-18.13, Special Forces Use of Pack Animals, is the latest version of the guide and covers functional aspects of caring for, training, and loading equipment onto horses, donkeys, and mules, as well as how to actually put them to use in operations. This version replaced an earlier edition from 2004. “Since the deactivation of the pack transport units after the Korean Conflict, the Army has relied on air and ground mobility for transporting personnel and equipment,” the handbook explains in its first chapter. “Today and throughout the operational continuum, SF [Special Forces] may be involved in operations in rural or remote environments … that demand the use of pack animals.” More specifically, “commanders use military pack animal operations when the area of operations restricts normal methods of transport or resupply,” it continues. “Animal transport systems can greatly increase mission success when hostile elements and conditions require the movement of troops and equipment by foot.” U.S. special operations forces and members of the Northern Alliance on horseback in Afghanistan in 2001., US Army If the conditions are right, pack animals like horses, donkeys, mules, and various crossbreeds – we’ve reproduced one of the official government descriptions here so you can see the authors of the manual talk about some of the different options like so many Humvee configurations – perform a number of important tasks. They can be a good substitute for a light truck or all terrain vehicle, both in terms of mobility and cargo carrying and despite their relative size, they can carry significant loads. On top of that, they can fill in as impromptu ambulances, either dragging a litter on the ground or moving a sick or wounded individual on a platform suspended in between a pair of animals. US Army via FOIA With all this in mind, the manual stresses that a team with pack animals is primarily a logistical, not a combat element and they should make any and all attempts to avoid contact with the enemy before reaching their destination. “Fighting from horseback is not considered a primary function of mounted soldiers today,” the handbook says. Still, the authors point out special operations forces must still be prepared to use personal weapons while mounted, if necessary. Unfortunately, since it long ago abandoned horse-mounted cavalry, the manual says the U.S. military doesn’t really have weapons well suited to the job and offers some interesting advice for how troops should arm themselves when riding animals that’s worth reading in full: The standard weapons of the U.S. military have a serious defect in their size for mounted operations. It is difficult to handle the reins of a horse and a lead line while holding a large rifle. These weapons also demand a certain degree of accuracy that is next to impossible to achieve from horseback. To compromise between effective firepower and effective size, carbines are recommended. U.S. M16 variants, such as the M4 , are acceptable for conventional warfare environments while AK folding stock variants are acceptable for unconventional warfare environments. The ability of a submachine gun to lay a heavy base of fire from an unstable position makes it a valuable choice. A selective fire weapon with a folding stock (extended for accuracy when required) is the ideal choice. A very good choice of an immediate suppression weapon for the mounted unit is the U.S. M79 grenade launcher. It is much shorter and lighter than the M203 , and the Soldier can maneuver it with one hand. The launcher’s compact size allows the Soldier to place it in a scabbard and still quickly bring it to bear. Several M79s dispersed throughout a moving unit would greatly improve that unit’s chance of surviving an ambush. Another consideration is the adoption of shotguns as standard weapons for mounted troops conducting operations in dense terrain. Their unequaled killing ability at close range and less severe accuracy requirement make them a good weapon choice for mounted troops. The M249 squad automatic weapon would be the best choice for a general fire support weapon because of its size. The box magazine of the M249 is recommended because a belt of ammunition is too unwieldy around animals. The main problem with any of the weapons described is how their size relates to how they can be carried effectively and still be brought into action when needed. Larger weapon systems that are 50 pounds or less , such as the M60, M240, and M249 MG [machine gun], should be laid across the top of the rucksacks that are attached to the animals. Personnel can secure the weapons for easy access using a packer’s knot, 550 cord, or straps with quick release. As discussed before, the selection of carbine-style or folding-stock weapons helps to resolve the issue of carrying weapons during mounted operations. However, further mention must be made about how weapons should be carried. As stated before, a rider can use a scabbard when enemy contact is highly unlikely, such as when traveling in a secure area. A cross-chest carry with a top-mounted sling is the best, including, including crew-served weapons that can give a foot patrol a level firepower more associated with a team in a small vehicle choice. The Soldier must take great care to ensure that weapons do not endanger him or his mount by becoming entangled in reins and lead lines or by hitting the animal. US Army via FOIA On top of that, pack animals may be ideal for carrying crew-served weapons, including heavy machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and even man-portal surface-to-air missiles, but the manual doesn’t advise anyone fire them while riding along. “The possible exception is the M72 light antitank weapon,” the authors note. Over the years, special operations forces have employed a number of specialized versions of this light, single-shot, disposable rocket launcher, including the M72A7 for taking out light vehicles, the M79A9 optimized for blowing up fortifications, and M79A10 with a fragmentation warhead designed to kill enemy personnel. Otherwise, the handbook instructs teams to make sure they can unpack their larger weapons and get them set up quickly if the need arises. U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers lead a mule carrying a Mk 47 automatic grenade launcher during a training exercise., US Army Oh, and apparently “Soldiers must never carry sensitive or classified communications items on a pack animal.” Though the manual doesn’t offer any additional explanation, it seems likely this has to do with the possibility that an animal could escape for some reason and end up in the hands of enemy forces. The guide contains a number of notes and other information that highlight the fact that these are living, breathing creatures rather than just another vehicle. “Casualties may arise from animals becoming frightened and breaking loose or stampeding,” the authors mention in the section on security considerations when teams are taking a brief break or have halted for extended period of time. “During an attack on the detachment, these animals are susceptible to both enemy and friendly fire. The chances are good that a large percentage of the animals will either flee or suffer wounds.” Beyond ambushes and other combat, certain environments, such as an urban area already subjected to intense fighting, poses unique hazards to animals all on their own. “A damaged city with extensive rubble presents danger in the form of sharp rock, broken glass, and other debris that can permanently damage animals,” the handbook says “The best choice when planning to use pack animals to support an urban operation is to halt them at a secure location outside of any built-up areas and move the supplies in by foot. However, if the detachment must move the animals through a built-up area, it should try to avoid rubble, broken glass, nails, and other debris that will injure the animal.” US Army via FOIA Special operators might not even being going into a hot spot that has or could sustain the right kind of animals. There is a whole chapter on “Llamas and other animals” describing alternative options. However, according the manual, special operators would require local handlers in order to make any real use of less common species like camels or elephants. This general lack of experience with these animals within the U.S. military was undoubtedly why President Abraham Lincoln declined an offer from the King of Siam for war elephants during the American Civil War or why the U.S. Army’s Camel Corps never saw action against the Confederacy. So, it should go without saying that pack animals aren’t a universal or perfect solution. Right in the first chapter, there are dozens of questions commanders should ask themselves when considering employing pack animals in the first place. These range from the most basic considerations, such as “Is the operational area conducive to pack animal use?” and “Are there areas for the animal to graze or forage?” to far more complex factors, including “Does the enemy have a similar capability to detect or interdict conventional infiltration methods?” and “Is there a risk of reprisals against locals that the detachment is receiving support from?” But their utility under the right circumstances isn’t idle speculation. As they found in Afghanistan in 2001, American special operations forces are often called upon to operate in areas and under conditions where even their lightest, least resource intensive vehicles are more of a hindrance than a benefit. When the 5th Special Forces Group’s Operational Detachment Alpha 595 touched down and linked up with warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum – a Soviet-trained ethnic Uzbek military officer who had sided with the Northern Alliance against the predominantly Pashtun Taliban and who ultimately became a highly controversial figure accused of multiple human rights abuses and war crimes – they found his forces already conducting cavalry raids on horseback due to the lack of roads and even established trails in the area. “Looking back, it was the best means for travel because some of those places we went would have been non-permissive to even motorcycles ,” retired U.S. Air Force combat controller Bart Decker, who had served attached to ODA 595, said in 2016 . Members of ODA 595 and Northern Alliance fighters in Afghanistan in 2001., US Army “It was the wild, wild west,” U.S. Air Force Maj. Mike Sciortino, another former combat controller, who was then serving with the 31st Surgical Operations Squadron, added at the time. “When we first got in, they said we were probably going to ride horses … I had never ridden a horse before. I was like, are these guys serious?” The whole situation might have been a disaster had it not be for an amazing twist of fate. ODA 595’s commanding officer, U.S. Army Major Mark Nutsch, had grown up on a cattle ranch in Kansas and competed in rodeo events while he studied at Kansas State University. “The guys did a phenomenal job learning how to ride that rugged terrain,” he said in a later interview . “Initially you had a different horse for every move … and you’d have a different one, different gait or just willingness to follow the commands of the rider. … The guys had to work through all of that and use less than optimal gear. … Eventually we got the same pool of horses we were using regularly.” The Army manual is part of a clear, concerted effort to make sure U.S. special operators are more likely to be prepared in advance the next time there’s a need to mount up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 10, 2020",We’re Losing In Afghanistan And Sprinkling In Troops Won’t Likely Change That,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Within days of the Pentagon gaining the power to set American troop levels in Afghanistan independent of White House approval, there have been reports that the United States may soon send thousands more troops to the war torn country, even though U.S. military officials say they are still crafting a new strategy. But with Taliban and its partners, along with an emergent ISIS faction, continuing to make significant gains, it seems unlikely that the addition of a few thousand troops is any more the answer now than it has been for more than a decade. On June 14, 2017, during a hearing before members of the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Defense Subcommittee, Secretary of Defense James Mattis confirmed that President Donald Trump had given him direct authority to increase and decrease the number of American personnel in Afghanistan. At the time, there were approximately 8,400 U.S. troops in the Central Asian country. “The delegation of this authority does not in itself change the force levels for Afghanistan,” Mattis said in his written remarks . “This will enable our military to have greater agility to conduct operations.” Mattis made clear that this ability to rapidly respond to changing and emerging threats was critical if the United States wanted to finally change the course of the more than 15-year old conflict. And it is hard to argue that the situation hasn’t become markedly worse in the preceding year and half. Just since Jan. 1, 2017, at least eight American troops have died while supporting the mission, now known as Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, including two in a firefight with ISIS-linked militants and another three in a so-called “green-on-blue” insider attack. Afghanistan’s security forces suffered more than 800 fatal casualties in the same time frame, according to a report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). Secretary of Defense James Mattis meets with U.S. Forces-Afghanistan Command US Army Gen. John Nicholson and other coalition officials in April 2017. , NATO In its thirty-fifth quarterly report to Congress, which it released in May 2017, SIGAR also estimated that Afghanistan’s central government had complete authority over just two-thirds of the country. Other experts and observers contended that the true figure was probably even lower given that the American watchdog likely focused just on total numbers of population centers under nominal government control or otherwise free of insurgent influence, rather than total physical area. By most independent accounts, militants operate with virtual impunity in much of the countryside . With all this in mind, it’s no wonder that Mattis had earlier given a bluntly negative assessment of the situation on June 13, 2017. At another hearing, this time with members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, America’s top defense official answered pointed questions from Arizona Republican John McCain about just how things were going in Afghanistan. “We are not winning in Afghanistan right now,” Mattis declared. “We will correct this as soon as possible.” US Army He then told the outspoken Senator that the Pentagon was working on a new, comprehensive strategy for prosecuting the conflict, which would be ready for members of Congress to review by mid-July 2017 . However, citing the urgent nature of the situation, Mattis added that there were already interim plans underway to make sure the U.S. military and its Afghan and coalition partners wouldn’t “pay a price for the delay.” There is a definite sense of urgency. For months, insurgents and terrorists have continued to launch increasingly brazen attacks, even inside government-controlled centers, and expand their influence. On March 8, 2017, the Taliban launched a spectacular complex attack on the main military hospital deep inside the capital Kabul, massacring dozens of doctors, other medical staff, patients, and other innocent bystanders. This incident especially called into question just how much control the government has over even its largest and most heavily patrolled cities. Later that same month, the insurgents overran the government center in Helmand Province’s Sangin District. At the time U.S. Navy Captain William Salvin, the top spokesman for the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan, tried to downplay the situation by insisting the fighters hadn’t actually taken any of value. Rather than losing control of the strategic district center, the Afghan government had “repositioned the district center,” he claimed. “This move to a new district center has been planned for some time.” The Taliban have also launched new offensive to take over other major hubs, including in and around the long contested city of Kunduz much further north. Then in June 2017, Afghanistan’s ISIS branch, known formally as ISIS-Khorosan or ISIS-K, reportedly seized control of the infamous Tora Bora cave complex , where Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and his group’s top leadership had operated from before fleeing into neighboring Pakistan in December 2001. As American forces found out more than a decade ago, the region is isolated and easily defended. In spite of a massive aerial campaign, including B-52 bombers carpet bombing the area, Bin Laden and other senior Al Qaeda members had escaped unharmed. ISIS-K has already become well known for making use of Afghanistan’s naturally occurring caves, existing tunnel networks, and other fortified positions. In an attempt to root the terrorists out of a similar position in the Achin district of Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province in April 2017, U.S. special operations forces dropped the huge GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast , a 30-foot long 22,600 pound weapon nicknamed the Mother of All Bombs, for the first time in combat . A subsequent raid in the same province by American special operators and members of Afghanistan’s shadowy Ktah Khas battalion led to the death Abdul Hasib, the organization’s self-described emir. In June 2017, the U.S. Army released an odd, low quality picture of soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division firing a BGM-71 TOW missile at an ISIS-K position. American forces have long used anti-tank missiles, such as the TOW and the FGM-148 Javelin , to take out insurgents in Afghanistan hiding inside bunkers or behind other hard cover. This low quality image shows soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division firing a TOW missile at ISIS-K fighters., US Army On top of that, there have been reports that Russia may be looking to spoil the situation by actively supporting the Taliban in part in retaliation for unrelated U.S. sanctions . Then there’s the ever-present concern that Pakistan continues to be an unreliable partner and bad actor in the region, being either unable or unwilling to stop militants, most notably the ethnic Pashtun Haqqani Network , from operating on its side of the shared border with Afghanistan, and undermining any prospects for a lasting peace . Ever mindful of broad power dynamics, China may be looking to take advantage of Afghanistan’s weak institutions and the general upheaval in the country in order to boost its influence in Central Asia, too. So, with Afghanistan already dealing with these potential crises, reports of just what Mattis’ more immediate measures entailed seemed to quickly emerge on June 15, 2017, when unnamed sources told The Associated Press that the Pentagon was moving ahead with a deployment of approximately 4,000 troops. Previous reports suggested the U.S. military was considering a mini-troop surge of between 3,000 and 5,000 personnel. The bulk of this new force would be dispatched to advise and assist Afghanistan’s own security forces. At the end of April 2017, approximately 300 U.S. Marines arrived in Helmand , but that group replaced an existing U.S. Army unit and didn’t change the size of the overall American presence in the country. However, on June 16, 2017, the Pentagon refuted the new leaks, saying it had made no final decisions on any future troop increases. To be fair, without knowing the Pentagon’s full plan, it’s difficult to assess how significant any surge could be in the end in achieving its stated goals. Since the United States formally ended its combat mission in December 2014, its advisors have largely been limited to working with higher level headquarters, though special operations forces continued to coordinate and conduct operations at much lower levels. The hope would be that a new influx of trainers would allow them to engage directly within small Afghan military and police units and thereby improve their combat effectiveness. This would also mesh with separate plans for a major modernization and expansion of Afghanistan’s security forces, especially with regards to the country’s air force and special operations elements. In March 2017, unspecified sources told Reuters that the 17,000-strong Afghan National Army Special Operations Command (ANASOC), then responsible for more than 70 percent of all combat operations across the country, could ultimately double in size. Afghan National Army Mobile Strike Force Vehicles., SIGAR Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee any of this would work any better than it has in the past. Historically, Afghanistan’s endemic corruption has undercut these efforts. SIGAR has routinely found examples of American officials wasting money on unnecessary projects, local contractors defrauding the Untied States and the Afghan government, and more. The country’s military has routinely proven unable to quickly absorb deliveries of new equipment, even systems that offer only modest improvements , and put them to good use. And we’ve seen in Iraq and Syria that “advise and assist” missions with forces that are not able to operate independently of outside support, or are just insufficiently motivated, can easily translate into what most people would reasonably consider combat for American troops. Even without seeing Mattis’ final proposal, there are definitely reasons for skepticism of any plan “win” the war in Afghanistan in general, not least of which because so many of the individuals responsible for crafting the new strategy were involved to some degree in crafting the old ones they now say have failed. While he retired from the Marine Corps in 2013, his fellow Marine, General Joseph Dunford, who is now Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the head of American and coalition forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Army General John Nicholson, have been in uniform the whole time. Before taking up his current post, Dunford had held Nicholson’s job title. Nicholson previously served as both a brigade-level and regional commander in Afghanistan. In those positions, they both went on the record with pronouncements that later turned out to be far detached from the reality. In 2009, Nicholson, then a brigadier general and the top coalition officer in Southern Afghanistan, said he was “ unapologetically optimistic ” about the upcoming surge of troops that President Barack Obama had recently announced. “To me, to see this increase in U.S. forces means we are now resourcing our counterinsurgency appropriately to accomplish what it is we have laid down in our [Afghanistan-Pakistan] strategy,” he continued in an official military interview. “So I am very encouraged and feel that this is going to make a big difference.” At that time there were more than 50,000 American troops in the country. That number peaked two years later at more than 100,000. Does anyone even remember the highly touted “ Af-Pak ” strategy? As many were quick to point out in defense of Mattis and his new authorities, the reported additions would be significantly smaller, too. But it also begs the question of how such a small force is supposed to achieve any useful objectives. Separately, in July 2014, in his role as head of all foreign forces in Afghanistan, Dunford had whole-heartedly endorsed the then-new and now apparently much maligned strategy that would see advisers pull back to work exclusively in larger command centers. “The Afghans no longer need much help fighting the Taliban – they can do that on their own,” he declared in the introduction to an official handbook . One could argue that this should be seen as a more candid assessment since the guide was marked “for official use only” and not necessary intended for public consumption. The situation in Afghanistan has not reflected well on either Nicholson’s or Dunford’s comments. It seems likely that further digging would turn up even more dubious remarks after more than a decade of fighting and a carousel of general officers, including many others who have returned to the theater to serve in increasingly senior positions. The situation has become such that even some in the larger U.S. military community have come to view the entire enterprise as good fodder for some pretty dark humor . But “this administration will not repeat the mistakes of the past,” Mattis insisted in his prepared statement on June 14, 2017. “We cannot allow Afghanistan to once again become a launching point for attacks on our homeland or on our allies.” We’ll have to wait for him to present and implement his new plan to see if this holds true or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Says Its Future Bombers Will Have Protection From “All Missiles”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If claims made through Russian state media are to be believed – and one should always view them with a certain amount of skepticism – the country’s upcoming Tu-160M2 Blackjack bomber will have significantly improved defensive countermeasures, as well as updated avionics and mission systems. If the systems do make it into service on the new aircraft, the same equipment, or variants thereof, could make it onto the still-unseen PAK DA long-range bomber. On June 14, 2017, state-run media outlet TASS ran a story on the topic centered on an interview with Vladimir Mikheyev, the First Deputy CEO of Radio-Electronic Technologies Group, also known as Concern Radio-Electronic Technologies or by its Russian acronym KRET. The state-owned company produces a variety of products for civilian and military applications, including radios, navigation systems, radars, and intelligence gathering equipment. The Tu-160M2s “will have a principally new defensive aids system which is being developed as part of a new R&D effort,” Mikheyev said. “It will protect against all possible types of missiles. The system will detect targets at a distance of several hundred kilometers.” The Tu-160, which the Russians call Beliy Lebed or “White Swan,” is the country’s largest bomber and has a top speed, at full afterburner, of over Mach 2. A swing-wing design visually similar to the U.S. Air Force’s B-1 Bone, the four-engine aircraft is more comparable in overall size to the abortive XB-70 Valkyrie. Though the prototype first flew in 1981, the Tu-160 didn’t see combat until 2015 , when the Kremlin employed them to attack targets in Syria via cruse missile launches. Vitaly Kuzmin In 2014, the Russian military began receiving the first updated Tu-160Ms with improved avionics and mission systems. Now, the Kremlin wants to restart the production line and buy all-new M2 versions with the additional internal updates from firms like KRET, along with new engines and other more significant external modifications to improve fuel efficiency and overall range. As of June 2017, Moscow hoped to get the first of these bombers into service by 2021. https://youtube.com/watch?v=x77nflLUV94 The executive did not offer any additional details on how the new system or systems for the bombers might defeat incoming threats. TASS’ did add a definition for “defense system” that covered detecting and classifying incoming weapons, as well as destroying them. It is possible and perhaps likely that he could have been referring to a completely new suite of equipment that included optical, infrared, and radar-linked early warning sensors along with jamming gear, lasers able to deflect certain types of missiles, and traditional dispensers loaded with flares and chaff. Many of these types of systems, such as direction infrared countermeasures , already exist, but KRET could improve any or all of them by extending the range at which they first spot possible dangers, as Mikheyev alluded to, as well as how fast and actively defenses respond to the threat. The gear could involve more revolutionary technology, such as electrically-powered solid-state lasers or other systems that actually knock down incoming missiles. Another option might be to use highly focused beams of electromagnetic radiation to confuse or even destroy targeting radars or the seekers inside individual weapons. A conformal active electronically scanned radar (AESA) could do double duty in this role and Russia has already begun flying conformal arrays on their T-50 fighter jet prototypes. An turreted directional laser-based infrared countermeasures system is visible on the rear of the MC-130H. This is a first generation installation., USAF Over nearly the last two decades, laser-based direction infrared countermeasures used to blind incoming missiles have become so tiny they are almost impossible to spot unless without a very close examination of the aircraft. , Northrop Grumman The U.S. military is already working on a number of similar projects, though it remains tight-lipped about most of them. One of the most analogous, at least from what we know, is the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) advanced technology demonstration known by the forced acronym SHiELD, which stands for Self-protect High-Energy Laser Demonstrator. Earlier in 2017, we received briefings through the Freedom of Information Act regarding this and related programs that were heavily redacted and devoid of almost any real detail – we’ve included one of the briefing slides so you can see for yourself. The censored cited a statute, 10 U.S.C. § 130, which specifically exempts information from release if the U.S. government reasonable believes it provides enough detail on a sensitive technology for someone to reverse engineer or similarly use it for their own purposes. USAF via FOIA What is clear is that the U.S. Air Force is looking for a podded, turreted laser for aircraft that can shoot down threatening projectiles. Beyond that, it needs to have the necessary equipment project and aim the beam, keep it stable, and make sure everything stays cool enough for multiple shots in a relatively short amount of time, as well as a power source to run all those components. In 2014, an interesting partnership between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, AFRL, Lockheed Martin, and Notre Dame University demonstrated a beam-control turret that fits the description of that part of the system. In 2016, Northrop Grumman received a new contract for development work related to the SHiELD turret. The notional system has become a key component of emerging sixth-generation fighter jet concepts . As of 2014, the U.S. Navy was also exploring the idea of a less intensive and shorter range Helicopter Active RPG Protection (HARP) program, which would be small enough to potentially fit on smaller aircraft, as well. However, this notional system, which would use a chemical- or kinetic-energy interceptor to blow up small projectiles, wouldn’t work in the high-altitude combat scenario a heavy bomber would be more likely to experience. Regardless, with various countries working on stealth technology and hypersonic and highly maneuverable air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, the crew of a non-stealthy bomber might have little time to react and no ability to dodge threats. As such, an active, fast-cueing, and likely automated defense system might be vital to survival in a future conflict. Dmitry Terekhov via Wikimedia Similar considerations seem to have gone into KRET’s plans for the Tu-160M2’s new navigation equipment. Mikheyev described a combination of gear that would allow crews to continue the mission even if one or more systems were damaged or otherwise unusable. “In this area, the requirements for navigation are changed completely,” he explained to TASS. “In this sense, everything will be principally new. The aircraft will feature a strapdown inertial navigation system, a new astronavigation system and a whole number of instruments, including a new satellite navigation system.” Though the satellite navigation system – likely linked to Russia’s GLONASS GPS-equivalent satellite network – would no doubt be a welcome improvement, the astronavigation equipment is the more notable item. The idea of a modern bomber crew using the stars to plot their position and course is nothing to laugh at. If an enemy force begins attacking space-based systems during a conflict, aircraft without a reliable backup system might find themselves effectively flying blind. Since Russia is steadily developing its own anti-satellite arsenal , one would imagine its military is especially aware of the increasingly real threat. KRET’s deputy head isn’t talking about a navigator with a manual sextant , either. The company makes advanced electronic star-scanning systems that can do the work automatically. The U.S. Air Force’s now retired SR-71 spy plane had a similar system and B-2 bombers, among other aircraft, still do, for the same reasons. All of these systems could be just as useful on the future PAK DA, depending on its final design. Fan art and animations of the proposed aircraft depicts a variety of the advanced shapes, but a blended wing, subsonic design seems most likely . However, despite nearly a decade of reports, to date Tupolev hasn’t released any official art , let alone pictures of a mockup or prototype.  If Russia’s low observable (stealth) technology cannot defeat a wide variety of radar bands, not to mention infrared sensors, these types of defensive systems may be especially critical for this new bomber. In fact, Russia’s focus on these defensive measures might actually be a tacit admission that their own work on aircraft with low-observable features and high-end data fusion and sensor technology, aimed to enhance survivability and the aircrew’s overall situational awareness while in combat, might be lagging far behind that of its potential opponents. It’s also worth noting that many advanced defensive electronic warfare systems can double as offensive weapons, able to actively scramble communications or radar receivers. In addition, the sensors scoop up much of the same information as electronic intelligence arrays, giving them another potential role. The War Zone has highlighted these features with regards to the combination of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s electro-optical targeting system, distributed aperture system – which already helps cue defensive gear to incoming missiles – and especially its radar and super-sensitive electronic surveillance equipment. In theory, this could make the jets a powerful intelligence collector and, with the help of advanced data links, push that information out to other aircraft or forces on the ground. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZyPR6uL6NBI Of course, as always with Russian military modernization programs , there is an inherent cost factor . Between the country’s flagging economy and sanctions over its foreign military interventions and attempts to influence foreign government and political systems, the Kremlin has repeatedly found itself strapped for cash and has already had to delay major procurement programs indefinitely to free up funds for other priorities. The country may just have a lot of catching up to do in general. For instance, Russia’s President S directional infrared countermeasures system, which is similar in size, if not more ungainly, to first generation American systems, only appeared in the late 2000s and seems to be just hitting the battlefield now. However, new and upgraded aircraft remain high on Moscow’s wish list and the kind of systems Mikheyev alluded to are much more realistic than some of other reports that come out of Russia’s state-operated media outlets. According to TASS, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov explained that developing systems that would ultimately go into both the Tu-160M2 and PAK DA would help save money, too. Its always possible some of the equipment could end up on other existing bombers, such as the Tu-22M Backfire or the Tu-95 and -142 Bears. If the Kremlin does intend to follow through with its plan to start making Tu-160M2s within four years, we should find out soon enough if KRET is working serious on these systems or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2020",Timing Of Qatar Finally Signing $12 Billion F-15 Deal Is Wildly Controversial,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Qatar has finally moved forward with a long-standing plan to buy advanced fighter jets from the United States. This comes amid a massive spat between the small country and Saudi Arabia that has spiraled into a huge political crisis throughout the Middle East and beyond. On June 14, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that the Qataris would sign a $12 billion deal to buy up to 36 F-15QA fighter jets from Boeing. The country’s Ministry of Defense later announced it had reached an agreement, which followed a meeting between Minister of State for Defense Affairs Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis that day, but did not confirm the total number of aircraft in the order or offer any expected delivery schedule. The F-15QA – standing for “Qatar Advanced” – is a version of Boeing’s latest version of the fighter, the F-15 Advanced Eagle. Derived from the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle, the multi-role jet features two General Electric F-110-129 engines – also found on Saudi Arabia’s F-15S and SA , Singapore’s F-15SG, and South Korea’s F-15K – each of which produce almost 30,000 pounds of thrust, along with a host of improvements to the aircraft’s avionics and mission systems. More visibly, the new variant includes two additional underwing hardpoints. When it first revealed the design, the Chicago-headquartered firm prominently featured these new additions in its press packages, highlighting the plane’s ability to carry as many as 16 AIM-120 long-range air-to-air missiles . Bristling with hardpoints, the aircraft can carry up to 23,000 pounds of ordnance and  external fuel, including both air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons, according to Boeing. The Eagle is also upgraded with a full fly-by-wire flight control system. This not only enhances maneuverability, but also safety. USAF F-15E Strike Eagles., USAF In addition, the fighters can come with either the AN/APG-63(V)3 or AN/APG-82(V)1 radar, both active electronically scanned array (AESA) types from Raytheon. These are widely regarded as the most powerful and capable fighter radar sets in existence. The U.S. Air Force is in the process of upgrading its F-15C/D aircraft with the AN/APG-63(V)3 and Singapore and Saudi Arabia both chose this unit for their latest jets. The AN/APG-82(V)1 is becoming standard on the F-15E. We don’t know the exact configuration of the QA version and Boeing has historically offered a variety of optional extras to specific customers, such as Israel , as well. It seems likely, especially given the nomenclature, that the Qatari version will be similar to the Saudi F-15SA , which is the most advanced Eagle variant in service to date. Beyond the F-110-129 engines and AN/APG-63(V)3 radar, the SA variant has an updated “glass” cockpit with a large digital multi-function display, advanced early warning systems and defensive countermeasures, and the ability to use helmet-mounted displays in both the front and rear cockpits. On top of that, there is an infrared search and track system , nicknamed “Tiger Eyes,” in the pylon holding a targeting pod under the left engine intake. The Saudi planes come ready to carry a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons, including the AIM-9X and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles, the AGM-84 Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) cruise missile, and the dual-mode GBU-54/B Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) smart bomb. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uO8om2ojRVg But the execution of the Qatari Eagle deal at this time is clearly ironic, given that earlier in June 2017, the regime in Riyadh and many of its regional allies severed all links, diplomatic and physical, with its smaller neighbor, touching off a far-reaching crisis with no end in sight. The Saudis said their decision was ostensibly over Qatar’s links to terrorist organizations, but tensions between the two have were already long simmering when the situation finally boiled over, something we’ve reported on previously in detail at The War Zone. Separately, political turmoil in the United States has hampered its ability to step in as peacemaker. A Saudi Arabian F-15S., USAF On June 6, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted out his apparent support for the Saudi move, accusing Qatar of “funding of Radical Ideology.” His administration, however, attempted to take a more nuanced and diplomatic approach to a flap between two major regional allies. “We call on Qatar to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on June 9, 2017 . “[But] the blockade is also impairing U.S. and other international business activities in the region and has created a hardship on the people of Qatar and the people whose livelihoods depend on commerce with Qatar. The blockade is hindering U.S. military actions in the region and the campaign against ISIS.” Tillerson was referring in part to the U.S. military’s use of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is home to the U.S. Air Force’s Combined Air Operations Center for operations across the Middle East and Central Asia, among other things. Though the Pentagon had quickly tried to downplay the crisis a “political issue” that wouldn’t impact operations, we at The War Zone worried about the implications for the fight against ISIS and other military activities in the region. Tyler Rogoway wrote: By calling this a “political issue” the Pentagon must see the Saudis’ claims toward Qatar as straight up false or as a matter of dubious equivalency, because it is nearly impossible to argue that those claims are not directly associated with the US-led coalition’s military mission in Qatar. Especially considering that America’s primary goal in the region is to stamp out the same sort of extremism that the Saudi’s allege Qatar supports, even if in a tacit manner. This may turn out to be a truer test of where America’s ideals really lie, as well as the Trump Administration’s political will when it comes to the fight against terror, as any. If these allegations are true, the US stands to only erode its moral high ground on the issue if it refuses to act. And how can America expect to ask more for the counter-terror fight from its Arab allies, like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain if it doesn’t live by the same standards it preaches? But within hours of Tillerson’s comments, Trump seemed to repudiate those remarks again, saying that he had agreed with other world leaders during a recent state visit to Saudi Arabia that the time had come to punish Qatar for funding terrorist organizations. “The nation of Qatar has unfortunately been a funder of terrorism, and at a very high level,” Trump said during a shared press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. “So we had a decision to make. Do we take the easy road or do we finally take hard but necessary action?” A Qatari Mirage 2000-5, USN The Qatari fighter deal, in the works since 2015, had already been fraught with problems . President Barack Obama and his administration held back on approving the sale, a decision that seemed intended to placate Iran as part of the push for a major international agreement over that country’s nuclear program. In the interim, Qatar had put in an order for 24 Rafale from French plane maker Dassault. The Qatari Emiri Air Force wanted new fighters in the first place to replace its aging fleet of Mirage 2000-5s, another Dassault product. After considerable pressure from supporters of the sale in Congress, the Obama administration finally signed off on the deal in November 2016. By that point, unfortunately, there were new, serious concerns about whether Qatar’s budget shortfalls might scuttle various military modernization programs. So, between the Rafale purchase and Saudi pressure, it remains unclear how many F-15s the small peninsular country will ultimately receive. Back in 2015, Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, told Defense News that the plan called for a total of 73 aircraft, with an initial production run of 36 aircraft. This may be the number Bloomberg was relying on in its latest report. It’s worth noting that the country’s air force hasn’t gotten any of the Rafales yet, either. F-15 Advanced Eagle., Boeing “This proposed sale enhances the foreign policy and national security of the United State by helping to improve the security of a friendly country and strengthening our strategically important relationship,” the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on November 17, 2016. “The proposed sale of this aircraft, equipment, training, and support services will not alter the basic military balance in the region,” it added, using canned language the United States includes in notices about all major arms deals. It remains to be seen if those statements still hold true after more than a year and half. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air F-15 Fighters"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 16, 2019",USAF and USN Both Come To Terms With Long 4th Generation Fighter Futures,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to extend the life of hundreds of F-16C/D Vipers, even more than we previously reported . At the same time, the U.S. Navy seems to have come to a similar conclusion with plans to buy more and better F/A-18E/F Super Hornet derivatives. Suffice it to say that the 4th generation fighter will be alive and well within the Pentagon’s inventory for a long, long time to come. On June 12, 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) posted a presolictation notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps regarding production of upgrade kits for the service’s F-16 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The latest announcement on the project, now more than three years in the making, has the service pushing the maximum equivalent flight hours for up to 841 Block 40/42 and 50/52 F-16C/D aircraft to more than 13,800 hours in total. The F-16C/D’s original life expectancy was 8,000 hours. “The F-16 USAF SLEP intends to extend the aircrafts current structural service life from 8,000 equivalent flight hours (EFH) up to 13,856 EFH by modifying and/or repairing life limiting, fractural critical, and safety of flight critical structure,” the notice explained. “This effort seeks to award a contract to a vendor who can manufacture and/or procure, assemble, and deliver up to the estimated maximum quantity of 841 F-16 Block 40-52, C/D-Model SLEP modification kits necessary to extend the structural service life of these aircraft, in accordance with Government standards and specifications defined in the Technical Data Package.” This is a dramatic increase over the previous announcement in April, where Lockheed and the Air Force said they expected to overhaul just 340 aircraft – 300 F-16Cs and another 40 F-16Ds, with all of the latter going straight to allies – and added only 4,000 hours of life to the airframes. An earlier draft proposal AFLCMC released in December 2016 did specify upgrade packages that could provide up to 6,000 additional fight hours. The Air Force estimated value of the contract would be no more than $403 million in total. However, the final details are still subject to change and its not clear how many, if any, of the planned kits would be destined for foreign air forces. USAF Of course, while the SLEP will keep these jets flying safely, it’s not necessary enough to keep them competitive against a near-peer opponent and be useful supplement to the advanced, stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighter . Most importantly, the Air Force’s F-16 fleet is in desperate need of new radars to maintain its combat edge, even when compared to other fourth generation fighters, such as the service’s own F-15C Eagle. However, the Air Force is already pursuing just such as an upgrade program on behalf of the Air National Guard and its Vipers. On June 7, 2017, Northrop Grumman announced it had received a contract to add its AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) type, to 72 Guard F-16s in order “to meet a U.S. Northern Command Joint Emergent Operational Need for homeland defense.” Contractors install an AN/APG-83 radar on an F-16 at Edwards Air Force Base., Northrop Grumman “AESA radar upgrades are critically important to give the F-16 community, the tactical advantage it deserves, and we are honored to provide this differentiating technology for the safety and mission effectiveness of our warfighters,” Bob Gough, the Vice President of Northrop Grumman’s Combat Avionics Systems division, said in a statement . “The APG-83 SABR system is in full rate production and available now for U.S. and international F-16 upgrades.” The SABR is already a key component of the F-16V , an upgrade package that Lockheed Martin offers to existing Viper operators, as well as the F-16 Block 70 , which the company is offering on the export market. On top of that radar, the V model modifications include new avionics and mission systems, while the Block 70 includes similar improvements. Taiwan has already contracted with Lockheed to convert its existing F-16A/B aircraft into new V versions, while the Maryland headquartered firm has entered the Block 70 into India’s latest fighter competition. If the Air Force decides to combine the APG-83 upgrade with the SLEP, it could potentially doom the F-15C/D fleet. In March 2017, the service revealed it was studying the potential positive and negative impacts of retiring all of these Eagles , but the details of its budget request for the 2018 fiscal year indicated the plan was at least on hold. An F-15C Eagle., USAF The budget proposal includes $7 million to replace the longerons on some of the Eagles, which could extend their service life into the 2030s. It’s not entirely clear how many aircraft this funding would cover. In an interview with FlightGlobal, Steve Parker, Boeing’s Vice President for F-15 programs, seemed to suggest that it would cost about $1  per aircraft, meaning that this funding would let the Air Force overhaul less than 10 jets out of a fleet of nearly 180 aircraft.  Regardless, this does nothing to address the more serious and potentially expensive issue of refitting the F-15C/D’s main fuselage section, wings, and other components, which might require between $30 and $40 million per aircraft. Still, Boeing says this is a worst case scenario and the aircraft may need far less costly structural work to remain in the air for decades to come. If the Air Force’s optimistic estimates for F-16 SLEP package are accurate – and there is no guarantee that they are or will be forever – the price tag of each upgrade kit is less than $500,000. How much more it might take to actually install the parts is unclear. But it seems likely that overhauling the Vipers would still be substantially less costly, something which the service might find hard to ignore in any final debate over the future of the Eagles. Regardless, with more than 800 upgraded legacy fighter jets, the Air Force looks increasingly set to abandon its overly ambitious plans to buy more than 1,700 Joint Strike Fighter. An F/A-18E Super Hornet., USN The Navy, which expects to buy a relatively small number of F-35Cs , is also pushing ahead with plans to upgrade and even expand its fleet of fourth-generation fighter jets. The service’s fiscal year 2018 budget request includes more than $87 million for a SLEP for existing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growler jamming aircraft, plus millions more for other modifications across the Super Hornet fleet. The Navy reportedly plans to ultimately upgrade at least some of its existing Super Hornets with elements of Boeing’s new, so-called Block III Super Hornet configuration . Boeing first proposed similar modifications in 2008, calling the version the Advanced, or Block III Super Hornet. The package includes a new heads up display, as well as improved avionics and mission systems, including a new Distributed Targeting Processor Network computer. The plan will also add Tactical Targeting Network Technology data links to help pilots share and receive more and better information about the battlefield around them. In addition, the improvement program will add Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFT), to extend the aircraft’s range without impairing its overall performance . Enhanced performance GE-F414 engines with roughly 20 perfect more thrust are also optional, as is an enclosed, stealthy, ventral weapons pod. The add-ons may have a secondary benefit of reducing the aircraft’s radar signature and there’s talk of adding a radar-absorbing coating, too. The Navy says a unspecified portion of these upgrades will filter down to the EA-18G , too. Separately, it is planning to add infra-red search and tracking technology to the Super Hornets so pilots have another tool on top of their radars to help detect opponents. On top of that, the Navy wants to buy at least 80 all-new Super Hornets , likely in the Block III configuration, in order to make up a growing fighter jet shortfall, especially as older F/A-18C/D Hornet aircraft simply age out. But the service is unlikely to be interested in letting things get as bad as they have in the Marine Corps. The Marine Hornet fleet has become increasingly unsustainable, with the Corps raiding the Boneyard and even a museum for aircraft and spare parts in order to keep an adequate number of jets mission ready in the past. Still, the USMC says roughly 70 percent of their Hornet force cannot fly at any given time. These purchases will cost the Navy an estimated $7 billion plus over a span of five years, which is great news for Boeing’s struggling Super Hornet production line in St. Louis. With the new aircraft, upgrades, and depot-level refurbishment, the Navy expects the Super Hornet Fleet to remain combat ready into the 2040s. All in all, though the Air Force, Navy, and Marines remain committed to the Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon seems to be finally coming around to the idea—or maybe the fiscal reality—that there is still a place in America’s future fighter fleets for upgraded fourth generation aircraft.

There was no word as to when the Navy expected to start that work, what the timeline would be for installing the equipment on the rest of the Nimitz -class carriers, or whether the gear would be standard on the up-coming Ford -class ships . “MQ-25 Stingray will pioneer the integration of manned and unmanned operations, demonstrate mature complex sea-based … technologies, and pave the way for future multifaceted multi-mission UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] to pace emergent threats,” the Navy said in a review of the highlights from its budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year. “FY 2018 will continue work that was begun under UCLASS [Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike] and leverage previous work completed, focusing on the three segment areas: air, control system and connectivity, and carrier development.” According to NAVAIR, the modifications to Eisenhower and Bush fall under the “connectivity” and “carrier development” portions of the program. To help pay for the changes, with Congressional approval, the Navy shifted $26.7 million in funding the service had previously set aside for a planned 4-year refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) for their sister ship the USS George Washington . The Pentagon’s fiscal year 2018 budget request included approximately $222 million for general research and development of the MQ-25A aircraft itself. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B., USN The expectation is that the experience with the previous Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) project and the experimental X-47B unmanned aircraft will make these portions, or at least certain elements within them, relatively simple. While the exact final design of the aircraft, or even its basic configuration, remains almost entirely unknown, the control systems and connections necessary to launch, operate, and land a drone of this size are not. The control station for the Stingray will most likely be the notional MD-5A, which the Navy has had in the works for years already. In its formal request for the control station’s nomenclature in 2014, the Navy described the carrier version of the UCLASS Mission Control System, or CVN UMCS, as a line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight control setup using a “integrated Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solution” including the Common Display System (CDS), Remote Common Electronics Module (RCEM), and Common Processing Systems (CPS), as the key hardware components. The system would use the Common Control System (CCS) software suite for unmanned aerial systems, as well as gear to connect all of these systems to the carriers existing computer networks. The 2016 request for what became the MQ-25 designation also mentioned the aircraft’s data links would be compatible with the Distributed Common Ground Station-Navy intelligence production and sharing network as part of continued plans for a limited surveillance mission. The author previously obtained both of these documents via the Freedom of Information Act. Beyond those parameters, the Navy may actually already have a pretty good idea of the size constraints and any signal interference issues of installing the control systems, which would be some of the bigger considerations. Bush previously hosted Northrop Grumman’s X-47B during a series of at-sea flight tests. The ship was responsible for the first ever catapult launch of a drone on May 14, 2013. The next month, the vessel recovered the drone in the first ever arrested landing by an unmanned aircraft. Afterwards, the USS Theodore Roosevelt took over as the flight test ship. Earlier in 2013, Navy officials had sent the X-47B out to the USS Harry S. Truman , but just to see whether it would be compatible with the Nimitz-class’ hangar bays, aircraft elevators, and existing communication systems. With so many transmissions already going in and out of an aircraft carrier, it was important to see if the pilotless plane’s systems would be confused by that, interfere with the workings of other systems, or both. The sheer volume of radio and radar emissions on warships means that the Navy has to be especially conscious of the potential hazards, which even include accidentally setting off electrical fuzes inside bombs and missiles. As such, the service relies on munitions with features deemed Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) “safe” in order to prevent potentially deadly incidents. The X-47B touches down on the USS George H.W. Bush in 2013., USN It’s also worth noting that when the Navy decided to in 2016 to change the Stingray’s planned mission set , from strike and intelligence duties to acting as a recovery tanker with a secondary surveillance function, it only requested a new designation – MQ-25A rather than the previous RAQ-25A moniker – for the future aircraft, not the control stations. The requirements for the MD-5 series remained conceptually unchanged. It’s unclear whether the future MQ-25 with its new functions will ultimately make use of the previously proposed shore-based MD-5B or mobile, land-based MD-5C. The MD-5A will likely continue to be the nomenclature for the carrier-specific system workers install on Eisenhower and Bush . Unfortunately, The actual design and ultimate operational concept for the Stingray will undoubtedly continue to be the more complicated portion of the program, which now appears to be simply called Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA). When the Navy fundamentally changed the UCLASS’ proposed function in 2016, it initially referred to the refocused aerial tanker drone program as the Carrier-Borne Aerial Refueling System (C-BARS). On April 23, 2017, the service announced it had awarded contract modifications worth more than $18 million each to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, for additional design work on their MQ-25 proposals. This from Lockheed Martin is the extent of the MQ-25A-specific concept art to date., Lockheed Martin So far, only Lockheed Martin has released any artwork specifically associated with the project, showing only an under-wing probe-and-drogue tanking pod, similar in size and shape to existing buddy-tanking pods the Navy has already had in service for years. The designs the four companies had initially proposed for the UCLASS program – Boeing’s Phantom Ray, General Atomics’ Sea Avenger, Lockheed Martin’s Sea Ghost, and Northrop Grumman’s X-47C –  all had low-observable shapes and features based around the idea of strike and intelligence missions in an so-called “anti-access/area-denial” (A2/AD) environment, which may no longer be necessary for an unmanned aircraft that the service now expects will mainly orbit near the carrier itself. “The Navy came out with these requirements perhaps in the last six to eight months, and they still haven’t given us the final system requirements document – that should be coming any day – with specifically what they want this tanker to do,” Rob Weiss, head of Lockheed’s Skunk Works advanced projects office, which was responsible for the Sea Ghost design, to USNI in March 2017. “From our viewpoint, the requirements, as they are currently unfolding, are going to require a new design from all of the competitors.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=CO8s3sLZHXg The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway has already written in detail about the U.S. military’s progress on unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) in general, as well as the issues involved in the Navy’s decision to pursue a pilotless tanker rather than its more ambitious earlier proposal for a stealthy unmanned attacker and spy that could potentially penetrate deep into enemy territory for networked “swarming” strikes and persistent surveillance of denied areas. In April 2017, he specifically wrote the following as part of a series of recommendations for how American’s naval arm might restructure its priorities: The Navy was supposed to field an advanced UCAV (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle) for its carriers by the end of decade. Strangely that requirement has been dumbed down into a sensor and refueling platform once dubbed Carrier-Borne Aerial Refueling System, or C-BARS. Now the Navy calls it a MQ-25 Stingray, but what it isn’t is a stealthy, hard hitting, penetrating UCAV that it could have been. The terrible decision to go for a drone tanker and sensor platform over a UCAV – that could have done both roles as well as many others – was likely the result of a cultural override by the Navy that historically protects the fighter pilot as a concept, as well as a move to protect high priority (and highly lucrative) manned fighter programs like the F-35C, and even the Super Hornet to some extent. These aircraft could quickly become far less relevant once the UCAV genie is let out of its bottle. But tanking and orbiting around collecting information, that unglamorous role can be done by the drone without putting the fighter cadre at risk. USN An unnamed Navy spokesperson told USNI News that the program was still too “pre-decision” to even speculate on when a production aircraft might actually be combat ready. Other sources told them that the service hoped to introduce the MQ-25 into carrier air wings sometime between 2019 and 2020. So, even if the design for the control stations and data links remain relatively consistent, the very concept of the MQ-25 itself may change radically as the research and engineering development stages continue and the Navy’s priorities continue to evolve. In a world full of evolving threats in space , hypersonic weapons , and other advanced challenges , the Stingray could easily experience more fundamental changes in both design and overall purpose before it finally reaches the fleet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2019",One Faulty Part Halted THAAD Interceptor Production for Four Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States and its allies see Lockheed Martin’s Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) missile defense system as an important defense against the growing threat of ballistic missiles. Unfortunately, this only adds to nagging concerns about the company’s quality control processes, as well as the overall effectiveness of the weapons, as The War Zone has previously reported in detail , which may have an effect on an already controversial deployment of the systems to South Korea, as well as deals with existing and potential customers. During the fiscal year, Lockheed delivered less than half of the total number of interceptors the U.S. Missile Defense Agency had ordered due to a fault in an unspecified connector within the missiles, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) revealed in a May 2017 report . The problem halted production line at the company’s plant in Troy, Alabama for four months, Bloomberg subsequently reported . “Upon investigation, the contractor learned that one of its sub-vendors changed the manufacturing process on the connector without informing Lockheed Martin and, as a result, production was temporarily halted,” GAO’s annual review of the Pentagon’s missile defense programs explained. “According to THAAD program officials, there has been a renewed emphasis on parts quality supported by a policy memo to emphasize parts quality assurance and the verification of implementation of various requirements for doing so, including onsite verification assessments at subcontractor facilities.” When the issue was identified, Lockheed had already shipped 158 of the interceptors of a total 428 missiles the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) plans to buy by the end of 2025, according to Bloomberg. As a result, the subsequent production delays did not impact the controversial deployment of THAAD batteries to South Korea in March 2017. MDA Though Lockheed “was not delivering interceptors during this period, they were continuing the production of unaffected components in order to rapidly deliver interceptors once the affected component was qualified,” Leah Garton, an MDA spokesperson, told Bloomberg in an Email. The company “designed a simpler connector that will provide greater reliability and producibility.” Separately, the Maryland-headquartered defense contractor told Bloomberg that the THAAD production line was not only back on track, but actually speeding up work. The firm expected to fulfill the last of the delayed deliveries by August 2017. Lockheed Martin But this is not the first time the missile defense system has experienced significant quality control problems and other delays. After winning a contract to begin engineering and manufacturing development in 2000, it took Lockheed five years to actually flight test its next prototype. This was in no small part due to a series of deadly explosions in 2003 at the Pratt and Whitney facility in San Jose, California responsible for building the interceptor’s rocket motor. The company had to find a new sub-contractor for this work. A year later, Pratt and Whitney announced it would shutter the troubled complex for good. Suggesting that there have been more unreported quality control issues since then, in 2015, the U.S. Army quietly replaced all of its interceptors situated on Guam for unspecified reasons in order to “maintain operational readiness.” Two years earlier, the Pentagon decided to send a THAAD battery to the remote American island in the Pacific over increasing fears about the range and capability of North Korean ballistic missiles, specifically the BM-25 Musudan. All of this may give American allies political ammunition to renegotiate the terms of U.S. military deployments of the system abroad, as well as potential Pentagon-assisted purchases of the interceptors. After his victory in a special election following the impeachment of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the country’s new liberal head of state Moon Jae-in has attempted to slow the deployment of American THAAD systems into the country with a possibly eye toward halting the operation altogether. During the election campaign, his advisers indicated he would launch a review of the agreement with the United States. “At the end of the day, if the reality unfolds in a way that South Korea’s national security and the economy were damaged because of the THAAD, not because of the North Korea issue, then it’s not really a rational situation, is it?” Choi Jong Kun, one of the Moon campaign’s foreign policy advisors, told Reuters in March 2017. THAAD launchers arrive in South Korea in March 2017., US Army After winning the polls in May 2017, in a phone call to Defense Minister Han Min-koo, the new president said he was in “ extreme shock ” that an additional four American missile launchers had arrived in the country without his knowledge. It later emerged that the country’s defense officials had deliberately withheld this information. On June 7, 2017, the new government announced it would not approve any new deployments until the completion of an environmental assessment . Word of shoddy work at Lockheed may give South Korean authorities new reason to pause and reassess the situation. It may impact planned sales of the system, as well as any deals with existing customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), too. The UAE received their first THAAD interceptors in 2015 and have been steadily working to establish a site along its Persian Gulf coastline , undoubtedly pointed at Iran and its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. A 2010 Defense Security Cooperation Agency memo suggests the small country may have already secured its own version of the system . https://youtube.com/watch?v=pEQht8atht8 The multi-billion dollar arms deal the Trump Administration has offered Saudi Arabia also includes as many as seven THAAD batteries for the Kingdom’s defense. On top of concerns about Iranian ballistic missile program, in recent years, the country has come under more immediate threat from Yemeni rebels firing older, short-range ballistic missiles. In May 2017, The New York Times reported that White House advisor and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had personally talked to Lockheed’s CEO Marillyn Hewson about cutting the costs of the THAAD systems in the package, and the critical Raytheon-made AN/TPY-2 long-range radar in particular. With this new information, the Saudis may want to talk again, but about the final price tag of the interceptors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EOdDTOwZm5w In addition, in 2012, the U.S. State Department approved a sale of THAAD systems to Qatar. Four years later, The Wall Street Journal reported that budget problems in the country might have delayed the final purchase deal, valued at approximately $6 billion. The June 2017 decision by a broad political bloc led by Saudi Arabia to isolate the emirate , which quickly touched off a broader crisis , may impede the sale even further, though this would have nothing to do with cost or any inherent issues with the missiles themselves. There may be plans in the works to send American interceptors to Turkey , or sell the weapons directly to that country, as well. We will definitely be keeping an eye out for any new developments in the THAAD program, its overseas deployments, and future sales.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 13, 2018",U.S. Drones May Have Been Gunning For Top Somali Terrorists in New Strike,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has conducted the first airstrike against Al Shabaab terrorists in Somalia since President Trump granted new authorities and designated part of the country as an “area of active hostilities.” The mission is the latest evidence of a campaign against the group’s leadership on the part of the United States, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and the Somali government, which may actually be almost a year old already. One June 11, 2017, American drones – possibly U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reapers from the base at Chabelley Air Field in Djibouti – hit what U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) described as a “command and logistics node” 185 miles south of the Somali capital Mogadishu. The command did not give any details about the “precision” weapons they employed, but estimated that eight members of Al Shabaab had died in the strike. “U.S. forces, in cooperation with the Government of Somalia, are conducting operations against al-Shabaab in Somalia to degrade the al-Qaeda affiliate’s ability to recruit, train and plot external terror attacks throughout the region and in America,” an AFRICOM press release explained. “The group has cemented its control southern and central Somalia, they have used this area to plot and direct terror attacks, steal humanitarian aid, and to shelter other radical terrorists.” “The U.S. conducted this operation in coordination with its regional partners as a direct response to al-Shabaab actions, including recent attacks on Somali forces,” Pentagon Chief Spokesperson Dana White wrote in a separate statement . “This strike was conducted with the authorities approved by the President [Donald Trump] in March 2017, which allows the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct legal action against al-Shabaab within a geographically-defined area of active hostilities in support of partner force in Somalia.” An MQ-9 Reaper., USAF However, the nature of the operation and its location, combined with information from previous reports, suggests this may have been an attempt to target Al Shabaab leadership figures rather than just a punitive response. Regardless of how you measure the distance, 185 miles southwest of Mogadishu brings you relatively close to the town of Jilib, the terrorist group’s main stronghold in southern Somalia. In an Email to the War Zone, U.S. Army Captain Jennifer Drycz, an AFRICOM spokesperson, said the official distance between the two cities was 230 miles and that the strike was not technically in “the same vicinity” of Jilib. The body count of just eight fighters points to a very limited precision attack rather than a broad strike on a militant encampment. In March 2016, the Pentagon acknowledged an attack on an Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula training camp in Yemen, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of terrorists . The obtuse target description may indicate U.S. forces missed the individuals they had intended to kill. Prior to the mission, there seemed to be an uptick in reports of surveillance missions and possible strikes in and around Jilib specifically stretching back nearly a year. In August 2016, Al Shabaab burned three private cars outside Jilib, because the militants were convinced U.S. forces had installed tracking devices inside them. The group reportedly became suspicious after spotting surveillance drones circling the vehicles in question. Three months later, the terrorists released a video of a Tanzanian citizen confessing, possibly under duress, to being a spy for both the United States and Rwanda. Before his execution by firing squad, Issa James Mwaisige said he had received $4,000 to gather various types of information , including details about the group’s top leadership. A Kenyan Army MD 500 Defender touches down at the airport in Kismayo in 2012., AMISOM Perhaps more interestingly, AFRICOM has pointedly denied the United States was involved in any airstrikes in Somalia since an attack on September 16, 2016 that went awry and killed more than a dozen members of a local, government-aligned security force in Galkayo, northeast of Mogadishu. On April 17, 2017, the command released a statement saying it had not been involved in any way in strikes three days earlier, which local witnesses said resulted in the deaths of two Al Shabaab senior leaders. On June 4, 2017, the U.S. military again said it was not behind reported airstrikes in Somalia that day. Local media claimed foreign warplanes had hit terrorists in Welmarow – which they described as being near Jilib, despite being approximately 40 miles away – after which special operations forces moved in and attacked the remaining militants. The Kenyan Air Force, which is known to conduct aerial attacks in Somalia from time to time, may have been responsible in both of these cases, but whoever was responsible could have at least coordinated with or received intelligence from American forces beforehand. “US forces closely coordinated with the Federal Government of Somalia but for operational security reasons we will not go into specifics on  coordination,” Captain Drycz said of the June 11 strike in her Email. The War Zone Be sure to check out the latest version of our interactive Google Map showing where the U.S. military is operating in Africa. It’s something of an open secret that the U.S. military, and more specifically the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), has been conducting targeted strikes against Al Shabaab since the group formed itself from the remnants of the Islamic Courts Union in 2006. The War Zone has already written in depth about this shadowy campaign and the history of America’s military involvement in Somalia in general. In July 2015, citing Somali and African Union officials, Foreign Policy first reported the existence of JSOC personnel situated at the airports in Baledogle, northwest of Mogadishu, and in the port city of Kismayo, which sits about a 100 miles from the Kenyan border. You can see the relative position of these sites, as well as other mentioned in this story, on our custom Google Map of America’s military presence across Africa. A rare photo of what appear to be members of Gaashaan in a pickup marked “SNSA” in 2010., AMISOM The Foreign Policy story suggested that the American special operators might have been flying drones of some description from within the country. In addition, the elite American troops came to share Baledogle with a new Somali special operations unit called Danab , meaning “lightning.” Modeled after the U.S. Army’s Rangers, the group has reportedly received training from both the U.S. military directly and from a U.S.-based private military company, Bancroft Global Development . There was additional evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency had already been involved in the creation of a counter-terrorism rapid reaction force within Somalia’s National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA), sometimes referred to just as the Somali National Security Agency (SNSA), known as Gaashaan, or “shield.” Then, in October 2015, The Intercept published a series of pieces, dubbed the “ Drone Papers ,” based leaked of documents that in part covered JSOC activities in and around Somalia. Classified briefings from 2013 identified a unit called Task Force 48-4, which was conducting targeted strikes in both Yemen to Somalia from a host of bases in East Africa. The Somalia mission was nicknamed Operation Jupiter Garrett. Though the leaks did not show any operational sites in Somalia proper, they did present a picture of precision attacks on Al Shabaab targets based on intelligence gathered in part by both drones and manned spy planes, including contractor-operated aircraft flying from a remote base in Manda Bay Kenya. As of December 2014, Jupiter Garrett was still an active mission, per information the author separately obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Earlier in June 2017, the Defense Logistics Agency posted contracting documents online that, for the first time, seemed to officially confirm the existence of the JSOC sites, outlining the fuel requirements for unspecified “American Camps” in Baledogle and Kismayo, as well as a third location with that nomenclature at Mogadishu’s Aden Adde International Airport. So, though the Trump Administration gave the Pentagon new authorities with which to fight Al Shabaab in March 2017, it is clear that Task Force 48-4 and its partners had already been taking the fight to the group for years. In addition to airstrikes, there were a number of special operations raids, including notable successes and failures . Most recently, on May 4, 2017, a U.S. Navy SEAL died during an air assault with Somali forces – possibly troops from Danab or Gaashaan – into the town of Barii, approximately 40 miles west of Mogadishu. Danab troops maneuver U.S.-supplied vehicles during training with American forces in May 2017., ANG The United States and AMISOM are undoubtedly looking to step up the pressure on Al Shabaab in general with hopes of finally breaking up the group for good. In October 2018, the African Union plans to begin drawing down its commitment, with the goal of ending its peacekeeping mission entirely in 2020. At that point, African security forces from more than a half dozen nations will have spent more than a decade working to stabilize the fragile country . At the same time, Somalia’s international partners seem focused on improving the quality of its armed forces and its special operations in particular. Ostensibly to help get Somalia’s National Army ready to take over, on April 2, 2017, approximately 40 soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 101st  Airborne Division arrived in the country for what the Pentagon described as logistics training. Official pictures of the practice sessions subsequently showed troops from the 101st and American special operators teaching Danab’s support elements how to conduct long-range ground convoy operations, which could improve the unit’s mobility in the absence of foreign helicopter support. So, regardless of how the June 2017 strike and the Trump Administrations new authorities actually fit in with the larger operational plan, all the evidence indicates the U.S. military will only continue expanding targeted strikes against Al Shabaab’s leadership and its remaining strongholds throughout southwestern Somalia in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2020",This Russian Su-27 Pulled Off The Ultimate Photo Bomb On U.S. Bombers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Examples of all three of the U.S. Air Force’s heavy bombers are in Europe for the first time since at least 2009. Whether the United States intends for the unusual deployment to be a message to Russia or not, the Kremlin has already taken a keen interest in all the activity. On June 9, 2017, airmen from the active Air Force’s 509th Bomb Wing and the Missouri Air National Guard’s 131st Bomb Wing helped bring two B-2 Spirit bombers to RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom. The unique stealth bombers joined B-1 Bones and B-52 Stratofortresses already at the Royal Air Force base, bringing the trio to the same place for only the second time since the creation of Air Force Global Strike Command in 2009. In August 2016, B-2s made a similar surprise appearance at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam after B-1s and B-52s had already touched down on the island outpost. The B-1s and B-52s are in Europe mainly for the annual Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) and Saber Strike exercises. BALTOPS focuses on scenarios in and around the increasingly tense Baltic Sea, while Saber Strike is primarily a ground exercise that spans the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as having outstations in Poland and Germany. The Pentagon has not publicly tasked the B-2s with any particular mission beyond reassuring America’s NATO allies and general deterrence. The bombers make regular appearances in Europe for various training exercises, as well as for what the Air Force has referred to in the past as “global power training sorties,” which are simply opportunities for aircraft crews and other personnel to get experience with conducting and coordinating long-range deployments , which can be especially complex when they involve the large aircraft. DOD U.S. Air Force Colonel Jared Kennish said as much in official comments to the service’s reporters. “The bomber assurance and deterrence missions these three aircraft are supporting are key to reinforcing our commitment to our allies in NATO – in a very visible, very tangible way – that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them, no matter what,” the officer, who is in charge of the 322nd Air Expeditionary Group, which is coordinating the latest bomber missions in Europe. For BALTOPS and Saber Strike, a variety of other U.S. fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, and other aircraft from various allied units are taking part, as well. On June 9, 2017, a number of them had gotten together for a photo shoot for the press over the Baltic when a Russian Su-27 Flanker arrived on the scene. The jet, possibly flying from the naval air station in Chkalovsk, Kaliningrad, intercepted the aircraft as they flew in a neat formation through international air space. In addition to the Pentagon’s own photographers, journalists quickly snapped shots of the new arrival and spread them across social media. DOD Nestled in between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, Russia’s enclave of Kaliningrad is geographically separated from Russia proper. Three days earlier , another Flanker met up with a Stratofortress in the same area. It’s worth noting that none of Moscow’s aircraft came out to greet a detachment of U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighters when they visited Estonia in April 2017. DOD Thankfully, unlike previous meetings between Russian aviators over the Baltic Sea and elsewhere in recent years, there were no immediate reports of dangerous or otherwise unprofessional flying on the part of the Russian pilot. Russia’s air defense networks, including long-range radars associated with the S-400 surface-to-air missile in Kaliningrad and other systems in the country proper, are probably keeping an eye on the NATO activities. The Russians shadowing these high-profile training missions makes sense, since the unique capabilities of each of the American bombers will be on display. Though it may not make the same impact as the iconic and nuclear-capable B-52, the B-1 can actually carry a heavier conventional weapons load. Both aircraft can perform strategic attacks and interdiction type missions against target behind enemy lines or perform close air support duties with laser- and GPS-guided bombs . They can also carry various kinds of unguided ordnance and other payloads, such as non-lethal leaflet bombs. As part of BALTOPS. the B-52s have already dropped inert Quick Strike naval mines , highlighting their utility in a maritime role. The B-1s dropped BDU-50 inert dumb bombs during Saber Strike. The B-2s can do what the other bombers can’t, fly deep into hostile territory with a high-degree of immunity to enemy air defense networks and fighter jets. It seems likely that the B-2s will fly show-of-force style missions throughout the region before returning home. Above all else sending an Su-27 into a complex aerial photo exercise like this is actually a brilliant move by Moscow. It says “hey world we’re here too and there is nothing you can do about it” in just about as clear and creative way possible. It literally hijacks a big U.S. allied/NATO public relations move, and there is no recourse for such an act. American crews will probably be on the lookout for more meetings in the skies over the Baltic before BALTOPS and Saber Strike wrap up later in June 2017.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2018",Now The USAF Wants to Cut A-10 Squadrons and Stop Re-Winging The Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As more details emerge regarding the U.S. Air Force’s plans for the A-10 warthog in the 2018 fiscal year and beyond, it has become clear that the service’s apparent promise to maintain the entire remaining fleet of hardy attack aircraft was highly conditional and entirely temporary. The details come as the low- and slow flying planes continue to prove their worth in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Sadly, none of this is really surprising. On June 7, 2017, two senior Air Force officials told the House Armed Services Committee that they were only planning on keeping at least six squadrons of A-10s through 2030. This stood in stark contrast to written statements from both the service and the Pentagon when it unveiled its portion of President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget in May 2017. Overview briefings stated, without the apparently necessary caveats, that the entire fleet of more than 280 aircraft across nine combat-coded squadrons would be “fully funded” for at least the next five years. “The Air Force is committed to maintaining a minimum of six A-10 combat squadrons flying and contributing to the fight through 2030,” according to written joint testimony from Air Force Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Requirements, and Air Force Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the uniformed deputy for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. “Additional A-10 force structure is contingent on future budget levels and force structure requirements.” It wasn’t just the public that might’ve been confused by this new development. Members of the Committee – most notably Representative Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican and former Warthog pilot herself – were surprised to hear this, as well. “It’s the first time you’ve publicly said that you are going to go down to six squadrons,” McSally told Harris and Bunch. “I’d really like to know what those planning assumptions are of the six squadrons.” USAF The need to vote in the House curtailed the hearing and neither officer had a chance to answer the question. On June 8, 2017, Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, which oversees the bulk of the service’s active component combat aircraft, from fighter jets to spy planes, elaborated on the issue in an interview with Defense News . As it turns out, the Air Force only requested money to “fully fund” the operations and maintenance costs – day-to-day expenses that include things like payroll, fuel, and basic preventive maintenance – associated with flying the A-10s. The service then shunted a request for money to replace the wings on more than 100 of the jets into its so-called “Unfunded Priorities List,” a wish-list separate from the budget proposal with items it hopes Congress might consider paying for if at all possible. USAF “Their wings don’t all run out of service life at the same time, it depends on the individual airplane,” Holmes explained. “We have the money in the unfunded list to get another contract for wings and to get a batch that would help us work through a period and give us time to buy more wings for the rest of the fleet if we are unable to go forward to drop down to six squadrons.” Regardless, Holmes insisted that the plan to cut the three A-10 squadrons by 2030 was within the parameters Congress had set in its previous defense appropriations bills. Lawmakers specifically inserted language into the military spending bill for the 2017 fiscal year that would prevent the Air Force from dropping below 171 operational A-10s before the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation had reviewed the results of a planned fly-off between the Warthog and the stealth F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. “When their current wings expire, we have some flexibility in the depot, we have some old wings that can be repaired or rejuvenated to go on,” Holmes said. “We’re working on a long-term beddown plan for how we can replace older airplanes as the F-35 comes on, and we’ll work through to figure out how we’re going to address those A-10s that will run out of service life on their wings.” USAF The only problem is that this is almost the exact same sort of argument that prompted legislators to block the Air Force from making changes to the Warthog fleet in the first place. The Air Force has repeatedly argued that keeping the A-10, a plane it has long sought to retire, continues to hamper the process of getting the F-35 fully into service . The service argues that Warthogs are obsolete, that the F-35 can fulfill its functions, and that the Joint Strike Fighter is necessary above all other aircraft for it to maintain a qualitative edge against potential high-end opponents such as Russia or China. Legislators like McSally have disagreed, citing the aircraft’s extensive combat record and testimonials from the troops it supports on the ground. They’ve pushed back at repeated Air Force attempts to either ditch the venerable ground attack aircraft outright or indirectly push them into retirement by hamstringing vital upgrades, including new communications equipment and data links, the ability to carry newer targeting pods, upgraded mission software, and the aforementioned wing replacement program. The wing replacement project has been a particular sore spot on both sides for more than a decade now. With the new spans, the A-10s should be able to fly reliably until 2040 or beyond. Without them, the aircraft could quickly become dangerous to fly, making the value of their inherent capabilities a moot point. From the available evidence, it appears that Air Force deliberately delayed and slow-rolled the overhaul in an attempt to finally get rid of the aircraft entirely. I explored the debacle in detail back in 2015 for War Is Boring when this issue had already become a political firestorm: Most notably, the Air Force hired Boeing to install new wings on more than 200 of the blunt-nosed attackers in 2007. The Air Force itself declared these new, reinforced spans would keep the A-10s airworthy for at least another three decades. But having already expected to get rid of the straight-winged planes, the Air Force effectively waited until the last possible moment to approve the upgrade. “The A-10 fleet received no money for major modifications or programmed depot maintenance during the 1990s,” the Government Accountability Office reported a month before the work started. “As a result, the Air Force is now faced with a very large backlog of maintenance, structural repairs and extensive modifications.” The next year, the problems became particularly evident. Cracks in the wings from “fatigue and corrosion” sprouted up across the A-10 fleet, according to an Air Force history we received through the Freedom of Information Act. “Of 144 aircraft inspected, 138 had cracks,” Air Combat Command’s 2008 historical review explained. “A planned A-10 deployment for the spring of 2009 to Korea was shifted to other systems, ACC cancelled at least one upcoming exercise due to lack of A-10s and one training course was ‘effectively grounded.’” Even with these self-inflicted problems, the Air Force conceded that it expected to save more than a billion dollars in future maintenance costs with the improvements. It might not necessarily have been such an issue if the Warthogs hadn’t continued to fly and be such a critical component of American military operations against terrorists and insurgents in places like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Earlier in June 2017, official statistics showed that A-10s and F-15E Strike Eagles had borne the brunt of the fighting against ISIS. USAF Between Aug. 8, 2014 and May 16, 2017, Warthogs lobbed more than 13,850 bombs and missiles at terrorist targets. This was more than half of the total number of weapons the next four most active aircraft – the B-1 Bone bomber, the F/A-18C/D Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jet, and the F-16C Viper fighter jet respectively – had released in total . To be fair, not all of these aircraft had spent as much time in theater as others. Still, the same can be said of the A-10s, which first arrived on the scene after months of strikes by Hornets, Super Hornets, and Vipers. Regardless, this shows that commanders in the region have demanded the Warthogs more often and requested they spend more time in action overall against the brutal militants. Without the A-10s, and with the F-35A still having limited air-to-ground capability as it moves slowly toward a full operational capability of some description, it is unclear what other options the Air Force might have to fill the resulting close air support gap. There has been much criticized talk of passing the mission off to ground-attack focused squadrons equipped with F-16 fighters, some of which the service is actively looking to keep operational until at least 2048 . “From my view and my experience, if we need that capability until a proven, tested replacement comes along, nine squadrons is the absolute minimum,” McSally said, according to Defense News, almost assuring there will be another fight with the Air Force over the Warthog. However, the Air Force has expressed only the slightest interest in developing a dedicated ground attack aircraft to replace the A-10, commonly referred to as A-X. It does plans to begin evaluating lower-end close air support planes later in 2017 as part of an limited evaluation program known as OA-X , but there is no clear indication as to what specific goals that project will actually have in the end. In the meantime, the A-10 will have to fight on, hopefully getting badly needed improvements before their wings literally fall off.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",This Disturbing Iraqi Special Forces Demo Is Like A Cheer Tryout From Hell,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s not uncommon for military forces around the world to put both new recruits and existing troops through often strenuous and sometimes bizarre rituals to build camaraderie and esprit de corps . A recently released video of what may be a graduation ceremony for Iraqi Army trainees takes this to a whole new level with the troops following up a martial arts display by killing live animals. On June 8, 2017, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense posted an official video of the event, which involved special forces recruits and took place on the 14th of July Bridge in the country’s capital, Baghdad, according to a crude machine translation of the title. There was no additional information. The span, named in honor of the day a military coup deposed the Iraqi monarchy in 1958, crosses the Tigris river and is a major route in and out of the city. The demonstration begins innocuously enough. The soldiers march out onto the bridge in an orderly formation before performing a synchronized display of martial arts moves. Things begin to get more intense as instructors break sticks over their limbs. Eventually, select recruits break flaming tiles with their fists and foreheads. Then everyone has to literally jump through a flaming hoop. But if you fast forward to 2:00 in the video, things get decidedly more extreme. On command, teams of soldiers beginning beating white rabbits, resulting in a flurry of movement and flying fur. Some appear to bite tear the small animals with their mouths and what appear to be innards fall to the ground. Other individuals look to be doing the same to small snakes or lizards. Be warned, the full footage is disturbing to watch. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kq6b4pTN13w And then, as if nothing happened, the event moves on to the recruits shooting off Czech Vz.58 assault rifles before building a human pyramid. The individual at the top of the pile raises the Iraqi flag – and then the video ends. This is hardly the first time the Iraqi Ministry of Defense has posted official video from similar events and demonstrations that might be considered dangerous or even disturbing by Western standards. In October 2016, another clip appeared online showing recruits taking a “leap of faith” by jumping of what may also be the 14th of July Bridge. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mbncJgEK3ag To be fair, it’s also not out of the ordinary to see similarly garish displays of individual strength and grit from other military and security forces around the world, especially special operations elements . There are similar rituals within the U.S. military. Every year, during the U.S.-led multi-national Cobra Gold training exercise in Thailand, American troops drink cobra blood and eat the animal’s flesh, as well as dining on other living things, such as scorpions. The lurid display is part of a jungle survival course the Thai military runs for visiting personnel. Trainers kill the venomous snakes on the scene. Official pictures and news items routinely appear online and units proudly announce they’ve completed the training. Then there is North Korea, notorious for the crazy displays put on by its special operations soldiers that supposedly showcase their extreme toughness. https://youtube.com/watch?v=WKR_gC_yBPU All that being said, this Iraqi demonstration is still by far one of the most excessive displays we’ve ever seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2019",We Finally Know Exactly What The Saudis Are Getting In That Huge Arms Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A more detailed list of the United States’ planned $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia has emerged, though both parties may not ultimately move forward with all of the provisions. Still, the breakdown provides a good sense of the two countries priorities. On June 8, 2017, Defense News first reported the specifics, based on what it described as a “White House document … authenticated by a second source.” It’s not clear how much of the list is straight from the document versus an analysis of the information it contains. $84.4 billion of the approximately $110 billion package were included in Memorandums of Intent (MOI), which are offers the U.S. government describes as being responsive to a particular country’s desire for “potential future defense capabilities.” These are deals that the U.S. government would still need to finalize and that Congress and the State Department would still need to approve. Here is the more detailed breakdown of items from the MOIs, according to Defense News: $13.5 billion for seven THAAD batteries, with an estimated delivery time of 2023-2026. $4.46 billion for 104,000 air-to-ground munitions, divided amongst five types (GBU 31v3, GBU-10, GBU-12, GBU-31v1, GBU-38). $6.65 billion for enhancements to Saudis’ Patriot anti-missile system, with a scope of work from 2018-2027. $2 billion for “light close air support” aircraft, with the aircraft and delivery date still unknown. It is possible that the winner of this contract could be related to the U.S. Air Force’s OA-X close-air support study. $2 billion for four new aircraft, of a to-be-determined variety, for “TASS & Strategic ISC.” TASS stands for “tactical airborne surveillance system,” similar in concept to the U.S. Air Force JSTARS system. It’s possible the replacement could be the same as the JSTARS replacement currently being considered by the Pentagon. Those would be delivered in 2024. $5.8 billion for three KC-130J and 20 C-130J new aircraft, along with sustainment through 2026. Those planes would start delivery in 2022. $6.25 billion for an eight-year sustainment deal for Saudi Arabia’s fleet of F-15 fighters, with another $20 million for an F-15 C/D recapitalization program study. $2 billion for an unknown number of MK-VI Patrol Boats, with an unknown delivery date. $6 billion for four Lockheed Martin-built frigates, based on the company’s littoral combat ship design. That order falls under the Saudi Naval Expansion Program II (SNEP II) heading, with planned delivery in the 2025-2028 timeframe. $2.35 billion to modify 400 existing Bradley fighting vehicles, along with another $1.35 for 213 new vehicles. $1.5 billion for 180 Howitzers, with an estimated delivery time of 2019-2022. $18 billion for C4I System and integration, with no further details given on what that means, nor with a delivery date offered. The big ticket items are unsurprising. More than $40 billion is devoted to modernizing Saudi Arabia’s Air Force, a continual priority for the Kingdom as it tries to maintain its qualitative edge in the region, especially with regards to Iran. A Saudi F-15S., USAF In December 2016, four Boeing F-15SA multi-role fighters out of an 84 jet order touched down in Saudi Arabia. The country also ordered 70 upgrade kits, mainly for its existing fleet of F-15S models. So it’s not surprising the United States would be keen to offer a support contract for the entire fleet, in addition to studying ways to bring its older versions up to the latest standard. The F-15S and SA aircraft can carry impressive amounts of precision guided munitions , such as the laser-guided GBU-10/B and -12/B Paveway and GPS-guided GBU-31/B and -38/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). There are no additional sales of controversial cluster munitions mentioned in this list. The Kingdom has also long been interested in upgrading its existing three RE-3 Tactical Airborne Surveillance System (TASS) aircraft. One of these, the sole RE-3B Improved Tactical Airborne Surveillance System (ITASS), was actually a conversion of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) prototype. The resulting aircraft reportedly combine some of the surveillance and targeting features of the JSTARS radar aircraft with a signals intelligence suite akin to the RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, giving the aircraft more of a dual role. It is unlikely therefore that they would be willing to accept the product of the U.S. Air Force’s JSTARS recapitalization program without significant modifications. There is also an order for 30 MH-60 rescue helicopters as part of the deal. This could end up being the same HH-60W configuration that is set to replace the HH-60G Pave Hawk. The desire for a light close air support aircraft is not surprising either, given the Kingdom’s protracted and grueling intervention in Yemen, as well as is expansive and sparely populated borders. Whether they will actually decide to wait for the results of the OA-X program , which remains nebulous as to its own actual goals, is uncertain. The Saudis had been helping fund the modernization of Lebanon’s military , which now includes the purchase of Embraer’s popular A-29 light attack aircraft and the government in Riyadh has strong ties to Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, both of whom operate armed derivatives of agricultural aircraft . Officials in Riyadh are well aware of their options. The C-130J cargo aircraft and KC-130J tankers would replace about half of Saudi Arabia’s existing fleet of C-130H and KC-130H models. The U.S. Army tests a modified Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile in 2013. , US Army Air and missile defense are the next big winners, with $13.5 billion for seven full batteries of Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) systems and more than $6.5 billion more for improvements to the Kingdom’s existing Patriot units. Neither of these purchases would be surprising, as Saudi Arabia has seen an increasingly real threat of ballistic missile attacks not just from traditional opponent Iran, but also Yemen, where rebels have taken control of that small country’s stockpile of Scud missiles and claim to be building their own derivatives. The THAAD package would likely include the mobile AN/TPY-2 radar . Though neither Raytheon nor the Pentagon have made the exact range of the system public, it may be able to track targets more than 1,800 miles away. If true, these units would be able to see deep inside Iran or Yemen from well within Saudi Arabia.  There’s also more than $4 billion set aside for space-based capabilities, including remote-sensing and early warning satellites, as well as expanding the Saudi military’s satellite communication coverage. Could the Saudis be purchasing their own Space-Bases Infrared System (SBIRS) like satellite to augment their anti-ballistic missile capabilities? Doing so would give The Kingdom earlier warning of ballistic missile launches that the AN/TPY-2 radar cannot provide. It could even possibly detect other events, like artillery fire. Then again, this investment could give access to data from U.S. early warning satellites that are already constantly scanning the region. A model of a the Freedom-variant frigate Lockheed Martin has offered to the U.S. Navy, similar to the proposed MMSC., Joseph Trevithick More notably, the Saudi Navy, traditionally the country’s “fourth service” behind the Air Force, Army, and the independent Saudi Arabian National Guard, has beaten out the country’s land forces. There is $6 billion for a more capable derivative of Lockheed Martin’s Freedom -class Litorral Combat Ship (LCS) know as the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), another $2 billion for a previously approved deal for much smaller Mk IV patrol boats. 14 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters are also on order. Most importantly, there is $18 billion for the Royal Saudi Navy’s extensive planned C4I command and control and intelligence sharing network. This project includes a host of upgrades to facilities, hardware, and software that support naval forces afloat and ashore, including the country’s small marine and naval special warfare contingents. The War Zone has already extensively reported on the Kingdom’s desperate need to update its relatively small and outdated naval arm. A breakdown of the FMS case for the Royal Saudi Navy’s C4I program, as of 2014., USN The Army comes in last with less than $10 billion for upgrades to its fleet of 400 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 180 howitzers of unspecified type or caliber. 26 AN/TPQ-53(V) Radar Systems, along with training and support is also included . The mobile system built around a large AESA radar system provides directional or 360 degree surveillance for rockets, artillery and mortars. Aircraft and drones can also be detected and tracked. The system can cue counter-battery fire and short-range air defense systems. Some additional items, including hundreds of Black Hawk helicopters , were reportedly included in separate “LOAs,” or Letters of Offer and Acceptance, a part of the U.S. government’s formal Foreign Military Sales process. Both LOAs and MOIs sometimes only specify a generic category of equipment rather than a particular system. This helps explain why some entries are specific, while others are just generic weapons such as “howitzers.” Foreign parties can reject these offers even if they meet the basic requirements outlined in the initial request. After agreeing to the LOA, the Pentagon runs the contracting process, which could include the items as part of a larger purchase for multiple parties, though the country in question ultimately pays for their agreed upon portion of the deal. How much of this entire package U.S. and Saudi officials eventually agree on will probably be based on how both sides determine the country’s “future defense” needs. Given the state of the Middle East at present, it’s safe to say that may subject to change . Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces Royal Saudi Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2018",F-15E Shot Down “Predator-Sized” Drone That Attacked Coalition Forces In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in more than four decades, American forces have come under aerial attack after a drone released an unspecified weapon near U.S. special operators and their Syrian partners at a garrison in the town of At Tanf . The strike has huge implications for the conflict in the country, as well as the future of warfare as a whole. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the top American task force leading the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, announced the incident in talking to the press on June 8, 2017. The apparent attack had occurred earlier the same day and U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle fighters had responded by shooting down the pilotless plane. “The pro-regime [unmanned aerial vehicle], similar in size to the U.S. MQ-1 predator, was shot down by U.S. aircraft after it dropped one of several weapons it was carrying near a position occupied by coalition personnel who are training and advising partner ground forces in the fight against ISIS,” CJTF-OIR’s public affairs office later said in a statement. “The shoot down follows an earlier engagement in the day in which Coalition forces destroyed two pro-regime armed technical vehicles that advanced inside the well established de-confliction zone threatening Coalition and partner forces.” The attack did not result in any casualties. When asked by reporters what the drone’s bomb actually hit, Dillon said “it hit dirt.” But it is a major turn of events. No foreign military or insurgent group has subjected American troops to a traditional airstrike since a bizarre incident in 1968 in which two North Vietnamese An-2 biplanes attacked a covert U.S. radar site in Laos. The planes did not cause any casualties on the ground in that case, either. The last time Americans actually died from an aerial attack was in 1953 near the end of the Korean War. One of Iran’s many purported armed drones, the Hamaseh, seen in 2013., AP The Pentagon did not offer any additional information about the drone involved in the Syria attack, so it is impossible to speak to the appropriateness of their size comparison. However, from the basic description it seems almost certain this was Iranian type. Iran has proudly displayed an increasing arsenal of unmanned aircraft over the past few years, including designs at least visually reminiscent of an American RQ-170 stealth drone that crashed in the country in 2011. Though it’s unclear how many of these different types are actually capable of operations, Iranian officials had showed very functional looking aircraft. In 2010, the country unveiled the Karrar, a modified target drone it claimed was capable carrying unguided bombs. Two years later, the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps unveiled the Shahed 129, which was similar in shape and configuration to the Israeli Hermes drone. In 2013, the Iranian Armed Forces Aviation Industries Organization revealed Fotros, which looks very similar to Israel’s Heron TP. And the list goes on and on . Iran hasn’t been shy about selling or otherwise exporting these unmanned planes abroad, either. In 2012, the Lebanese-Palestinian militant group Hezbollah reportedly flew a Shahed 129 over Israel. Israeli forces also shot that unmanned aircraft down and have knocked out a number of other unmanned aircraft since then. This type, which is similar in size to the Predator and often seen in static displays carrying what look like either missiles or glide bombs, could easily have been involved in the strike at At Tanf. One was spotted flying over Damascus in 2014 and there is evidence armed versions have been zipping around the country, too. Unless the drone involved had a satellite data link, which is highly unlikely, the pilot would have needed a line-of-site connection to the aircraft, reducing the maximum range it could operate from its ground control station at the time of the incident. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MLnRt9CZz58 The incident at At Tanf comes just a day after Hezbollah-aligned television station Al Manar broadcast footage of what it claimed was one of the group’s drones shadowing an American pilotless aircraft over Syria. The organization said it was prepared to attack American forces or their partners if they crossed unspecified “red lines,” an apparent repackaging of previous U.S. threats against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Al Assad. The terrorist group has already been actively using smaller, hobbyist-type drones in Syria since at least 2014 . The garrison at At Tanf has already been under increasing pressure from this militia, that international news outlets have referred to as Iranian-backed. This could mean Hezbollah or one of the local militias it is working with inside Syria. The Pentagon has only described them as “pro-regime” and did not mention Iran in its official statement on the drone strike. However, Iranian authorities and their proxies clearly see the American-supported garrison, situated along the country’s strategic Highway 2, as sitting in the way of their own objectives, which could include a land route from Damascus to Tehran via Iraq. “The Coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces partnered with them,” the CJTF-OIR public affairs office stated. “The demonstrated hostile intent and actions of pro-regime forces near Coalition and partner forces in southern Syria, however, continue to concern us and the Coalition will take appropriate measures to protect our forces.” The American airstrike that preceded the incident was the second in three days against this unnamed group’s fighters and the third in two months in the vicinity of At Tanf. Earlier in June 2017, U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets in Arabic showing the aforementioned “de-confliction zone” and warning the militants to stay away or risk attack. The militiamen were undeterred and moved armor and heavy weapons inside the designated safe area. Based on images that appeared on social media afterwards, the strike on June 6, 2017 destroyed at least one 2S1 Gvozdika 122mm self-propelled howitzer and a ZSU-23-4 Shilka self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. There was no indication that the fighters had attempted to turn the Shilka on the attacking planes. The Pentagon has already acknowledged that its monopoly on drone warfare has ended, stepping up research and development of weapons and other equipment to destroy and defeat hostile unmanned aircraft. However, it has focused most of its efforts on the threat of small, commercially available types that insurgents and terrorists have turned into improvised weapons. The idea of a state military or large insurgent group employing an advanced, production unmanned aerial combat vehicle hasn’t been an immediate concern. This could have implications far beyond Syria, since the U.S. military has only begun realizing how much of a gap it has when it comes to anti-aircraft weapons. With air attacks a virtual non-issue for decades, any funding that might have gone into new short-range air defense systems was diverted into more pressing projects. In 2011, Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization began holding an annual exercise, Black Dart , to explore ways to counter the growing threat of unmanned aircraft systems. There has been work on everything from shotgun shells loaded with nets to mobile lasers . Earlier in June 2017, the U.S. Army announced it had tested one of the first major upgrades to the Stinger man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) in years. The upgrade involves adding a proximity fuze to the shoulder-launched missile, allowing it to be more effective against small drones. First fielded in 1981, man-portable and vehicle-mounted versions of the missile are the only short-range anti-aircraft weapon still in widespread U.S. military service. The Army is in the process of developing a new launch system capable of firing a variety of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles called the Multi-Mission Launcher . The fact that U.S. aircraft had to shoot down the intruder may highlight this lack of anti-aircraft capability on the ground. There is no information one way or another yet about any potential difficulties the American F-15Es experienced during the intercept. Top air-to-air warfare experts in the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps will undoubtedly be eager to pick apart the rare engagement for any valuable lessons. Regardless, as this attack proves, drones of all shapes and sizes are only going to become an increasing threat to American forces in conflicts big and small.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Ukrainian Spetnaz’s Weapons and Gear May Show an American Touch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New photos of Ukrainian special operations forces show a steady increase in Western influence. With elite forces already a critical part of the fight against Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern Donbass region, officials in Kiev have no doubt been keen to take any lessons, even indirectly, from their counterparts in the United States and Europe. One June 8, 2017, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense posted a number of undated images of special operators or candidates during training. The pictures showed troops maneuvering through temperate, snowy, urban, and nighttime environments, as well as conducting apparent team-building type exercises. More importantly, their weapons and gear are very similar to the kit that American and Western European special operations forces commonly employ. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Ukraine inherited a significant number of existing military units, along with associated military infrastructure, weapons, and other equipment. These included both military spetnaz – a contraction of the Russian words spetsialnogo naznacheniya , meaning “special purpose,” which has become a catch-all term in Russia and many post-Soviet states for elite formations – and other specialized personnel within the Ministry of the Interior. Ukraine MoD So it’s perhaps not surprising that the bulk of the weapons on display were derivatives of Soviet-era designs, including members of the legendary Kalashnikov rifle family and the ubiquitous PKM light machine gun. At least one of the operators has a much more uncommon Stechkin APS pistol with a sound suppressor. This handgun fires the same 9x18mm cartridge as the Makarov pistol, but has the ability to fire fully automatic at a rate of 750 rounds per minute. In this mode, a shooter could burn through a full 20-round magazine in a matter of a couple seconds. The 9x18mm round is notably less powerful than NATO-standard 9x19mm ammunition. A member of Ukraine’s special operations forces with a suppressed Stechkin APS pistol., Ukraine MoD Ukrainian companies, such as RPC Fort, still produce many of these weapons, as well as updated versions, as well as the ammunition to go along with them. However, the Ukrainian special operators have versions of these old standbys covered in accessory rails and fitted with various red dot optical sights. One spetnaz troop has a combination of an EOTech Holosight and a magnifier. This allows the operator to switch rapidly between sights better suited for close-in and longer range engagements. A Ukrainian spetnaz operator with a rifle featuring both an EOTech Holosight and a magnifier., Ukraine MoD In May 2017, Military Times spotted a fighter with an elite element of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units rebel group, better known as the YPG, carrying a similar configuration in Syria, which it said was indicative of American support for the unit. A separate video showed Ukrainian elite troops have been using the configuration for more than a year. https://youtube.com/watch?v=JhjhD_jIH5s Fort has also begun license producing a number of Israeli-designed weapons, including a number of versions of the Israeli Weapons Industries Tavor TAR-21 bullpup rifle. Ukrainian special operators appear in one of the pictures carrying a short-barrel version of this 5.56mm weapon, which would be ideal for urban operations or when rapidly moving in and out of a vehicle or helicopter. A blurry shot of one of Ukraine’s spetnaz troops with a Fort-built clone of the IWI Tavor., Ukraine MoD In addition, snipers are seen with sniper rifles featuring rail accessory hand guards and lightweight, modular stocks similar to the U.S. Army’s M2010 or U.S. Special Operations Command’s Mk 21 Mod 0 Precision Sniper Rifle. As early as 2013, Ukraine’s PJSC Mayak Plant, under direction from the state-run arms enterprise Ukroboronprom, had already begun designing precision weapons in the NATO-standard 7.62x51mm cartridge, as well as .338 Lapua Magnum, a round popular among Western military forces. Ukraine MoD On top of that, most of the elite forces in the pictures are dressed in the uniforms with a camouflage scheme similar to the U.S. military’s Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) or the commercial Multicam design, both of which have long been popular among American special operators. Some wear lightweight Ops-Core helmets, which were also cited in Military Times’ May 2017 report from Syria. One image shows two spetnaz, including one with a PKM machine gun, driving a small all-terrain buggy similar in size and shape to the Polaris MRZR that U.S. special operations forces and other specialized units have in service.  In May 2016, these vehicles appeared with elite American troops in Iraq, too. Ukraine MoD To be fair, Russia’s own spetnaz have been adopting a lot of similar kit since the end of the Cold War. However, the exact types of gear Ukrainian special operations forces are using, and even the brands in question, highlight increased interactions with their American counterparts and possible active shared training sessions. It’s worth noting that in April 2016 Ukrainian Major General Ihor Lunyov, head of the country’s Special Operations Forces Command (SOFCOM), and his staff traveled to Stuttgart, Germany to meet with U.S. Air Force Major General Gregory Lengyel, then in charge of Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR). Two months later, Lengyel left to take up the post of Deputy Commanding General of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command. U.S. Air Force Major General Gregory Lengyel, then SOCEUR Commander, talks to Ukrainian Major General Ihor Lunyov in April 2016., SOCEUR “The visit consisted of briefings and discussions at the SOCEUR Headquarters on the current state of Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SOF), the U.S. and partner nation SOF contributions to the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine mission, along with a conversation on the future structure and the development of the Ukrainian SOCOM’s institutional capacities,” according to an official press release . “The visit concluded with a joint demonstration by [U.S.] Army and Navy SOF at a local training area.” Ukrainian officials have been eager to expand the ranks of their elite units since Russia seized control of the Crimea region in March 2014 and then began actively supporting separatist factions elsewhere in the country. The spetnaz community, both in the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, had already been deeply entangled in the country’s many crises. Ukraine MoD The Ministry of Interior’s Berkut special purpose force was heavily implicated in the violent crackdown that led to Ukraine’s 2014 revolution, which in turn unseated pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and touched off a series of events lead to the country’s civil war. In the aftermath, the new Ukrainian government disbanded Berkut. Other spetnaz units, which were among the best trained and equipped, were also entangled in the country’s political upheaval, with some members reportedly defecting to Russia or joining Russian-backed militia in the Crimea and Donbass regions. Those that remained loyal to officials in Kiev were quickly deployed to combat separatists who had established de facto statelets in the country’s Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Ukraine MoD During the fighting in and around Donetsk Airport in 2015, Kremlin-supported forces dubbed the Ukrainian defenders, which included members of the 3rd Spetnaz Regiment, as inhuman “ cyborgs ” for their tenacity. They only abandoned their positions after repeated artillery bombardments and assaults with tanks and other armored vehicles. Unfortunately, though supportive of the government in Kiev and its claims to territorial integrity, the United States has gone back and forth on just how active its support should be and whether military assistance should include the sale of offensive weapons like artillery pieces and anti-tank missiles. So far, the only publicly announced SOCEUR engagement in Ukraine involved medical training. Given that they remain at the forefront of the country’s internal security campaign, Ukraine’s spetnaz contingents would want to seek out top of the line weapons and gear in general. But the new images suggest ties with Western elite units may be expanding, either directly or indirectly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 18, 2018",How The Terror Attacks in Tehran Fuel an Already Perilous Middle East Crisis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ISIS has claimed responsibility for a pair of rare terrorist attacks in Iran’s capital Tehran, which some of the country’s most hard-line officials in turn blamed on the United States and Saudi Arabia. The dramatic incidents have added another layer of complexity on top of an already rapidly growing political crisis, centered on an attempt by the Saudis and their allies to isolate Qatar , which now involves the Russians and threatens to engulf the entire Middle East. On June 7, 2017, at least seven terrorists conducted two simultaneous attacks on the seat of Iran’s parliament, known as the Majlis, and the tomb of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of the country’s Islamic Revolution. The complex operation involved small arms, suicide bombs, and possibly hostage taking. The nature of the attacks and their targets were highly symbolic. At the country’s parliament, four ISIS fighters, reportedly dressed as women, burst into an administrative building and began shooting, killing seven or eight individuals outright. Iranian state television said the Majlis was in session and another terrorist with a suicide vest made an attempt to get into the main hall before blowing themselves up, according to The Associated Press . In total, the terrorists murdered 13 people. At the same time, additional fighters assault Khomeini’s mausoleum, with one setting off their suicide bomb in the process. Government security forces shot and killed six of the attackers and arrested a seventh, who was actually a woman. They claimed to have thwarted a third attack entirely. Reactions from Iranian government officials were swift, focusing mainly on applauding the indomitable spirit of the country, its people, and the Islamic Revolution. “These fireworks that happened today will have no impact on the people’s resolve,” the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei , said afterwards “They are too weak to affect the will of the Iranian nation and that of the officials.” “The Iranian nation…will prove once again that it will crush any plot or scheme by ill-wishers through unity and solidarity and its powerful security structure,” recently re-elected President Hassan Rouhani , seen as a moderate reformist in the context of Iranian politics, assured the nation. Iranian security forces take cover during the June 2017 terrorist attacks in Tehran., AP The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had a very different take . In a statement, the powerful paramilitary entity, which is nominally part of the country’s armed forces and acts as the defender of the country’s unique political system, drew a direct line between the ISIS attack and U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. Rather than refer to it by name, the IRGC only noted collusion between Trump and “the rulers of a regional reactionary regime.” Iran’s hardliners often do not name countries they see as hostile, preferring to use epithets, such as “ Great Satan ” for the United States and “ Little Satan ” for Israel. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, attends an IRGC graduation ceremony in 2014., AP It’s worth noting that the idea of U.S.-Saudi-ISIS cabal is already a well established conspiracy theory . However, ISIS, a Sunni Islamic terrorist group, has a perfectly understandable grievance with predominantly Shia Iran over the country’s support for the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad, which includes funding and providing various equipment for Syria’s own forces and various Shia militias, as well as Iraq’s majority Shia government. Since at least March 2017, ISIS has stepped up propaganda calling for attacks on Shi’ite Iranians and the state itself. But this response is hardly surprising, given that Trump and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud both pointedly criticized Iran during the state visit, slamming the country as a destabilizing force in the region and sponsoring terrorism – and there is significant evidence to support both claims. However, officials in Tehran see their counterparts in Riyadh as the true bad actors in the greater Middle East, funding extremists themselves – accusations that are also not easy to deny. دول عربية تقرر #قطع_العلاقات_مع_قطر بزعم دعمها ""للإرهاب"" كاريكاتير: كارلوس لاتوف pic.twitter.com/sExwxlpVg0 — شبكة رصد (@RassdNewsN) June 6, 2017 There is a long history of competition between the two countries and it has been increasingly, if not necessarily accurately, become framed in the context of a divide within the global Muslim community. Saudi Arabia is home to Islam’s two holiest sites and its monarchy effectively claims to be guardian of the faith worldwide, despite belonging to a relatively small branch of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism . As such, Riyadh is actively opposed to other brands of political Islam, even among fellow Sunnis, with particular anger reserved for the Egypt-centered Muslim Brotherhood. On the other hand, Iran’s Islamic authorities see themselves as the center of a so-called “Shia Crescent,” despite again not necessarily speaking for all of Shi’ism and its own many sects and offshoots. Iranian state media routinely brands Sunni militant groups with the term takfiri . Though this formally refers to a Muslim who has accused another Muslim of apostasy – the act of renouncing one’s religion – it has taken on a derogatory definition as someone who wrongly claims to practice the only legitimate interpretation of the faith. Then-Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani meets with Ayatollah Khamenei in 2010., AP As such, this latest rhetoric might not have even merited a mention had it not been for its place alongside an increasingly serious situation sweeping across the Middle East as a whole. Saudi Arabia touched off this political crisis when it decided to sever relations with Qatar. Despite being another Sunni Arab monarchy, the House of Saud has long seen the House of Thani as potentially dangerous outlier. Most galling to the Saudis, Qatar maintains relatively warm relations with Iran and offers neutral ground to operate in for even the most extreme Sunni political groups, such as Hamas and the Taliban . Perhaps even worse for Saudi royals, the country has a vibrant and relatively free press, centered on the Al Jazeera television network, which routinely takes Arab rulers to task over poor human rights records and other abuses. The outlet has been particularly critical of the Saudi-led intervention into Yemen’s already brutal civil war , which was prompted by the rise of Houthi rebels with links to Iran. Saudi air strikes in particular have resulted in significant numbers of civilian deaths and there is evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity on all sides. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in May 2017., AP The matter came to a head in May 2017, after reports that Qatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani had criticized Trump and Salman’s attacks on Iran and called for increased Arab cooperation with the government in Tehran. This came straight from Qatari state media , which later claimed hackers had broken into its website and Twitter account and planted the fake news to stir up trouble. The plan apparently worked . On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, with what appeared to be tacit approval from the Trump Administration, cut off both diplomatic and physical links with the peninsular country. Officials in Riyadh accused the government in Doha of supporting terrorism and undermining regional governments, including its own. Trump subsequently Tweeted out what seemed to be an agreement with the Saudi position. Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates quickly followed the Saudi lead. Jordan, the Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, and Senegal all ultimately cut ties, downgraded relations, or put new economic restrictions in place. During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 …extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 As we already reported at The War Zone, this had the potential to throw Qatar, as well as its neighbors and allies into chaos. Tyler Rogoway wrote : Saudi Arabia closed its common land border with Qatar—which is Qatar’s only land border—as well as shuttering its sea and air borders with the country. The UAE and Bahrain have closed their air and sea borders with neighboring Qatar as well, and far away, Egypt closed its airspace to aircraft belonging to the peninsular nation. As a result, Qatar has lost a whopping 82% of its gulf imports as a result of the punishing measures, and the country relies heavily on these imports to survive, especially those that come through Saudi Arabia. The various players involved have also recalled their citizens from Qatar, some on very tight timelines, and have kicked Qatari nationals out of their own territories. And the situation has only become more complex and convoluted since then. While there was no claim or responsibility or other confirmation of the cyber attack on Qatar’s state broadcaster, on June 7, 2017, CNN reported that United States law enforcement officials had come to believe not only that the hack was realm but that the intruders were Russian . As it has done after other similar accusations , the Kremlin staunchly denied any involvement. Still, Russia has been looking to gain new influence in the Middle East and North Africa , beyond long-standing partner Syria. It has made inroads with Egypt and is cultivating ties with Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar. At the same time, in spite of early attempts at a diplomatic resolution, with Kuwait trying to intervene and calm the situation, Saudi Arabia has only escalated their rhetoric with a set of 10 demands to be met within 24 hours. These included cutting all relations with Iran, expelling Hamas – a Palestinian offshoot of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood – from the country and seizing its assets , as well as deporting other Muslim Brotherhood representatives and other unspecified elements hostile to the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council political and economic bloc. The Hamas-specific requirements may also be linked in part to warming relations between the Saudis and Israel , who both see a common enemy in Iran. Riyadh wants Doha to stop supporting terrorists groups and “interfering” in Egypt, too. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi took power in a coup during which the military overthrew an elected Muslim Brotherhood government. Oh, and the Saudis need a state-level apology for Al Jazeera’s “abuses” and a promise to shut down the network for good. Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, left, with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman during talks in June 2017., AP All of this could only be humiliating for the Qatari regime and it is unlikely to comply. What happens if it doesn’t, though, is unclear. As these new developments were appearing, Turkey announced it had authorized the deployment of troops to a new overseas base in Qatar . Though the risk of an outright conflict is low and the two countries had reportedly first started discussing this plan in January 2017, the rush to complete the deal can only be seen as a product of the existing political crisis. Turkey’s ruling J ustice and Development Party , an Islamist political party better known by its Turkish acronym AKP, is widely seen as the country’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. It has spoken out in support of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood in the past . The United States, which might otherwise be a key peacemaker, is in a complicated situation. President Trump himself has already publicly sided with Saudi outrage over what may have been false statements. At home, Trump is facing a steady barrage of criticism over his handling of investigations into Russia’s attempts to undermine the American electoral process, which he insists is “ fake news .” But the vast majority of the parties directly or tangentially involved in the crisis – with the obvious exceptions of Russia, Iran and Hamas – are traditional U.S. allies. Qatar happens to host the largest American military base in the region, which has been essential in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS. U.S. President Donald Trump at center, along with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, second from the left, in May 2017., AP On the other hand, no one in the U.S. government would want to be perceived as being soft on Iran or terrorism, especially as American officials look to enact new sanctions on Tehran over its ballistic missile programs. The Pentagon has become increasingly in danger of getting into a more significant fight with Iranian-backed militia in southern Syria as it attempts to focus on battling ISIS, too. All this in turn could push Iran’s more moderate elected authorities to side with hardliners to more actively support Qatar, potentially driving a wedge deep between it and its historic American benefactors. In spite of these political realities, the U.S. State Department did take a smart, apolitical line in response to the Tehran terrorist attacks. “We express our condolences to the victims and their families, and send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Iran,” Heather Nauert, the Department’s top spokesperson, said in a statement . “The depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world.” Unfortunately, if it becomes any more difficult for the parties to reign in their rhetoric and defuse the situation, platitudes like this may not be enough to prevent the crisis from boiling over into something far worse.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Humanitarian Cargo Contractor Secretly Supported U.S. Spec Ops in Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report has shed light on the shadowy world of contractors supporting some of the United States most secretive counter terrorism operations. As The War Zone has also reported before, the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community often take great care to obfuscate or outright conceal their activities abroad, but in doing so, often create a potentially dangerous nexus between security forces and spies, humanitarian organizations, and private companies. On March 27, 2015, Houthi rebels detained an American contractor in Yemen’s capital Sana’a. After nearly six months in captivity, the militants let Scott Darden go, following an apparent intervention by the Sultan of Oman on his behalf, but there was no indication that his work in the country was anything particularly out of the ordinary. Now it seems this was not so according to a story, citing a number of anonymous sources, from The New York Times published on May 6, 2017. In Yemen, Darden was the head of operations in the small Arabian country for New Orleans-headquartered Transoceanic Development, which coordinated and warehoused humanitarian aid shipments for organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Children’s Fund, better known by its acronym UNICEF. At the same time, he was managing deliveries for American special operators, as well. The revelation is not particularly surprising. It is at best an open secret that the U.S. military has increasingly come to rely on contractors for a wide variety of functions, even when it comes to the most secret missions. Combined with specialized military and paramilitary units , these individuals and companies are vital for providing support functions and simply getting supplies into remote and often dangerous regions where the United States may not be waging a visible conflict. Using civilians can help keep the effort – and more often than not, local government involvement – discreet. A Red Cross employee oversees the unloading of humanitarian aid at Sana’a International Airport in Yemen in 2015., AP Yemen is a particularly good example of this trend. By the time the time the Houthis seized control of Sana’a in September 2014, which set the country on course for what became a brutal civil war, the Pentagon had been running a multi-faceted counter-terrorism campaign against Al Qaeda’s franchise in the country for at least five years. On one side there was a publicly acknowledged mission to train and equip Yemen’s military to fight Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). On the other hand, the Pentagon and the intelligence community used drone strikes and commando raids, often with the assistance of American-trained Yemeni special operators , to attack specific individuals. Officials in Washington were tight-lipped about the military assistance operation. They almost categorically refused to comment on the more focused counter-terrorism operations, with nicknames such as Copper Dune and Yukon Viking . The exact relationship between the two efforts remains unclear and Darden could have been arranging support for one or both of these missions. There was already significant evidence that contractors were heavily involved in both the public and covert operations. Sometime before 2007, Yemeni officials hired Panalpina, a freight forwarding company, to move American-supplied gear from warehouses in the United States into Yemen proper. However, according to the Government Accountability Office , the country’s government fell behind on its payments to Panalpina and in 2008 contracted DHL Global Forwarding to continue this work. Neither company specifically focuses on military contracts. Cash flow continued to be a problem and GAO found significant amounts of equipment and supplies still languishing in private storage months after Yemen’s government completely collapsed in 2015. GAO The U.S. government did hire private military and security contractors to more actively assist in training and equipping Yemeni security forces. But this work may have required the Pentagon or other American officials to use private logistics or charter travel companies to move personnel or equipment in and out of the country, too. In March 2017, The War Zone revealed the existence of shadowy and possibly stillborn joint program between the U.S. Army and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the same region, known as the Yemen Somalia Agent Information Conference (YSAIC), as part of a larger analysis of the situation across the Gulf of Aden in Somalia. At least one YSAIC project would have involved bringing members of the Yemeni Ministry of Interior to the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia to learn about collecting “post-blast” evidence and intelligence after bombings. Records we obtained through the Freedom of Information Act say this particular plan ended up canceled due to a lack of funds. However, it seems more likely from The New York Times ’ description and U.S. government responses to its reporters’ questions that Transoceanic Development’s operation in Yemen had ended up shuttling equipment and supplies for a shadowy U.S. military unit known as Task Force 48-4.2. This group was one portion of a larger element led by the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) that hunted down terrorists across the Arabian Peninsula and throughout East Africa. DOD via The Intercept In October 2015, The Intercept published a number of leaked documents that provided some of the most granular details about these missions to date as part of a series of stories known collectively as “ The Drone Papers .” Despite this moniker, the documents showed that contractor-flown “manned fixed wing” spy planes were involved in the intelligence-driven targeted strikes. However, these forces would have needed more mundane goods and services, from food and water to fuel for vehicles and portable power generators. Already helping move similar items to Red Cross and UNICEF facilities in the country, Transoceanic Development would have been in a prime position to store and otherwise help deliver this type of material to forward operating sites. And it’s not just Yemen. The U.S. government and its partners have and continue to apply similar models in other hotspots, such as Afghanistan , Iraq, Syria , and Somalia. On May 30, 2017, a Fairchild-Dornier Do-328JET cargo aircraft belonging to an obscure company called Heidi Aviation crashed at Aden Adde International Airport in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu while flying a mission for Bancroft Global Development. Bancroft is the contractor supporting the African Union’s American-backed peacekeeping mission in the country. On top of that, JSOC’s Task Force 48-4 is understood to be active in Somalia, likely being behind a raid on Al Qaeda-linked terrorist organization Al Shabaab in May 2017 in which a U.S. Navy SEAL died . In the future it may turn out that, as in Yemen, contractor logistics firms have been supporting a number of different international activities at the same time. Without private workers, the Pentagon would probably have difficulty maintaining a constellation of sites across Africa . “The bottom line is there aren’t a lot of companies willing and able to provide those kind of necessary services in a place like Yemen,” Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen, told The New York Times . “It’s not like you have people pounding down the doors for those contracts.” A charter flight sits at Mogadishu International Airport in Somalia in 2006., AP Unfortunately, these arrangements aren’t without certain risks for humanitarian groups. This overlap between civilian and military organizations can put aid workers and humanitarians in danger if terrorists and militants no longer feel they can discern between the two or simply decide that there isn’t any meaningful distinction anymore. Famously, the Central Intelligence Agency ran a polio vaccination scheme in Pakistan that ultimately helped confirmed Osama Bin Laden was hiding in a compound near the city of Abbotabad. Afterwards, the militants such as the Pakistani Taliban began a vicious campaign against unrelated medical workers, in turn causing a spike in polio cases in the country. As recently as April 2016, armed groups were still targeting humanitarians and medical personnel. If Darden’s case is any indication, that experience and others like it clearly haven’t dissuaded the U.S. government or its partners from employing contractors in such ways that might entangle counter-terrorism missions with unrelated civilian activities. As Feierstein noted, there simply aren’t a huge number of contractors to choose from when it comes to these efforts. You can be sure that The War Zone will continue to be among those keeping an eye out for these shadowy operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 14, 2019",Russia Says It’s Going To Build This New Amphibious Assault Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though Russian officials have delayed plans to move forward with two of its major surface ship programs indefinitely, including a new aircraft carrier, the Kremlin insists it will move ahead with work on a modern amphibious assault ship. Despite assurances to the contrary, there is little evidence that the country’s shipbuilding infrastructure is anymore ready for this task, and the project could easily end up deferred in the face of other priorities. On June 4, 2017, Russia’s state-owned news outlet Sputnik reported that the Ministry of Defense had included the proposed Lavina -class amphibious assault ship in its up-coming modernization plan, which will run through 2025. In 2015, the Krylov State Research Center in St. Petersburg unveiled the design along with that of the highly ambitious Project 23000E Shtorm aircraft carrier. Krylov “has conducted extensive studies on the creation of a next-generation universal amphibious assault ship design,” Valery Polovinkin, an advisor to the firm’s general director, told Zveda television, which the Russian ministry of defense operates. The ship would be more capable than the French Mistral -class, which Russia had previously attempted to buy, he added. On paper, the 24,000 ton Lavina – which means “avalanche” in Russian – displaces 2,500 tons more than the Mistral class. Though it’s not clear whether it will be conventionally or nuclear-powered, Krylov claims its ship will be able to make 22 knots, three knots faster than its French counterpart. Given Russia’s capacity to produce large conventional marine engines, or lack thereof, the proposed ship would most likely need a nuclear powerplant for this to be true. The model of the proposed Lavina -class amphibious assault ship., Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia Krylov designed the amphibious ship to carry up to 50 main battle tanks and other armored vehicles, depending on their size, along with 500 troops. Between four and six Project 11770 or Project 02510 landing craft would ferry these forces ashore during an assault. A model the company showed off in 2015 featured a turret with a 100mm gun, two Pantsir-M surface-to-air missile launchers, and three Palash close-in weapon systems for self defense. But by far, the Lavina ’s most powerful weapon would be its compliment of up to 16 helicopters, including some number of the advanced Ka-52K Katran, a navalized version of the Ka-52 Alligator gunship. In addition to folding rotor blades and other features for shipboard operations, the new version can carry the Kh-31 and Kh-35 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles. “This is the first helicopter in the world capable of using the Kh-31 and Kh-35 anti-ship cruise missiles,” Zveda reported, according to Sputnik. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oAWS7ndPazE On top of that, the attack helicopters have a 30mm cannon and can carry laser-guided Vikhr anti-tank missiles, R-73 short-range air-to-air missiles, unguided rockets, and other weapons. There are somewhat questionable reports that Kamov is looking to integrate the long-range R-77 air-to-air missile, an analogue to the American AIM-120, onto the choppers. The Katran’s does have a nose-mounted radar, along with the option for a mast-mounted type, for air- and surface search functions, along with infrared video cameras. Russian officials have already been buying the Ka-52K, initially expecting to deploy them on its now canceled Mistrals . This deal, which U.S. officials had already criticized and pressured their counterparts in Paris to reconsider, finally broke down completely after the Kremlin invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. France subsequently refunded a significant amount of money it had already received for the project and then sold the two ships it had already under construction to Egypt . One of two Mistral-class ships under construction for the Russian Navy in 2014., Ludovic Péron via Wikimedia But there’s still no clear evidence that Krylov, or any of Russia’s other shipyards, have the capacity or knowledge base to produce a ship like the Lavina . Since 2004, the Yantar Shipyard, located in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea, has been struggling to finish orders for two significantly smaller Ivan Gren -class landing ships. These 6,000 ton ships can carry 13 main battle tanks or 36 armored personnel carriers, as well as 300 troops, but have no flight deck or helipad. Yantar laid down the hull of the Ivan Gren in 2004, but didn’t launch her until 2012. The vessel began sea trials in 2016. The Russian Navy expects to get the second ship, Petr Morgunov , sometime this year. Krylov has never built an aircraft carrier or an amphibious assault ship in its history. The firm insists that, despite it turning into a debacle, the technical data Russia obtained from the Mistral arrangement has given it the knowhow, especially in the design of well decks for amphibious operations, to proceed with the project. As part of the deal with France, the conglomerates behind Mistral – STX Europe and DCNS – agreed to share a certain amount of information with Russian engineers as part of a planned joint venture that would have produced additional ships in Russia. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6_ppaaMjFss The two ships that France intended to sell to Russia, but ultimately offered to Egypt, did have changes based on Kremlin requirements. Given Moscow’s rapidly warming relationship with Cairo, it is possible that Russia may be able to learn even more about the design in the end. The two countries are already in talks regarding the sale of Ka-52Ks specifically for these warships. “The carriers [the Mistrals ] had been built in accordance with Russian requirements and for Russian systems,” Alexander Sitnikov, an independent analyst and frequent commentator on military issues for Sputnik, said in an interview earlier in 2017 . “Rebuilding them to NATO standards was technical feasible, but not commercially justifiable: it would be cheaper to simply scrap them. If Russia wins the tender for the helicopters for the Mistrals (and the probability is very high), Egyptian experts will allow Russian naval engineers access to all the ships’ systems.” The Ivan Gren landing ship in 2016., OlegErm via Wikimedia There’s still no guarantee that any amount of information will translate into actual capacity to build the ships, which would require a skilled workforce and significant improvements to Russia’s shipyard infrastructure. As we have written at The War Zone many times before, those factors are largely separate issues dictated by Russia’s economy. In 2015, the Nevsky Design Bureau, proposed a smaller, competing 14,000-ton design , called the Priboy , or “surf.” So far, this ship has failed to materialize, too. If all goes to plan, the Russian Navy hopes to get its first Lavina -class ship before 2025. But previous delays in similarly sized ships and persistent economic factors suggest this may be an optimistic time frame.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 18, 2021",It Looks Like The Army’s Most Secretive Aviation Unit Needs A New Home,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In March 2017, The War Zone dived into the world of the U.S. military’s most shadowy aviation units . Now, it looks like one of those groups is looking to get a new home base. Tucked away in the Pentagon’s budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year, which it unveiled in May 2017, is a U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) request for something it calls a “Battalion Complex, Phase 1” at a classified location somewhere in the contiguous United States, which excludes Alaska and Hawaii. A closer reading of the project’s description and requirements all point to upgraded facilities for a secretive group of U.S. Army aviators widely known as the Flight Concepts Division. But first, here’s the official description of the existing situation: Unit currently works out of a mix of existing facilities of various ages ranging from 10 years old to over 50 years old that have been modified over time to attempt to address mission requirements. Supporting utility and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are old and failing. Unit has outgrown existing facilities, which no longer support the unit’s mission. No space or facility exists to meet the unit’s requirements. Unit has compressed into existing space increasing risk of accidents. Unit is projected to continue growing. US Army On the face of it, this all sounds pretty innocuous and uninteresting. But here’s what the “unit” actually needs from the work, estimated to cost more than $64 million in total, according to SOCOM. The single biggest ticket item is more than $22 million set aside for a line item called “airfield pavements,” which includes “taxiways, a taxiway bridge, taxiway lighting with controls, aircraft parking apron, and access apron,” the overview in the budget explains. Then there are another 10,000 square feet of covered storage space for aircraft ground equipment and other vehicles worth almost $2 million. The bulk of the remaining $40 million goes into various associated improvements to the electrical and gas connections, water and sewage, storm drains, sidewalks, and other basic features found on any large construction project. There is also more than $1 million in various anti-terrorism and cyber security features, as well as an “intrusion detection system” to spot unwanted visitors to the site. For any budding geolocators out there, the taxiway bridge will connect to an existing runway. SOCOM says the work will require construction crews to demolish and relocate an existing “urban assault course” training range, along with a set of bleachers troops presently use for immediate debriefs after they run through exercises, somewhere else, as well. Google Earth We also have a suggestion of where to start looking. While we don’t know the unit in question, almost everything about the proposal seems to point to the Army’s top secret Flight Concepts Division, which is situated at Fort Eustis in Virginia. Here’s what I’ve previously written about the group’s main hangar at the base: The obscure building itself sits secluded at Fort Eustis, Virginia behind multiple layers of fencing. The base’s fire chief isn’t even allowed in to check things out for emergency planning purposes. “Research activities are also conducted by the Flight Concepts Division that is highly secret and access for pre-planning purpose is non-existent,” an undated job posting explains. “Nature of their work is known to be hazardous.” On July 8, 2015, Army Colonel Paul Olsen briefed Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Norfolk District’s past and present projects. In a powerpoint slide titled “You will soon see…” there was a specific reference to the Flight Concepts Division and a new hangar. There was even a low resolution artist’s conception of the new building. The low quality artist’s conception of the Flight Concepts Division’s future hangar., USACE According to the Pentagon’s budget request, design work on the classified “Battalion Complex” started in January 2015. “Unit operations building and hangars will be constructed in follow on phases,” the proposal’s description also notes. On top of that, Fort Eustis’ Felker Army Airfield, to which the existing hangar is adjacent, is basically in the middle of a swamp. Visible on Google Earth less than a mile southeast of the runway, deeper into unimproved marsh, is a collection of buildings or containers that match the basic description of the urban training area. A collection of structures southwest of Felker Army Airfield., Google Earth The proposed “project site is remote requiring long utility runs, surrounded by wetlands and has high storm water management requirement which contribute to unusually high supporting facility cost,” according to the SOCOM budget request. “Wetland mitigation will be required.” Furthermore, The War Zone and other researchers have linked this group, at least tangentially, to the Joint Special Operations Command’s (JSOC) Aviation Technical Evaluation Group (AVTEG). Reports have connected the Flight Concepts Division to the stealthy Black Hawk helicopter that crashed during the JSOC-led raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May 2011 that led to the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The main point of contact for this budget item is JSOC. Of course, there are definitely other secretive locations that could be the intended site of the future project. The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway has been following work on a new hangar at the secretive Groom Lake test site, better known as Area 51, while I’ve previously reported on another classified SOCOM construction project at another undisclosed location. But none of these seem to fit as many of the parameters outlined in the budget proposal as the Flight Concepts Division and its home at Fort Eustis. You can be sure we’ll be keeping an eye on the base, as well as other locations, for any new developments.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2019",Putin Says “Patriotic” Russians Could Have Been Behind Cyberattacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has all but admitted the Russian government conducted a complex cyber warfare campaign targeting the 2016 presidential election in the United States. His comments fit a trend of previous Kremlin denials regarding the country’s involvement in various conflicts and attempts to influence or coerce foreign governments, often in the face of gobs of evidence to the contrary. Putin made his remarks during a forum with the editors of major international media outlets in St. Petersburg on June 1, 2017. During the event, he took the opportunity to address increasing accusations that Russian government actors had been involved in “hacking” foreign elections. You can read his remarks, as they’ve been widely translated, for yourself: Hackers are free people, just like artists who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting. Likewise, hackers get up in the morning and read the news about international affairs. If they feel patriotic, they try to make what they see as a fair contribution to the struggle against those who speak ill of Russia. Is that possible? Yes, theoretically. Later on in the wide-ranging discussions he added: What’s most important, and this is my deep belief, hackers can’t crucially influence an election in a foreign country. No information will change the minds of a foreign people and the outcome. So that’s my answer: The Russian government is not [supporting hackers at any level, and doesn’t plan to. On the contrary, we try to fight it in Russia. But anyway, I’m sure that no hackers will be able to influence an election in any European country, in Asia, or America. On the face of it, these comments aren’t particularly new or interesting. Russian officials within the country and at their embassies abroad have been increasingly flippant in denying accusations the country’s intelligence services have sought to undermine the democratic processes in countries such as the United States , France , and Germany . Putin meeting with his Ministry of Defense team., AP “Hacking,” which seems to imply directly breaking into a computer network to change an election result , might not necessarily be the most accurate description of the Kremlin’s activities. Foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as well as independent cyber security firms and experts, have more accurately said Russian agents and government sponsored actors have selectively stolen and leaked information to smear certain politicians and political parties, possibly seeded those leaks with or been duped into releasing fabricated documents, actively spread disinformation , and otherwise sought to manipulate the public discourse. Both organizations and individuals have taken responsibility for these operations. Some of these, such as the individual or individuals claiming to be the hacker Guccifer 2.0 , have insisted they’re acting on their own accord despite evidence linking them to Russian intelligence agencies. Notably, in October 2016, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), an element of the Department of Homeland Security, released an unclassified Joint Analysis Report with “details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS).” The review specifically looked at entities known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 and APT 29, better known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear . These two groups are widely understood to be directly under the control of the military Main Intelligence Agency (GRU) and either the civilian Federal Security Service (FSB) or Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), respectively. Cyber-security firms had previously connected the organizations to cyber attacks dating as far back as 2008. DHS said its information was part of a broader investigative operation into “Russian malicious cyber activity,” which it had nicknamed Grizzly Steppe . Pro-Russian militiamen train in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. , AP Russia has steadfastly denied these assertions, saying that American and other foreign officials have creatively crafted the available evidence to point back to the Kremlin. Putin and his spokesmen have branded the allegations as “ hysteria ” and the product of “Russophobia.” But the Russian leader’s own words in St. Petersburg suggest things may not be so clear cut. In particular, his use of the term “patriotic” to describe Russians motivated by their love of country, but acting independently from any government direction is one that he has trotted out before in a very different context. In March 2015, Putin said it had been the “ composure and patriotism ” of Russians that had delivered Ukraine’s Crimea region back to the motherland a year earlier, rather than a forceful invasion and illegal annexation. In August 2014, a separatist commander leading rebel in Ukraine’s eastern Donestk region made similar comments in an interview with the Russian television channel Vesti, according to Reuters . “Among us are fighting serving [Russian] soldiers, who would rather take their vacation not on a beach but with us, among brothers, who are fighting for their freedom,” Alexander Zakharchenko told the state-run outlet. At the same time, other Russian state media characterized them as heroic “ volunteers ” who “could not idly observe events.” The language of being unable to control the actions of such individuals is equally familiar. “We don’t call on anyone to do this, we don’t encourage [going to fight in Ukraine],” Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, insisted in an interview with state news agency RIA Novosti, now known as Sputnik, in June 2015. “But realistically, to stop them would be impossible.” A woman walks with pro-Russian militiamen in Donetsk., AP In December 2015, Putin finally admitted that his country had military intelligence personnel supporting the separatists fighting the government in Kiev. He still denied widespread reports that actual, conventional Russian troops with tanks, heavy artillery, and other weaponry had joined the fight and were dying in significant numbers . So, one could argue that Putin’s comments might be more of a non-denial, setting his government up to distance itself from individuals involved in these activities. His comments do follow leaks from U.S. officials that American investigators have identified Russian cyber warriors by name and may have traced certain networks back to the Russian president himself . And Kremlin authorities have acknowledged their ability to conduct such operations, even if they insist that other countries have the same abilities. In February 2017, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces were conducting “ intelligent, effective propaganda ” against unspecified targets. Putin with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev., AP There is always the remote possibility that Putin is telling the truth, or is at least making statements that are technically correct. But combined with his past statements and the repeated changes in his government’s official line regarding the fighting in Ukraine, as well as the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over the country, his new comments seem to come very close to acknowledging an active hand in trying to influence the outcome regardless of whether or not it worked out directly. Whenever it comes to Vladimir Putin, one has to remember that you’re dealing with a former Soviet intelligence officer who has infamously said “there is no such thing as an ex- Chekist .” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 31, 2019",The US Navy’s Newly Delivered Supercarrier Still Needs a Ton of Work,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has finally gotten the first of its latest class of supercarriers, the future USS Gerald R. Ford . Though the service expects to commission the ship within months, there are still significant questions about when it will be fully operation and what exactly that will really mean in the end. On May 31, 2017, Newport News Shipbuilding delivered the upcoming Ford to the Navy’s own facilities in Newport News, Virginia. This is the service’s first all-new carrier type in more than four decades and the first new flattop of any kind – not counting the USS America , technically an amphibious assault ship – it has received since what became the Nimitz -class USS George H. W. Bush arrived in 2009. The Navy originally expected her to join the fleet in March 2016. “Over the last several years, thousands of people have had a hand in delivering Ford to the Navy – designing, building and testing the Navy’s newest, most capable, most advanced warship,” Rear Admiral Brian Antonio, the Navy’s program executive officer for aircraft carriers, said at a ceremony marking the milestone. “It is because of them that Ford performed so well during acceptance trials, as noted by the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey.” Antonio’s not wrong about the ship’s design being a significant departure from the existing Nimitz-class. Compared to the older ships, the Ford -class’ nuclear reactor and associated generator turbines produce more than three times as much electricity. This is vital to run a host of new systems, including high-tech battle management networks and other computer systems, long-range radars and other sensors. The future USS Ford in 2014., USN But by far, most important are the ship’s electrically-powered Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). Nimitz -class carriers launch aircraft using steam-powered catapults and recover aircraft with a hydraulic arresting system. On paper, both systems should allow the ship’s crew to have more control over how they get aircraft into the air and get them back on the deck, speeding up the processes and reducing wear and tear on the ship and the planes. The Navy has made a somewhat questionable claim that the Ford -class will be able to increase overall sortie generation rates by about a third compared to the older carriers. The precision equipment could also fundamentally change the way people design carrier-based aircraft, paving the way for smaller, lighter drones and other developments. The only problem is that neither of these systems work reliably in their present form. The technology is revolutionary, but still largely unproven, even after many years of research and development and huge sums of money invested. Without them performing as expected, the Ford and its sister ships will simply be incapable of doing their job to any meaningful degree. The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway, who has been following the development of the new supercarrier, highlighted this issue earlier in May 2017: The thing is, both of these components are absolutely critical to the carrier’s mission and are heavily integrated into the vessels. Also they don’t have to work reliably just some of the time, but all of the time. Aircrew’s lives are literally depending on them as is the carrier’s actual war fighting ability. So if they are not able to function in a highly reliable manner, it equals a mission kill for these massive ships. In April 2017, given the issues with Ford , Rogoway offered his own detailed recommendations of how the Navy could right-size its carrier forces, as part of a larger set of proposals for future naval developments. The Navy is well aware of these issues. In August 2016, Bloomberg.com obtained a memo Frank Kendall, then Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and effectively the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, sent to Ray Mabus, who was then Secretary Navy. In his notice, Kendall said he was ordering an independent review of the program, which had already seen serious cost overruns and seemed destined for more in order to fix the glaring issues with its most central equipment. He specifically mentioned trouble with the EMALS and AAG, but also pointed to persistent issues with the ship’s powerplant, its dual band radar, and the ship’s elevators that take aircraft and weapons up from the hangars onto the flight deck. “With the benefit of hindsight, it was clearly premature to include so many unproven technologies in the Gerald R, Ford ,” Kendall explained. “What we have to determine now is whether it is best to stay the course or adjust our plans, particularly for future ships of the class. The first step in that process has to be a completely objective and technically deep review of the current situation.” Though Kendall mentioned a purchasing method called “transformation,” what he really appeared to be talking about was a process known as “ concurrency .” Under this concept, rather than finalizing the design of a weapon system first, the Pentagon would hire contractors to start building examples immediately while that work was still ongoing. In theory, the “concurrent” work would save time and money as “minor” fixes are applied to finished products and those still on the production line. In practice, the results have been exactly the opposite, with costly and complex changes routinely leading to delays and limiting the system’s initial combat capability . Ford under construction at Newport News in 2013., USN So, in referring to this revelation as “hindsight,” Kendall may have been being very generous to himself and his colleagues. The Pentagon and the Navy had both downplayed many of these issues for years beforehand, in the face of assessments and cost estimates from both independent government watchdogs and Newport News Shipbuilding itself. In October 2015, the Government Accountability Office hit the Navy with a scathing report on the progress of Ford , titled “Poor Outcomes Are the Predictable Consequences of the Prevalent Acquisition Culture”– essentially “ we told you so .” “In July 2007, we reported on weaknesses in the Navy’s business case for the Ford -class aircraft carrier,” Paul Francis, the GAO’s Managing Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management, explained to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Oct. 1, 2015. “Today, all of this has come to pass in the form of cost growth, testing delays and reduced capability – in other words, less for more.” The Navy initially estimated Ford would cost $10.5 billion. GAO felt this was around $2 billion short, a number that closely matched Newport News’ own calculations. This shipyard has a wealth of experience in what goes into building carriers, having been involved in constructing every class of flattop the Navy has operated since the 1950s. It seemed the height of pique for anyone in the U.S. military to disregard the company’s view of the matter. As of 2016, the final price tag had risen to more than $13 billion, and that does not include research and development costs, which were billions more. The USS George H.W. Bush, the Navy’s newest carrier actually in service., USN So, with the Pentagon’s review still ongoing, and EMALS and AAG, along with other systems, still slogging through development, its entirely unclear how long it will be before the Navy can actually put Ford to any use. Buried in its own announcement is a tactic admission of this fact: “Planned deferred work will be performed [after commissioning], and any deficiencies identified during trials will be addressed during in-port periods.” The Navy wants the ship to be combat ready by 2020, but on how significant the changes and fixes are, this may turn out to be as overly optimistic as the ship’s cost. Changes in the EMALS system in particular could potentially require a redesign of the ship’s basic profile or internal arrangement, not the kind of thing contractors could do during a brief port visit. A more drastic change, such as going back to a traditional steam catapult system – which no American company currently makes – would be even more time and labor intensive. That shift is unlikely to happen, but President Donald Trump did highlight it as a possibility in a freewheeling speech from the deck on the ship earlier in May 2017. Trump talks on the Ford in May 2017., AP “You going to goddamned steam,” he said he told a Navy officer after learning about the electromagnetic catapult’s troubles. “The digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it’s no good.” The need for expensive overhauls might not be linked to any particular system, either. The Navy repeatedly attempted to delay critical shock tests , which the Pentagon conducts on all new ships to see how they and their on board equipment might fare when things start exploding nearby in combat. Ford needs to pass those trials before it can enter service. Any one has to wonder how legitimate any such results might be if gear like the EMALS is still not fully functional under optimal conditions. This is all on top of the normal teething trouble any new weapon system experiences, too. Workers will undoubtedly find things they didn’t even know were a problem as they put Ford through the paces before its commissioning. All of this could impact the final cost of the second Ford -class ship, the future USS John F. Kennedy , which is already under construction at Newport News. As it stands now, unfortunately, the Navy still has a number of hurdles to overcome before it can get its newest supercarrier into action and it likely doesn’t even know yet how extensive the work required will be in the end.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 8, 2018",Air Force Now Wants to Get Sidelined C-5 Galaxy Transports Back In the Air,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force wants to get more massive C-5 Galaxy cargo planes back into active duty. The plan follows more than a decade of retirements or other cost cutting measures in the face of budget shortfalls that had ultimately trimmed nearly half the fleet. Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, the Air Force’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Requirements, made the announcement during a Congressional hearing on May 25, 2017. The proposal would take eight C-5s from the service’s inactive reserve and put them back into full service by the end of 2021. “We’re going to buy back two a year for four years,” Harris explained. But he would only be able to do it “if we’re able to have a predictable budget.” It’s not clear what model of Galaxy the Air Force has awaiting a return to active duty. Officials have said the eight aircraft are all the latest C-5M Super Galaxies, but it seems unlikely the service would choose to put recently upgraded models into reserve status while antiquated aircraft continue to fly. It is possible these references only reflected the expected end state, since the service expects to eventually update all of its Galaxies to the M standard. Regardless, Lockheed Martin’s C-5M is the Air Force’s largest cargo hauler and among the largest aircraft anywhere in the world . The four engine jets can carry up to a maximum of 135 tons of cargo. The planes can fly more than 4,800 miles with a more typical load of 120,000 pounds of personnel, equipment, or a combination of both. The Galaxy can refuel in mid air, too. By comparison, the U.S. military’s next largest airlifter, the C-17A Globemaster III , can fly approximately 2,400 miles with its maximum payload of 85 tons. This major improvement project included both the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP). AMP involved adding a new “glass cockpit” with digital rather than analog systems, as well as modernized communications, navigation, and air traffic management system. The latter piece of gear made the aircraft compliant with overarching Federal guidelines for safe air travel. The RERP replaced all four of the General Electric (G.E.) TF-39 engines found on earlier the A, B, and C models with all-new G.E. F-138s. Also known as the CF6, each of these new high-bypass turbofans produced more than 8,000 pounds more thrust in addition to being more fuel efficient, extending the aircraft’s overall range. On top of that, this gave the new M version a 58 percent increase in climb performance versus the older variants, on top of a 20 percent increase in payload capacity. Most importantly, the Air Force expected the new motors would cut the cost per flying hour by more than 30 percent. All of this made the Super Galaxy even more versatile and able to reach even more destinations than before. During an open house on March 31, 2017, Air Force General Carlton Everhart, in charge of Air Mobility Command, noted that a C-5M had recently flown straight from Travis Air Force Base in California all the way to Yokota, Japan without the traditional stopover in Hawaii. “It’s the only airlifter in the inventory that can make the flight non-stop, which means we can put the American flag on the ground in hours versus days,” he declared. Air Force personnel load the fuselage of a C-130 cargo plane into a C-5 Galaxy., USAF Unfortunately, a combination of years of budget uncertainty and competing priorities have forced the Air Force into the position it’s in now, where it has 56 of the massive jets, but only flies 48 of them. The other eight are sitting in “backup inventory” meaning “we still have the aircraft but lost all manning and funding to operate them,” Everhart explained at the event in March 2017. After the Budget Control Act of 2011 capped defense spending and imposed significant cuts as part of a process known as sequestration, the service argued it needed to trim the fleet in order to pay for other priorities, including the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and KC-46A aerial tanker. But the process had begun well before then. The capability offered by the C-5 never came cheap. The Galaxies’ were and still are expensive to fly and maintain, costing the Air Force more than $100,000 per flight hour as of 2016 .  The aircraft’s relative complexity meant that historically less than 70 percent of them were ever mission capable and that ready rate was often even lower, hovering near 60 percent. So, between the 2004 and 2013 fiscal years, Congress approved a series of plans to ultimately trim the entire fleet to just 52 planes. More than 75 C-5As would head straight to the boneyard. Of course, the service did plan to upgrade the remaining aircraft to the C-5M standard. An M1 Abrams tank rolls into the belly of a C-5M Galaxy., USAF Unfortunately, sequestration delayed these upgrades. As of 2016, out of the 48 flyable planes across the active Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard, there was still a combination of 10 C-5As and Bs, as well as a lone remaining C, according to data from the Air Force Association. Cost cutting also meant Air Mobility Command had to keep the inactive jets sidelined longer than expected. “Those eight C-5Ms? I was going to buy them back within a two-year period,” Everhart complained in his remarks in March 2017. Between sequestration and funding from a series of short-term “continuing resolutions” rather than an actual budget, that idea had “been delayed twice … in two budget cycles.” Compounding the problems was the fact that no American aircraft manufacturer was making a strategic airlifter of any description. This meant the Air Force would either have to upgrade existing aircraft, such as the C-5s, or hire a company to come up with an all-new design. The latter option would be an immensely time consuming and expensive proposition. So, the service had to have known that an increasingly smaller airlift fleet could only limit its ability to perform its missions. Now its finally and actively looking to reverse that trend when it comes to the Galaxies. The service’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget proposal includes funds to get the first two inactive C-5s back in operation, as well as continue work to finally upgrade the remaining aircraft, according to its official budget brief . On top of that, the service is looking for money to finish installing the Large Aircraft Infra-Red Counter Measures (LAIRCM), a laser-based defense system against infra-red guided missiles, across all of its cargo aircraft, including the C-5s. C-5M, Lockheed At present, within the U.S. military, only the Galaxy has the capacity to move certain units and their equipment as a single package. In a realistic scenario, it would take multiple C-17s to do the duty of just one C-5. The Air Force cannot and does not expect the Globemaster IIIs to fill this role. Short of contracted airlift, the U.S. military doesn’t have many other options if it wants to deploy significant numbers of troops and their associated equipment within hours rather than days, weeks, or even months. Even then, only aircraft like the similarly sized Antonov An-124 or the gargantuan An-225 can truly match or exceed the C-5’s abilities. Back in 2015, Ben Brown, an Air Force C-5 pilot, had this to say about these different aircraft in an interview with The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway: “The An-124 is a big bird as well, but the C-5 has its advantages. The C-5 is made in America, flown by an Air Force crew, and a display of American airpower wherever it goes. The C-5 can refuel in flight, if required. Inflight, the whole of the C-5 is pressurized, whereas an An-124 (to my knowledge) only pressurizes the flight deck and passenger compartment, so the cargo compartment is unpressurized and can’t easily be checked in flight. The biggest strength in my mind is that the C-5 has an easily configurable floor; it can be flat and smooth for rolling stock, or you can flip portions around and pop up rails so that you can roll pallets on, as well as having omni-directional rollers on the cargo loading ramps. I’ve heard that the An-124 has a wooden floor, so that makes it different than ours. I’m not familiar with all the particulars of the An-124, so I don’t know how fast or far it goes, or if it can taxi easily, or anything like that. Bottom line, from my perspective, is both are massive aircraft with unique capabilities.” C-5 high over rugged terrain., USAF So, when the U.S. military needs to move all sort of of heavy and oversized items, from Army tanks and helicopters to ballistic missiles and even other aircraft, it has few better options than its own C-5s. Hopefully the Air Force will be able to keep an adequate number of them flying for the foreseeable future. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",South China Sea Underwater “Environmental” Sensor Net Could Track U.S. Subs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese government has approved plans for a massive undersea surveillance network in both the East and South China Seas. Officially intended to primarily monitor environmental changes, state officials acknowledge the systems will have “national defense” applications, which could include tracking the movements of foreign submarines. The plan includes a number of unspecified sensors on the ocean floor, connected via optical cables to a central processing and monitoring facility in Shanghai. The devices will be able to provide “real-time, high-definition, multiple interface, and three-dimensional observations,” according to state-run outlet CCTV . “China is an ocean power; it should have done more in oceanic studies in the past,” Jian Zhimin, dean of the School of Marine and Earth Sciences at Tongji University in Shanghai, told CCTV. “An ocean power must be able to go to the high seas and go global.” Ostensibly, the network forms a “laboratory” in which researchers can study climate change and maritime phenomena, Jian added. Additional reports suggested that this equipment would be calibrated to gather chemical, biological, and geological data. But the national security implications are hard to miss. A prototype of one of the sensors for China’s new monitoring underea system., CCTV The underwater system could be useful for “other sectors, such as mining, mapping or ocean rights protection, and national defense in addition to scientific research,” Zhou Huaiyang, a professor in Tongji’s School of Marine and Earth Sciences, explained to CCTV. “We hope different governmental departments can work together to work out stricter regulations and measures on the protection of these undersea facilities, so as to ensure the long-term operation of this system.” It is possible that Zhou’s reference to “national defense” referred to the preservation, exploration, and exploitation of natural resources for China’s benefit. The East and South China Seas may contain untapped reserves of oil, natural gas, and valuable minerals, as well as just being important sources of fish and other edible marine animals. An artist’s conception of the undersea network., Chinese government handout via South China Morning Post However, it seems much more likely the network’s defensive function would have to do with monitoring foreign military movements, especially of submarines. Earlier in May 2017, IHS Jane’s Defence Weekly reported that the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation had presented details of a massive “ Underwater Great Wall Project ” for the People’s Army Liberation Navy (PLAN) during a public exhibition the previous year. That proposal sounds extremely similar to the one CCTV announced in size and scope if not necessarily stated function. During the Cold War, the United States maintained a similar system to guard itself against Soviet submarines, known as the Sound Surveillance System , or SOSUS, which employed groups of ultra-sensitive hydrophone listening devices along the seabed . As a result of espionage, the U.S. Navy was ultimately forces to employ a combination of fixed sensor arrays, surface ships towing sonar, and processing stations ashore, known as the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). But even decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, elements of the system remain in use or available in a crisis. A model of the undersea network., Chinese government handout via South China Morning Post A similar Chinese system in the East and south China Seas would be essential for Beijing to enforce its claim to almost in their entirety of both bodies of water. Nearly every one of the country’s neighbors, as well as major international maritime nations, disputes China’s dominion over these regions. Many, such as the United States, actively challenge the country’s position by sailing through or flying over the area. By 2015, “China demonstrated a willingness to tolerate higher levels of tension in the pursuit of its interests, especially in pursuit of its territorial claims in the East and South China Sea; however, China still seeks to avoid direct and explicit conflict with the United States,” the Pentagon noted in an annual public report to Congress on Chinese military developments. “In the near-term, China is using coercive tactics short of armed conflict, such as the use of law enforcement vessels to enforce maritime claims, to advance their interests in ways that are calculated to fall below the threshold of provoking conflict.” A map of Chinese and foreign outposts in the South China Sea., DOD Most visibly, since 2014, the Chinese government has been actively turning at least eight previously uninhabitable reefs and shoals into man-made islands able to support military outposts . The operations at locations such as Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi Reefs in the South China Sea have airstrips able to support fighter jets and heavier aircraft, apparent radars and launch sites that could accommodate surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles for local defense, and other facilities. In March 2017, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that commercial satellite imagery suggested these military sites were close to fully operational . The Washington, D.C. think tank created an interactive map to go along with their report, showing Chinese aircraft, missiles, and radars provide extensive coverage throughout the South China Sea. For China, these bases are important fixed “territory” it can point to when defending its claims and as part of legal arguments it makes in front of international bodies. Similarly, it has enacted an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East Sea as another method of attempting to enforce its position. Within this zone, the country argues it can restrict foreign military movements and even dictate civilian flight paths, with any organization needing to coordinate air travel with Chinese officials.  There are reports that China may be considering declaring a similar zone over the whole of the South China Sea, something its new islands could help monitor. At sea, Chinese authorities have made similar pronouncements about their control over international waters in both the South China and East Seas. In both regions, to reinforce the country’s claims of absolute ownership, Chinese aircraft and warships have repeatedly harassed foreign civilian and military activities. The United States has responded with regular aerial and naval patrols to challenge this assertion. And though both countries might want to avoid an actual skirmish, tensions have often run high during these missions. Chinese fighter jets routinely buzz American patrol and surveillance aircraft. In May 2017, two People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) fighters performed “ unsafe and unprofessional ” maneuvers near a WC-135 Constant Phoenix spy plane, which collects air samples looking for evidence of nuclear tests, in international air space over the South China Sea, according to the U.S. Navy. The China’s navy, various other maritime security forces , and the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia – popularly known as “ Little Blue Men ” – all similarly shadow American warships as they move through the area during what the Pentagon pointedly refers to as “ Freedom of Navigation Operations ” (FONOPS). Rarely do the two sides ever truly meet. In a rare incident in May 2016, PLAAF jets scrambled from the airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef in response to the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS William P. Lawrence ’s trip through the area . More flagrantly, on Dec. 15, 2016, a Chinese ship snatched a U.S. Navy underwater glider, a type of drone the service uses for underwater mapping and research activities, right out of the water and sailed away. Within a week, China had returned the Slocum glider without any real explanation of why they seized the unclassified vehicle in the first place . But what the Chinese military hasn’t been able to do is challenge the U.S. Navy’s submarines, or those from other developed nations that patrol the East and South China seas, such as Japan and Australia. Able to operate for protracted periods under the waves, subs have an innate deterrent capability and could easily be a hidden threat to China’s man-made naval outposts during a crisis. The undersea vessels could also spy on those bases without Chinese forces being able to necessarily respond. A Chinese warship launches anti-submarine rockets during an exercise in 2005., AP In February 2017, Chinese state media announced planned changes to the country’s maritime safety statute , which would require submarines to sail on the surface with a national flag displayed when passing through regions such as the South China Sea, while reporting to Chinese maritime security organizations. Chinese officials expected the changes to take effect in 2020. “As a sovereign State and the biggest coastal State in, for example, the  South China Sea, China is entitled to adjust its maritime laws as  needed, which will also promote peace and stable development in the  waters,” Wang Xiaopeng, a maritime expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the state-operated newspaper Global Times . But, in addition to violating the most basic spirit of international maritime law, this would be difficult if not impossible for China to enforce at present. Though the PLAN has spent considerable effort in improving its own “silent service,” submarines remains a relatively small portion of the country’s naval arm. As of 2016, China had approximately 56 attack and guided missile submarines, but a significant number of those are old Cold War designs or smaller coastal defense types, according to that year’s edition of The International Institute for Strategic Studies’ The Military Balance . The United States operates a similarly sized fleet, but one entirely comprised of long-range, ocean-going, nuclear-powered vessels. In addition, the U.S. military boasts more than twice as many nuclear-armed ballistic missile subs, not including four doing duty as cruise-missile boats. So, instead, the Chinese military would have to devote significant surface ships and aircraft just to hunt for foreign subs violating its new regulations. A Chinese Song -class submarine., SteKrueBe via Wikimedia An underwater surveillance net able to detect and track submarines traveling in and out of an area could dramatically change the calculus for world navies operating in the East and South China Seas, as well as potentially improving China’s negotiating position. The country has been undeterred by unfavorable determinations on its claims from international tribunals, insisting that it has the right to settle any disagreements directly with the affected parties . Of course the new capability won’t come cheap. Official estimates are that the underwater project will cost approximately $2 billion Yuan – $300 million at the official, likely undervalued exchange rate – and take at least five years to complete. It’s not clear whether or not this will be the final total for the complete network that covers all of the East Sea and South China Sea, or just one initial portion covering a specific area. What is clear is that China seems intent on challenging the ability of foreign navies to sail through bodies of water it considers to be part of its national territory, even under the surface.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 5, 2021",U.S. Navy Wants Long-Range Guided Artillery Shell For Hitting Moving Targets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is leading developing a new 155mm artillery round capable of destroying moving targets on land or at sea that could end up in use across three services, including the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. More importantly, the precision munitions will not use GPS, making them useful even in GPS denied environments. The Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWC Dahlgren), and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) have been coordinating on the project, blandly titled the Moving Target Artillery Round. The MTAR acronym has apparently lent itself to a more colorful program logo featuring a minotaur throwing the notional projectile. The Navy and its partners are still ironing out the full requirements, having just put out an official contracting notice looking for information from prospective industry partners in May 2017. The plan is to have the project formally up and running sometime in 2019. As of May 2017, the Navy was envisioning a 155mm round able to strike moving opponents on the surface, whether they are on dry land or out at sea, at ranges roughly between 40 and 60 miles, according to a briefing Sanford Steelman, a program manager at NSWC Dahlgren, presented at the National Defense Industry Association’s 2017 Armament Systems Forum & Firing Demonstration . Though not specified, to get these ranges from existing howitzers, the projectiles would need to be boosted by a rocket or another significant additional propellant source. The presentation also included a conceptual description of a fire mission by a howitzer battery against a land target. The MTAR project logo., USN The first phase involves the crew of an M777A1 155mm howitzer receiving and process the request for fire support, which would include uploading the relevant target information into the MTAR. This is the same basic procedure for Army and Marine Corps gunners employing the GPS-guided M982 Excalibur projectile. With Excalibur, the appropriate coordinates must be transferred into the guidance unit via before troops send it down range. The conceptual MTAR firing sequence., USN In the case of MTAR, the idea is to use a separate radar system to track the projectile and point it to the target’s general area. During flight, inertial navigation would keep it going in the right direction. In the final stage, a manned aircraft, drone, or troops on the ground would use a laser designator to aim the projectile at the exact target. Though not specified in Steelman’s brief, the round’s seeker would have to include a so-called “laser-lead” capability to calculate how far ahead of a moving target it needs to fly in order to actually hit the mark. Both the Army and Marines might find the shells useful for taking out opponents driving anything from tanks to technicals. https://youtube.com/watch?v=s41mPivcztY The new guided 155mm round will be able to work in any Army or Marine Corps M777A1 howitzer. As such, it will undoubtedly be compatible with the M109A6 Paladin and M109A7 Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) self-propelled 155mm systems. Conceivably, existing counter-fire radars that can track incoming fire and locate enemy artillery batteries could supply the initial direction for the projectile, reducing the amount of additional new equipment troops would need to employ the final, production ammunition. The presentation featured a picture of the electronically-scanned AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder, one such system, as the notional example. Updated versions of the “Q-36” use an inertial navigation system to plot the path of projectiles to locate their launchers, which could also aid in MTAR’s guidance. Two Q-36 radars., US Army But by far the most significant of MTAR’s features is that, unlike Excalibur or a number of other precision artillery ammunition already in service or in development, its guidance does not involve GPS in any way. The Navy specifically says this is to make sure troops and sailors can continue providing precise artillery support in a “satellite/network denied environment.” This would be a situation where the connection to the space-based navigation system is somehow broken, whether by jamming the signal, spoofing an inaccurate location, or someone just physically knocking down the satellites. Though this might sound like the plot of a Hollywood movie or the beginnings of a conspiracy theory, the Pentagon has become increasingly worried about the very real threats to GPS coverage . With so much of day-to-day combat heavily reliant on GPS, along with satellite-based communications and sensor systems, even a brief disruption could have wide-range impacts. These issues seem to be among the main driving factors behind the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) XS-1 space plane project . And The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has long been calling attention to the dangers of new technologies designed to attack targets in space and wrote the following in December 2016: Cyber warfare may be grabbing all the headlines lately, but space – the place where so much of America’s unique combat capability is enabled from – is the US military’s glaring Achilles Heel. China and Russia are rapidly developing new capabilities to destroy, disable, blind or even hijack American satellites in orbit in an attempt to level the playing field should a peer-state conflict breakout. The US is slowly trying to adapt to this new reality by spinning up new ways to navigate and target in GPS-denied combat environments – as well as coming up with new communications techniques that work around reliance on satellite relays. Marines fire an M777 howitzer in Iraq in 2008., USMC Unfortunately, the Navy’s GPS-free solution isn’t perfect. Lasers are notorious sensitive to environmental factors such as cloud cover, dust, and smoke, which can break up the beam or block it entirely. The Army has been well aware of this issue from years of experience with the M712 Copperhead laser-guided shell. The service had adopted this round specifically to attack tanks and other armored vehicles. With terminal laser-guidance only, Copperhead had a “glide mode” that allowed the shell to fly a flatter trajectory, keeping it below heavy cloud cover that could impair its targeting system. MTAR’s initial and mid-course guidance would make it more flexible than Copperhead, but still be less so than a true “dual-mode” weapon with both GPS- and laser-guidance systems on board. Units would probably need to stock both these rounds and existing GPS-guided projectiles in order to cover all the expected target sets. This relative simplicity might keep the cost down and wide-spread fielding could potentially reduce the unit cost of each round even more, as both the Army and Marines buy stockpiles for all of their towed and mobile 155mm howitzers.  The overall percentage is always an important consideration and might make the projectile a viable option for the 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS) weapons on the Navy’s high-tech Zumwalt -class stealth destroyers , too. The ONR has already designated the eventual formal project a “Future Naval Capability” program. The Navy has had a desperate need for alternative projectiles or weapons for the Zumwalts since the service canceled future purchases of the advanced Long-Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) in 2016. Each of these had a mind-boggling sticker price of $800,000. This decision left the ships’ main guns with literally no ammunition. Three services buying the MTAR could only drive down the cost even more and a cheap guided round, however imperfect, could provide at least an interim solution for the Zumwalt’s glaring armament problem. To make the round even more attractive to the Navy, Steelman’s brief noted that there were already plans to develop a discarding sabot that would allow crews to fire the guided munitions from 5-inch naval guns, standard on all Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and Ticonderoga -class cruisers. Of course, the proposed MTAR wouldn’t have the range of the LRLAP, which were able to hit targets up to 100 miles away. Depending on its minimum range, however, it might be more useful against small, waterborne attackers in a swarm scenario , and above all else can provide an over-the-horizon precision strike capability against moving targets that could be designated by a ship’s MH-60 Seahawk helicopter or MQ-8 Fire Scout helicopter drone. Even small boats equipped with laser designators could act as forward targeting nodes, and of course the round would be especially useful for supporting troops ashore. MTAR is just one of a suite of guided munitions that the Navy is exploring as part of a broader project it calls “Enhanced Expeditionary Engagement Capability,” or E3C. Other developments included continued work on 81mm and 60mm mortar rounds with combination GPS- and laser-guidance systems. The goal of E3C is to “demonstrate the ‘art of the possible’ in fire support technologies for USMC weapons, through an ongoing series of integrated system firing demonstrations,” Steelman explained in his presentation. If all goes to plan, “possible” may include a precision, long-range artillery round free of the tether of GPS before the end of 2022.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Russia’s Plans for New Nuclear Carriers And Destroyers Delayed Indefinitely,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is reportedly moving ahead with aggressive plans to revitalize its military as the country adopts an increasingly revanchist foreign policy. However, some items are noticeably absent from the Kremlin’s latest rearmament program, specifically two all-new surface warships, suggesting earlier proposals may have been, not surprisingly, too ambitious for the Russian defense industry. Earlier in May 2017, Russian media revealed details about a new tranche of modernization projects, which are slated to run through 2025. Though we don’t know much the Kremlin has set aside for these new purchases, it set aside approximately 19 trillion rubles – around $336.3 billion at the existing rate of exchange – for the previous build up, which started in 2011 and will wrap up in 2020. The amount of overlap between the two is unclear. “The 2025 program is a black box right now,” Pavel Luzin, a Russian defense industry analyst at Perm State University, said according to Defense News . “It has a lot of overlap with the 2020 program, which suggests it is aimed only to hide the failures of the current program. That isn’t to say the 2020 program failed, just that it has strayed far from its original financing and procurement goals.” In particular, Russian daily Kommersant , a leading business-focused newspaper, reported that the new plan put work on new classes of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and destroyers for the Russian Navy on hold indefinitely. Big ticket items would still include the RS-26 Rubezh, RS-28 Sarmat, and Bagruzin intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as purchases of more advanced derivatives of Sukhoi’s Flanker fighter jets, orders for PAK-FA/T-50 stealth fighters, and continued work on the still unseen PAK-DA stealth bomber. A model of the proposed Project 23000E aircraft carrier. , Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia The new modernization thrust “will become the most important instrument in implementing Russia’s  military and industrial policy in the spheres of defense and security  through 2025 and beyond,” Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said, according to state-run media outlet TASS. Experts and observers, including The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway and myself , have long been skeptical of the Kremlin’s abilities to follow through on many of these plans. Notably, Russian officials repeatedly scaled back purchases of the T-50 stealth fighter, which has experienced numerous delays and setbacks, to the point that they were only planning to buy a token fleet of 12 aircraft as of 2016. Even if Moscow manages to double that order under the latest rearmament push, it would amount to less than half of the aircraft the Russian Air Force initially expected to have in service by 2055. The changes in spending on surface ships are especially unsurprising. Russian state media included a number of dubious details when it first began talking about the Project 23000E carrier, also known as Shtorm , in 2015.  The ship would have “no analogues in the world,” but only cost $5.6 billion, Russian Admiral Vladimir Korolyov, head of the country’s Northern Fleet, boasted to TASS in June 2015. The U.S. Navy’s new Ford -class super carriers will cost more than twice that amount when they finally enter service. A model of the as yet unseen Project 23560 destroyer., Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia Information on the Project 23560 destroyer, also known variously as the Lider -class, was simply scant in general. In July 2016, state-run outlet Sputnik described the vessel as an advanced, nuclear-powered icebreaker , before additional information emerged later in the year showing it to be a fully fledged destroyer. Of course, the ship’s design could still have had ice-breaking features. The Russian Navy is still set to get a number of smaller Project 23550 Ice -class ships , effectively ice-breaking corvettes, armed with a medium-caliber deck gun and launchers for cruise missiles, such as the Klub-K and Kalibr-NK. It was immediately unclear how Russian officials expected to pay for both of these large warships, especially given its other priorities in modernizing its nuclear triad and expanding investment in advanced aircraft projects. There was already significant evidence by the end of 2015, that the Kremlin had been forced to scale back those projects in the face of harsh economic realities, too. Royal Navy destroyer HMS Dragon sails by the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in the English Channel., Crown Copyright After the end of the Cold War, Russia’s economy had been buoyed by a rapidly expanded international market for its vast natural resources, most notably oil and natural gas. Unfortunately, by 2014, it had begun to decline , owing in no small part to the collapse of the international price of crude oil. Then, in March 2014, the Kremlin seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula, igniting world-wide outrage and leading the European Union and the United States, among others, to institute a flurry of sanctions. Russian support for separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad only prompted more rebukes. In October 2016, reports swirled that the country’s defense budget would suffer significant cuts as a result of this new reality. In March 2017, the Russian Federal Treasury put out figures that seemed to imply the country would slash military spending by more than 25 percent compared to the previous fiscal cycle. Some disputed this, saying the real figure was actually closer to 10 percent , but this would still have been a significant change in funding levels. These cuts could easily have doomed the ship-building projects, which in general can require relatively long lead times combined with significant investments in supporting infrastructure and a skilled workforce. And that may actually have been the bigger issue. Russia simply does not have existing facilities and workers to support massive surface warship projects. So, when it came to the Shtorm especially, the project would have required much more money and resources than just the price of the ships. A view of the Nerpa ship repair plant in Snezhnogorsk. , AP When India hired Russian shipyard Sevmash Enterprise to overhaul the smaller, conventionally-powered Admiral Gorshkov – another Soviet-era carrier from another Ukrainian ship builder – the results were disastrous. The firm had no history with carriers in general or the design in particular. It took nearly a decade and more than $2 billion – more than twice the original estimate – for the renamed INS Vikramaditya to finally be combat ready. Reports that Russia had offered to sell India a Project 23000E seemed almost laughably optimistic given this debacle. So it wasn’t particularly surprising to find that the lead contractor for the Shtorm , the Krylov State Research Center in St. Petersburg, also had no experience what so ever designing and building aircraft carriers. Russia’s only such ship, the Admiral Kuznetsov and its much maligned conventionally fueled steam boilers, came out of a Ukrainian shipyard when it was still part of the Soviet Union. Since Russian shipyards have taken responsibility for the ship, it has become so accident prone that it never leaves port without an ocean-going tug alongside. The Kremlin is now planning a $700 million overhaul of what it officially calls a “heavy aircraft-carrying missile cruiser,” which could put it out of action entirely for a protracted period of time. Similar issues were quickly apparent in reports surrounding the Lider -class destroyers. The Severnaya Verf shipyard, also in St. Petersburg, hasn’t built a ship of this type since 1999. If reports about the design’s displacement , an almost absurd 17,500 tons, are at all close to reality, this would the largest vessel to come out of the facility ever . Even a more modestly-sized warship would be taxing on infrastructure and skill labor that has only been called upon to put together 2,200 ton corvettes and 4,500 frigates for more than a decade. At the same time, Russia is also reportedly in the process of updating one of three inactive Kirov-class missile-armed battlecruisers, the Admiral Nakhimov . The improvements are expected to include new vertical launch missile tubes that can accommodate Onix anti-ship missiles and Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles and a separate navalized version of the S-400 surface-to-air missile. The updated ship may also be able to fire the shadowy Zircon hypersonic anti-ship missile. When that ship re-enters service, the Russian Navy will then send the Pyotr Veliky for a three year overhaul to receive the same modifications. State media has offered various different timetables for when the Admiral Nakhimov refit will finish up. Initially, the work was supposed to be done by 2020, then 2019, and finally 2018. Whether that holds true in the end, or if the final product matches the original description, remains to be seen. “Unfortunately, our shipbuilding is not in good shape,” Ilya Kramnik, a Russian defense expert and columnist with Lenta.ru, acknowledged in an interview with Navyrecongition.com in December 2016. “Everything will depend on what shipyard lands the [sic; they] order and how the latter will be financed. I hope that if they start carrying out the order at all, they will have been able to assess risks realistically by the time the lead ship is laid down, so that we avoid a 10-11-year-long delivery delay.” It seems that this vital improvement to the country’s shipbuilding infrastructure has not yet come to pass. Until it does, Russia will likely have to keep delaying plans to build new, large surface ships, relying instead on its submarine force and lighter, cruise-missile armed littoral ships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 28, 2019",DARPA Chooses X-37 Builder Boeing to Craft a Revolutionary Space Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s top research arm is moving ahead with a project to develop an experimental, reusable space plane. The U.S. military hopes the new design will help reduce the costs of launching satellites into space and dependency on foreign suppliers for space missions. On May 24, 2017, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced it was partnering with Boeing to build the prototype for its unmanned XS-1 space plane program. The Illinois-headquartered firm won the contract with a design it calls Phantom Express. DARPA and Boeing plan “to build and fly the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space,” the military research and development organization said in a press release . “The program aims to achieve a capability well out of reach today – launches to low Earth orbit in days, as compared to the months or years of preparation currently needed to get a single satellite on orbit.” The primary requirement for the XS-1 technology demonstrator is the ability to loft a 3,000 pound expendable payload into low earth orbit, an altitude of anywhere between 99 and 1,200 miles, at a cost of no more than $5 million per launch. According to DARPA, this is roughly 10 times less than what the U.S. military spends on similar space missions. More importantly, the Pentagon wants “aircraft-like” performance, with the ability to conduct at least 10 flights in as many days. There is significantly more time involved when planning and preparing to launch a traditional rocket. An animated artist’s concept of the cycle of operation has the XS-1 taking off vertically, without the need for a large booster rocket, but landing like a conventional airplane, much like NASA’s now retired Space Shuttle. This would make it significantly more capable than the Pentagon’s super-secretive X-37B experimental mini-space shuttle, which launches on top of a conventional rocket. It’s worth noting, however, that this earlier spacecraft is another product of Boeing’s Phantom Works advanced projects office. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” Jess Sponable, the XS-1 program manager said in a statement. “We’re very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 – fabrication and flight.” To achieve the project’s goals, Boeing intends to use the Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 as the main propulsion source for the Phantom Express. This is a liquid-oxygen and liquid hydrogen fueled motor based on the Space Shuttle’s main engine. A secondary booster would help propel the craft into space. This additional rocket will be expendable and house the payload. If all goes to plan, upon reaching the proper position in low earth orbit, the assembly will detach and deploy the satellite. In theory, this launch concept should keep costs down by reducing the total number of components necessary for the craft and required for each mission. By comparison, the Space Shuttle required two external boosters to get it up to speed. These were expensive and complex enough to make it worthwhile to recover them after launch. Boeing’s X-37B space plane., USAF On top of this hybrid boost engine/payload container, DARPA and Boeing plan to make use of advanced, lightweight composite materials that will hopefully make the craft easier to shoot into space. The XS-1 design will leverage automated flight system from the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program, which involved using the momentum of a manned aircraft to give an extra boost to help loft a space craft out of the atmosphere. In the ALASA concept, when the carrier plane reached a certain altitude, it would release the launch vehicle, which would use its own booster motors to propel it the rest of the way into space. The Russians and Chinese have experimented with similar concepts and it may help explain China’s interest in getting the massive Antonov An-225 Mriya back into production . It is very likely that lessons learned from the unmanned, autonomous X-37B – which has been operating for years with few official explanations of its actual mission – have gone into the Phantom Express, too. And there might be an parallel “black” project in the works at the famous Area 51 test site. In addition to refining the design and actually building the prototype, the XS-1 program’s Phase 2 will involve ground engine tests. Boeing will have to fire the Phantom Express’ motors 10 times in 10 days to validate its basic ability to meet that requirement. DARPA expects this portion of the project to wrap up in 2019. Phase 3 will consist of between 12 and 15 actual flight tests. This will include test missions within the Earth’s atmosphere, with and without payloads and up to speeds of Mach 5, followed by full Mach 10 demonstration flights with a “demonstration payload” somewhere between 900 and 3,000 pounds. DARPA has already broadly scheduled these experiments for 2020. If the Phantom Express performs well, it could potentially be revolutionary. As of 2017, the U.S. military was still relying on increasingly expensive, but entirely expandable rockets that require massive dedicated infrastructure to launch. And then there’s the matter of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V , one of the main launch vehicles, which just so happens to use Russian-made RD-180 rocket motors. This has become increasingly politically problematic in the face of the Kremlin’s revanchist foreign policies, including active military support for armed separatist groups in Eastern Ukraine and backing the brutal dictatorship of Bashar Al Assad in Syria. Even before Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, the Air Force was already looking at risk mitigation strategies in case these engines suddenly became unavailable. As a result of subsequent sanctions against Russian officials and companies, the U.S. government has banned the purchase of additional RD-180s after 2022, which will ultimately lead to the use of a different engine, making this particular issue less significant. The Pentagon is interested in reducing the cost of these more conventional missions with reusable booster motors. Private companies SpaceX and Blue Origin already have such designs in development. An Atlas V rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in 2017., USAF However, these traditional missions would still require significant lead time, potentially delaying the Pentagon from deploying critical capabilities or replacing them if something happens. If it works as intended, the XS-1 could rapidly deploy a satellite or even multiple miniature satellites with relative ease. And this may become increasingly important in the near future. “Although many improvements have been incorporated over the decades, launch systems today have grown increasingly expensive and must be procured years in advance of launch, impacting both the affordability of launching national security payloads as well as the cost and complexity of the payloads themselves,” DARPA explains in its main description of the XS-1 program . “In an era of declining budgets and proliferating foreign threats to U.S. air and space assets, routine, affordable and responsive access to space is essential to enabling new military space capabilities and rapid reconstitution of space systems during crisis.” The notion of an enemy taking out satellites in preparation for a larger attack might sound like something out of a Hollywood blockbuster or a videogame, but for the Pentagon it’s becoming an increasingly real concern. If the U.S. military were to lose its GPS coverage for even a brief time, it could hamper troops ability to operate or drop precision bombs on target. Knocking out early warning satellites could blind American forces to incoming attacks. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has kept a close eye on these developments and wrote this in December 2016: For years, anything but kinetic anti-satellite weaponry remained on the dark fringes of the defense world. Now these concepts and capabilities are emerging into the mainstream. These range from the mysterious X-37B miniature space shuttle, to DARPA led initiatives aimed at servicing other satellites in space or using space junk to create cheap communications satellites. Any of these could be used to monitor, jam, or even destroy enemy satellites without creating terrible debris fields that will limit future access to space. Other highly classified space technologies also likely exist. USAF In December 2016, Russia conducted the fifth test of its PL-19 Nudol anti-satellite missile . Nearly a decade earlier, China conducted its own anti-satellite test . There is a growing potential for dual-use satellites , which could perform peaceful functions like repair other man-made objects in space or simply attack them, as well. Between 2013 and 2015, Russia launched three odd craft that seemed to fit this description , able to make dramatic movements and effectively follow other satellites. They went dormant for a period, but appeared to “ wake up ” in April 2017. U.S. military officials are finding themselves struggling just to come up with what a war looks like in space to begin with, especially when it might involve top secret orbiting objects. “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists,” Douglas Loverro, then deputy assistant secretary of Defense for space policy, said during a talk in October 2016 . “Probably people are going to die on the ground where nobody’s going to die in space.” “Is jamming an attack? Is a laser an attack? Does it have to be a kinetic hit on a satellite to be an attack?” Loverro continued. “That is not even settled in international law and probably won’t be for a long time.” Whatever the final legal framework is, with a fleet of XS-1s, the Pentagon would be able to replace any lost spacecraft quickly. And there’s always the possibility the U.S. military could modify Phantom Express to go on the offensive itself.

As the service tries to replace the specialized aircraft, which have been especially valuable in fighting ISIS terrorists, formal protests against its plans are mounting. On May 25, 2017, American plane-maker Boeing announced it had lodged a complaint with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a top federal watchdog, over how the Air Force has structured its effort to replace the EC-130H electronic warfare aircraft, nicknamed Compass Call. In March 2017, Canadian aviation firm Bombardier filed a similar notice with the GAO. “The Air Force’s approach is inconsistent with Congress’s direction in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act and seems to ignore inherent and obvious conflicts of interest,” a Boeing spokeswoman said in a statement, according to FlightGlobal. “We believe that the U.S. Air Force and taxpayer would be best served by a fair and open competition, and that the Air Force can still meet its stated timeline of replacing the aging fleet of EC-130Hs within 10 years.” Each $165 million EC-130H is a modified C-130 Hercules cargo plane that carries a suite of electronic attack gear that can find and track “emitters” like radios and radars and then scramble their signals. The four engine aircraft had a cruising speed for approximately 300 miles per hour and can fly almost 2,300 miles without refueling. They are capable of refueling in midair for extended operations.  Since their introduction in 1982, Compass Calls have flown in support of American operations from Europe to the Middle East to North Africa. The EC-130H Compass Call., USAF These aircraft have been especially critical in America’s fight against terrorists around the world. The same gear that blocks military communications can jam cell phones, too. This meant that the aircraft could help stop militants from using that method to remotely set off deadly improvised explosive devices (IED). Between March 2003 and August 2010, Compass Calls flew more than 20,000 hours over Iraq and U.S. commanders credited them with directly preventing militants from detonating at least 100 roadside bombs. Crews have put in more than 40,000 flights hours in over Afghanistan performing similar missions. I was among the first to report on their return to Iraq to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces battling ISIS in December 2015. In January 2016, a public affairs officer with the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing in Kuwait confirmed to me that the aircraft had supported Iraq’s troops as they fought to liberate Ramadi, screwing up terrorist communications and preventing militants from alerting each other or responding quickly to new developments on the battlefield. By the end of the year there was talk that the aircraft had gone into action to knock out ISIS’ growing arsenal of small drones , which it was using to spy on friendly forces, direct artillery fire, and even drop improvised bombs on them.  As of May 2017, the EC-130Hs were still flying regular missions in the country. In February 2015, the Air Force had briefly considered eliminating half of the already small 14-plane fleet in order to free up approximately $300 million for other projects. Congress rejected that proposal and has subsequently mandated the service maintain the EC-130Hs. President Donald Trump’s first proposed defense budget, for the 2018 fiscal year, pointedly includes funding to keep all the aircraft in active inventory. Unfortunately, after more than three decades of active service, the aging planes are in need of replacement sooner rather than later. So, at the core of Boeing’s and Bombardier’s disputes with the Air Force is the service’s plan to speed up this replacement process with as little disruption as possible to operations within the next decade. Firstly, defense contractor L-3, which has a wealth of experience from maintained the EC-130H fleet for years, has received contract to effectively port over the existing Compass Call system into a new aircraft. However, instead of holding a separate competition to select who will get to build this plane, the New York-headquartered firm will be the one choosing the new airframe. The U.S. Army and Air Force have used similar methods to rush surveillance aircraft into combat since the mid-2000s. The contracts for these so-called “quick reaction capabilities” focused more on what particular sensors commanders in the field wanted overhead rather than the plane carrying them. In many cases, the services were perfectly happy to let contractors retain complete ownership of their aircraft and even the mission equipment, arrangements that are still known as “government-owned and contractor operator” and “contractor-owned and contractor operated,” or GOCO and COCO. By 2010, the Army had two different types of aircraft carrying the Constant Hawk electro-optical system in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as three kinds of planes lugging the imagery and signals intelligence equipment associated with the Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS) in both of those countries. But this may be the first time the U.S. military has ever chosen to take this route when buying what will be wholly government-owned system outright. “I can’t give you an example specifically of a contractor picking the aircraft,” Air Force Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the service’s top acquisition official, told Defense One in an interview that described the decision as “unprecedented.” An EC-130H on the ground at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan., USAF Air Force officials insist this is a viable method of doing business that serves its very immediate needs and still gets taxpayers a good deal. Boeing and Bombardier have countered by complaining to GAO that this almost guarantees Gulfstream and its G550 business jet will get the contract for new electronic attack aircraft. Bombardier wants to put its Global 6000 business jet the running. The Air Force already has a variant of Bombardier’s Global Express family, known as the E-11A, in service to carry the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) data relay system. Boeing would like to offer a version of its venerable 737 airliner, a derivative of which is flying with the U.S. Navy as the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane . Multiple foreign air forces fly 737-based airborne early warning aircraft , as well. The G550 and Global 6000 are roughly equivalent aircraft, with very similar dimensions and cruising speeds. Gulfstream says its base aircraft has an unrefueled range of approximately 6,750 miles, 750 miles more than Bombardier’s plane, but that could easily change with the Compass Call systems installed. Boeing’s 737-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) is significantly larger, but still has a range of approximately 6,200 miles. The P-8 variant of the 737 has a range of roughly 4,500 miles. Still, a 737 derivative will have a lower ceiling (by as much as 10,000 feet) than its business jet competitors. Bombardier’s Global 6000., Markus Eigenheer via Wikimedia Since L-3 has not yet had a chance to choose any particular plane, the government watchdog’s opinion was that Bombardier’s protest was “premature,” according to FlightGlobal. It is entirely possible the oversight entity will reach the same conclusion in response to Boeing’s challenge. That’s not to say the concerns aren’t reasonable. L-3 is already working with Gulfstream on Air Force’s separate effort to recapitalize its E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) radar aircraft as part of a Northrop Grumman-led team . Northrop Grumman, which developed the original JSTARS equipment, plans to use the G550 as the host aircraft for its improved system. The company already uses one of the jets as a developmental testbed. A rendering of the basic configuration of Gulfstream’s G550-based range support aircraft for the U.S. Navy., Gulfstream On top of that, the Air Force has already expressed interest in using a variant of Gulfstream’s G550-based Conformal Airborne Early Warning (CAEW) design as the Compass Call replacement. In its fiscal year 2017 budget proposal, the service outlined a plan to buy six electronic attack versions it referred to as EC-37Bs. This dovetailed with the idea of junking half of the EC-130Hs, which would have created a mixed fleet of Compass Call aircraft. At the time, the Air Force suggested this would also be a cost-effective move, as it already had nearly 10 C-37A executive transports, which would share many of the basic aircraft components, such as the engines, and reduce requirements for specialized maintenance and logistics support.  The Navy had just bought a CAEW variant to support test range operations, too. A Boeing 737-based airborne early warning aircraft for the Turkish Air Force., Seattle Aviator via Wikimedia In addition to refusing to approve scrapping any existing EC-130s, Congress also ultimately balked at this idea. As a result, the Air Force refocused its effort and decided to go down the current path of simply handing the final decision on what aircraft to use over to L-3. It is insistent now that this is the best way to proceed. “We made this decision after looking at all the options – laying out pros and cons, looking at a variety of different methods that we thought we could work our way through this,” Lieutenant General Bunch said during his discussion with Defense One. “You can’t really call an aircraft a subcomponent, but in this case, the real technology stuff and everything else is the guts. It’s what’s inside the EC-130 platform and we’re buying something to carry it.” The big question is whether Congress, and any members who might be inclined to be especially supportive of Boeing and Bombardier’s participation in the program, agrees with the Air Force’s assertion. In the meantime, the old EC-130Hs will have to continue jamming terrorists and militants on the front lines. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Update 5/26/2017: The original version of this story used the performance specifications of Boeing’s standard 737-700 airliner for comparison. It is unlikely that the company would offer this variant as a contender for the new Compass Call platform. The piece has been updated with BBJ and P-8 metrics. Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 22, 2019",The U.S. Army Wants to Expand a Secretive Missile Defense Site in Turkey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is looking to expand a secretive missile defense site in Turkey, according to the service’s request for funds in the 2018 fiscal year. The plan comes amid tensions between officials in Washington and Ankara over support for Kurdish rebels fighting ISIS in Syria, as well as cool relations with Russia who have historically criticized America’s missile protection plans in Europe and the Middle East. Posted online on May 23, 2017, the military construction portion of the Army’s budget proposal includes approximately $6.4 million to build out a so-called “forward operating site” at an unspecified location in Turkey. The plan would provide adequate space for approximately 250 American personnel, Turkish forces, and contractors, operating a mobile AN/TPY-2 radar on behalf of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), as well as improve the overall quality of life at the facilities. Separately, the MDA asked for $524 million to support its entire world-wide “radar fleet,” including the TPY-2 in Turkey. “This project is required … for a unit undergoing conversion from a Detachment to a Ballistic Missile Defense Battery,” according to the project description. “The project supports the operations of the AN/TPY-2 radar system, a deployed component of the Missile Defense Agency.” Though the Army doesn’t say where the small base actually is, other publicly available documents point to an obscure facility near Malatya, Turkey, known as “Site K.” The Army, in cooperation with the MDA, first began setting up there in 2013 as part of a NATO missile defense mission known as Operation Atlantic Sentry. Raytheon’s radar is most commonly associated with Lockheed Martin’s Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, but it can operate as an independent surveillance tool. A rare shot of U.S. Army personnel at Site K in 2013., US Army From the request, the existing facilities sound pretty austere and unwelcoming. This is the official overview of the situation: “The location is a previously abandoned radar site on a remote, underdeveloped mountain top. Currently, deteriorating temporary rigid wall structures are being used for the unit’s readiness building. The unit is without warm vehicle storage. The vehicles are exposed to harsh winter conditions, sub-zero temperatures, heavy snowfall and high winds, which persist seven months of the year. Food is stored in refrigerator vans which are nearing the end of their service life. Large quantities of supplies must be temporarily stored in distant locations because the site is inaccessible during the winter months.” So, the Army wants new funds specifically to pay for an upgraded ready building for the missile defenders, an expanded motor pool, an improved power plant, and various storage facilities to support these operations. In addition, the money covers associated improvements to the site’s local defensive perimeter, electric power and gas lines, water and sewage systems, and storm drains. A slide from a 2013 U.S. Office of Defense Cooperation-Turkey briefing noting the radar site near Malatya., DOD Maintaining the site is an important part of MDA’s global posture, which is primarily focused on protecting against potential missile launches from smaller, regional actors such as Iran and North Korea. Site K is one of three known AN/TPY-2 radar positions in the Middle East and Northeast Asia. The other two are in Japan and at a location on top of Israel’s Har Keren known as Site 512. As of May 2017, there was another radar deployed somewhere else in the Middle East. Another unit was assigned to a Army THAAD task force on the island of Guam. Though the exact range of the system isn’t known, Raytheon’s radar may have the ability to track targets more than 1,800 miles away, depending on its position. These positions give MDA the ability to spot missile launches and other activity inside Iran and North Korea. The Pentagon recently set up another one of the radars in South Korea . A map of American military facilities Europe and the Near East as of 2015, showing Sites G, K, and 512., US Army MDA and U.S. Strategic Command, which supports these sites through its Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense (JFCC-IMD), are especially tight-lipped about this network. In December 2014, in response to the author’s Freedom of Information Act request seeking a complete roster of overseas missile defense sites, STRATCOM said it could “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of any remaining sites” beyond Sites G, K, and 512. The command did confirm that MDA was no longer overseeing Site G, a “contingency location” situated near Gaziantep in Turkey. At that time, Army air defense soldiers were operating Patriot missile batteries from that site to guard Turkey against potential Syrian ballistic missile attacks as part of a mission nicknamed Operation Anatolian Protector . This followed reports in December 2012 that the regime in Damascus was firing Scud missiles at rebel positions inside the country. A U.S. Army solider poses with a member of the Turkish Air Force Security Forces at Site K in 2013., US Army Unfortunately, the Army’s plans to continue support for and expand Site K come at a time when relations between Turkey and the United States, both NATO allies, are unusually cold. Ties between the two countries have been increasingly strained over American assistance to Kurdish forces in neighboring Syria. The War Zone has already written extensively on this issue. Officials in Washington see the Syrian Kurds as invaluable partners in the fight against ISIS, while Turkish authorities see them as an extension of domestic terrorists. Both sides might decide to use the facility as a political bargaining chip. It reportedly took more than a year to negotiate the deployment of American personnel to Site K in the first place. Then, in 2015, Turkey publicly criticized the Pentagon’s decision to withdraw the Patriots from Site G. The Army’s troops never fired a shot in anger against an incoming Syrian missile during the multi-year deployment. Spanish air defense units ultimately took over the mission . However, the United States is unlikely to be interested in giving up the capability at Site K. During visits to Saudi Arabia and Israel in May 2017, President Donald Trump and other members of his administration repeatedly criticized Iran. Earlier in the month, the U.S. government expanded sanctions on the regime in Tehran over its missile programs , which American officials say could eventually produce an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. Syria’s Scuds remain a threat, too. In March 2017, the government in Damascus threatened to unleash a barrage of the missiles at Israel if it did not halt air strikes on Syrian territory targeting arms shipments reportedly bound for Hezbollah terrorists. To the best of our knowledge, without the radar in Turkey, Site 512 in Israel would be alone in watching both Iran and Syria from the ground. U.S. Army personnel fire a THAAD interceptor during a test., Lockheed Martin And with the relationship between the governments in Moscow and Ankara thawing over increasingly shared interests in Syria, Russia could also seek to pressure Turkey over the site. The Kremlin has repeatedly criticized American and NATO missile defenses as a threat to its nuclear deterrent. While there are no anti-ballistic missile weapons based at Site K, the powerful AN/TPY-2 is problem enough for officials in Moscow. Though ostensibly pointed at Iran, it could also let American forces keep an eye on Russia’s southern flank. Chinese officials have similarly complained about the new radar site in South Korea. An enlarged, more permanent base at Site K would open up the possibility to deploy actual THAAD interceptors. One wonders why else it would otherwise be necessary to not only improve the facilities on the mountain top, but also expand them to accommodate an entire battery’s worth of personnel. At the moment, the actual climate appears to be more pressing than the political climate. Whatever happens to the facility in the end, hopefully the personnel near Malatya will at least keep warm in the meantime.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019",Trump Lets Slip That American Subs May Be Ready to Attack North Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States may have two nuclear submarines positioned near North Korea, able to strike at the reclusive regime if necessary. These details emerged thanks to a confidential transcript of a phone call between President Donald Trump and his counterpart in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte. The document raises additional questions about Trump’s handling of sensitive information, as well as the possibility of a potential strike against Pyongyang’s military or government. On April 29, 2017, Trump called Duterte ostensibly to commend the Philippine president on his violent and controversial war on drugs, in which police have killed thousands of Filipinos, mostly addicts and small-time dealers. The freewheeling discussion quickly turned to other topics, including North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. “He [Kim Jong Un] is playing with his bombs, his toys and from the looks of it, his mind is not working well and he might just go crazy one moment,” Duterte says at one point near the end of his chat with the American president. “We have a lot of firepower there,” Trump responds, apparently unprompted. “We have two submarines – the best in the world – we have two nuclear submarines – not that we want to use them at all,” he continues, according to the transcription. “I’ve never seen anything like they are but we don’t have to use this but he could be crazy so we will see what happens.” Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs Anonymous sources leaked the transcript, an official Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs document that is marked confidential and has a security cover sheet, to various news outlets on May 23, 2017, according to The New York Times . Additional unnamed individuals confirmed its contents as “an accurate representation of the call.” The Intercept subsequently posted a complete copy of the document online. Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs Though the conversation occurred in private, the comments are in line with the Trump administration’s increasingly stern rhetoric with regards to increasingly worrisome North Korean provocations. Since January 2017, the regime in Pyongyang has conducted nearly a dozen ballistic missile tests – including firing significantly more advanced and heretofore unseen types than in previous years – and made apparent preparations for sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of existing international condemnation and sanctions. Since the beginning of April 2017, North Korea has averaged almost one missile launch every week. The “era of strategic patience is over,” Vice President Mike Pence said on April 17, 2017, while making a surprise visit to the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea. “We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.” North Korean forces launch a KN-15 missile in May 2017., KCNA But it should go without saying that U.S. officials disclosing even the relative position of U.S. Navy submarines, regardless of the circumstances and the parties involved, is highly unorthodox at best. America’s submarines are nicknamed the “silent service” for a reason. Their ability to operate all over the world, performing missions ranging from routine patrolling to intelligence gathering, all without giving away their location is their greatest strength. This ability to quietly move into a particular area and potentially strike without warning makes them a very credible deterrent threat. The transcript immediately sparked criticism and concern about the president’s attitude toward discussing sensitive information. Trump had already provoked outrage among politicians and pundits by apparently disclosing top secret intelligence from an Israeli source during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russia’s ambassador to the United States Sergey Kisylak. In an attempt to push back against those reports, in a joint press conference with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump insisted he hadn’t specifically mentioned Israel during the incident. This admission only seemed to confirm that he had discussed the highly sensitive source of information with the Russian officials. North Korean premier Kim Jong Un laughs while observing the test of a KN-15 missile in May 2017., KCNA And this isn’t the first time Trump has drawn flak of for his open discussion of military matters by talking about the presence of submarines in the region. In April 2017, he mentioned them specifically as part of a force the United States was sending in a show of force to North Korea during an interview with FOX Business Network reporter Maria Bartiromo. “We are sending an armada, very powerful,” the president. “We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier.” The carrier in question was the USS Carl Vinson , whose precise location became a news story in its own right after a series of confusing statements from the Trump Administration and the Navy about where it was headed and when. The submarine issue got lost amid those reports. Now there is a concern that their presence in the area is yet another indicator the Trump administration is still actively considering a military strike on North Korea. To be fair, Trump did not appear to tell Duterte exactly where the submarines were, what type of boats they were, or exactly what sort of weaponry they had on board. Based on publicly available information, we can’t say for sure what subs he was talking about or if they are still in the vicinity of North Korea nearly a month later. Reconnaissance Marines prepare to depart USS Michigan during a training exercise off Guam in 2015., USN One was almost certainly the USS Michigan , an Ohio -class missile submarine, which arrived in South Korea’s port city of Busan on April 25, 2017. The Navy described this stop as “a routine visit during a regularly scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific.” This isn’t the first time the sub has made a stopover in South Korea. In addition, though the majority of the Ohios carry 24 Trident II nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, Michigan is one of four converted to only fire conventional Tomahawks instead. These boats carry a massive load of 154 of the land attack cruise missiles. On top of that, Michigan is on the Ohio-class vessels to carry the Dry Deck Shelter, which allows it to deploy special operations forces and their swimmer delivery vehicle mini-subs. The other submarines might be a Los Angeles -class attack boat, which routinely accompany carrier groups, such as the one escorting the Carl Vinson . The vessels also conduct independent patrols and the Navy’s Commander, Submarine Group Seven oversees the activities of four Los Angeles- class attack subs in the Western Pacific from Apra Harbor on the island of Guam. Though their primary job is to attack enemy ships, each Los Angeles can fire Tomhawks. Early boats could launch the missiles horizontally through their torpedo tubes, but more recent members of the class have a dozen vertical launch cells that can accommodate either the cruise missiles or Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The Los Angeles-class submarine USS Sante Fe shows off her vertical launch system., USN All of this would seem to imply the U.S. military is prepared for a very limited strike against North Korean nuclear or missile facilities, akin to the American strike on Syria’s Shayrat air base in April 2017. In that case, the Trump administration chose to employ Tomahawks, too. At the time, the War Zone took a hard look at the decision to employ cruise missiles in that mission. Unfortunately, Pyongyang employs hardened structures, deep caves, and similarly difficult to reach sites in order to protect its most sensitive military assets. It seems unlikely the Tomahawk would be a good choice for attacking those nuclear and missile sites. Launched in close proximity, the missiles could be useful for time-sensitive strikes, driven by information from Washington’s massive intelligence infrastructure spying on North Korea , to hit Pyongyang’s missile forces while they’re still moving into position and preparing to fire. This would work best against the country’s liquid fueled missiles, which take significantly longer to get ready to launch than solid-fuel types. However, during his phone call, Trump seemed to bring up the possibility of a nuclear attack on North Korea. “We can’t let a madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that,” he told Duterte. “We have a lot of firepower, more than he has, times 20 but we don’t want to use it.” The Navy does keep a number of Trident-equipped Ohios on “hard alert, in their patrol areas, awaiting orders for launch,” Stephen Schwartz, an expert on nuclear proliferation issues and editor of Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Since 1940 , told Business Insider . “We don’t even know where they are – they run silent.” Still, since the Trident II has a range of more than 7,000 miles, an Ohio -class boat wouldn’t need to be very close to the Korean Peninsula in order to be in a position to attack targets in North Korea. Based on heavily redacted copies of the Pentagon’s actual nuclear war plans that we obtained the Freedom of Information Act, the War Zone has already published a particularly detailed look about what would go into an American nuclear attack on North Korea and how any U.S. administration might arrive at that decision. But “Trump has a disturbing tendency to talk very cavalierly about nuclear weapons — as if he is an impulse away from using them,” Joe Cirincione, an expert on nuclear weapons and head of the Ploughshares Fund, which advocates for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, told The Intercept . “He doesn’t seem to understand the vast destructive nature of these weapons and the line he would be crossing by using them.” Another one of the four Ohio -class guided-missile submarines, the USS Georgia ., USN Regardless of his actual intent, as in the past, Trump’s statements are only likely to fuel the North Korean government’s victim complex and its paranoia about American attacks, which it routinely says are imminent and the reason for its nuclear weapons program, as well as lending weight to its domestic propaganda – something we’ve already warned about here at The War Zone. North Korea’s state-run media arms already published threats to sink the Michigan and the Vinson in April 2017. So far, the presence of any American submarines in the area has so far not deterred Kim Jong Un. Since the beginning of May 2017, North Korea has already tested two more ballistic missiles, including the off-road mobile and potentially nuclear-capable Pukguksong-2 , also known as the KN-15. It is possible that the Trump administration may feel increasingly compelled to strike, whether or not subs are ultimately involved.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 8, 2019","Trump’s Budget Would Keep the A-10 Warthog Flying, at Least For Now","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the latest development in the ongoing saga of the A-10 Warthog , President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for the 2018 fiscal year keeps the iconic attack aircraft going for the foreseeable future, at least in theory. Unfortunately, the Pentagon’s wording makes it very clear that it will still defer to the U.S. Air Force on the fleet’s ultimate fate. Released on May 23, 2017, the Pentagon’s overview of the proposal makes it clear that the budget they want will adequately fund the entire existing fleet of A-10s. At that time, there were just over 280 Warthogs across both the active and reserve components. “The Air Force’s FY2018 budget request continues our emphasis on our readiness recovery, fills critical gaps, and improves lethality,” the service said in its own statement . “Sufficient funding, stable budgets, and flexibility will allow us to maintain the balance necessary to support today’s readiness and capabilities needed in the future.” The inclusion of full funding for the A-10 is notable because the aircraft’s future was very much in doubt in 2016. The Air Force has had an at best complicated relationship with the blunt-nosed plane since the first examples entered service in the 1970s. In the face of budget caps and cuts mandated in the 2011 Budget Control Act, the service has repeatedly sought to retire all of the Warthogs ostensibly to free up funding for other more advanced aircraft, namely the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . USAF This has, in turn, drawn the ire of the A-10’s supporters in Congress and the Air Force appeared to be changing direction by October 2016. “They have re-geared up, we’ve turned on the depot line, we’re building it back up in capacity and supply chain,” Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, head of Air Force Materiel Command, told Aviation Week at the time when asked about the support infrastructure for the Warthogs. “Our command, anyway, is approaching this as another airplane that we are sustaining indefinitely.” However, as The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway noted at the time , it appeared Pawlikowski was simply hedging her command’s bets that the Air Force would fail once again in the face of Congressional backlash to send the A-10s to the Bone Yard for good. There was no indication that the service wasn’t still hoping to move ahead with its plans to slowly phase out the aircraft. On the face of things, the Pentagon’s latest budget proposal seems to settle the argument and preserve the A-10s, which continue to prove themselves extremely valuable in combat in Iraq and Syria, as well as other deterrence missions elsewhere. Unfortunately, reading between the lines, it’s not clear how much the budget proposal actually changes things. “Fleet strategy and viability will be assessed as the Air Force determines a long term strategy,” the Pentagon’s overview report clearly states. “We still had to make tough choices in balancing capability, capacity, and readiness while focusing on modernizing weapons systems and infrastructure,” the Air Force said about its own budget planning. USAF Even if the Trump’s budget passes in its current form, which is extremely unlikely , Air Force officials would be able to argue for shifting any funding set aside for the A-10s for other projects it feels they are more important. Beyond the A-10, there are other aircraft also in desperate need of upgrades and overhaul . Of course, Congress would need to approve any such decision. More importantly, the question remains of just how the Air Force plans to deal with the larger looming issue of simply becoming unable to pay for its existing aircraft along with expensive new purchases such as the F-35 and the KC-46A tanker. Air Force officials repeatedly insist there just isn’t any money for any new aircraft . In May 2016, it became clear that the service wouldn’t be able to maintain its fighter fleet as a whole by 2021 without a massive injection of new funds. USAF And that may be the bigger issue. Trump’s defense spending proposal for the 2018 fiscal year is not dramatically different from the outlays President Barack Obama and his administration envisioned for the coming years. The Trump administration has cited an increase in defense spending of more than $50 billion over Obama’s proposal for the 2017 fiscal cycle. However, the president’s new baseline defense budget is actually only approximately $18 billion more than what the previous administration already estimated would be necessary in the next fiscal year. With this in mind, you can expect to see us look deeper into the actual budget proposal as a whole, as well as reactions in Congress and any plans to fundamentally change the final funding amounts for various systems.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 15, 2018",Regular U.S. Troops Are Getting Close Enough to ISIS to Fire Mortars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since the U.S. military began its campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, American troops, primarily special operators , have been creeping closer to the front lines and toward increasingly active combat. A new, official video provides measurable clues about just how close conventional forces now are to enemy in the fight to finally eject the terrorists from their de facto capital in Iraq, Mosul. On May 19, 2017, the U.S. Army’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division published another in a set of videos of its soldiers supporting Iraqi security forces (ISF) in and around Mosul. Unlike the other footage – which showed paratroopers flying in to a helicopter landing zone on UH-60 Black Hawks, driving and walking through liberated streets inside the city, delivering ammunition, and training Iraqi police snipers – this particular clip followed a mortar section providing relatively close-range fire support. Other images show the mortars in action in or near Mosul as early as March, 14, 2017. The brigade “enables their ISF partners through the advise and assist mission, contributing planning, intelligence collection and analysis, force protection, and precision fires to achieve the military defeat of ISIS,” the official caption states. “Precision” in this case would be relative to the gunner’s skill, as no guided mortar rounds, though they exist, are visible. It is also not clear whether the troops have GPS-assisted targeting equipment or electronic ballistic computers. They appear to do the initial sighting-in and adjustments manually. The team from the 82nd Airborne fires or prepared to fire both the 81mm M252 and the 120mm M120 mortars in the video. The M252 has a maximum range of almost three and a half miles, but can also hit targets less than 300 feet away. The significantly larger M120 can toss shells nearly four and half miles away while still able to hit the enemy at ranges just over 650 feet. However, these ranges are entirely dependent on what type of ammunition the troops are firing, how many propelling charges they’re using, and the angle at which they position the weapon. Though we don’t know the exact inclination of the M120 when the soldiers shoot it in the video, we can see that they’re using M934 or M934A1 high-explosive rounds and stripping off all but one charge from the shell before sending it on its way. Both the M934 and the improved M934A1 weigh just over 31 pounds and are nearly 28 inches long. The M929 smoke round – which we have found more detailed firing table information for – is identical in weight and less than two tenths of an inch shorter due to the different nose fuze. With only one charge, the maximum range of the M929 drops to just over one and a half miles. Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division prepare to fire an 81mm mortar in or around Mosul in March 2017., US Army What this means is that, most likely, these soldiers from the 82nd Airborne were within that range of their enemy. The top American command leading the coalition campaign against ISIS, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), appeared to confirm the close-in and less precise nature of the mortars. “CJTF-OIR considers mortars an area weapons system used for protection of Coalition forces and for suppression of enemy forces,” the task force’s media office told The War Zone in an Email. While the U.S. military has employed artillery in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIS before, it had done so at appreciable distances thanks to 155mm howitzers and 227mm rocket artillery systems . Both of these weapons have the ability to attack targets with GPS-guided rounds dozens of miles away. In the past, in what some might see as a tacit acknowledgement of the frequency of these fire missions, CJTF-OIR noted it did not count artillery support for Iraqi “maneuver” operations as a “strike” and therefore does not track how often it occurs or how much ammunition American forces have expended in this role. It has since removed this caveat from the daily press releases cataloging air and artillery attacks against ISIS. But the same disclaimer still applies to the 82nd’s mortar teams. “The Coalition does not have statistics on mortar rounds fired, how often used, or other details,” the command’s media officer wrote. This only continues to highlight the obtuse nature of the American advisory mission in Iraq and Syria, as well as how the Pentagon defines combat, which I have covered extensively in the past. The issue is particularly important in light of President Donald Trump and his administration’s increasing willingness to send both special operators and conventional troops on risky missions throughout the Middle East and beyond. Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division fire an 120mm mortar round toward Mosul in March 2017., US Army At the end of March 2017, we at The War Zone looked closely at how this policy shift had already begun to change the face of American involvement in the Mosul offensive specifically. This became even more apparent when a roadside bomb killed one of the 82nd’s paratroopers, 1st Lieutenant Weston Lee, near Mosul on April 29, 2017. Lee was the first U.S. military to die in Iraq after Trump’s inauguration. According to the Pentagon, the officer was pulling security while on an advise and assist mission at the time. However, the official press release noted that the “incident is under investigation,” suggesting the exact nature of events might not have been immediately clear. What is obvious is that regular American personnel, in addition to special operations forces , are inching closer to the actual fighting, and therefore increasing danger, in Mosul. As of May 2017, Iraqi forces were in the midst of their final push to oust ISIS from the city completely. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrive near Mosul in February 2017., US Army The last battles are going to be “extremely violent” for Iraqi troops, Army Colonel Patrick Work, head of the 82nd’s Airborne’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, told The Washington Post in May 2017 . “The hardest days are still in front of them.” From what we can tell, a number of the brigade’s soldiers will be very close to this intense battle, actively providing fire support to uproot the last remaining terrorists.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 24, 2019",Venezuela’s Shoulder-Fired Missiles At Risk Of Ending Up On The Black Market,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As political and humanitarian crises in Venezuela continue to grow , observers are increasingly worried about the stability of the country’s institutions, including the military. If the government in Caracas were to collapse without a clear transition plan in place, it could throw the country’s armed forces into disarray and potentially create a dangerous space where sensitive weapons, such as shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles (SAM), end up on the black market. At a public hearing on May 11, 2017, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Mike Pompeo told Senators that he was worried about advanced weapons slipping out of Venezuela during the crisis. He specifically mentioned the advanced Russian-made 9K338 Igla-S man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), also known as the SA-24. This latest version of the Igla family and among the most advanced such weapons available on the market today. “It is a real threat,” he declared. “[But] we have not seen any of those major arms transfers take place, we don’t have any evidence that those have taken place to date.” Compared to older variants, the Igla-S has a longer range and a significantly larger warhead. Its maximum range of 20,000 feet is more than 5,000 greater than that of the iconic American FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS. The exact speed of the S model is not publicly available, but one would imagine the designers would not have wanted it to be slower than the average speed of earlier types, which was approximately 1,300 miles per hour. The Stinger’s average flight speed is 1,600 miles per hour. The Igla-S missile and its launch tube., Vitaly Kuzmin More importantly, the S variant has a dramatically improved infrared seeker head with advanced proportional navigation, making it less likely that flares and other countermeasures will distract the missile, according to one U.S. Army manual . This sensitive guidance system is said to have a significantly greater probability of intercepting the target, as well as a better chance to hit a vital area in the process, compared to earlier versions and analogous weapons. These attributes make them a realistic threat to even the most recent 4th generation Western fighter jets – and that was one of the reasons Venezuela bought them in the first place. After first being elected president of Venezuela in 1999, firebrand leader Hugo Chavez quickly drew the ire of the United States with his open endorsement of socialist and leftist governments and apparent support for leftist guerrilla movements such as the FARC in Colombia. Though they denied any involvement, American officials openly endorsed a brief coup attempt in 2002. So, between 2005 and 2008, specifically citing the need to defend against an American invasion, the Venezuela government went on an arms shopping spree. Thanks to billions of dollars in low-interest loans from the Russian government, by 2013, Venezuela had obtained a formidable arsenal of T-72 tanks, Msta-S self-propelled howitzers, Su-30 Flanker fighter jets, S-300 and Tor-M1 mobile SAMs, and the Iglas, among other items. On May 22, 2017, Reuters reported that it had obtained a Venezuela military record that showed country had a total inventory of approximately 5,000 Igla-S missiles. “I have no doubt that the Americans want to come here in search of oil and we must be ready to face them,” Venezuela General Jesus Gonzalez reportedly told Mexican media in 2008. “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, AP The problem is that Venezuela seems to be edging toward a war of its own. In 2013, Vice President Nicolás Maduro took power after Chavez died of cancer. Maduro sought to both continue his predecessor’s “revolution” and consolidate his own power. Since then, however, the country has suffered historic shortages of even the most basic goods, leading to increasing dissatisfaction with the ruling party. In March 2017, protesters took to the streets to demand new elections. Maduro has repeatedly dismissed civil unrest against his administration as an attempted coup and the work of American agents seeking to overthrow him. In an increasingly chaotic situation, where there have been reports that security forces have in some cases joined protesters, there is the distinct possibility that less scrupulous individuals could sell or steal weapons from government stockpiles. While it might be hard for anyone to smuggle out tanks or fighter jets, small arms and light weapons are much easier to pilfer. A girl poses with Venezuelan troops during a parade in 2016 while holding a MANPADS., AP And 5,000 Igla-S missiles on the open market would definitely be a serious concern. Relatively simple to use, these shoulder-fired missiles would be a prize acquisition for terrorists and criminals around the world. There are already decades of experience of how effective these weapons can be, even in the hands of insurgents with limited training. The most notable example was American deliveries of Stingers to Afghan fighters battling the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1970s and 80s. Shoulder-launched missiles have only spread further around the world since then, becoming an increasing threat to both military and commercial aviation . MANPADS have been a notable feature of the fighting in Iraq and Syria, though they haven’t been responsible for a significant number of downed aircraft. By and large, the weapons involved have been older and significantly less capable Russian and Chinese missiles, including earlier Igla types, which are more easily fooled by infrared countermeasures common on most western military aircraft . Critics of the regime of Bashar Al Assad Damascus have repeatedly floated the idea of sending the weapons to rebel groups to help fend off air attacks and level the battlefield equation that has tilted Assad’s way dramatically since Russian air power intervened in the conflict over a year and a half ago.  Of course, Russian planes and helicopters have countermeasures, too , which probably explains why they’ve been so resistant to attacks so far. “Proliferation aside, these infrared-guided shoulder-launched weapons are essentially low-altitude weapons that are difficult to employ and relatively easy to defeat,” U.S. Air Force veteran Michael Pietrucha, who served as an irregular warfare operations officer, argued in a piece for War on the Rocks . “In the tens of thousands of sorties flown in the last two decades by U.S. and NATO aircraft in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan, only four fixed-wing combat aircraft have been hit (and two downed) by MANPADS. None of the losses was an American aircraft.” Of course this doesn’t take into account losses where MANPADS may have been responsible, not to mention many other mission kills that have occurred when aircraft have been damaged severely by MANPADS, and that’s not to say the older designs aren’t dangerous under the right circumstances. Rebels in Syria have claimed to have shot down numerous jets and helicopters, with at least some of those reports turning out to be true. In Iraq, ISIS terrorists have knocked down a number of Iraqi fixed-wing attack aircraft and choppers. The situation became so worrisome that in 2015, the U.S. Special Operations Command issued an urgent request to upgrade 11 unspecified aircraft with additional defensive equipment against shoulder-fired missiles. The author obtained a heavily redacted copy of this document via the Freedom of Information Act. “The … threat environment has changed significantly in recent years,” Matt Schroeder, a senior researcher at Small Arms Survey and expert in the proliferation MANPADS, told the author in 2016. “There has been a sharp uptick in sightings of illicit missiles in many countries, including recent generation systems not previously seen outside of government control.” But, thankfully, the SA-24 has thankfully remained largely off the battlefield, at least so far. After rebels ousted and executed long-time Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, there was a concern that militants and terrorists would get their hands on that country’s stores of shoulder-fired missiles, including SA-24s. Journalists and researchers subsequently determined that the only Igla-S missiles Libyan forces had were for vehicle-mounted Strelets launchers and could not work with the shoulder-stock and grip assembly associated with the MANPADS version. Differentiating the various Igla variants is a complex task. Apparent Libyan missiles did later turn up in Lebanon, according to Small Arms Survey , but again these were for the Strelets system. A Venezuelan soldier practices how to use a MANPADS in a simulator. The US has an even more elaborate, sci-fi like Stinger trainer system. , AP In 2012, a Syrian rebel posed with what appeared to be an SA-24, likely captured from government forces. “As far as I know, this is the first SA-24 MANPADS ever photographed outside of state control,” Schroeder, then working for the Federation of American Scientists, told The New York Times at the time. By 2014, Schroeder had found evidence of eight different types of missiles in the hands of rebels in Syria, but evidence of only a very small number shoulder-launched Igla-S. In 2015, observers spotted SA-24s in Ukraine’s breakaway Donetsk region. However, the operators seemed to be largely Russian “volunteers,” leaving the weapons under the oversight of Moscow’s troops, rather than in the hands of Kremlin-backed separatists. But the fighting in eastern Ukraine had already involved significant numbers of MANPADS . Rebel troops and their Russian partners scored a number of kills in 2014 alone with shoulder launched SAMs, including downing a number of Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters and an An-30 surveillance aircraft. The pro-Russian separatists also claimed to have shot down other planes and choppers, including an Su-25 Frogfoot ground attacker and an Il-76 transport. Unfortunately, any significant losses of SA-24s from Venezuela stocks could lead to an explosion of these improved missiles on the international black market. Whatever happens to the government in Caracas, the country’s security forces hopefully stay professional and maintain control over their arsenals.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 22, 2019",Saudi Arabia’s Naval Capabilities Will Balloon Thanks To Huge U.S. Arms Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump will unveil the largest single American weapons sale to Saudi Arabia to date during his trip to the kingdom, which began on May 19, 2017. The deal will include weapons and equipment for the Royal Saudi air and land forces, which have been critical in Riyadh’s intervention in Yemen, as well as ballistic missile defense systems essential to for the country to counter Iran’s missile forces during a conflict. However, it may be new support for the relatively small Royal Saudi Navy that speaks more to the country’s desire to project even greater power in the Middle East and beyond. On May 18, 2017, The New York Times published an insider’s look into how White House advisor Jared Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law, had been actively involved in the arms sales, which many expect will be worth between $100 and $110 billion in immediate deals and up to $350 billion in total over the next decade. In particular, Kushner had personally intervened, as is the style of the Trump administration, to get the Saudis a discount on components of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system – the same weapon the United States had very publicly deployed to South Korea earlier in 2017. Also on May 18, 2017, Bloomberg confirmed that the Pentagon and their Saudi counterparts would finalize a $6 billion deal with Lockheed Martin for four modified versions of the company’s Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship – six percent of the total U.S. arms package. The rest of the deal will include thousands of precision guided munitions, 50 CH-47 cargo helicopters, 60 smaller UH-60 transport choppers, 115 M1A2S Abrams tanks, among other items. But buried among the palace intrigue and talk of advanced aircraft, precision guided munitions, and anti-ballistic missile defenses, was mention of unspecified “maritime assets” that the Saudi Arabia hoped to acquire from the United States. This would mean “ships” the authors explained, “so the Saudis can assume more of the burden of policing the Persian Gulf and Red Sea against Iranian aggression.” The warships are the center-piece of the American-funded Saudi Naval Enhancement Program II (SNEP II), which began in 2008. The United States, and the U.S. Navy in particular, supported supported the first SNEP in the 1980s, where the Saudi Arabia purchased a large fleet of modern naval vessels, ranging from frigates to small patrol boats, from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and other countries. After this modernization project, Riyadh boasted the largest and best equipped naval force in the Persian Gulf region. The Al Makkah , one of Saudi Arabia’s four Al Riyadh -class frigates., Jacques Lahitte via Wikimedia These ships formed the core of the country’s naval forces more or less as they continued to exist three decades later. The Saudi Navy’s only addition since then was its purchase of four modified French La Fayette -class frigates, which it named the Al Riyadh class, in 2003. As of 2017, these nearly 15 year-old ships were the country’s most modern warships. These 4,650-ton vessels have launchers for Exocet anti-ship and Aster 15 surface-to-air missiles, along with four torpedo tubes, a helicopter and a 76mm main gun. The design has limited stealthy features to help make it less visible to enemy radars. But what was state-of-the-art more than two decades ago is showing its age now. From the very beginning, SNEP II called for four all-new “frigate-like” surface combatants, with a displacement of approximately 3,500 tons. These would replace an equal number of older French-supplied Al Madinah -class ships that the Saudi Navy had received under the original SNEP. This portion of the program also proved to be especially troublesome. A standard Freedom-variant LCS, USN The initial requirements seemed relatively steep, with officials in Riyadh interested in a lightweight vessel that still had a radar and battle management capability similar to Lockheed Martin’s advanced Aegis system, including its powerful AN/SPY-1 passive electronically scanned array . In reality, “Aegis-like” really meant that it would have technology derived from that equipment. Instead of the full-size SPY-1D radar, the new ships would have the SPY-1F variant specifically for frigates and corvettes, which had half the range of the standard unit. The COMBATSS-21, which included some components of the Aegis system, would link the radar to the ship’s other sensors and weapons. Lockheed Martin produced both of these products. So, U.S. officials and company representatives proposed installing this equipment, along with a 16-cell Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS), deck-mounted Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers, and SeaRAM close-defense systems, on a modified version of the firm’s Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The resulting warship became known as the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC). In October 2015, the Saudis agreed to buy the ships. While at Foxtrot Alpha, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway wrote a deep dive into the precise capabilities of these planned ships. The primary weapon for the ship’s Mk 41 VLS would be RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, “quad-packed” four to each of the 16 launch cells, for area air defense against both aircraft and cruise missiles. The latest version of the SM-2 was another potential option, which would offer even longer range, but less plentiful, anti-air and even anti-surface capabilities. A model of a the Freedom-variant frigate Lockheed Martin has offered to the U.S. Navy, similar to the proposed MMSC., Joseph Trevithick Unfortunately, according to a report by Defense News three months later, the Saudi Navy had become horrified at the expected price tag, which unnamed sources said was between $750 million and $1 billion per ship. In addition, Lockheed Martin told the Saudis it would take up to seven years to deliver the first example. By that point, SNEP had been running for nearly a decade and the officials in Riyadh had already moved ahead with a separate $1.9 billion deal to buy 10 MH-60R helicopters and associated weapons and equipment, another part of the SNEP II plan. It seems impressive that the Saudis have been willing to pay even more in the end for the ships, suggesting they may come with new and improved capabilities over the original design proposal, or it could just be a symptom of the changing political winds in Washington. The Saudi’s purchase of the ships will be important for the U.S. Navy, since the they will likely fund development of a drastically upgraded LCS variant—one that includes area air defense capabilities—that many, including some members of Congress, have been pushing the Navy towards procuring instead of a far less capable “up gunned” Littoral Combat Ship concept . Sharing the burden with the Saudis in crafting the new configuration would not only offset development costs, but if the Navy were to also buy the ship, it would push the unit cost down overall. Otherwise, Much of the rest of the Saudi naval modernization program has already been sorted out or is otherwise already in progress. In July 2013, the Pentagon alerted Congress about a potential sale of 30 Mark V offshore patrol vessels , each armed with a single 27mm cannon and various smaller weapons, as well as associated spare parts, training support, and other items. That whole package was worth approximately $1.2 billion. Venezuela’s Avante 2200 corvette Guaiquerí ., barracuda via Wikimedia In January 2016, Spanish shipyard Navantia said it was working with the Saudis to develop a version of its Avante 2200 corvette . These ships, which also have limited stealth characteristics, would meet Riyadh’s requirement for six 2,200-ton ships. At the time, only Venezuela operated a variant of this ship, the Guaiquerí -class , which had a 76mm gun, a 35mm automatic cannon, and two .50 caliber machine guns. These vessels also had radar, electro-optical sensors, and electronic warfare equipment. A helipad at the rear could accommodate a helicopter such as the MH-60R, another thing Saudi Arabia was looking to purchase through SNEP II. However, it is unlikely the United States would offer to pay for the purchase of a foreign vessel. Other elements of SNEP II included three maritime patrol aircraft and anywhere from 30 to 50 unmanned surveillance aircraft. The Pentagon might be keen to try and sell the Saudis on Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon , which they have already expressed an interest in previously. Insitu’s ScanEagle or RQ-21 Blackjack drones, both of which the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have actively used aboard ships and on land, would be good options for the sort of drone officials in Riyadh seem to be looking to buy. In 2016, through other foreign military sales contracts, Riyadh had secured support to expand boat ramps and piers to make room for SNEP II ships at King Abdul-Aziz Naval Base in Jubail along the Persian Gulf. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers managed construction contracts for other facilities ashore, including a new headquarters for the Saudi naval special operations elements. Two years earlier, the U.S. Navy had begun farming out work to expand the Saudi Navy’s command and control communications network. In the 1990s, the U.S. military had helped the Saudis migrate over to the Global Command and Control System-Maritime, which improved their ability to coordinate with American naval forces. It is possible that the 2017 military assistance plan will include more funding for construction and other support projects. An aerial view of King Abdul-Aziz Naval Base in 1990., DOD Regardless, Saudi Arabia is likely to have decided it couldn’t afford to wait much longer to get the ships into production. As SNEP II has progressed, the character of the Persian Gulf has changed significantly. More than anything, Saudi Arabia has had increasing tensions with a resurgent Iran while officials in Tehran have made improving and expanding their military a priority to do its best to ward off any challengers. What this means is that Iranian forces now have a significant posture on the other side of the Persian Gulf. In February 2017, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence published a public report on Iran’s naval and coastal defense elements. It included a map highlighting that Iranian land-based anti-ship cruise missile batteries could reach much of Saudi Arabia’s northeastern coastline and had coverage in depth throughout the rest of the strategic waterway. On top of that the Iranian Navy and the country’s parallel Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy had significant numbers of small, missile-armed corvettes and fast attack craft, mine-layers, and semi-submersibles and traditional submarines of various sizes. This increasing threat of smaller or underwater craft overwhelming Saudi Arabia’s aging warships hasn’t gone unnoticed. During the Iran-Iraq, Iranian forces targeted Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers moving Iraqi oil. At the time, the Saudi Navy was still modernizing and could do little to protect the ships, relying instead on American forces to guard the shipments during what became known as the “ Tanker War .” Since 2007, Iran has made repeated threats to close of the narrow Strait of Hormuz, which leads out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Oman and out into the Indian Ocean. Doing so would significantly limit Saudi Arabia’s ability to export oil and related products, which are the country’s lifeblood. Though doing so would touch off an international incident, Iran might be able to do significant damage to regional economies before the crisis ended. Iranian forces fire a Ghader land-based, anti-ship cruise missile., AP In addition, Tehran has made a number of high profile, if often laughable naval sojourns out of the Persian Gulf, seeking to project its power into the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean, going as far south as South Africa in 2016 . If the Saudis decide they want to try and match these expeditionary missions, they’ll definitely want additional, blue-water capable warships. Since 2015, the government in Riyadh has been fighting a complicated and brutal war of attrition against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, which I’ve previously written about in detail . These forces have access to both ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as more unconventional capabilities including unmanned aircraft and boats, as well as home-brewed naval mines . As the Saudis and their allies, have attempted to blockade the flow of weapons and other supplies into Yemen, the dangers have become increasingly visible. In October 2016, a rebel cruise missile destroyed a military vessel from the United Arab Emirates. Afterwards, militants fired more anti-ship missiles at American warships in the area, which they see as aligned with the Saudi-led coalition, though they failed to do any damage. Then, in January 2017, Yemeni militants successfully rammed what appeared to be an unmanned, explosive-filled boat into the Al Madinah , killing two Saudi sailors. For Saudi Arabia, it has to be relatively clear that new naval capabilities are essential to confront what the Pentagon refers to as “anti-access/area-denial” capabilities. Additionally, the Saudis are coming to terms with the reality that they have two strategic shipping choke points to keep open, plus the need to have a stronger, more persistent presence in the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. With this in mind and with so much Saudi treasure having been spent on the Saudi Air Force and Army, as well as the country’s Praetorian Guard-like Saudi Arabian National Guard, it’s the Royal Saudi Navy’s turn to replenish its fleet with fresh U.S. weaponry.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",Russia’s “Counter-Sabotage Vehicle” Guards the Country’s Mobile ICBMs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The basic concept of mobile ballistic missiles is to make the weapons hard for the enemy to track and shield them from pre-emptive strikes. Of course, this doesn’t mean they’re not vulnerable to various kinds of attacks, including from small groups of special operations forces, terrorists, and saboteurs. So, to help guard its RS-24 Yars road-mobile, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Russians developed a unique “counter-sabotage vehicle.” In 2013, Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces received the first prototype of this specially configured 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle, officially known as the 15Ts56M BPDM , or Typhoon-M – not to be confused in any way with the 6×6 Typhoon-K and Typhoon-U mine-resistant trucks or the submarine known in the West as as the Typhoon . Another 14 production vehicles, with what appeared to be far less extensive modifications arrived in 2016, some of which made it into the 2017 Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, 2017. The Typhoon-M “vehicle is designed for radio, optical and infrared surveillance and reconnaissance,” according to a January 2017 news story from the Russian state-owned news agency TASS. The BPDM is “unique owing to its surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, including its unmanned aerial vehicle, enabling it to spot the enemy 5 [kilometers] out.” The BPDM is based on the chassis and hull of the BTR-82, an improved version of the Soviet-era BTR-80 . The standard armored personnel carrier variant weights 16 tons and has a top speed on improved roads of between 50 and 60 miles per hour. One of the BPDM Typhoon-Ms as seen during the 2017 Victory Day parade preparations., Vitaly Kuzmin The full extent of it capabilities is unknown, but each 15Ts56M reportedly has at least one TKN-4S night vision sight and Kredo-1 ground surveillance radar. The TKN-4S is the same unit found in the commander’s position on the T-90 main battle tank, as well as updated T-72 and BTR-70 and -80 armored personnel carriers. Bristling with antennas, it seems likely that at least the prototype BPDM had some type of electronic warfare suite to detect or jam hostile radio communications or electronic attacks. Russia is known to be a major operator of mobile jamming equipment. Crews can link up remote ground sensors to the vehicle, too. A remote turret on the top has a 7.62mm PKTM machine gun for self-defense. However, the most important element of the Typhoon-M system appears to be the ability for the crew to launch and control a small Eleron-3SV surveillance drone. This is where TASS’ claim of a surveillance range of five kilometers, or just a little over three miles, comes from. Manufacturer ENICS claims the tiny pilotless plane actually has a maximum range of over 15 miles while transmitting full-motion video back to its control station. When flying in a power-saving “off-line” mode, it should be able to travel more than 30 miles in total. Operating the drone no more than three miles from the BPDM as a rule would mean it would be able to keep persistent coverage in that limited area for a longer period of time. Personnel must launch the drone from outside the vehicle using a small, portable launch rail. ENICS says it only takes 10 minutes to get things set up and ready to go. In addition to its association with the 15Ts56M, Russian special operations and military intelligence units, as well as Kremlin-backed forces in Ukraine’s breakaway Donetsk region and Syria, have used this drone in combat . When the Typhoon-M entered service, the Russians also bought a dedicated simulator system to train the crews on how to use these various surveillance systems. Personnel assigned to guard the missile units also have practice setting up their equipment around a mock Yars missile position in order to become qualified on the BPDM, according to TASS’ report. https://youtube.com/watch?v=JhxF3Tp4Tos The Soviet Union reportedly developed the initial version of the BPDM, the 15Ts56, based on the BTR-80, in 1990. Apparently in the face of massive budget shortfalls and other turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War, the newly independent Russia put the project on hold, as it did with many other advanced defense programs . Development of the updated 15Ts56M began in 2007. The same year, Russia test fired the first prototype RS-24 missile. Three years later, the 54th Guards Rocket Division put the first Yars ICBMs into service. Russia has come up with some interesting concepts to guard their ICBMs in recent years, including this pop-up turret that is supposed to defend against enemy attacks on missile silos. Additionally, the Typhoon-M wasn’t the only specialized vehicle the Russians tested to protect missile units in the field, either. In 2013, state-owned media agency RIA Novosti – now known as Sputnik – announced that the Strategic Missile Forces were testing a new type of mobile mine-clearing vehicle specifically to give RS-24 units additional freedom of movement during actual combat operations. Based around an unmanned ground vehicle, the design would combine conventional mine-clearing explosives with new “microwave emitters,” the report explained. Vitaly Kuzmin “The vehicle will allow the components of the missile system to breach minefields as well as reduce the threat of individually-placed explosive devices,” according to Russian Colonel Dmitry Yevmenenko said, according to an official Defense Ministry statement. “Russian military experts believe the new vehicle will deal with threats such as minefields set by ‘commando’ teams or artillery submunition rounds and cluster bombs,” the RIA Novosti story added. We don’t know if the Strategic Missile Forces ever bought any of these drones. However, the Typhoon-Ms remain in service, continuing to guard Russia’s mobile nuclear missiles from enemy infiltrators.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",The US Plan to Give Afghanistan a Fleet of Black Hawks Is Deeply Flawed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States is moving ahead with a plan, known as the Afghan Aviation Transition Plan (AATP), to help replace the bulk of the Afghan Air Force’s helicopters with the UH-60 Black Hawk. Unfortunately, while Afghanistan’s military is in dire need of additional choppers, it’s not clear whether provide them with the American-made aircraft is a good choice. In May 2017, both U.S. and Afghan officials confirmed to Military Times that the Pentagon was looking to provide as many as 159 Black Hawks to replace Afghanistan’s existing Russian-made Mi-17V1 and V5 Hip helicopters over the next four to six years. In November 2016, the Pentagon submitted a budget proposal that included a request for funds for the first 53 upgraded UH-60s for Afghanistan. Speaking about the situation broadly, “offensive capability is what will break the stalemate in Afghanistan,” U.S. Army John Nicholson, in charge of all American and coalition forces in Afghanistan, had told American legislators on Feb. 9, 2017. “The key offensive capabilities for the Afghan security forces are their special forces and their Air Force.” Both of these points are true. In March 2017, Reuters reported that Afghanistan’s special operations forces were responsible for approximately 70 percent of the country’s combat operations. And air mobility and close air support has been vital to the operations of both the American-led coalition and Afghan security forces in general, which often have to quickly respond to fleeting militant attacks across a country nearly the size of Texas. A U.S. Army UH-60 in Afghanistan., US Army To compound matters, despite years of foreign investment, Afghanistan’s road infrastructure remains relatively limited, and what does exist can often be treacherous because of the ever present threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). This makes resupply of often remote forward bases by air an important consideration, too. “Making up just less than half of total AAF [Afghan Air Force] aircraft, the Mi-17 is considered the “workhorse” of the AAF,” the Pentagon noted in an annual review of military activities in the country in December 2016. “The AAF is capable of deploying and operating Mi-17s throughout the country.” But as essential as the helicopter have been, there just aren’t enough of them to go around. As of November 2016, Afghanistan’s air arm had 47 Mi-17s to serve a national army of more than 160,000 troops. By comparison, each one of the U.S. Army’s Black Hawk-equipped assault aviation battalions has 30 choppers. And not all of the Afghan Hips are operational. By April 2017, the Afghan Air Force had a 46 Mi-17s in total, of which 18 were not flyable either due to scheduled overhauls or major repairs, according to a quarterly report from the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). On top of that, the United States had hired contractors to help keep them flying because of the heavy wear and tear from near constant sorties. Much of the “heavy maintenance” occurred outside of the country, further reducing the number of available helicopters at any one time. A pair of Afghan Air Force Mi-17V5s., USAF “At the current attrition and flying hour rates, the number of AAF Mi-17s available for 2017 will be significantly diminished,” the Pentagon’s 2016 report continued. “The Mi-17 fleet will become unsustainable by mid-2018, virtually eliminating the AAFs vertical transport and lift capability.” As the U.S. government began working to rebuild Afghanistan’s military in the early 2000s, the Pentagon had been inclined to simply buy more Hips to fill out the AAF and improve its capabilities. Kabul’s existing aviators, many of which had received their training from the Soviet Union, were familiar with the helicopters, which performed well in the country’s “hot-and-high” environment. Rotary wing aircraft in general are sensitive to any changes in the density of the air, such as hot and humid weather and thinning air at high altitudes. Rapid changes can prevent a chopper from getting sufficient lift and lead to catastrophic accidents. Unfortunately, this steadily became an untenable political proposition. American legislators wondered why U.S. military aid was going to foreign companies at all and to Russia in particular. At issue initially was Moscow’s history of supplying weapons to regimes the U.S. government considered hostile to the American interests, such as Iran and Venezuela. Kremlin aid to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad after he began a brutal crackdown of his own people in 2012 only prompted further calls to cancel deals for more Russian helicopters. In July 2013, a group of 80 members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel demanding to know why the Pentagon was still buying Mi-17s through the Kremlin arms broker, Rosoboronexport. “Even as Rosoboronexport was providing weapons to the Syrian regime last year, DOD entered into no-bid contracts to purchase Mi-17 helicopters … from the firm,” their letter noted. Some of the Afghan Air Force’s Mi-17V1s, USAF The matter came to a head when the Kremlin’s forces invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, subsequently becoming significantly involved in their neighbor’s civil conflict. Sanctions effectively halted future weapons deals regardless of their merits. By the end of 2016, the United States had already come to rely on Warsaw Pact members turned NATO allies with previous experience with the Mi-17 – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia – to conduct major repairs on the Afghan Hip fleet. In April 2017, General Nicholson declined to refute reports that Russia was actively supporting Taliban militants in April 2017, suggesting the U.S. government’s position wasn’t likely to change any time soon. The United States hopes to finally alleviate these issues for good by swapping out the Hips for U.S.-made Black Hawks. In theory, the plan makes perfect sense since the Pentagon has easy access to excess UH-60s and no trouble accessing the necessary support systems and supply chains to train Afghan aviators to fly them and keep the aircraft airworthy. It’s not clear if or how the new plan will impact the separate Special Mission Wing, part of the Afghan National Army’s Special Operations Command, which had another 28 Hips on hand as of December 2016, according to the Pentagon. “We are in the midst of an insurgency where the enemy is getting tacit support from neighboring countries,” Ahmad Shah Katawazai, the defense liaison and resident security expert at the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington, D.C., told Military Times. “Our security forces are under immense pressure as they are fighting each day, on several fronts, with more than 20 terrorist organizations.” However, there are immediate concerns about how well the Black Hawks can take over for the Mi-17s in Afghanistan’s rugged environment. The U.S. military has already conceded that the 1980s-era UH-60As destined for the AAF will need new engines. American officials have not specified what powerplants it will install for these modified UH-60A+ helicopters, but they “will be able to perform almost all of the same missions that the current Mi-17 fleet has been conducting in terms of number of people and cargo typically carried,” Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump told Military Times. The most likely choice would be the General Electric T-700-GE-701C, which is found on the U.S. Army’s more recent UH-60Ls and Ms, as well as the up-coming UH-60V . U.S. Army soldiers rappel from a UH-60 in Afghanistan., US Army The bigger issue may be that the Mi-17 and UH-60 are not analogous in general, let alone in how the AAF has been employing them, which could provoke a need for the AAF to completely reorient its doctrine and tactics to suit the new helicopter.  The Hip is a significantly larger and more powerful helicopter at base, able to carry nearly 9,000 pounds of cargo internally depending on the weather and other factors. A large rear door – a ramp or a clamshell design depending on the specific variant – makes it easy for crews to load larger individual items, too. The Black Hawks cabin is much smaller and can only load some 2,600 pounds of cargo through slide doors on the side of the fuselage. And then there are the armament options. While the Black Hawk can carry rockets and missiles on special stub wings, these severely limit the helicopter’s ability to perform as a transport. Of the 159 the United States plans to deliver, nearly 60 will reportedly be in a dedicated gunship configuration . On the other hand, the Russians designed the Mi-17 from the outset as an armed troop carrier, with the necessary power to lug both passengers and weapons on up to six pylons. Both helicopters can mount machine guns at windows along the sides of the main cabin and have other self-defense features like decoy flares. This shouldn’t necessarily matter, since “very few of these aircraft have been outfitted with rockets,” Stump told Military Times. The Mi-17’s “primary role is to perform lift, air assaults and medevac [medical evacuation] missions rather than aerial fires missions.” The official reporting heavily contradicts this claim. Between June 1 and Nov. 30, 2016, rocket- and cannon-armed Mi-17s performed more than 80 percent of all AAF close air support missions in support of Afghan troops, according to the review the Pentagon published the following month. And there’s already evidence of new aircraft prompting significant changes in how the AAF fights and causing disruptions both in its operations and morale as a result. In 2015, reports emerged in domestic and international press outlets that Afghanistan’s fliers were not particularly happy with the new MD 530F gunships , which the United States had supplied in attempt to finally retire the country’s aging, but iconic Mi-35 Hinds and get the Hips back to transporting troops. “This plane [the MD 530F] is a total mess,” AAF Colonel Qalandar Shah Qalandari, the country’s most decorated pilot, told the New York Times in a damning interview in September 2015. “To be honest, I don’t know why we have this plane here.” “It’s unsafe to fly, the engine is too weak, the tail rotor is defective and it’s not armored,” the aviator, who had experience flying Mi-17s and -35s, continued. “If we go down after the enemy we’re going to have enemy return fire, which we can’t survive. If we go up higher, we can’t visually target the enemy.” An Afghan Air Force Mi-35 Hind., USAF The biggest issue was that the MD 530Fs initially arrived only able to carry two gun pods, each with a single .50 caliber machine gun, and no gun sights at all. The United States subsequently delivered 70mm rocket pods and sighting gear for the diminutive helicopters, similar to the AH-6 and MH-6 Little Birds U.S. special operators fly. Still, a pair of rocket or gun pods isn’t a real substitute for the much more extensive weapons loadout on the Hinds and Hips. The Pentagon seemed to realize this, and the Black Hawks are only one part of the AATP, which includes additional MD 530Fs, as well as armed Cessna AC-208 Caravans and A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft. All of these could help relieve the Mi-17s of their important fire support mission, but only if they’re available. Training and logistical concerns could easily render the whole moot. The AAF already lacks enough aircrews for all its aircraft and relied heavily on foreign to keep most of them functional. An Afghan Air Force Mi-17V5 prepares to land at a forward base in the Kunar Valley., USN By the end of 2016, the Pentagon found there were only 36 qualified aircrews for the fleet of 47 Hips. This worked out in a way, since less than 30 of them were operable, but it meant that even if more Mi-17s came online, there wouldn’t be anyone to fly them. Also problematic was that of the 68 pilots who were qualified to fly the choppers as of April 2017, 35 were instructors nominally focused on training new aviators rather than combat operations. This isn’t a new concern. In 2013, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) questioned whether it was prudent to spend hundreds of millions on additional Mi-17s for Special Mission Wing. At the time, even this better staffed specialized aviation unit had more choppers than crews. Even more worrisome, it seems debatable that the force could rapidly integrate an entirely new type of helicopter, and more complicated one at that, without significant assistance – or an upsurge in potentially deadly accidents. In December 2016, Afghan General Mohayedin Ghori, head of the country’s 207th Corps, died when the Hip he was riding in crashed near the town Muri Chaq in Badghis Province. The incident was reportedly the result of poor maintenance. The UH-60 is significantly more complex and maintenance intensive than the Mi-17 and the existing corps of Afghan flight and ground crews have no experience with any version of the aircraft. By comparison, the AAF as an institution has decades of time with the Hips, which could only have benefited existing personnel and new trainees. To fly and repair Black Hawks, the force would need all-new training. In the meantime, contractors would need to continue running things to avoid a dangerous slip in operational capabilities. “Logistical sustainment will make or break the AAF in the long-run,” the Pentagon concluded in another report it published in June 2016. For the new U.S.-supported Afghan aviation plan to truly work, the UH-60s, along with the other additional aircraft, will have to ease those issues without simply creating new problems.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Germany Might Join the F-35 Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The German Air Force is reportedly looking for additional information about Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as it moves ahead with plans to replace its aging Panavia Tornado multi-role combat aircraft no later than 2035. The stealthy F-35 would be just one of multiple options Germany might consider as it looks to modernize its military in general. In May 2017, Germany’s air arm, also known as the Luftwaffe, asked the U.S. military for classified data on the Joint Strike Fighter, according to a report by Reuters . The letter highlighted the fact that German government and military officials had not yet decided on any particular plan to buy new warplanes of any kind. Instead, the country’s Federal Ministry of Defense would “an in-depth evaluation of market available solutions, including the F-35, later this year,” according to the document, which Reuters said it had reviewed. As such, “in order to understand [the] F-35’s cutting-edge technologies, the German Air Force is requesting a classified brief of the F-35’s capabilities in general and especially concerning sensor suites, information management and operational capabilities.” Defense contractor Lockheed Martin already has a dozen international partners signed up to the Joint Strike Fighter program, not including the primary customer, the United States. If Germany ever decided to go ahead and purchase the F-35, they would find themselves in the company of their NATO allies in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. USAF This would be an important consideration for Germany, as it would ease logistical concerns and improve the ability for its aircraft to operate with other members of the alliance. As part of the larger F-35 project, Lockheed Martin is working with the Netherlands and Italy in particular to build significant infrastructure within Europe to support the jets. In October 2015, Dutch authorities announced that they would set up an engine test and maintenance facility , valued at between $90 and $100 million, to service its own future Joint Strike Fighters, as well as aircraft from Italy. Italy itself had previously arranged to operate the only final assembly and checkout facility , or FACO, on the continent. The first Italian F-35A rolled out of the plant in Cameri, Italy, in March 2015. The facility will also finish putting together Italian F-35B and Dutch F-35A aircraft, and could potentially do so for other future European partners. This regional cooperation could become a political consideration, as well. The Tornados that Germany wants to replace came out of an Anglo-German-Italian partnership that began in the 1960s, which led to the country having a significant financial stake in the project and reaping the subsequent benefits of that industrial participation. Germany similarly joined in the development and manufacture of the advanced Eurofighter Typhoon. The country is still the registered location of the multi-national holding companies, Panavia and Eurofighter, associated with both projects. The first F-35A to come out of Italy’s FACO in Cameri., Lockheed Martin Not surprisingly, given that experience, German authorities are considering a future fifth generation fighter jet from Airbus. Germany is also part of this major European aviation consortium, which itself has a stake in Eurofighter. In June 2016, Alberto Gutierrez, then head of the multi-national company’s Eurofighter and combat aircraft programs, told FlightGlobal the plan could include a combination of traditional aircraft and drones, with the pilotless planes acting as the core of this manned-unmanned team. In March 2017, Airbus Defence and Space chief executive Dirk Hoke confirmed the still largely conceptual project, known as the Next Generation Weapons System (NGWS), was still moving ahead, according to German business daily Handelsblatt . “We are currently putting together pre-design studies to show what such an aircraft could look like,” Hoke said. He insisted the future design would include “far-reaching new technical qualities.” At that time, Airbus expected France and Germany to be the two main drivers of the NGWS program. Unfortunately, that could cause potential conflicts in how the project might proceed. German officials want a new aircraft as early as 2025, when they want to start retiring the first of their approximately 85 remaining Tornados. Despite their own aging fleet of Mirage 2000s, French authorities have indicated they are willing to wait until as late as 2040 to have a new fighter jet ready for combat. Bundeswehr For Germany, this time frame may be unacceptable. The Luftwaffe could probably do with replacing its Tornados, an aircraft that went out of production in 1998, now . According to an official report Der Spiegal obtained in 2014, only 66 of the aircraft were actually flyable and the German air arm only had the resources to put 38 of them into combat in or outside of the country. The numbers for the service’s Typhoons weren’t much better, with only 42 of 109 being categorized as “deployable.” The next year, Deutsche Welle obtained a new report that showed the situation had gotten even worse . This led to embarrassing incidents after six Tornados began flying reconnaissance missions from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey targeting ISIS terrorists, which started in January 2016 . Later that month, German newspaper Das Bild reported that an upgrade to the jets meant that the cockpit lighting was too bright, making night flying impossible. The terrorists had long before been making significant movements at night in an attempt to try and avoid detection. Then in November 2016, two of planes touched down at the main airport in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, after an apparent in-flight emergency . After a subsequent inspection, German officials deemed the aircraft airworthy enough to return to Turkey, despite the fault in the fuel tank. As of February 2017, the detachment of Tornados had flown 2,300 flight hours in total during 750 sorties over Iraq and Syria . On top of the need to prepare for far-flung missions like the fight against ISIS, the German military is generally looking to improve its capabilities because of renewed threats closer to home. Since Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and began taking an increasingly revanchist stance toward NATO, officials in Berlin have found a need to reorient their defense policies. For more than two decades, the Bundeswehr had been slowly shrinking as the apparent threat of a major conflict in Europe appeared to subside after the final collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Bundeswehr German military spending grew by two billion Euros in 2017 to a total of 37 billion Euros, with that figure expected to reach more than 39 billion Euros by 2020. The country renewed its commitment to meeting NATO’s expectation of members paying at least two percent of their GDP on defense. “We’re moving in the right direction, but we can’t do it in one year,” German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen told German television network NTV in January 2017. Beyond basic funding, difficulty in attracting new recruits and limited modernization since the end of the Cold War slowed down the process of growing the country’s military, as well. How Germany would pay for the F-35, or any other new warplane, is likely to be a major consideration in how the country proceeds with replacing the Tornados. Unnamed sources told Reuters that German officials had been watching the steadily decreasing unit cost for Joint Strike Fighters before asking for the additional information. And then there’s just the matter of political disagreement over what the existing and future forces should be setup to do. Germany has long been a contributor to humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, and by 2017 had security forces working in locales as diverse as Kovoso, Iraq, Lebanon, Mali, and Somalia. “Germany spends 30 to 40 billion euros on supporting refugees because of military interventions years ago that went wrong,” German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel declared in January 2017 . So, the increased defense spending “should be considered a contribution to stabilization,” he argued. F-35A over The Netherlands., Lockheed Martin To maintain a credible defense against potential opponents such as the Russians, especially if it intends to continue participating in NATO’s Baltic Air Policing mission, Germany will undoubtedly want to replace its Tornados as soon as possible and otherwise improve the Luftwaffe’s overall readiness. The United States and those foreign partners who have already joined the program have poured resources into the often criticized and controversial Joint Strike Fighter specifically to counter exactly these kinds of developments. In April 2017, the U.S. Air Force sent eight F-35As to the United Kingdom in what could only be seen as a message to both critics and the Russians. Surprise visits to Estonia and Bulgaria only reinforced this viewpoint. A fifth generation fighter such as the F-35 or Airbus’ notional NGWS could be an important capability for the Luftwaffe to have, especially in light of Russia’s ever-improving long-range radars, surface-to-air missiles, and advanced fighter aircraft. However, it’s entirely possible the country’s priorities could change again after federal elections in September 2017, in which the potential for Russian influence and interference has become a significant factor. Beyond just trying to figure out how and when to replace the Tornados, whether it be with the F-35 or something else, officials in Berlin will probably have to decide on what role they want their military play in Europe and the world in general first.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2019","Yes, Britain Really Did Just Issue a Terror Warning for Antarctica","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a universal truism that terrorists are bound only by the limits of their creativity when they plot how, where, and when to strike. On the other side of the equation, it’s equally true that government security forces are always in the undesirably position of being on guard for nearly every potential attack they can think of, whether or not they ever occur. But sometimes you have to wonder if this “constant vigilance” has gone too far. In May 2017, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office issued a terrorism-related travel advisory for the British Antarctic Territory. For those who have probably never heard of it, this is a 660,000 square mile slice of Antarctica that the United Kingdom first claimed in 1908, which has two permanent research stations and an average population of around 250 people. Winter temperatures at Halley Station , which is the closer of the two to the South Pole, are generally balmy minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit or below. And yet, “although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the British Antarctic Territory, attacks can’t be ruled out,” the Foreign Office’s statement reads . “There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against U.K. interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.” Security experts have been understandably baffled. It’s not just that there is no recent history of terror attacks in the “BAT” or Antarctica broadly. There is no history of them in the region what-so-ever . A view of Ross Island, with Mount Terror to the right in the background., NOAA The closest reference to terror of any kind is the snow-and-ice-covered Mount Terror on Ross Island. But Royal Navy officer and explorer Sir James Clark Ross named this feature after his second ship, the HMS Terror. Ross Island is also home to Terror Point, Terror Saddle, and Terror Glacier and there is Terror Rift in the surrounding Ross Sea. There’s no indication of an ISIS cell in the area, though, where wildlife like penguins and seals generally outnumber people. “MI5’s then-Director-General once said there was a terror threat almost everywhere except Antarctica,” British Army Colonel Richard Kemp, who led the United Kingdom’s forces in Afghanistan in 2003, told The Sun tabloid, using the common name for the U.K.’s Security Service domestic security agency. “Now they’ve put Antarctica on the list. We expect guidance based on intelligence, not a pointless exercise in back-covering — unless I’ve missed the Islamic State Polar Brigade.” Kemp, who was also previously part of a U.K. government Cabinet Office Briefing Room crisis response group, or COBRA committee , was suggesting the Foreign Office made the move in response to accusations it had not adequately warned British nationals about visiting Tunisia in 2015. That year, gunman with a local ISIS faction went on a rampage along the beach in the resort town of Port El Kantaoui, near the city of Sousse. The majority of the 38 victims who died in the attack were British tourists. An Aurora over part of Halley Station in 1998., Mtpaley via Wikimedia To be fair, tourists do visit the region every year to see the wildlife and picturesque landscapes. The Sun found the United Kingdom’s diplomats had used the same canned language for alerts applied to Antigua and Barbuda, the Falklands, and Iceland, indicating it may just be a generic warning for British vacationers anywhere in the world. Earlier in 2017, someone did take a jab at U.S. President Donald Trump’s hard-line rhetoric on terrorism by joking that he planned to target non-existent militants in Antarctica, but otherwise a cursory Google search doesn’t turn up any actual talk or evidence of increased risk in the area. Of course, the remote region hasn’t been able to entirely escape criminality over the years. In a bizarre episode in 2003 , the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) teamed up with Romanian authorities to arrest a pair of individuals who claimed to have hacked into the server at the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station science research facility. The two criminals said they would sell off stolen scientific data unless American officials paid them an unspecified ransom. We don’t know what information the thieves obtained that they thought was worthy of a pay day. The site supports research into astronomy, astrophysics, air and ozone, and seismic science, according to the official website . NASA has used the forbidding locale to simulate “off-world” environments, too. Their threat fell apart due to Amundsen-Scott’s unique position. Due to intermittent satellite coverage at the time, the station only had internet access for part of the day to begin with, allowing contractors on the site to quickly isolate the infected computer during the down time. The FBI and Romanian law enforcement ultimately tracked down the hackers, who were wanted in connection to crimes in the continental United States, including credit card fraud, as well. A view of the Amundsen-Scott research station in 2009., Mradyfist via Wikimedia “Our improved international relations helped us tackle crime on the South Pole,” Cassandra M. Chandler, then the FBI’s Assistant Director for Public Affairs, told a gathering at the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center in September 2004. “That’s right, Antarctica. A United States scientific research station located in the coldest spot on the planet called us for help after their computer systems had been hacked into and their data corrupted.” “Because of the sub-freezing temperatures, it was impossible to send agents to the scene – no aircraft could land or take off from the site for months,” she continued. “But working from thousands of miles away, our investigators were able to trace the source of the intrusion to a server outside Pittsburgh. From there, we identified two Romanian suspects. Thanks to the cooperation and hard work of the Romanian authorities, they were arrested outside Bucharest shortly thereafter.” So, it’s probably important to never say never. But when it comes to terrorism, we still think Antarctica is probably one of the safest places to be. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 22, 2024",The U.S. Air Force Only Has One Upgraded Ejection Seat for its F-35A Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has rescinded restrictions on how small pilots flying the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter can be, ostensibly owing to fixes to the aircraft’s ejection seat and the development of a modified helmet. But the service decided not to highlight that it hasn’t actually implemented any of those improvements yet and that they may not impact any existing pilots. Let’s rewind a bit. On May 15, 2017, the Air Force proudly announced it had changed the rules to allow pilots under 136 pounds to fly the F-35A. Two years earlier, the service had put that limit in place in light of concerns that the Joint Strike Fighter’s ejection seat was too likely to seriously injure or even kill smaller aviators as it rocketed them out of the cockpit in an emergency. Testing had shown the size and weight of the helmet could be another dangerous factor. At the same time, the Air Force highlighted improvements to the ejection seat and helmet that supposedly made the change possible. Martin-Baker, which makes the US16E ejection seat found in all F-35 variants, issued a similarly self-congratulatory press release . “I have personally briefed every single F-35 pilot in the United States Air Force about these changes to their ejection seat, and I’m confident our pilots are no longer concerned with the safety of the F-35 ejection system,” Air Force Brigadier General Scott Pleus, the service’s F-35 Integration Office director, said, clearly linking the two events directly together. “I’ve flown in this seat myself and believe, with these modifications, this is the safest ejection seat I’ve ever flown.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ag591vjVa5M But tucked away at the very end of the Air Force’s official story was an important qualifier. “The new ejection seats are already being retrofitted into the existing fleet, and the lightweight helmets are available in pre-production now, while full production starts later this year,” the service’s reporters noted. The War Zone reached out to the Air Force’s Air Combat Command (ACC), which oversees the vast majority of the service’s combat aircraft, including all the combat-coded F-35As, for clarification of this point. As it turns out, while the weight restriction was gone, it wasn’t because the Joint Strike Fighters had received the new safety improvements. According to the ACC public affairs office, at the time of writing, the Air Force has exactly one F-35A, situated at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, with the new seat. Rockwell Collins and Elbit Systems of America (RCEVS) have not put the improved helmet into full production. USAF This is not a trivial point. For years, the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) had serious reservations about the US16E ejection seat and whether it posed a hazard to pilots in certain weight ranges. Additional testing showed those concerns weren’t misplaced and led to the weight restrictions to begin with. In 2010, a test involving a 103-pound manikin showed damage consistent with a serious neck injury. In July 2015, the Pentagon repeated the experiment, but with an improved helmet, and got the same results. A 136-pound dummy experienced the same stresses during an evaluation the next month. “After the latter failure, the program and Services decided to restrict pilots weighing less than 136 pounds from flying any F-35 variant, regardless of helmet type,” the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation noted in his 2015 review of the F-35 program. “Pilots weighing between 136 and 165 pounds are considered at less risk than lighter weight pilots, but at an increased risk (compared to heavier pilots).” “The level of risk was a labeled ‘serious’ risk by the [Joint] Program Office based on the probability of death being 23 percent and the probability of neck extension (which will result in some level of injury) being 100 percent,” the report continued. “Currently, the program and the Services have decided to accept the risk to pilots in this weight range, although the basis for the decision to accept these risks is unknown.” USAF As a result of these findings, the JPO demanded that Martin-Baker identify and develop a solution to the problem. The Air Force also considered qualifying an alternative seat , United Technologies’ ACES 5, in case the United Kingdom-headquartered defense contractor couldn’t fix the US16E. The company ultimately developed a mechanism that would delay parachute deployment, and therefore the force exerted on the pilot from the canopy opening, when necessary. Aviators in the lower weight ranges would flip a switch on the seat to activate this new “light” mode. Separately, RCEVS trimmed yet more weight form the helmet to reduce additional strain on an individual’s neck during an ejection. But more than a year later, and after its controversial decision to declare the F-35A combat-ready , the Air Force’s own calculus had apparently changed largely independent of whether it had actually implemented these fixes or not. Despite Pleus’ remarks, the service had become willing to accept what it described as a statistically unlikely risk. “Flying fighters, or any aircraft, is inherently risky and there isn’t a single ejection system without risk,” an ACC public affairs officer told The War Zone in an Email. “The team that completes risk analysis does so for the entire fleet, and makes recommendations to the Air Force and air worthiness authorities on whether a given system has acceptable risk or not. We carry similar risks on many other airplanes in our inventory, not only for their ejection seats but also other variables.” The Air Force subsequently ran a new risk analysis and “in accordance with the standard discipline and engineering done for all aircraft” accepted the relative danger to smaller pilots flying the F-35A, and only in part because of still forth-coming safety improvements. The service declared the overall danger to pilots of any weight flying in routine conditions at normal speeds to be low. Aviators weighing less than 136 pounds still had a medium-level risk in low-speed conditions where the aircraft was rolling or yawing. “The probability of an ejection in this slow speed regime remains very low, estimated at one in 100,000 flight hours, and the Air Force has accepted risk of similar magnitude in previous ejection seats,” the ACC public affairs officer added. “Based on the remote probability of an event occurring requiring ejection from the aircraft and pilot weight considerations, the airworthiness authorities recommended and the Air Force has accepted lifting the restriction for lightweight pilots.” This is a fair point and an argument that many proponents of the F-35 made after the discovery of the ejection seat issues in the first place. The Air Force has repeatedly stressed that only a minority of its fighter pilots fall into this lighter weight bracket. It’s also an easy decision to make since the restrictions meant no pilots under the weight cap ended up in the training pipeline. It’s not clear if there are any F-35 pilots who got sidelined by the rules changes back in 2015. As of May 2017, the service didn’t expect to begin training any new lightweight pilots until the fixes are available, according to Air Force Times. Still, removing the restrictions before the updates actually reach the F-35s would help get candidates into the training cycle sooner. The service’s hope is to have an aviator under 136 pounds in the training pipeline by the end of 2017 and in the air by 2018. USAF Regardless, it is the service’s prerogative to assess and determine what risks it’s willing to take in general. However, the way in which the Air Force announced the changes and obscured the actual relationship between the two events only begs the question of how strongly the service believes in its own argument. It’s worth noting that neither the U.S. Marine Corps nor the U.S. Navy, which have different risk assessment rubrics from the Air Force, have made a similar decision. Their bans on pilots weighing 136 pounds or less from flying the F-35B and C respectively, both of which use the same US16E ejection seat, remains in place. Some foreign operators, with overall force demographics that skew smaller and lighter, may not be able to make do at all without the upgraded seats. Japan received its first F-35 in December 2016, but there has been no word on whether there are any restrictions on who can fly the jet. Of course, the situation will steadily improve. The Air Force has developed a plan to install the improved seats across the fleet for the few pilots who might need them. The service hopes to retrofit at least 14 aircraft each month, with contractor teams needing between 4 and 5 days to install a single seat. Any F-35As that go for maintenance at depot-level will automatically receive the seat regardless of other scheduling. Though there isn’t a fixed time frame for the modifications, the overall plan is for the jets at Luke Air Force Base to get the upgrades first, then those at Eglin in Florida, and finally the planes at Hill in Utah. The Navy, Marine Corps, and foreign operators have not yet announced whether they will upgrade to the new seat. In the meantime, the rules change is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the Air Force’s Joint Strike Fighter pilots, who will continue flying with the existing seats and helmets, or their operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2019",Three Planes Will Square Off in the USAF’s Light Attack Experiment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At least three different aircraft will participant in the U.S. Air Force’s light attack experiment, commonly referred to as OA-X, according to the companies involved. All that remains to be seen is just how serious the service actually is about pursuing the concept. On May 12, 2017, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) issued a press release on behalf of itself and its partner, Embraer Defense & Security, announcing that they would be sending their A-29 light attack aircraft to the Air Force’s evaluation. On May 15, 2017, Textron Aviation sent out a notice that its AT-6 Wolverine and Scorpion aircraft were slated to take part in the tests. The project would begin in July 2017 at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. OA-X may turn out to be “a more sustainable model for the future that would be less costly [and] that I could entice foreign partners and allies and coalition members to partner with us on,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein explained during a talk at the American Enterprise Institute in Jan. 18, 2017. He added that a proposal by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) earlier than month to buy 300 such aircraft was a “great idea.” After McCain released his white paper and Goldfein made his comments, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway wrote an in-depth analysis of the possible competitors and the potential future of such a program. At that time, the A-29 and the Scorpion seemed like the most likely contenders. The final decision is hardly surprising given that Boeing and Lockheed Martin both said they were unlikely to participate in the experiment. The decision by the smaller company IOMAX not to compete was also notable, but more on that later on. Two A-29s of the Afghanistan Air Force., USAF As it stands now, Air Force testers at Holloman will be pitting two relatively similar and proven aircraft against each other, while evaluating another, totally new aircraft. The A-29, a variant of Brazilian plane maker Embraer’s EMB 314 Super Tucano, and the AT-6 Wolverine, a version of the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II trainer, are both low-wing, two-place monoplanes with roughly similar dimensions. A single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop, the industry standard engine for light aircraft in this class, powers both aircraft to similar cruising speeds of around 320 miles per hour without any weapons or equipment. At just over 37 feet long and with a wingspan of 36.5 feet, the A-29 is approximately four feet longer and two feet broader than the AT-6. The Brazilian design is also 1,000 pounds heavier. The A-29 can carry missiles, bombs, rockets, gun pods, and other ordnance on five pylons, two in each wing and another under the fuselage centerline. In addition, the aircraft has a .50 caliber machine gun built into each wing. The Wolverine has six under-wing pylons, but no fixed guns. Both planes can carry a sensor turret with day- and night-vision cameras and a laser designator, along with defensive flares. The inclusion of both types in the OA-X tests makes perfect sense. The Air Force already has a large fleet of T-6A Texan II trainers, which share many of the same components. This means that a not insignificant portion of the service’s logistics pipeline could support units with an attack variant. Certain training and maintenance expertise would translate to the new planes, too. And since 2013, the Air Force has been buying A-29s for foreign partners and training pilots from those countries to fly them. An AT-6 Wolverine., Textron The similarities between the two aircraft have already brought them into close competition in the past. Between 2010 and 2012, Beechcraft – now part of Textron – and the SNC-Embraer team, along with the political supporters in Congress, fought over a series of disputed contracts to supply aircraft to both the U.S. Air Force and Afghanistan’s air arm. Despite significant “ buy American ”-based lobbying on behalf of Beechcraft, the SNC-Embraer offering won out to build what became the A-29. Through the Foreign Military Sales program, the Pentagon has delivered a number of the light attack aircraft to Afghanistan and is working to send more to Lebanon . The U.S. Air Force canceled its parallel project in 2012, nominally due to budget cuts, but in no small part because of institutional reticence bordering on outright sabotage. “SNC and Embraer will take part in the experiment with the A-29 Super Tucano, which is the only light air support (LAS) aircraft in the world with a USAF Military Type Certificate,” the companies boasted in their press release. “Partnering with Embraer, we’re proud to present the U.S.-made, combat-proven A-29 as part of this experiment,” Taco Gilbert, SNC’s senior vice president for SNC´s Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance division, added, clearly trying to get in front of any renewed objections to the aircraft’s Brazilian connection. The Textron Scorpion., Textron It’s this experience that may help explain Textron’s seemingly odd choice to submit two radically different aircraft. The Scorpion is significantly different beast from either of the turboprop entrants, being a two-seat, high-wing jet. Two Honeywell TFE731 turbofans, each generating 4,000 pounds of thrust, gives the aircraft a maximum speed of over 500 miles per hour. With an empty weight of more than 12,000 pounds and with a wingspan of more than 47 feet, it is significantly larger than either the A-29 or the AT-6 and can carry a variety of weapons on six under-wing stores stations. More importantly, it has a retractable mount in the nose for a sensor turret, as well as an internal payload bay for additional mission systems in the center of the fuselage. This could include more sensors, advanced defensive gear, or other equipment. According to Textron, the privately-funded design features a low-maintenance composite airframe and modular, plug-and-play avionics that can be upgraded and updated with relative ease. In August 2016, the Air Force already agreed to test the aircraft’s airworthiness in a first-of-its-kind arrangement, which the Rhode Island-headquartered defense contractor hoped would encourage foreign sales. After that, it was undoubtedly an easy decision for the service to include the plane in the OA-X trials. “This is an exciting step forward for these programs, and we are confident the Scorpion and AT-6 are exceptional platforms to fulfill the USAF’s light attack mission,” Textron said in its statement. “Both platforms offer advanced mission systems technology, affordability and adaptability. Designed, sourced and built in the United States, the Scorpion and AT-6 also offer a strong, positive economic impact aligned with the goals of the current administration.” Noticeably absent is IOMAX’s Archangel or another aircraft in the rapidly expanding category of light attack and surveillance aircraft based on agricultural aircraft. A idea dating back to the 1980s , the North Carolina-based firm has become one of, if not the preeminent company building such aircraft. It has already sold armed aircraft to a number of countries, including Jordan and the United Arab Emirates . Afghan A-29s., USAF However, unfortunately, IOMAX is currently in the midst of a dispute with the Air Force over a separate deal to sell this type of aircraft to Kenya. The company and its supporters in Congress argue that the service steered the military aid contract to a preferred contractor, L-3, which has limited experience with converted agricultural aircraft and no history of building armed versions, without even considering any competitors. “They were given a raw deal,” representative Ted Budd (R-NC) told Fox News in March 2017. “We want to know why IOMAX was not considered.” But regardless of the participants, it’s still not clear how far the Air Force intends to proceed with OA-X in general. In 2008, a team within Air Combat Command published what became known as the OA-X Enabling Concept , a white paper that outlined the basic parameters for the aircraft in question. The next year, the command, which flies the vast majority of the Air Force’s combat aircraft, proposed a plan to buy four squadrons – at least 176 aircraft, but as many as 204 – for approximately $4.2 billion over the next six fiscal years. The service dutifully budgeted for what it called the Light Attack / Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) project, as well as, the parallel Light Air Support (LAS) program for Afghanistan. As already noted, the service simply could not decide how to proceed or even if it wanted to do so, despite contract awards and available funding. Contract disputes and budget cuts known as sequestration were simply the final blows to what already appeared to be a doomed project. The Air Force ultimately dropped out of a partnership with U.S. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Navy on a related effort, known as Combat Dragon II . On the surface, with statements like those from General Goldfien earlier in 2017, the revived OA-X seems to have significantly more institutional support than it did in the past. The big question is whether that extends beyond simple experimentation. “We don’t think [an experiment] would cost a lot of money, and it’s designed just to help us get our arms around [questions like]: What can you actually do? Does it actually contribute? Can it survive in different threat environments?” Lt. Gen. James M. “Mike” Holmes, the Air Force’s deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and requirements, told Defense News in September 2016. The OA-X experiment will hardly be the first time the Air Force has flirted with a light attack aircraft for conflicts involving enemies with limited air defenses. If one counts both the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly and the A-29 program, the service has gone on to buy significant numbers of the resulting aircraft on exactly two occasions – and only once for itself. And its controversial history with the significantly heavier A-10 Warthog ground attack plane doesn’t necessarily inspire confidence , either. Some immediately worried the new iteration of OA-X was simply a veiled ploy to ditch those blunt-nose attackers for good. There’s always the possibility more companies will get invites, too. So, you can be sure we at The War Zone will be closely watching the OA-X trials to see what, if anything comes of them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 19, 2019",U.S. Special Operators and Marines Want A New Long-Range Machine Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun and its derivatives continue to be deadly weapons despite a basic design that’s nearly a century old, few would argue that at it could do with shedding a little weight. Unfortunately, lightweight versions and alternatives have almost universally turned out to be poor substitutes. So, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and U.S. Marine Corps are looking to go in a different direction and potentially buy a weapon that sits somewhere between the iconic “Ma Deuce” and lighter 7.62mm machine guns. On May 11, 2017, SOCOM and the Marines posted a notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps, looking for information from companies on their ability to build as many as 5,000 machine guns chambered in .338 Norma Magnum. This round is more commonly associated with long-range precision rifles. “This is only for Market Research, but may result in an invitation to an open discussion with the U.S. Government,” the announcement makes clear. The description does not mention any particular design by name, but gives a number of key parameters. The belt-fed “lightweight medium machine gun” (LWMMG) should be less than 24 pounds, have a barrel 24 inches long, and be able to fire somewhere between 500 to 600 rounds per minute. Special operators and Marines want a weapon that is accurate against area targets, such as groups of individuals or vehicles, out to a range of more than 2,000 yards. Accessory wise, the gun needs to have a lightweight tripod and standard mounting points for optics, laser aiming systems, and more advanced fire control systems still in development, which might include ballistic computers that calculate where the bullet might land at certain distances. SOCOM and the Marines are looking for a system that can easily accept one of two different barrels, a regular version and a sound suppressed type. For use on vehicles and watercraft, the LWMMG should fit into existing mounts for the 7.62mm M240B and C machine guns. GD If these parameters sound at all familiar, that’s probably because they do describe one existing machine gun. While SOCOM and the Marines might not have asked for information on any specific gun, what they outlined was General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems’ LWMMG . In 2009, the Florida-headquartered subsidiary of defense contractor General Dynamics had identified what it felt was a machine gun “gap” and began working privately on a solution. The firm’s engineers felt that American combat experiences during the War on Terror had shown 5.56mm M249 squad automatic weapons and the aforementioned M240 light machine guns were man-portable for mobile operations, but might lack the range and power to attack enemies at longer ranges or behind hard cover. The venerable M2 was able to get at those opponents, but was simply too heavy for regular, day-to-day patrolling. A General Dynamics LWMMG prototype with suppressor., GD What the company ultimately crafted was a 24 pound machine gun with a 24-inch barrel firing the .338 Norma Magnum round at a sustain rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute. By 2014, engineers successfully demonstrated it could accept a sound suppressor , too. A complete package with its tripod, spare barrel, a 6x Trijicon ACOG optic, and 500 rounds of belted ammunition, was approximately 105 pounds. An M2 with a similar collection of gear would be three times heavier. At the same time, the weapon boasted impressive terminal effects, having twice the muzzle energy of the U.S. military’s standard 7.62mm round, helping keep the gunner on target and the rounds accurate, even at long ranges. According to General Dynamics, the LWMMG could pierce through level III body armor at 1,000 yards and break lighter vests at 1,500 yards. The weapons maximum effective range against groups of enemy troops was 1,700 yards, more than twice that of an M240B. On top of that, the prototypes had an improved recoil system that reportedly made them just as controllable as a smaller 7.62mm weapon, also eliminating the need for heavy or recoil-absorbing vehicle mounts associated with the M2. And you could fire the weapon just as well on the move from a bipod as a tripod. A member of the Iowa Army National Guard carries an Mk 48 machine gun with ammunition backpack., Iowa ARNG A primary driver of U.S. military machine gun development, the U.S. Army has been well aware of the range and portability issues, too, but has focused primarily on reducing weight in order to make 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons more useful in dismounted operations. Regular soldiers in Afghanistan evaluated SOCOM’s Mk 48 Mod 0, a 7.62mm relative of the M249. The standard M240B infantry gun weighed more than 30 pounds empty, while the Mk 48 came in at under 25 pounds even with a 100 round belt of ammunition. Troops were reportedly so happy with the guns that there was briefly talk of units in the country completely replacing their M249s with the larger guns. To help soldiers take the larger guns on more regular operations, the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force went so far as to build a prototype action movie-esque ammunition backpack that fit both the Mk 48 and the M240. Of course, there were certain deficiencies that came along with the lightened features. The gun’s could overheat during sustained firing or shake so much during prolonged bursts as to be noticeably less accurate. The weapon’s gas system had a tendency to foul quickly and needed regular cleaning. When it created the requirements for the Mk 48 machine gun, the U.S. Navy, which manages the program for SOCOM, only required the guns to shoot an average of 4,000 rounds before some sort of malfunction. By comparison, the base reliability requirement for the M240B was 7,500 means rounds between failure. These factors might not have been problematic for special operators during short-duration missions, but were a major issues for broad, routine use by conventional forces. It may have been one reason that FN Herstal found no customers for the guns when the firm first proposed them in the 1970s. The Belgian company’s website clearly notes that it was only SOCOM interest in such a machine gun that prompted them to dig out the design more than two decades later. Instead, the Army’s preferred solution was a dedicated lightweight version of the M240, called the M240L. With a titanium receiver and other weight-saving features, the new variant shed approximately five pounds. A shorter “assault” barrel cut that figure even further. On the other end of the spectrum, a new, light-weight .50 caliber machine gun, the XM806, would replace the aging M2 in certain roles. Also known as the Lightweight .50 Caliber Machine Gun (LW50), this weapon was another General Dynamics product. The prototypes, with their tripods, only weighed 62 pounds, compared to the M2 on its mount, which was nearly 130 pounds in total. This meant that a two-man gun crew could readily carry more manageable portions, as well as ammunition, even on foot. A soldier poses behind an XM806., US Army While the M240L did enter service, the XM806 ran into delays. By 2013, the Army had postponed the project indefinitely. The big issues were again reliability and ease of maintenance . As the service had found in nearly every previous attempt to replace or lighten the M2, the power of the .50 caliber round often wreaked havoc on these systems, wearing down and breaking parts in short order and literally shaking themselves apart. On top of that, General Dynamics’ new gun had the misfortune of also being reportedly overly complicated to take apart and repair. So the capability gap remains. Now it appears SOCOM and the Marines have decided not to wait for the Army to come up with a solution. General Dynamics LWMMG, or a weapon from another manufacturer just like it, would be a distinct improvement over the M240 and M2 in many situations. The main issue would be the .338 Norma Magnum’s performance against heavier targets at range. GD As it stands now, available .338 Norma Magnum ammunition – standard ball, armor piercing, and special, long-range types – is a perfectly fine substitute for the .50 caliber round at relatively long ranges, but only against soft targets like exposed personnel and light, essentially unarmored vehicles. The bullet simply does not have the weight or the space to mimic the effects or capabilities of the .50 caliber round – especially those with high-explosive and incendiary fillers – against light armored vehicles or fortifications. That SOCOM and the Marines are only looking for a weapon that can fit existing mounts for M240s suggests they are aware of this limitation. But even in those roles, it would be a significant improvement. And the mention of the M240C is also interesting since the only vehicles in the U.S. military that use this version are the Army’s Bradley infantry and cavalry fighting vehicles and the Marine Corps’ LAV-25 8×8 wheeled scout vehicles. From this, the Corps would appear to be interested in mounting the new .338 machine gun turret in place of the smaller 7.62mm weapon in the LAV-25’s alongside the existing 25mm cannon. It seems most likely that in the near future special operators and Marines could be fielding this new weapon, but that they will continue to use their existing 7.62mm and .50 caliber machine guns, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 7, 2019",This U.S. Army Manual Has New Official Details About the RQ-170 Sentinel Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are few aircraft as closely examined—but with as few hard official details known—as the U.S. Air Force’s RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone . The War Zone’s two primary writers have probably followed the aircraft more closely and exposed more new details about its operations than anyone else. But for more than six years, the single largest collection of official information was the service’s fact sheet , with a neat total of just 100 words. Now, additional technical facts have emerged about the secretive pilotless aircraft from an unlikely source, a U.S. Army manual. On May 5, 2017, the Army published the latest iteration of its “Visual Aircraft Recognition” manual , or more formally, Training Circular 3-01.80. There is an entry on Lockheed’s RQ-170 tucked away in the 22-page chapter on “unmanned aircraft platforms.” The single-page description includes a three-view line drawing and what appears to be a computer rendered concept art of the Sentinel. Some of the information is relatively mundane, some of it obvious. The wings are “low-mounted, swept-back, and tapered with square tips,” while the fuselage has a “sharp, pointed nose … [and] Pyramid and faceted appearance.” To state what is clear from any of the available pictures, the specifications point out that the drone has no tail fins. But there are significant new details included, too. If the entry is to be believed, the RQ-170 has no longer-range sensors, with the aircraft’s role being “close-range, day and night surveillance.” This information confirms what we have thought regarding the RQ-170’s mission set as a persistent penetrating surveillance platform. The handbook also confirms that it carries no weapons. Most notably, it provides the first official source that offers dimensions for the craft, including the Sentinel’s much disputed wingspan. According to the Army, the Sentinel has a wing-span of more than 65 feet and is nearly 15 feet long. For comparison, the wing span is more than 10 feet longer than the MQ-1 Predator, but just slightly shorter than that of the MQ-9 Reaper. The stealthy RQ-170 is significantly shorter than both of these ubiquitous drones. Once again, this is the first official source confirming those dimensions. Where the Army sourced this info remains unclear. US Army More curiously it states that its main engine is an “electric turbofan mounted inside the body.” This is a very confusing detail and islikely a mistake that stems from the manufacturer’s name of the Sentinel’s engine, not some exotic type of propulsion. It has been widely speculated that the RQ-170 uses a highly modified version of the General Electric TF-34 jet engine, but even if it were another General Electric engine, the catalyst for such a mistake is the same. No other aircraft’s engine type is listed as an “electric turbofan” in the manual and no such engine exists at all, at least publicly. So, unless the RQ-170 uses some exotic new hybrid powerplant in an operational form , this anomaly is probably just that. It’s not entirely clear why the aircraft warranted an entry in the manual to begin with. It was only mentioned in a textual list of drones in the previous edition, which the Army put out in February 2016. That version was almost comically error-ridden , widely panned online by defense journalists and hobbyists alike. It’s impressive the Army waited more than a year to print a corrected handbook. The only mention of the RQ-170 in the previous edition of the manual., US Army “Aircraft manufactured by friendly countries can also be a threat in some regions depending on current situations,” the training circular notes, which is a fair point. On a separate note, this part of the introduction includes yet another factual error, suggesting, by way of example, that Iraq was flying American-made A-4 Skyhawks during the Gulf War in 1991. The Iraqis have never flown the A-4. To go back to the Sentinel, to the best of anyone’s knowledge—and as logic would dictate—the United States hasn’t sold the aircraft abroad and the manual clearly states in its description of the RQ-170 that the drone has no foreign analogues. In December 2011, Iran did capture one of the secret aircraft after it crashed inside its territory while on an apparent surveillance mission. Captured RQ-170 that fell into Iranian hands in late 2011. , Youtube Screengrab Despite a U.S. government request, officials in Tehran declined to return the drone. In 2014, Iranian officials released images and video of what appeared to be a sub-scale clone that mimicked the basic shape of the Sentinel at most. That same year, Iranian Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force (IRGC-AF), boasted that the country would soon be flying a full-size version. In 2016, pictures and video emerged of an entire fleet of larger, similarly shaped drones. State-run media outlets did not show any of them in the air. Based on what one could gleaned from the photographs and video clips, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway wrote a detailed assessment of the unmanned aircraft and their likely capabilities. And while its true that there isn’t another operational drone similar to the Sentinel that has been publicly disclosed, that might not be the case for long. Potential near-pear opponents Russia and China have both shown off prototype flying wing drones, while America’s European allies are actively working on similar unmanned combat aircraft . As for the U.S., it remains totally unclear where the Pentagon stands when it comes to the development of stealth unmanned combat air vehicles. It goes without saying pilotless planes are already a common sight above the battlefield and will only become more prevalent as time goes on. Is the U.S. military actually worried about these Iranian RQ-170 copies or new foreign designs? Was it just a random inclusion? It’s worth noting the manual did not include information on all the unmanned aircraft the U.S. military had in service at the time, nor did it feature any of Iran’s extensive arsenal of operational pilotless planes. With this in mind, it’s possible the authors were just looking to provide a selection of unique and representative shapes for recognition purposes. Whatever the reason, this has given the public the next chunk of information on the shadowy Sentinel, an aircraft that remains enigmatic a decade after it was first photographed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 10, 2019",A Simple Screw Up Caused $4 Million in Damage to Air Force One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has revealed that a parts mix up and a hasty decision to try and remedy the situation led to millions of dollars in damage to America’s most important aircraft, Air Force One. Boeing thankfully located the problem before a more serious accident occurred on the ground or in flight, but the accident was a direct result of serious problems at the aircraft manufacturer’s maintenance facility. Between April 1 and 10, 2016, contract maintenance personnel used contaminated tools and replacement parts while servicing the oxygen system on one of the Air Force’s two VC-25A aircraft at the Boeing Global Support Services’ site in San Antonio, Texas. VC-25A is the official designation for the pair of specially modified 747-200 aircraft the Air Force has on hand specifically to fly the President of the United States, their staff, and other accompanying press and dignitaries, wherever they might need to go. Popularly known as Air Force One , the planes are uniquely configured to allow the president of the United States to conduct their full range of duties safely and securely while airborne, even during a nuclear attack. “To prevent a fire hazard, the VC-25A Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) requires all tools and components used on the [mishap aircraft’s] oxygen systems to be ‘oxygen clean’ so contaminants do not exceed specified levels prior to oxygen system maintenance,” an executive summary of the report explained. You can read that brief review here . What this means is that when working on Air Force One’s oxygen system, repair crews must make sure to use a special process to scrub any potentially dangerous chemicals from both spare parts and anything they use to manipulate them. Though not flammable by itself, oxygen is a powerful accelerant. It can also cause other powerful chemical reactions. Contaminating the sealed system could potentially lead to a fire, which could in turn quickly get out of control as it feeds on the oxygen inside. USAF The use of contaminated parts forced Boeing to replace significant portions of the oxygen system for safety reasons. The price tag for the repairs was over $4 million, which the Chicago-headquartered plane maker paid for in the end. In Pentagon parlance, the most severe accidents, called Class A mishaps, are ones that cause $2 million or more in damage or result in a fatality. The summary report says that incident began when one mechanic mistakenly gave contaminated items to co-worker, who ultimately noticed the problem. Instead of stopping work and reporting the incident, the second individual, along with a third, located the problematic components, then attempted to clean them using a quick, ad hoc procedure. The second mechanic then put everything back together on the VC-25A. The summary does not include the names of any of the individuals involved in the mishap. The full accident report notes that objects can become contaminated in the open air within two to five minutes, according to Air Force Times . After crews complete this kind of work, they need to put any unused items or tools through the cleaning procedures again before sealing them in an airtight container. The contamination to the rest of the system could have occurred when the parts were connected in the first place or when the mechanics reinstalled the improperly cleaned components the second time around. The Air Force ultimately cited three separate human errors as causes of the mishap. The first was the second individual’s failure to follow “oxygen-clean” procedures, while the third was all three mechanics involved had not been able “to absorb or retain oxygen system training and failed to apply cleanliness procedures,” according to the Air Force’s summary. The second issue centered on Boeing’s poor oversight of the San Antonio facility and subsequent quality control issues. The complete incident report found that the company had attempted to make up for schedule slips by having employees work 12-hour shifts, six-to-seven day a week for weeks on end starting in December 2015, according to Air Force Times. In spite of this and without having verified the work, Boeing’s supervisory staff approved the repairs as satisfactory. Investigators also brought attention to the firm’s decision to move heavy maintenance operations for aircraft such as the VC-25A from its plant in Wichita, Kansas to San Antonio. As a result, the work became the responsibility of more than 150 individuals who did not meet the Air Force’s minimum experience requirements. Boeing sought and received waivers for these individuals after self-assessing the risks to be low. President Donald Trump waves as he exits Air Force One., AP On May 10, 2017, Boeing defended itself to Air Force Times, saying it was the one to notice the problem, that it accepted responsibility and reported the accident to the Air Force on its own accord, and that it paid for the repairs. “We fully understand the level of responsibility that comes from working on the president’s aircraft, and we’re committed to our partnership with the Air Force to provide the highest standard of support for the VC-25,” Boeing spokesman Ben Davis said. However, the accident is still significant since there are only two VC-25As. The entire point of having a pair of aircraft is so there is always one ready to go at a moment’s notice. The unscheduled or total loss of one could only severely impact the operations of the other. From time to time, depending on the situation, America’s top executive may use smaller aircraft, such as the Air Force’s C-32As, but these planes are nowhere near as capable. And the Air Force is already concerned about the age of the existing Air Force Ones, which first flew in 1990. The service is currently working on developing the requirements for two replacement aircraft and hopes to get the pair of all-new Air Force Ones into service by 2024, at an estimated cost of at least $3 billion in total. President Donald Trump made the costs of Air Force One and the Air Force’s planned replacement aircraft an issue during election campaign and after his victory, a topic that The War Zone has previously reported on . Until then, the Air Force needs the existing aircraft in top flying condition to serve the president’s needs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 10, 2019","As Tensions Simmer, CIA Says It Will Spy Even Harder on Pyongyang","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In April 2017, The War Zone detailed the multitude of ways America keeps watch over North Korea from the air , including spy satellites, surveillance aircraft, and drones. Now, in the face of Pyongyang’s missile tests and public displays of potential advanced weaponry , there are reports that the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Pentagon are further expanding efforts to gather intelligence on the reclusive country . On May 10, 2017, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) announced it was creating a new office focused specifically on North Korean nuclear and missile activities. The Korea Mission Center would bring staff from across the agency under the direction of an unnamed “veteran operation officer,” according to an unusual official press release. “Creating the Korea Mission Center allows us to more purposefully integrate and direct CIA efforts against the serious threats to the United States and its allies emanating from North Korea,” CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in the statement.  “It also reflects the dynamism and agility that CIA brings to evolving national security challenges.” In addition to getting information from satellites and manned and unmanned spy planes, the press release noted that the Korea Mission Center would be able to call on the “full resources, capabilities, and authorities of the Agency.” This would include other assets, including human intelligence from sources such as agents and defectors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mYeBVIZ4IFU The notice did not say where CIA would situate the new unit, though the group could definitely perform its functions from within the Agency’s campus at Langley, Virginia, while still coordinating with other U.S. and foreign intelligence and security organizations. It is possible that some or all of the staff could be permanently situated at other locations at home and abroad, including within the CIA’s stations throughout Northeast Asia. It’s not clear how this new entity will differ from the Agency’s existing operations regarding North Korea. The idea that there wasn’t already a unit specializing in the insular country is difficult to believe. The newly created group could reflect President Donald Trump’s administration’s attempts to apply additional pressure on authorities in Pyongyang. The rare public announcement followed months of increasingly tough rhetoric by President Donald Trump’s administration and similar responses from North Korean officials, which The War Zone has been actively following. With regards to North Korea, the “era of strategic patience is over,” Vice President Mike Pence said on April 17, 2017 , during a surprise visit to the Demilitarized Zone. “We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.” The CIA’s new plan could also signal Washington’s desire to keep up the pressure on the Communist regime in spite of the results of South Korea’s special presidential election following the impeachment of right-wing President Park Geun Hye. Park had taken a hard-line stance on North Korea and was a proponent of increased military and security cooperation with the Untied States. By comparison, South Korea’s new president Moon Jae In, head of South Korea’s center-left Democratic Party, has said his country needs to be able to “say no” to its powerful American allies and has openly discussed the possibility of visiting Pyongyang for talks with the North Korean regime. KCNA Of course, the desire for renewed or increased attention on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs is hardly surprising. The CIA new initiative comes less than a month after Pyongyang’s annual Day of the Sun military parade. The holiday as a whole revolves around the cult of personality of North Korea’s first leader, Kim Il Sung, and celebrates the day of his birth, April 15. The elder Kim died in 1994. Among other things, the event has become an opportunity for the authoritarian regime to showcase its latest military achievements. Though it featured other systems , the 2017 parade was a missile bonanza, with a host of never before seen designs rolling through the country’s capital. It is very likely that some of these, including what appeared to be two different types of containerized intercontinental ballistic missiles, were only mockups. North Korea followed up the public display with a missile launch from the country’s naval base at Sinpo on the East Sea. An apparent failure, the unidentified missile reportedly exploded shortly after launch. Another test at Pukchang airfield, near the country’s western coast, reportedly failed on April 28, 2017. Satellite imagery suggested Pyongyang would also conduct a sixth underground test of a nuclear weapon, though there was no evidence this had occurred by the end of April. Regardless of these failures to perform, it’s important to note that experimentation of any kind can provide valuable information. As The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway pointed out in a detailed analysis of the events in April 2017, Pyongyang’s weaponeers could have learned new lessons from these tests and may have even command detonated the missiles intentionally to prevent them from inadvertently crossing into international territory and being shot down or otherwise falling onto an undesirable location within the country itself. There is also the fact that South Korea routinely searches for the remains of rockets after these tests to gather its own intelligence, a situation North Korea could be looking to avoid. The CIA could use its resources to spy on North Korea’s conventional military developments and deployments, as well as political intrigue and other illicit activities, too. In April 2017, to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army, North Korea put on a massive display of traditional firepower , involving hundreds of artillery pieces – including dozens of its 170mm Koksan self-propelled guns – and submarines. In February 2017, Kim Yong Nam, half brother of North Korea’s current leader Kim Jong Un, died in what appeared to be a state-sponsored assassination in Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur International Airport. And then there’s matter of the extensive networks Pyongyang uses to evade international sanctions . https://youtube.com/watch?v=AnbpQBabQLQ The Agency won’t be doing its work alone, either. “The new Mission Center will work closely with the Intelligence Community and the entire U.S. national security community,” the press notice added. Other intelligence entities, such as the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), National Security Agency (NSA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), are no doubt ramping up similar efforts to identify and assess North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities. In addition, the CIA and other members of the Intelligence Community work closely with military intelligence units. The most obvious supporting organizations would be the Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the service’s nuclear weapons-focused Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) have been vital in tracking the development of Pyongyang’s increasingly threatening arsenal. AP Most notably, AFTAC’s Technical Surveillance Squadron operates the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System , which fuses information from sensors on board satellites, inside aircraft, under the sea, and at dozens of land-based seismic monitoring stations around the world. Analysts use the equipment to determine whether a disturbance of some kind is actual a nuclear explosion. The unit’s other squadrons conduct other aerial and sea-borne intelligence looking for nuclear activities. In 2015 , the Center added a Cyber Capabilities Squadron to support and protect its global computer networks. NASIC’s focus is on potential air and space threats, such as foreign aircraft and missiles. It regularly publishes public reports on the state of global ballistic and cruise missile development. The center published its most recent unclassified review in 2013, which prominently featured North Korea’s existing work on all types of ballistic missiles. “North Korea has an ambitious ballistic missile development program and has exported missiles and missile technology to other countries, including Iran and Pakistan,” the analysts noted. “Continued efforts … show the determination of North Korea to achieve long-range ballistic missile and space launch capabilities.” KCNA Though not necessarily dedicated to nuclear and missile threats like the Air Force’s units, U.S. Army assets in South Korea could feed information to the CIA’s new Korea office, as well. On May 7, 2017, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported the top American command in the country was considering activating a new military intelligence battalion to conduct human intelligence operations. “I see high chances that the U.S. troops will make use of the country’s human intelligence gathering channels like the Central Intelligence Agency,” an unnamed official from the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) said, according to Yonhap. The NIS itself has a long-standing relationship with the CIA. So far, neither the U.S. Army nor U.S. Forces Korea has confirmed the plan to stand up the unit, rumored to be the future 524th Military Intelligence Battalion. The battalion previously served on the Korean Peninsula from 1982 until its inactivation sometime in 2014. In 2005 and 2006, interrogators from the unit helped man the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center (JIDC) in Iraq, which included operations at the detention centers at Camp Bucca and Camp Cropper, as well as the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. As of January 2017, the 501st Military Intelligence Brigade in South Korea had four subordinate battalions. These included the 3rd Military Intelligence Battalion conducting aerial surveillance missions, the 532nd Military Intelligence Battalion running counter-intelligence missions to guard against enemy spies, and the 719th Military Intelligence Battalion specializing in detecting and monitoring enemy communications and other signals in cooperation with the NSA. AP The reserve component 368th Military Intelligence Battalion, which also performs counter-intelligence duties, was nominally attached to the brigade despite being situated at various locations in California. U.S. Pacific Command’s 500th Military Intelligence Brigade also had another counter-spying unit based in Japan. The CIA and its new Korea center may actively coordinate with American and South Korean special operations forces, too. Intelligence collection is a key special operations mission and there have been reports in the past about elite troops infiltration into the North or at least planning to do so in a crisis. In March 2017 , the Pentagon denied South Korean media reports that SEAL Team Six was training for a potential “decapitation strike” to neutralize North Korea’s leadership and nuclear and missile sites. In August 2016, however, then President Barack Obama did approve a Pentagon proposal to put U.S. Special Operations Command at the forefront of any U.S. military response to a situation involving weapons of mass destruction . In short, the CIA has many partners it can call upon in the region. And regardless of how much the new Korea Mission Center actually changes the Agency’s sources and methods of operation, the United States and its allies are definitely well position to uncover more details about North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 28, 2018","US Gives Syrian Kurds Combat Vehicles, Mortars, Anti-Tank Weapons, and More","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Within 24 hours of President Donald Trump’s administration announcing America’s plans to arm Kurdish groups in Syria, deliveries of weapons and other equipment have begun arriving into the country’s northern region. The move is likely to further inflame tensions between the United States and its ally Turkey, which is just one facet of an increasingly complex situation, as The War Zone just covered in depth . On May 9, 2017, the Trump Administration declared it was moving ahead with plans to support Kurdish rebels in northern Syria ahead of a assault on the city of Raqqa, ISIS’ de facto capital in the country. The organizations in question include the People’s Protection Units, more commonly referred to by their Kurdish Acronyms YPG and YPJ, which Turkish authorities view as terrorists. On May 10, 2017, images and video began to emerge on social media of the first batches of supplies moving into the region, which Kurds refer to a Rojava. “We’ve got a certain amount of supply in the country already that was used to equip the Syrian Arab Coalition and some of that may be distributed very quickly,” U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, told reporters on May 10, 2017. “Every single one of these weapons that will be provided to our partner forces will be accounted for and pointed at #ISIS. #defeatDaesh,” he later posted on Twitter , using another term to refer to ISIS terrorists. The shipments will reportedly include heavy machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons armored vehicles, and gear to detect and jam improvised explosive devices (IED). Heavy machine guns would mean .50 caliber weapons such the U.S. Browning M2 or the Soviet DShK. Any anti-tank weaponry could include deliveries of the ever popular TOW missile , as well as other similar wire-guided types, which Syrian Arab and Turkmen rebels already employ to great effect. Reports: 1st shipment of heavy weapons delivered by Trump admin to YPG in Qamishlo https://t.co/vum93NPTc3 https://t.co/xuuY2DuE24 — Tim Hogan 浩勤 (@TimInHonolulu) May 10, 2017 Unconfirmed photographs of some of the new weapons included Spanish EXPAL Integrated Mortar System (EIMOS). Defense contractor EXPAL’s system consists of Uro VAMTAC 4×4 truck with a 60mm or an 81mm muzzle-loaded mortar on a recoil-absorbing mount. This combination provides an accurate and mobile fire support weapon ideal for light forces such as the YPG. Indirect fire support would be essential in any offensive into Raqqa and its suburbs, as already evidenced by the U.S. deployment of its own artillery units to the area to support ongoing operations. There were reports that American military aid to the YPG included heavier artillery , such as howitzers, but this may have been a misidentification of the EIMOS trucks. Other video showed more mundane, but necessary equipment, including two-wheel trailers that light trucks such as a Humvee would be able to tow behind them. It may be some time before there is visual confirmation of all the supplies included in these aid packages. And while the Pentagon has danced around the issue of how much support it’s given the YPG before now, the group has already been receiving more limited U.S.-supplied aid for years. In January 2017, pictures emerged on social media of YPG forces driving Guardian armored cars while fighting with the Arab-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia. In what appeared to be an attempt to placate Turkey, the Pentagon denied the YPG had received the vehicles, saying that had gone instead to the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) component of the SDF. Kurds in Syria receive new weapon shipment from coalition, #kobani #syria #ISIS https://t.co/3yqafSC4Nn — andreas korinov (@andreaskorinov) January 29, 2017 “The coalition provided several Guardian armored vehicles to provide the Syrian-Arab Coalition with increased survivability from ISIL’s small arms and improvised explosive device threats,” Dorrian said at another press conference on Feb. 1, 2017. “The coalition will continue to bolster these fighters’ abilities with training, weapons and equipment as we have already done for more than 3,000 members of the SAC. International Armored Group – which has offices in eight countries, including the United States, United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, all part of the U.S.-coordinated program to arm Syrian rebels to fight ISIS – makes the light armored vehicle, which is based on the Ford F550 Heavy Duty pickup truck chassis. The most common variant in Syria has small turret with a machine gun mounted on top of the armor-played body. YPG fighters have also been spotted traveling in unarmored pickup trucks, such as the ubiquitous Toyota Hilux. Then, earlier in May 2017, the Pentagon again denied it had supplied weapons and equipment specifically to the YPG, according to a report by Military Times . The question came up after pictures appeared online of the Kurdish group’s fighters wearing American-made gear and carrying M4 carbines with accessories common to U.S. military units. More importantly, the individuals had helmets with AN/PVS-7B night vision goggles. Though these older systems are readily available for legal purchase online inside the United States, the U.S. government heavily restricts the export and sale of night vision and other image-enhancing equipment overseas. YPG fighters stand atop an improvised armored vehicle they captured from ISIS., AP It is possible that the YPG obtained this equipment in trade from its intended recipient or illicitly through the region’s expansive black market. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) may have been involved as well and did not respond to Military Times’ request for comment. If the Kurdish fighters did obtain the systems without U.S. approval, it begs the question about how well the Pentagon will be able to enforce Dorrian’s claim that no weapons will go unaccounted for or pointed at unintended targets. Though the SDF, including its Kurdish and Arab components, definitely need more weapons and other supplies in order to eject ISIS from Raqqa, there is a real question about what happens when that campaign ends. The author previously obtained reports regarding support for Syria rebels through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Though the sections on “Misuse or Loss of Provided Training and Equipment” are entirely redacted, their shows that it is a real concern for American officials. In one particularly galling incident in September 2015, an early group of Western-trained rebels surrendered their equipment – including six pickup trucks – almost immediately to Al Qaeda fighters upon return to Syria. US Central Command via FOIA And if Turkish officials follow through with its threats to attack YPG forces, it could easily break the chain of custody. Turkey insists the YPG and YPJ are linked to the Kurdish Worker’s Party, or PKK, in Turkey, which both it and the United States view as a terrorist group. “We want to believe that our allies will prefer to side with us, not with a terrorist organization,” Turkish President Recep Erdogan told a reporters in Ankara on May 10, 2017. “Every weapon seized by them [the YPG] is a threat to Turkey,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said during a separate televised press conference. Since March 2017 , American special operators have been trying to keep the peace between Turkey and the YPG, with varying degrees of success. Though their presence has prevented attacks in certain areas, Turkish aircraft still bombed Kurdish forces just six miles from where a group of U.S. troops was positioned in April 2017. It remains to be seen whether the newly armed Kurds will be able to continue their focus on Raqqa and ISIS or will have to split their attention between the terrorists and Turkish strikes. Regardless, the U.S. decision to step up support to the YPG to include these heavy weapons is an important shift in policy that could have significant ramifications in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 4, 2019",The Army Is Once Again Looking to Replace the 5.56mm Cartridge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is once again looking into what it would take to replace the venerable 5.56mm cartridge and weapons that use it like the M16 and M4. Kickstarted at a time of major firearms developments across the U.S. military, it’s still not clear whether the new plan will succeed where previous efforts have failed. In May 2017, Army Times revealed that the Army was working steadily on a replacement for the M16 family of weapons, along with a new cartridge for whatever gun came next. The service reportedly hopes to have a prototype or prototypes ready by 2020. “Right now the platform we have is a workhorse and very effective in the hands of a trained soldier or Marine,” U.S. Army Major Jason Bohannon, in charge of the lethality branch at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, Georgia, told Army Times. “Our next investment will likely be in a new operating platform.” Bohannon and others are still trying to determine the specific requirements for the new gun and settle on a caliber. Army officials will be able to really get to work once the results of the Small Arms Ammunition Configuration study are ready. The service expects this work, which has been going on since 2014, to wrap up no later than August 2017. There a lot of ideas already out there, though. US Army Decades of debate At the core of the existing research is the long-standing search for a so-called “intermediate cartridge,” and an associated rifle or shortened carbine, which would give average troops the ability to perform well at both long- and short-ranges. After decades of existing studies, the Army shifted from historically employing guns shooting .30 caliber and 7.62mm bullets to the M16 and its .223 caliber projectile, later known formally as the 5.56x45mm. An intermediate round would be one that sits, size wise, in between these two standards at somewhere between 6mm and 7mm. When the M16 entered service, the over-arching belief at the time was that guns firing a smaller round, and more of them, would have less recoil and therefore be more accurate. The Army had also considered small darts called flechettes and cramming multiple bullets into single cartridge cases to improve hit probability. US Army There  was considerable evidence that lightweight projectiles would reliably tumble,  fragment, or otherwise create horrific wounds, more than making up for  their relatively small size. On top of that, the lighter cartridges simply meant that troops could carry more ammunition, again helping making up for any loss of power compared to older designs. In addition, experience in World War II and the Korea War suggested that, on average troops engaged the enemy at relatively short ranges and that relative training and experience would have generally precluded them from doing otherwise. “The average effective infantry fire with weapons lighter than the machine gun was consistently less than 200 yards,” U.S. Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall, then acting as a historian and combat analyst, noted in a 1951 report on infantry operations and weapons usage during the Korean War. He could find no example of American troops ever bringing an enemy force to a halt with rifle and carbine fire alone. On paper at least, the M16, with a rate of fire of approximately 750 rounds per minute, and its cartridge, officially useful out to a maximum range of 600 yards against a specific enemy, seemed to fit most of these requirements. In theory, individual soldiers could take aimed shots using the rifle’s semi-automatic firing mode, while automatic riflemen could provide suppressing fire in full-automatic. Despite near legendary teething problems during the Vietnam War, the rifle went on to prove its worth in the short-range combat of Southeast Asia’s jungles. US Army 5.56mm fares poorly in Afghanistan Fast-forward to the mid-2000s and there were rumblings in the Army that things had changed based on combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. Insurgent snipers and long-range weapons teams, along with the threat of manually-detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs), reinvigorated the debate over the M16 and its caliber. These experiences are the clear impetus for the Army’s latest development. Study after study seemed to point to the specifics of the 5.56mm cartridge as a major limiting factor. In 2006, the Joint Service Wound Ballistics–Integrated Product Team released a report that suggested a projectile between 6.5mm and 7mm was the ideal bullet size. Three years later, then-U.S. Army Major Thomas Ehrhart, wrote a now often-cited paper at the service’s Command and General Staff College, which referenced this and other research and called for a new, standard infantry weapon. A U.S. Army soldier with a refurbished M14 rifle., US Army “While the infantryman is ideally suited for combat in Afghanistan, his current weapons, doctrine, and marksmanship training do not provide a precise, lethal fire capability to 500 meters and are therefore inappropriate,” Ehrhart contended. “There are several ways to extend the lethality of the infantry… A better option to increase incapacitation is to adopt a larger caliber cartridge, which will function using components of the M16/M4.” In Afghanistan more so than Iraq, insurgents employed Soviet-era 7.62x54mm SVD rifles, RPGs, recoilless rifles, and mortars and seemed to routinely out-range American squads armed primarily first with M16s and then the shorter M4 carbine. Though handier for close-quarters combat and when getting in and out of vehicles, the M4’s 14.5-inch barrel only reduced the terminal impact and effective range of the 5.56mm bullet. Things were bad enough that troops had taken to firing expensive Javelin anti-tank missiles at enemy fighters in order to hit them from a safe distance and get at them behind hard cover, such as rock outcroppings and earthen barriers. Both the U.S. Marine Corps and the Army, along with special operations forces, initially built specialized designated marksman versions of the weapon, before beginning to reissue larger 7.62mm NATO rifles . In addition, the Army obtained a number of Mk 48 Mod 0 machine guns , a 7.62mm relative of the 5.56mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, and sent them to units Afghanistan. More dramatically, the service dug out Vietnam War-era M67 recoilless rifles and rushed them into service, all while pouring money into other hard-hitting explosive weaponry . New bullets When it came to new standard infantry weapons and cartridges, the Army, Marine Corps and U.S. Special Operations Command all punted, choosing to develop an further improved 5.56mm cartridge, which was by far the cheaper and simpler option. All three groups had entered the Global War on Terror using the already updated M855 cartridge, a heavier Belgian design featuring a steel penetrator tip for increased armor penetration. “The muzzle velocity required for M855 to be effective is not achieved when this round is fired from the M4Al Carbine due to its 6” shorter barrel,” the U.S. Navy explained in one 2009 contract document relating to a purchase of new Mk 318 rounds for special operators and Marines. “Not only has the military’s primary weapon changed since the time M855 was fielded so has the threat target.” USN However, highlighting the very active nature of the debate, the Navy still reported that the majority of engagements in Afghanistan were occurring at 100 yards or less. The Mk 318 had a new 62-grain bullet specifically designed to bust through cover, including car windows and house doors without losing too much velocity, breaking up, or tumbling wildly in the process. The round also featured better effective range from the M4’s shorter barrel, but this was a relative upgrade over the poor performance of the M855 in the gun rather than an overall increase. A complete M855A1 EPR cartridge and the bullet itself., US Army It’s important to note that the special operations community had previously obtained a dedicated long-range round, the Mk 262, with a significantly heavier 77-grain projectile, specifically for marksman rifles. This round subsequently filtered out to the regular services, too. Various other specialized rounds for certain tasks and training purposes also came into service. The Army chose to craft an updated version of the M855. Critics slammed the somewhat controversially named M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) of getting its improved characteristics at the cost of exerting almost dangerous amounts of wear and tear on M4s and other guns. Army officials attributed the worn out barrels and broken bolts mainly to quality control problems as production of the new rounds ramped up, claiming they had been resolved by the end of 2011. The round remained in service as of 2017. A U.S. Army special operator moves out during a sniper competition., US Army Existing alternatives to 5.56mm As with previous reviews, Small Arms Ammunition Configuration study will undoubtedly recommend finally abandoning these incremental improvements to the 5.56mm round and instead adopting a new intermediate cartridge. “The term ‘old’ has an entirely different meaning in the world of small arms,” Mike Friedman, then director of Logistics for the Army’s Project Manage Soldier Weapons, told the service’s reporters in 2014 . “Small arms weapon systems don’t share the same obsolescence cycles as some products like electronics or computers do. Age is not the yardstick, performance is.” This is hardly the first time the Army, or its sister services, have toyed with the idea of a standard infantry weapon, along with other guns, firing an intermediate cartridge. There had been a particularly notable attempt to create a 6x45mm universal machine gun during the late 1970s that was both light enough to be a squad automatic weapon and powerful enough to perform as a light machine gun. Ultimately, the Army decided to field the 5.56mm M249 and keep larger machine guns, such as the M60 and M240, in 7.62mm. A U.S. Marine Corps special operator fires at a target during a sniper competition., US Army As of 2017, the Army and SOCOM were actively considering a slew of new cartridges, but primarily for long- and short-range work. The War Zone has already written extensively about the .300 Blackout round and its applications for close-in combat. Then, on May 4, 2017, the Army put out a contract notice looking for suppliers of .338 and .300 Norma Magnum rounds, likely as part of SOCOM’s Advanced Sniper Rifle (ASR) program. A precision rifle in one of these calibers – or able to quickly switch between – would offer additional range and terminal benefits over existing weapons chambered in either .300 Winchester Magnum. The guns would also have extended range, but still be relatively light and compact when compared to larger weapons such the .50 caliber Barrett M82 and M107. With those characteristics in mind, General Dynamics had earlier designed a prototype .338 Norma Magnum lightweight machine gun as a possible replacement for the iconic .50 caliber Browning M2 in certain roles. Army officials told Army Times that SOCOM was also evaluating smaller precision rounds that are popular in the civilian target shooting community, including .260 Remington and 6.5mm Creedmoor. These rounds “stay supersonic longer, have less wind drift and better terminal performance than 7.62 mm ammunition,” U.S. Army Major Aron Hauquitz explained to the reporters. The special operators are looking at the Army Marksmanship Unit’s in-house .264 USA , as well. Defense contractor Textron previously pitched the idea of using cartridge in everything from carbines and light machine guns, akin to the old 6x45mm universal round. One of the company’s own internal studies boasted the round had “terminal effects greater than 7.62 mm NATO out to 1,200 meters,�� according to Army Times. US Army Money is the real factor But in spite of this flurry of interest and development, it’s not entirely clear why the Army believes this concept is more likely to gain more traction now than it has in the past. Just by itself, the service can point to a number of stalled-out projects, including a push to include an intermediate cartridge as part of an most recent abortive attempt to upgrade or replace the M4, which ended in 2014. More so than anything, the ultimately factor in any decision is likely to come down to cost. Replacing hundreds of thousands of standard infantry weapons and buying millions of rounds all new ammunition is a massive and expensive undertaking. In the last 75-years, the Army has done it exactly twice, first when it switched from the .30-06 Springfield to the 7.62mm NATO cartridge for standard infantry rifles and then when it moved from the 7.62mm round to the 5.56mm ammunition when it adopted the M16. A prototype squad automatic weapon that fires cased-telescoped ammunition., US Army The service then became the driver of similar shifts throughout the U.S. military. And the transition was by no means quick in either case. By the 1970s, one could still find second- and third-line units in the Army and its reserve components, especially those in combat support or rare non-combat functions that still necessitated small arms, using older 7.62mm M14s. By the 2000s, there were still enough M14s in storage to convert to designated marksman rifles for American troops and ship overseas to foreign allies, including the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The Army would have to be entirely sure that the benefits are worth the costs and complexity of such a decision. Just look at how long it took the Marine Corps to find an argument for purchasing even a relatively small number of new 5.56mm rifles . In the past, the Army has rejected the idea of adopting any new traditional metal-cased cartridge in favor of work on polymer-cased, cased-telescoped, and caseless ammunition . Cased-telescoped rounds involve nestling the bullet inside the cartridge case with the propellant to reduce overall length, while caseless rounds dispense with this disposable container for the gunpowder altogether. In theory, these options offer reduced weight, the elimination of the need to buy metal to make casings, and revolutionary shapes that could lead to radically new small arms designs. In spite of decades of near constant work, they continue to be prohibitively expensive and unreliable. Experimental cased-telescoped, above, and caseless ammunition., US Army The push to have the weapons ready by 2020 might be another problem. In April 2016, U.S. Army Major General Walt Piatt, head of operations, readiness and mobilization, within the service’s top headquarters’ G-3/5/7 office, said that was when he wanted “ the entire Army to be fully ready – manned, trained and equipped.” These comments referred to a loss of overall readiness in the face of budget cuts and other uncertainty imposed by the process known as sequestration. At the time, Piatt said only a third of his forces were adequately prepared for combat. Though President Donald Trump has made increasing the Pentagon’s overall budget a priority, there are concerns about how and when his funding proposals could pass through Congress. The U.S. government continues to operate on short-term continuing resolutions with the ever present fear of a shutdown over domestic political issues. The Army will have to weight just how much it wants to and actually can spend on small arms development as it also tries to update its armored vehicles, helicopters, and other major equipment. In short, while the results of the Army’s Small Arms Ammunition Configuration study and any prototype guns that emerge as a result of its recommendations may well become the latest rallying cry for critics of the 5.56mm, it may still not be enough to move the U.S. military bureaucracy to act.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2019",Russia’s “Safe Zones” In Syria Only Make Things More Complicated,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia appears to be moving ahead in enforcing safe zones in Syria, which could potentially conflict with the United States’ fights against both ISIS and Al Qaeda in the country. At the same time, the U.S. military still seems to be gearing up to support Kurdish and Syrian rebels in a major offensive to liberate the city of Raqqa from terrorist fighters, a plan that has drawn the ire of Russian, Syrian, and Turkish officials, as The War Zone has already reported in detail . On May 3, 2017, the commercial ImageSat International (ISI) Eros B satellite captured imagery of what appeared to be a Russian Air Force Beriev A-50 Mainstay radar plane at Hmeymin Air Base . DefenseNews was the first to publish the images. This would have put the aircraft at the base, which the Kremlin has been actively using to support the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad since September 2015, just days before officials in Moscow announced the establishment of what it also referred to as “de-escalation zones.” These areas covered much of Syria’s Idlib Governorate, a portion of territory to the south between the contested cities of Hama and Homs, and a buffer space along the country’s southern borders with Israel and Jordan. “In the de-escalation zones, warfare between the government troops and armed opposition units joined or are to join the ceasefire regime is being stopped,” Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, head of Russia’s Main Operational Directorate, said at a press conference on May 5, 2017. “Not everybody appreciates it,” Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Lieutenant General Alexander Fomin added. Fomin specifically mentioned the United Nations, the United States, and Saudi Arabia – which Russia views as a major benefactor of Sunni militants and extremist groups in Syria – as well as unspecified “other countries” as the parties who were not thrilled with the agreement. The safe zones were part of a larger cease-fire arrangement that representatives from Russia, Iran, and Turkey had ironed out during meetings in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana. According to Rudskoy, troops from those three countries would act as observers and guarantors of the peace. Russian MoD Russian-backed no-fly zones At least nominally, the safe areas are supposed to include no-fly zones, which in turn could potentially preclude American warplanes from attacking ISIS and Al Qaeda fighters inside the designated spaces. The A-50 would be a key component of monitoring and enforcing those restrictions. Russia had sent one of these aircraft to Hmeymin with the rest of its forces in late 2015, but pulled it out as part of a limited withdrawal in March 2016. Analogous to the U.S. Air Force’s E-3 AWACS, the Mainstay has a large radar on top of the fuselage mounted inside a rotating dish. In 2008, the Russian Air Force began evaluating an upgraded variant, which subsequently entered service as the A-50U. This version featured new, digital avionics, improved target detecting and tracking capabilities, and more powerful computers to process the data. These aircraft can spot and track multiple aircraft at a time, as well as detect low-flying cruise missiles. An A-50 Mainstay., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia Russia’s air arm expects to begin testing another significantly updated version, the A-100 , which will have an all-new, fast-scanning active phased array radar (APAR) in July 2017 . Though there is no clear evidence available to confirm this, Russian sources boast that this aircraft may be able to detect even stealth fighter jets such as the F-22 Raptor. However, if accurate, these improved capabilities would be important for Russia’s operations in Syria. On April 6, 2017, the U.S. Navy fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria’s Shayrat Air Base following an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians in the city of Khan Sheikhoun. In addition, the U.S. Air Force has routinely employed the Raptor to attack ISIS in Syria with relative impunity. The Kremlin hopes to have the A-100 in operation by sometime in 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qikcJzXG4_A In the meantime, the A-50 and air search radars associated with Russia’s expanding air defenses in Syria provide the most aerial coverage and early warning capabilities. As of April 2017, Moscow had one S-300 surface-to-air missile battery situated at the country’s naval base at Tartus and an S-400 unit at Hmeymin, along with other shorter range weapons such as the Pantsir-S gun-and-missile system . The Russian Air Force could also respond to intrusions with its own advanced fighter jets, including the latest Su-35 Flanker-E , which it has in the region. After the attack on Shayrat, the Kremlin declared plans to provide Syrian government forces with improved anti-aircraft weapons, too. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tM8Pj31suXI Despite these defenses, it was not immediately entirely clear, however, if and how Russia and its partners in the de-escalation move expect to engage American aircraft that defy the no-fly zones. In their statements, Fomin and Rudskoy seemed to play down this possibility and offer loopholes to avoid confrontations. At the official press conference, Fomin actually praised the American-led air campaign against ISIS in Syria, listing it as a factor that had enabled the establishment of the safe zones in the first place. He said the counter-terrorism effort, along with the “improvement of [the] humanitarian situation,” would ultimately promote “creation of conditions promoting political settlement of the conflict.” In addition, “It is to be stressed that signing of the Memorandum on creation of the de-escalation zones in the Syrian Arab Republic does not stop fighting against terrorists of the ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria,” Rudskoy noted. “State-guarantors undertake to continue fighting against formations of these and other terrorist organizations in the de-escalation zones as well as provide assistance to the government troops and armed opposition in fighting insurgents in other areas of Syria.” An F-22 Raptor heads out for a mission over Syria in February 2017., USAF American operations continue in Syria Russia’s primary representative at the Astana gathering, Alexander Lavrentyev, insisted the ceasefire’s provisions only meant the United States could continue to operate in the country in general. The de-escalation zones would still be off limits to anyone. “The operation of aviation in the de-escalation zones, especially of the forces of the international coalition, is absolutely not envisaged, either with notification or without,” he declared . “This question is closed.” In response, the United States said it had not changed its operations in any way to accommodate the new agreement. “The coalition will continue to target ISIS wherever they operate to ensure they have no sanctuary,” Marine Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman told Fox News . “The coalition will continue to strike ISIS targets in Syria,” a State Department official separately explained to The Wall Street Journal . “The campaign to defeat ISIS will continue at the same relentless pace as it is proceeding now.” On May 6, 2017, the day Russia said the de-escalation plan would come into effect, officials in Moscow and Washington did formally agree to restart a hot-line to prevent future air-to-air incidents over Syria. Russian officials had previously stated they had stopped participating in the scheme after the American missile barrage on Sharyat. A satellite image of damage at Shayrat Air Base after the American cruise missile strike in April 2017. , Digital Globe via USN It’s worth noting that the safe zones are located in areas that the United States has only infrequently operated in to begin with. Idlib Governorate in particular has been a hotbed of anti-regime rebel activity, but has historically had a limited ISIS presence. Instead, American air strikes in the area have been part of a separate, shadowy campaign to kill or capture Al Qaeda members taking advantage of Syria’s instability. After multiple reports that the strike had destroyed a mosque and killed dozens of innocent civilians, the Pentagon announced it had launched an investigation into the incident, which it initially claimed only killed numerous terrorists. Other areas in western Syria have been largely off limits to manned coalition assets since Russia installed its S-400 air defense system at Tartus on the Mediterranean coast. The focus of the American-led campaign against ISIS has been further east, in and around the city of Raqqa. Since 2014, the city has been the terrorist group’s de facto capital. The map the Russians showed at their own briefing on the safe zones pointedly showed all of northwest Syria as outside government control. It’s also worth pointing out that the safe areas in southwestern Syria match where many of these Israel Air Force operations have occurred. In 2017, the IAF stepped up raids on Hezbollah arms transfers in Syria, which resulted in fairly extreme saber rattling between the two long-time foes. Israel’s most recent strike at a weapons dump near Damascus International Airport appears to be under, or right on the edge of, one of these new zones. If the country continues to wade deeper into the Syrian mess, then these no-fly zones might eventually impact those operations. A Syrian Army tank rolls out in Hama Governorate., AP A fragile ceasefire from the beginning Regardless of how or if the Russian-sponsored plan changes the face of the American-led coalition’s aerial bombardment of Islamic State, there’s no guarantee the safe zones and associated cease-fire will hold for any protracted period of time. Previous attempts to end the fighting and provide space for a peaceful resolution of the long-running civil war all ultimately proved fruitless . Rebels and the government in Damascus had a hard, if not impossible time finding common ground during negotiations in 2016. Assad himself remains the main issue. Insurgents, each with their own specific demands, have generally come to the conclusion that a lasting peace is incompatible with the dictatorial leader remaining in power. A Syrian Democratic Forces fighter stands above Taqba, Syria in 2017., AP On the other hand, Assad is unlikely to ever be willing to negotiate himself out of power and into a position where he could end up in front of an international tribunal to face charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity. In addition, the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies have taken the position that most, if not all of the rebels fighting the regime in Damascus are actually terrorists aligned with ISIS or Al Qaeda’s franchise in the country, al-Nusra, as a way of discrediting their legitimate grievances. Given the official Russian explanation of the plan, this rhetoric would seem to give Syrian forces and its foreign partners the necessary latitude to continue attacks on rebel held areas, even within the de-escalation zones. Opposition groups could easily be wary about signing on to a deal where they have no obvious protections from violations by the agreements so-called “guarantors.” A Shi’ite militiaman fires at rebels in Syria., AP On top of that, Syrian rebel factions who Russia and its partners invited to join the talks in neutral Astana were particularly vexed by Iran’s participation in the gathering. Iran, and Shi’ite proxy groups such as Hezbollah, have been both key to the survival of Assad’s regime and responsible for a particularly brutal campaign against rebel groups on the ground. “Iran is a country that is killing the Syrian people and the killer cannot be the rescuer,” Abu Osama Golani, a rebel commander who attended the meetings before walking out in protest, according to CBS News . “If this [negotiating] table does not lead to solutions, we will return to the gun,” Osama Abo Zayd, a spokesman for the Syrian rebel delegation in Kazakhstan, said. Turkish troops drive through Kobani, Syria after a brief incursion in 2015., AP Turkey’s regional calculus Then there’s the matter of Turkey’s complex position in Syria. In spite of previous calls for Assad to step down and support for ethnic Turkmen rebels , Turkish authorities have become increasingly flexible on many of these points, so long as it means Kurdish groups do not gain a greater foothold in northern Syria. Since the beginning of 2017, Turkey has only made it increasingly clear it will not accept any scenario that involves the People’s Protection Units, better known by their Kurdish acronyms YPG and YPJ, taking control of any significant amount of territory. Turkish officials see the YPG and YPJ as directly linked to the Kurdish Worker’s Party , or PKK, which it sees as a domestic terrorist group. As a result, Turkey’s concerns about the Kurds has pushed the country’s government closer to Russia and threatened to derail the U.S.-backed push toward Raqqa. Though it has designated the PKK as a terrorist organization, the United States views the YPG and YPJ as distinct and separate entities who are important allies in the battle against ISIS in Syria broadly. “I don’t think we’re going to change the demographics of Raqqa by Kurds or Turkmen or any group participating in the operation,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, in charge of all American forces fighting ISIS, told reporters on March 1, 2017. “I expect that probably all types of Syrians in northern Syria will participate in the liberation of Raqqa.” At the same press conference, the U.S. officer insisted that the YPG were not a threat to Turkey and had no intention of attack or trying to seize Turkish territory. A YPG fighter stands guard next to American armored vehicles in Syria., AP The two countries have been unable to reach a consensus on the situation and the Turkish military has launched a number of air and artillery strikes on Kurdish positions, despite American support. So, beginning in March 2017 , American special operators in Syria have been trying to keep a precarious peace, even mixing very openly with YPG and YPJ units to ward off attacks. Turkey responded with veiled threats and more direct action, reinforcing that its primary concern is Kurdish ascendance and not the maintenance of its long-standing foreign relationships. On April 25, 2017, a Turkish air strike hit Kurdish targets six miles from where U.S. forces were positioned in Syria. “We won’t be considering the fact that there are armored American vehicles,” Ilnur Cevik, a senior political advisor to Turkey’s President Recep Erdogan, said in a radio interview earlier in May 2017. “All of a sudden, by accident, a few rockets can hit them.” The YPG’s general commander said the Turkish strategy could backfire and its alliance of convenience with the Russians could lead to confrontations with Arab rebels, as well. Haven’t you noticed how major rebel units that were once supported by Turkey are melting away because of this Turkey-Russia cooperation?” he told Al-Monitor . Free Syrian Army fighters in the city of Jarablus near the Turkish border in 2016., AP None of this bodes well for Erdogan’s visit to the United States or the situation on the ground in Syria. The Turkish president is expected to reiterate to President Donald Trump that his country will not accept Kurdish participation in the liberation of Raqqa, while there are reports the American administration will tell him that the Kurds will be a part of the operation with or without Turkey’s consent. It’s unclear if Russia’s de-escalation zones or the associated ceasefire would change either side’s calculus, either. U.S. officials have been cautiously optimistic about the proposal, but have made it clear they’re not going to let it get in the way of existing plans. “Does this proposal have a hope for ending this war?…You know, we’re going to have to look at it,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mattis said to his traveling press corps on his way to Denmark. “The devil’s always in the details, right?  So we’ve got to look at the details, see if we can work them out, see if we think they’re effect–going to be effective.” Of course, whether or not Russia and its partners and America and its coalition find a way to work together on the ceasefire could easily become moot if the proposal collapses because rebel factions on the ground, as well as terrorist groups, decide it’s not in their best interests to abide by its terms.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018",USAF Reaper Drones Can Finally Drop GPS Guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly a decade of service, the U.S. Air Force’s MQ-9 Reapers now have the ability to drop the service’s most ubiquitous GPS-guided bombs . The upgrade significantly increases the drone’s capabilities and opens the door for its arsenal to expand further. In May 2017, the Air Force’s 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base, the service’s main unmanned aircraft unit, reported that its Reapers had started training to employ the GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) in combat. According to the report, the wing had finished the testing phase of the upgrade in 2016. “The GBU-38 is a weapon we’ve been trying to get on the MQ-9 for several years now and we had the opportunity to be the first to drop during training,” an Air Force instructor pilot from the 26th Weapons Squadron, identified only as “Captain Scott,” told the service’s reporters . “There’s definitely times when I could’ve used the GBU-38 in combat prior to this.” Boeing’s JDAM is more or less a kit that converts basic dumb bombs into guided weapons. The new tail assembly has an inertial navigation unit, GPS-receiver and moving fins to direct it to the target. In addition, a set of wind wanes or strakes wrapped around the body of the bomb made it more stable as it glides toward the ground. The Chicago-headquartered defense contractor offers these components for bombs in the 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pound weight classes. The GBU-38/B is the U.S. military nomenclature for the 500 pound configuration, of which there are different subvariants depending on the specific electronics and warhead. Armament specialists can assemble the weapons around the Mk 82 high-explosive bomb, the BLU-111/B PBXN-109 insensitive explosive filler, or the reduced-charge BLU-126/B. The Navy developed the BLU-126/B specifically for situations where there are increased concerns about hitting friendly forces or causing collateral damage, such as in dense, urban environments. The GBU-38/B is in no way a new weapon. After the Persian Gulf War, both the U.S. Navy and Air Force had gone looking for a relatively cheap precision bomb. At that time, only laser-guided Paveway-series bombs were available to American pilots. The first members of the JDAM family made their combat debut during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999. A JDAM on an MQ-9 Reaper as seen through the drone’s camera., USAF Still, the Pentagon didn’t see JDAM as a replacement for laser-guided weapons. While the GPS-guided weapons could reliably hit within 50 feet of static targets, laser-guided weapons could regularly manage to get within 10 feet of the aim point. Advanced laser-guidance systems – either inside the launching aircraft or the bomb itself – can also calculate the distance necessary to “lead” moving targets, too. But laser-directed weapons weren’t perfect, either. Most importantly, smoke, dust, and just bad weather could distort the laser beam or blind the seeker in the bomb, throwing it off target. This could potentially put troops or innocent civilians on the ground in danger and outright prevent pilots from providing badly needed support. And aviators had to get relatively close to either “lase” the specific point themselves or spot the beam another aircraft or troops on the ground were projecting on the target. JDAM offered a stand-off range up to 15 miles, depending on how high the aircraft was flying and where the enemy was situated down below. GBU-49/B Paveways on an MQ-9 Reaper during a test in 2008., USAF As the relative features of both systems became apparent, Boeing devised a new JDAM kit that included a laser seeker in the nose , the GBU-54 Laser JDAM, which entered service in the late 2000s. Paveway-makers Raytheon and Lockheed had similarly added GPS/INS-capability to some of their laser-guided bombs. A Reaper dropped one of these combination weapons, a GBU-49/B Paveway, for the first time in 2008 . Regardless, the JDAM was a ubiquitous feature of America’s aerial campaigns, including the fight against ISIS.  The U.S. military, as well as its coalition partners, had dropped so many of the weapons in Iraq and Syria that Boeing was having to ramp up production of the tail kits . In March 2017, the firm told DOD Buzz it was looking to build more than 36,500 units during 2017, which would mean making at least 150 every day . The GBU-38 is known for its affordability (everything is relative in the world of defense procurement) with each costing roughly $18,000. A Reaper observers as its JDAM hits a training target., USAF The addition of equipment necessary for the Reaper to employ the JDAM only opens a path for the service to add more GPS-guided weapons onto the drones, which are also in high demand. Before getting the GBU-38/B, the Air Force’s MQ-9s were limited largely to laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and GBU-12/B Paveway II bombs. “The GBU-38, just like the Hellfire and GBU-12, is a very accurate weapon and the fact that it’s GPS-guided gives us another versatile way to guide the weapon, specifically, through inclement weather onto targets,” Scott added. The Air Force Special Operations Command’s aircraft have also employed the AGM-176 missile, which has a combination of GPS and laser-guidance. They may be dropping other small munitions we don’t yet know about , too. However, a standard architecture for lobbing GPS-directed weapons on the Reaper would let the entire fleet employ a whole suite of existing weapons, as well as new munitions in development or already on the market. The most important of these would likely be the Boeing Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and Raytheon’s up-coming SDB II. These 250-pound class glide bombs have proven ideal choices for attacking small targets in crowded environments. In addition to run low in JDAMs, the Pentagon had to divert stocks of SDBs to the Middle East to keep up with the needs of operations against ISIS. A display of three Textron Fury bombs on a single launch rack at the 2017 Sea Air Space Exhibition., Joseph Trevithick For drones like Reaper, the ability to carry multiple SDB’s on the same pylon would be a boon. As it stands now, the MQ-9 has four under-wing hard points, which can each carry a pair of Hellfires or a single GBU-12/B. Video and pictures the 432nd released shows single carriage of JDAMs, too. The unmanned attackers should be able to carry at least two SDBs in place of one of these larger bombs. Lockheed, Orbital ATK, Raytheon, and Textron are all offering new, small GPS- or combination GPS/INS and laser-guided bombs and missiles, pushing particularly hard with racks that hold multiple weapons aimed small aircraft and drones.  Textron says three of its diminutive Fury glide bombs can fit in place of a single Hellfire and Orbital ATK is working on various options for its tiny Hatchet and Hammer weapons, which The War Zone previously reported on as a potential future option for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. All in all, the GBU-38/B significantly increases the combat capabilities of the Reaper and we can reasonably expect to see evidence of that soon. On top of that, it is just the first step into further expanding the drone’s available arsenal with both old and new weapons.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",U.S. Navy SEAL Dies in Somalia Raid as Pentagon Steps Up Operations,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This U.S. military has suffered its first combat death in Somalia since 1993. The incident follows news, which The War Zone previously reported on, that American commanders in the region have expanded authorization to go after terrorists and that regular troops were heading to the country to train local forces. On May 4, 2017, U.s. Africa Command announced in a statement that an unspecified U.S. service member died while on a joint operation with Somali National Army forces against Al Shabaab terrorists near the town of Barii, approximately 40 miles west of the capital Moghadishu. The press release offered no details about the nature of the mission or the units involved. U.S. military officials, speaking on and off the record to various news outlets, later confirmed that the American who died was a U.S. Navy SEAL and that Al Shabaab had wounded two other individuals, also presumed to be SEALs, during the operation. “We do not believe there has been a case where a U.S. service member has been killed in combat action in Somalia since the incident there in 1993,” Patrick Barnes, an AFRICOM spokesman, told The Associated Press . Between Oct. 3 and 4, 1993, militiamen in Mogadishu killed 18 American troops and wounded more than 70 others in the aftermath of an U.S. mission to seize senior militants allied with warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Author Mark Bowden later immortalized the battle in his book Black Hawk Down , a term that has become synonymous with the event. The War Zone’s own deep analysis of America’s experiences in Somalia and activities in the country since the 9/11 terrorist attacks touches in part on this incident. Since Al Shabaab appeared in Somalia in 2006, the United States has been battling the group and supporting African Union troops doing the same in the war-torn country. In 2012, the organization announced that it had formally joined the umbrella of the global Al Qaeda terrorist network. Al Shabaab fighters in 2009., AP “Al-Shabaab presents a threat to Americans and American interests,” AFRICOM added in its statement. “Al Shabaab is an affiliate of the terrorist group al-Qaeda, which has murdered Americans; radicalizes and recruits terrorists and fighters in the United States; and attempts to conduct and inspire attacks against Americans, our allies and our interests around the world, including here at home.” In many ways, the May 2017 raid near Barii was reportedly similar to the Black Hawk Down mission more than two decades prior. Helicopters carrying American special operations forces and Somali National Army troops descended on an Al Shabaab safe house in the village of Dare Salaam to kill or capture militants who had been planning attacks on government security forces and their international partners, an unnamed Somali intelligence official explained to AP . When the force arrived, the terrorists responded and a firefight broke out, leading to the casualties. It is unclear how many, if any, of the Al Shabaab targets died as a result of the combined attack. Afterwards, the group’s media arm, the Shahada News Agency, issued its own statement, saying the militants had killed or wounded “a number” of U.S. and Somalia government troops. Somali National Army troops march during a training exercise., AMISOM Of course, this is hardly the first time American and other foreign special operations forces have conducted raids against Al Shabaab. In addition, the terrorist group has been able to thwart a number of them in the past. In January 2013, the militants prevented elite French troops from rescuing intelligence agent Denis Allex, murdering him afterwards in retaliation for the attack. Later that year, Navy SEALs had to abort a raid near Barawe after an intense firefight. There are reports that British and Jordanian special operators may also be involved in the country. But the latest mission came shortly after President Donald Trump and his administration approved new, broader authorities for American commanders in the country. Though it did not mention raids specifically, the policy changes gave the U.S. military additional latitude to conduct air and artillery strikes in support of African Union peacekeepers and Somalia’s military. “This authority is consistent with our approach of developing capable Somali security forces and supporting regional partners in their efforts to combat al-Shabaab,” Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, wrote in statement on March 30, 2017. “Somali and AMISOM forces have already achieved significant success in recapturing territory from al-Shabaab, and additional U.S. support will help them increase pressure on al-Shabaab and reduce the risk to our partner forces when they conduct operations.” African Union troops provide security as German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel visits Somalia’s Hilac refugee camp in May 2017., AP Then, in April 2017, The Intercept obtained a letter from the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance that sought updated information about where “humanitarian and development organizations” were operating within Somalia. The need for this information, which would help the U.S. military try and avoid civilian casualties, seemed like a potential prelude to American strikes on Al Shabaab members. However, the Pentagon stringently denied it had carried out any targeted attacks in the country since January 2017, including reports of a suspected drone strike on or about April 14, 2017. With the African Union planning to end its mission in the country in 2020 and start pulling out troops as early as 2018, there is an impetus to get the Somali National Army and the rest of the country’s security forces onto more secure footing broadly. So, on April 2, 2017, approximately 40 soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division deployed to Somalia for the more mundane task of training local troops in logistics operations. Joseph Trevithick Be sure to check out our interactive google map of American military facilities across in Africa, including sites in Somalia In the past, the Pentagon and the State Department had conducted much of that training outside of the country at sites in neighboring countries such as Djibouti and Kenya, likely to keep American personnel and contractors shielded from Al Shabaab attacks. Despite major U.S. and African Union-supported offensives – the latest of which Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed announced in March 2017 – the terrorists remain willing and able to carry out deadly attacks in heavily patrolled areas, such as Mogadishu itself. On Jan. 25, 2017, militants launched a complex attack on the Dayah Hotel, a popular meeting place for Somali government officials and foreigners, including journalists. DLA For obvious security reasons, in an Email to The War Zone, AFRICOM would not specify where the troops from 101st were staying, saying only that they would be working at a “Somali military facility located near the Mogadishu International Airport.” In January 2017, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) posted a contracting notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps, regarding the pre-positioning of fuel across Africa. The associated documents included a plan for deliveries of 800 gallons of unleaded gasoline per month to a site listed as “Mogadishu International Airport Training Area 6.” AFRICOM declined not confirm whether this site was related to the new American training mission. Since October 2013, the Pentagon has also maintained a small Military Coordination Cell in the country too coordinate American support for local and African Union forces, nominally operating from in or around the country’s airport . It goes without saying that if the Trump administration continues with its apparent push to have more U.S. forces on the ground in the country conducting a combination of direct action, advisory, and basic training missions, there will be a similarly increased risk of additional casualties. Regardless of their exact positions, Somalia remains a dangerous locale in general.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2019",F-22 Raptors Have Intercepted Russian Su-35s Near Alaska For the First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Underscoring ongoing tensions between the two countries, American F-22 Raptor stealth fighters have intercepted Russian Su-35S Flanker-E fighter jets as they escorted heavy bombers on mission near American air space. For reportedly the first time ever, Russia has added these advanced fighter jets to long-range bomber patrols near Alaska. On the night of May 3rd, 2017, two Su-35S fighters, without an visible missiles, escorted a pair of Tu-95MS Bear bombers to within 50 miles of Alaska. An A-50 Mainstay radar plane was also in the area at the time, but remained well clear of U.S. territory. Two F-22s quickly flew to meet the incoming Russian planes. Unnamed sources told Fox News , which first reported the incident, that the Raptors were already airborne on patrol near Chariot, Alaska when they were ordered to intercept. The Russian flight may have been spurred by America’s massive and highly sensitive Northern Edge exercise that is currently underway in the region. Su-35S is on Russia’s front lines. , AP CNN later said American officials downplayed the intercept as routine and uneventful. This is hardly the first time the Raptors have intercepted Russian aircraft near America’s coastlines. In April 2017, F-22s, along with Canadian CF-188 Hornet fighters, conduct four similar intercepts in as many days. E-3 Sentry AWACS planes have helped direct some of these operations from the air. “We haven’t seen this sort of level of activity for a couple of years,” John Cornelio, a spokesman for the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) told CNN after the last of the April interceptions. He made sure to add that the flights were not “unprecedented” or “unusual.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=LaK9TGk4nV0 There has been a notable increase in these flights since 2014, when Russia forcibly annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region. In response to this aggression and the Kremlin’s subsequent revanchist moves elsewhere in Ukraine and in Syria, the United States and its NATO allies stepped up surveillance operations and training exercises along Russia’s western borders. At the same time, Moscow accelerated bomber patrols along America’s borders. In addition, in 2014 and 2015, the Kremlin had even sent out bombers towards Alaska with older members of the Flanker family as escorts. However, the May 2017 flight was the first time in over a year any Russian fighters had accompanied bombers on one of these excursions. An Su-35S., AP Regardless of the relative frequency of these operations, the May 2017 meeting is still significant, because it was the first time the Kremlin has decided to send its newest Su-35s out of one of these missions. Plane maker Sukhoi delivered the first of these production Flanker-Es to the Russian Air Force in 2012. Compared to older Su-27 and Su-30 aircraft, the Su-35s have small refinements in their overall shape, new engines, and updated avionics and sensors. Though still a fourth generation design, Russia says Flanker-Es can supercruise (fly faster than the speed of sound without the use of afterburner) for extended periods and potentially launch missiles while doing so. This tactic would impart additional speed on a weapon at launch, making it harder for opponents to evade them. On the other end, improved, independent 3D thrust vectoring could make the jets even more maneuverable adversaries. On top of that, the aircraft has a quick-scanning Irbis-E passive electronically-scanned array (PESA) radar and an electro-optical system that includes a laser range finder and long-range infrared search and tracking capabilities that stealthy fighters cannot hide from. On top of that, the jets reportedly have a powerful electronic warfare suite to jam and confuse hostile radars. Taken together, the Russians have boasted, without much in the way of public evidence, that this combination could allow the jets to better detect low-observable jets such as the F-22 and F-35. F-22s flying a major high-volume missile shoot test series out of Edwards AFB., Lockheed Martin But with less than 50 of them in inventory, the Russian Air Force has deployed them sparingly and observers often see their presence as a message.  In February 2016, two months after Turkish F-16s shot down a Russian Su-24 Fencer attack aircraft along the border with Syria, the Kremlin made a very public display of sending a detachment of Su-35s to Hmeymim Air Base in Syria’s Latakia province. In December 2016, Flanker-Es arrived at Russia’s Air Base in Karelia near the Finnish border. This followed Finnish President Sauli Niinistö’s meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to discuss regional security concerns, including Russia’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy, to the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. So, their appearance off Alaska is notable in spite of the routine. By sending its most advanced jets on these patrols, the Kremlin might be attempting to show it can project power on par with the U.S. military. If nothing else, it would seem to suggest a desire in Moscow to expand its newer, advanced military capabilities into more traditional roles. Of course, the chance of an actual show-down between the F-22 and Su-35S remains low at the moment. Only Russia and China operate the Flanker-E and while U.S.-Russia relations may be cold, there doesn’t appear to be any immediate threat of a conflict on the horizon. Its important to note once again that American Raptors have also been flying in Syria in support of the war on ISIS, but it is unclear if the two aircraft have ever encountered each other in that theater. It is probably safe to say that the F-22s have even if the Su-35s didn’t realize it at the time. In a real fight, the existing Raptors would have many advantages of their own beyond their stealthy features, including the aircraft’s AN/APG-77 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar, AN/ALR-94 electronic support measures package, and data links to garner additional details about the battlefield from other aircraft and to share their tactical “picture” with wingmen in other F-22s. The F-22 is an amazingly sensitive “sponge” when it comes to sucking up electronic emissions. If the Russians used their radars, and especially if they did so at full capacity, the Raptors would have been able to detect those emissions and they could be exploited by intelligence analysts and used for future electronic threat library updates. As a result, the Americans may actually have gotten more out of the May 2017 exchange. It is all but certain that the F-22s were flying with external fuel tanks, radar reflectors, or both. These would have prevented the Russian pilots from getting a good sense of their low-observable characteristics. It is customary for the Quick Reaction Alert Raptors in Alaska to be outfitted with external tanks at all times. USAF And although the Su-35S are very capable fighters, the Raptor is only getting more deadly. As The War Zone reported in March 2017, the Raptors now have the ability to shoot the AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range dogfighting missile, but still lacks a helmet-mounted display to take full advantage of the weapon’s capabilities. On April 18, 2017, F-22s with the 411th Flight Test Squadron fired a number of AIM-9 and AIM-120 missiles at BQM-176A target drones over the Utah Test and Training Range as part of the Increment 3.2B upgrade program , which the Air Force has billed as “biggest capability upgrade since reaching Initial Operating Capability in December 2005.” But Russia has expressed an interest in increasing exports of the Su-35S. In November 2016, Indonesia selected the Flanker-E as the winner of tender to replace the country’s aging F-5E Tiger II aircraft, though it has not yet finalized the deal . In February 2017, the United Arab Emirates signed an agreement with Russian state arms broker Rostec for an unspecified number of aircraft. Russian authorities and Sukhoi have also pitched the aircraft to Algeria, Brazil, India, Malaysia, and South Korea in the past, among others. The Su-35 is an imposing and massive air combat machine., AP The wider proliferation of such an advanced design could only be of concern to the Pentagon, especially as it works its way through the troublesome F-35 program and has no plans to restart production of F-22s. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the U.S. Navy and Air Force’s choice of new paint schemes for their aggressor aircraft, which play the role of enemies during training exercises. It seems safe to say, whatever Russia’s intent was in sending the Su-35s near Alaska, the F-22 and other American fighter jets are likely to have more interactions with these advanced Flankers, whether they belong to Russia or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 11, 2019",The USAF Finally Gives Its AC-130W Gunship The Big Gun It Desperately Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than four years, the U.S. Air Force has shown off one of its first AC-130W Stinger II gunships to carry a 105mm howitzer. After initially making the controversial decision to leave it out of the plane’s weapons load out, based on combat experience and user feedback, the Air Force smartly reversed course and rushed to fit the massive cannon onto the aircraft. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) brought the upgraded gunship to Warner Robins Air Force Base in Georgia as part of a ceremony to thank the base’s maintenance depot for all its hard work. Among other aircraft, the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex supports the command’s AC-130 gunships and MC-130 special operations transports. What the work at Warner Robins “allowed us to do is to test” aircraft like the modified Stinger II, Air Force Major General Eugene Haase, AFSOC’s vice commander, told the assembled personnel. “You can see the 105 gun there in the back, which is new.” Haase said this particular AC-130W, Spectre 67, was one of an unspecified number of Block 20 Stinger IIs, which are the final “full up round” configuration for the type. In addition to the 105mm howitzer, these W-model gunships have a 30mm automatic cannon and the ability to launch GPS- or laser-guided AGM-176 Griffin missiles and GBU-44/B Viper Strike and GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) glide bombs. In November 2010, Warner Robins delivered the first iteration of the new gunship, then known as the MC-130W Dragon Spear. The aircraft was a sub-variant of the specialized MC-130W Combat Spear cargo aircraft, which was itself a derivative of the standard C-130H Hercules. AFSOC pursued the program in order to quickly get more gunships into service without having to wait for all-new aircraft to arrive. The Dragon Spear conversion involved relatively modular weapon and sensor packages – referred to as the Precision Strike Package (PSP) – which maintenance teams could install with a minimum of work. After receiving the newly armed MC-130W, the Air Force promptly sent the plane off to Iraq to support American troops and their Iraqi partners as part of Operation New Dawn. At the time, the gunship’s only gun armament was the 30mm cannon. Its primary weapon was the 33-pound Griffin. In addition, the aircraft had two turreted day- and night-vision cameras, advanced communications gear, and data links to coordinate and share information with ground troops. Spectre 67’s 105mm cannon., USAF For a period, the Air Force considered buying a stockpile of PSPs so it could simply convert MC-130H and W special operations airlifters as necessary. But while AFSOC was happy with the Dragon Spear concept, it quickly became clear the “modular” package wasn’t necessarily so and had more limited capabilities compared to the gun-armed AC-130H Spectre and AC-130U Spooky II, which both had a powerful 40mm cannon and the 105mm howitzer. Another issue was that the only squadron with MC-130W, the 73rd Special Operations Squadron, remained focused on special operations airlift rather than traditional gunship missions like armed reconnaissance and close air support. During the Dragon Spear’s initial deployment to Iraq, the crew found themselves still hauling cargo in addition to their new missions. On top of that, the Air Force had only just started buying the ammunition and some of the munitions associated with the PSP. “Manning challenges centered on the Dragon Spear’s munitions and shortage of weapons used by the aircraft to include the 30 millimeter (mm) ammunition, special operations precision guided munitions (PGM), and small diameter bombs (SDB),” AFSOC explained in its annual historical review for 2010, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. An earlier block AC-130W without the howitzer., USAF The command responded by changing tack and focusing making the Dragon Spear into a dedicated attack platform, working to expand its arsenal. In 2012, they renamed the aircraft the AC-130W Stinger II and ultimately acquired a fleet of 12 planes. The 73rd officially transitioned to a gunship squadron. In November 2012, an AC-130W dropped its first SDB in combat. That same month, another aircraft test fired an AGM-114P-2 Hellfire missile. Lockheed designed this variant of the iconic laser-guided weapon specifically for high-altitude launches from unmanned aircraft like the MQ-1 Predator. However, this launch envelope also made it ideal for the Stinger II. None of this addressed the limited gun armament and the new gunships began looking more like flying bomb trucks . AC-130W, USAF Historically, the benefit of the side-firing gunship concept has been the aircraft’s ability to fire very precisely at specific points on the ground. With a gun, crews could shift their focus to new targets much faster than with missiles or bombs and lay down a much higher volume of fire, too. As it stands now, the AC-130W’s wing pylons can only carry eight SDBs or Hellfires, though crews can reload the aircraft’s Griffin missile launcher in flight. And cannon shells and artillery rounds are just cheaper than precision guided munitions. An 105mm high-explosive round costs approximately $400, while a Hellfire missile can cost up to $100,000, depending on the variant. From the Vietnam War onward, well-trained gunship crews repeatedly demonstrated their ability to destroy relatively small enemy concentrations while leaving the surrounding areas untouched, even in densely packed urban areas. After its introduction on the AC-130E Pave Aegis gunship in 1972, the airborne 105mm howitzer proved itself to be both particularly deadly and accurate. So, in February 2012, AFSOC had also kicked off a program to add a new, palletized version of the 105mm cannon to the AC-130W. The project, nicknamed Dragon Fire, would make sure the weapon was ready for the up-coming AC-130J Ghostrider , too. Despite the obvious desire for this weapon, the development moved slowly and in public the Air Force initially seemed non-committal. In the face of budget cuts imposed by sequestration, the service may have just wanted to focus time and money on other priorities. As of 2013, as it continued testing the system, AFSOC insisted that only some AC-130Ws and Js would carry the howitzer and that crews would only fit the weapons as necessary. Gunners on the AC-130J “Angry Annie” operate the 105mm cannon during that aircraft’s first live-fire test in January 2017., USAF But in January 2015, Air Force Lieutenant General Bradley Heithold, then head of AFSOC, confirmed he was personally pushing to add the 105mm cannon to both the AC-130W and AC-130J. In an interview with Breaking Defense , he outlined plans for the gunships and future armament options, though he didn’t say how many aircraft he ultimately wanted to have with the big guns. “An AC-130 is a precision strike platform in itself,” he explained. “It precisely delivers very low yield munitions with a 30 [mm gun] and a 105… and they’re very inexpensive to deliver.” During the discussion, Heithold only used the Block 20 nomenclature to refer to notional howitzer-armed AC-130Js. However, given Haase’s comments, it appears this nomenclature may actually apply to any gunship that carries the PSP. It remains unclear how many howitzer systems the Air Force plans to buy. In January 2017, the Block 20 AC-130J prototype “Angry Annie” fired its first rounds from the 105mm howitzer. Laser SDBs fall from the wing of an AC-130J during a test in October 2016., USAF At the same time, the Air Force is pursuing new precision guided munitions and other weapons to add to the gunships in the future. In October 2016, the AC-130J dropped its first Laser-guided SDB in a test run over White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The service expects the up-coming Small Diameter Bomb II to be an option for gunships, as well. And Heithold said in 2015 that proposed Block 40 aircraft might even carry a directed energy weapon , such as a laser or a microwave beam. These systems offer the potential for aircraft like gunships to carry a scalable weapon that can attack very specific targets on the ground, avoiding collateral damage and only causing as much damage commanders desire. In theory, they could operate in a less-lethal mode that causes no lasting damage at all. In addition, they could ease AFSOC’s logistical burden, since they don’t require a steady stream of ammunition to keep firing. With the technology steadily becoming more efficient and physically smaller , the Air Force plans to start tests by 2018 and hopes a feasible energy weapon will be ready for AC-130s by 2020. But, for now, it looks like the 105mm howitzer will continue to be a heavy-hitting and cost-effective part of the AC-130’s arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",The US Military is Formally Ending its Hunt For Joseph Kony and the LRA,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States is in the process of shutting down its military operation hunting for notorious rebel leader Joseph Kony – or is it? The Pentagon’s plan is to create a broader regional mission to respond to regional security threats and the remnants of his Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) certainly qualify. On Oct. 12, 2011, President Barack Obama announced he had dispatched special operation forces to central Africa to help countries in the area neutralize the brutal rebel group, capture its enigmatic leader Kony, and bring him to justice. In an Email to The War Zone, a U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) spokesperson says this effort, known as Operation Observant Compass, will officially come to an end in September 2017. “Where the group once boasted nearly 2,000 fighters, efforts of the African security forces, with U.S. advice and assistance, have reduced the group’s active membership to under 100,” AFRICOM public affairs official Robyn Mack explained. “As a result of this success, the USAFRICOM-led counter-LRA mission known as Operation Observant Compass, will remove U.S. military forces and transition to broader scope security and stability activities that continue the success of our African partners.” AFRICOM quietly announced this decision at the end of March 2017, but did not include the mission’s final timeline. Reports followed about American troops redeploying either within the region or out of the area entirely, mistakenly believing the operation had already come to a complete close. A 2006 file photo of LRA leader Joseph Kony., AP A backwater mission Of course, the move to shrink or shutter the effort has been on the U.S. military’s mind for some time . Shortly after the mission kicked off, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow had insisted to House Foreign Affairs Committee members that the operation would only last “ months ” and wouldn’t “ go on indefinitely .” When it finally wraps up, Operation Observant Compass will have lasted for more than five years. “When I first got here the guys who put the programs together for theater security, they came in and you looked at them like, ‘Man we are spending a lot of money here [on Kony],’” U.S. Army General David Rodriguez told Stars and Stripes in April 2016. “It’s over $100 million every year.” “We are at a point in time where we need to transition that mission,” U.S. Marine Corps’ General Thomas Waldhauser, Rodriguez’s successor, explained to the outlet seven months later . “The number of fighters in that whole organization has gone way, way down to the point where it is almost [at] insignificant levels.” There’s significant evidence to support this position. By the beginning 2017, it was true that, while notorious, Kony’s group had already been dwindling in both size and influence for more than two decades. “LRA fighters have proven themselves highly mobile over the years, exploiting ungoverned spaces in a volatile region to stage abductions and regroup,” the January-March 2017 edition of Special Warfare , the U.S. Army Special Operation’s Command’s official magazine, explained. “Fewer than 200 LRA rebels are still active in parts of Central Africa, where they operate in jungle terrain that covers the size of France.” An American special operator works with Ugandan and Central African Republic troops in 2012., AP Ending a reign of terror When the organization came into being in Uganda in 1987, the predominantly ethnic Acholi rebels could point to legitimate grievances. The year before, Yoweri Museveni had won the civil war that followed the ouster of dictator Idi Amin. Museveni – who has been president ever since and won the latest presidential election in 2016 despite widespread accusations of rigging and voter intimidation – promptly moved to consolidate power and attack rivals. Innocent civilians and ethnic minorities found themselves in the crossfire and many formed militias to fight against the new central authorities. One of these was Alice Auma ’s Holy Spirit Movement (HSM), the predecessor to the LRA. Though there hasn’t been an official confirmation, Kony may be related to Auma and certainly used this connection to garner prominence in the HSM. The LRA’s nominally Christian-inspired beliefs are clearly an outgrowth of her preaching. Auma also claimed to be a spirit-medium, taking on the nom de guerre Lakwena, who she said was the soul of dead Uganda military officer she had channeled to help her cause. Kony ultimately came to espouse similar supernatural abilities, building his own Christian syncretist millenarian cult and effectively branding himself as a messianic figure imbued with the power of the holy spirit who could lead the Acholi people to great victory. Auma ultimately distanced herself from this new LRA due to its violent methods, but the group was able to attract many of the HSM’s Acholi membership who wanted to take greater action against the government in Kampala. Ugandan troops patrol for LRA fighters in Central African Republic in 2012., AP What Kony actually touched off was almost 15 years of brutal fighting, during which the LRA became internationally known for burning villages, killing the adult residents, and kidnapping the children to serve in various roles, most notably fighters and sex slaves. The rebels abducted hundreds of children during this period. In 1994, the Ugandan government attempted, but failed to cut a peace deal and end the group’s reign of terror. Afterwards, Ugandan authorities turned to a two-prong strategy of counter-insurgency operations and amnesties, with mixed results. What was clear was that Kony’s repeated atrocities had begun to turn off many of his supporters. In addition, animosity between Uganda and Sudan had led the government in Khartoum to offer safe haven to the LRA in the 1990s. As a result, the rebels had begun mainly operating outside of Uganda itself. A map of LRA attacks from February 2012 through January 2013 that AFRICOM released as part of its 2013 annual posture statement., AFRICOM Fast forward to 2011 and LRA bands had largely turned to criminality, roving areas of the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and newly independent South Sudan. The fighters were sustaining their operations through theft and poaching, including killing endangered species in under-protected nature reserves, such DRC’s famous Garamba National Park. So, though the group had shrunk significantly, defeating the LRA continued to be a cause célèbre among locals and international humanitarians in Africa’s Great Lakes Region. Most notably, in 2012, Invisible Children, an international group seeking to raise awareness about the rebels and their victims, released a controversial viral online campaign called “ Kony 2012 ” that called for his capture and prosecution at the international criminal court. AP Shifting to a broader operation But as Rodriguez noted in 2016, the Pentagon was never entirely sold on the mission. “That’s not that important to us,” was how he described the response from his subordinates in charge of planning regional missions. As part of Operation Observant Compass, American special operators did gather and share intelligence information with the African Union’s Regional Task Force (AU-RTF), coordinate logistics support, and conduct psychological operations pushing LRA members to abandon their fight and rejoin society. Separately, U.S. regular and special operations troops trained and advised African forces. With the Pentagon’s support, the AU-RTF killed or captured four of five top LRA leaders, with only Kony remaining at large. Still, there never seemed to be enough resources to support the mission with actual U.S. military assets . Flying from a forward operating base at Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport, contractor-operated cargo and surveillance aircraft, as well as helicopters, eventually became the key components of the American assistance mission. American forces and private contractors maintained a secretive infrastructure of small air strips, out-stations, and command centers to support the operations. The Pentagon’s desire always seems to have been for a broader presence in the Great Lakes Region that could respond to various crises and work with partners to improve security throughout the area.  Sometime in 2013, AFRICOM renamed the main American element at Entebbe, which had been called the AFRICOM Counter-Lord’s Resistance Army Control Element (ACCE), to the much more generic sounding Special Operations Command Forward-Central Africa (SOCFWD-CA). This brought the moniker in line with the command’s two other regional special operations units in east and north and west Africa, both of which were running general theater security cooperation missions – Operations Octave Shield and Juniper Shield respectively. A U.S. Marine talks to Ugandan troops during a training exercise in 2012., USMC There is definitely no shortage of security challenges in the area for this reformulated unit. In 2012, rebels overthrew the government in Central Africa Republic, leading to a series of civil conflicts . International peacekeepers are still trying to provide space for a long-term resolution to the fighting, which has led to at least 5,000 civilian deaths and driven more than 400,000 people from their homes. Since December 2013, another civil war had raged in South Sudan after President Salva Kiir accused Vice President Riek Machar of attempting a coup. Both men had fought together in the country’s struggle for independence from Sudan. And then there’s the persistent violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern provinces, where various rebel groups have consistently challenged the authority of the country’s central government. In January 2017, armed fighters crossed over the border from Uganda, threatening to rekindle tensions in the resource-rich North Kivu province. On top of that, political upheaval has taken a number of violent turns in Burundi since 2015 . Despite this being the issue that touched off the crisis in the first place, in December 2016, President Pierre Nkurunziza said he still intended to run for reelection if the country’s legislators pursued changes to the country’s constitution and removed presidential term limits and “if the people request it.” In 2015, Rwanda also controversially changed term restrictions after a national referendum, enabling long-time leader Paul Kagame to potentially remain in power until 2034. There have been concerns this could eventually spark a similar dangerous impasse in that country. Ugandan troops take cover during a live-fire exercise in 2014., USAF Don’t forget about the LRA Those involved in the fight against the LRA aren’t particularly thrilled about having to share already limited resources with all of these other potential hot spots. There are fears, especially in Uganda where memories of the group’s atrocities are still fresh, the shift in focus could give Kony and his followers space to rebound, too. “Now that the Uganda government is stopping the search for LRA, it might become a mercenary force that can be used by any other groups to terrorize civilians,” Norbert Mao, a Uganda politician and former chairman of the country’s heavily Acholi Gulu District, told the Guardian. “They can explode any time and if we keep ignoring them, we shall pay the price.” “The LRA has always taken advantage of any lapses in combat to regroup and reorganize,” Lino Owor Ogora, head of the Foundation for Justice and Development Initiatives, based in Gulu, told IRIN . “It would be unfortunate if the LRA returned because they were allowed too.” USAF However, a broader regional focus doesn’t mean the Pentagon would automatically stop supporting its Great Lakes partners in fighting the LRA regardless of whether or not the group is truly on its way to a final defeat. Any central African security strategy simply could not ignore the group’s continued activities, which are a prime example of the dangerous nexus of trans-national criminal enterprises and terrorism. “It is also important to note that U.S. military effort is only but one part of the counter-LRA effort,” Mack, the command spokesperson, explained in her Email. “AFRICOM remains committed to African partners and regional security, and we will continue to help strengthen partner nation defense capabilities through military-to-military engagements, programs and exercises in coordination with the Department of State and African partner nations.” So, while Operation Observant Compass may be coming to a close, it seems likely that American special operators and other U.S. government agencies will continue to keep a close eye on the LRA, along with other regional issues. And keep an eye out for a new, standing regional counter-terrorism or security cooperation mission after things officially shut down in September 2017.

On April 28, 2017, various accounts on Twitter began showing at least three Stryker eight-wheeled armored carriers traveling in a convoy with members of the People’s Protection Units, better known by their Kurdish acronym YPG. The U.S. forces were reportedly in the vicinity of Al-Darbasiyah, also known as Dirbêsiyê, a town near the Turkish border in the semi-autonomous region that Kurdish groups refer to as Rojava . Along with large U.S. flags, the vehicles had tan- or sand-colored camouflage schemes and one carried a minigun. Another featured a large communications antenna. This made them visually distinct from four other Strykers that appeared further west near the contested town of Manbij in March 2017. We don’t know if the examples in are new additions to the theater or just newly painted and rearmed, but there is some evidence of the standard green paint job underneath the new coating. Earlier in April 2017, the U.S. Air Force did expand an airstrip near Kobani to allow C-17 cargo planes to step up deliveries ahead of a likely up-coming assault into ISIS’ de facto capital of Raqqa. Each one of the four-engine transports can carry up to three combat-ready Strykers. But regardless of how many Strykers there are in the country or how they got there in the first place, it’s their apparent role that’s most significant. Though the Pentagon is primarily focused on fighting ISIS throughout the region, these mobile special operations elements seem to be spending a significant amount of time just keeping the peace between America’s partners in that counter-terrorism campaign, namely the YPG and Turkey. When the first Strykers showed up in Syria last month, The War Zone and others assessed the situation as elite American troops successfully heading off a potentially deadly confrontation between the two parties over Manbij. Now, they seem to be attempting to dissuade Turkish forces from pushing into Syria east of the Euphrates River . YPG forces in Syria., AP The core problem is that Turkish authorities see the YPG and a slew of other Kurdish factions at home, as well as in Iraq and Syria, as dangerous terrorists and separatists. Since 1984, Ankara has fought a domestic counter-insurgency campaign against the Kurdish Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has both practical and ideological ties to the YPG. For its part, the United States has officially designated the PKK as terrorists and in 2007 the Pentagon began directly supplying intelligence for Turkish strikes and raids against the militants in northern Iraq as part of a mission called Operation Nomad Shadow. However, officials in Washington viewed the YPG as a separate entity. As the U.S.-led fight against ISIS expanded, the United States began to see the group as a reliable and capable partner in Syria and potentially the lead element of a larger force to liberate Raqqa. “I mean, I’ve talked to their [YPG] leaders, and we’ve watched them operate,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, the head of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), told reporters on March 1, 2017. “They continually reassure us that they have no desire to attack Turkey, that they’re not a threat to Turkey.” American special operations forces in Syria in May 2016, including one individual wearing a YPJ patch., DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP/Getty Images The Pentagon has repeatedly tried to find a middle ground with Turkey on the issue and be sensitive to the country’s point of view. When Turkish officials complained in May 2016 about American special operators wearing the insignia of the YPJ – the all-female counterpart to the YPG – American commanders swiftly curtailed the practice. Three months later, the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition acquiesced to a major Turkish intervention into Syria, known as Operation Euphrates Shield, even though its goals were not entirely aligned with the counter-terrorism fight. But with Syria’s civil war opening the door for Kurdish factions to make significant territorial gains, along with its active partnership with the United States, Turkey has become more and more worried about the long-term structure of the region. And the presence of American special operations forces in the region hasn’t stopped Turkey from taking an increasingly hard-line stance broadly against Kurdish groups along its borders. Turkish air and ground forces have launched numerous missions into Syria to either block or directly attack the YPG and other Kurdish groups, often without consent from CJTF-OIR. Tensions on Syria’s northern border between Kurdish forces and the Turkish military have escalated dramatically in recent days. , AP “As you know, Turkey conducted airstrikes in northern Syria’s Hasakah province the night before last, resulting in the loss of life of our partnered forces in the fight against ISIS,” U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian, a CJTF-OIR spokesman, said during a press conference on April 26, 2017. “As you’ve seen, the strikes that the Turkish Air Force conducted last night also killed several Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in this vicinity of Sinjar. … We’re troubled by that.” According to the Pentagon, American troops were unharmed in the strikes. Though they were six miles from the target area, Dorrian said Turkish forces put them in an “unsafe” predicament. The situation looks set to get more tense in near term. On March 30, 2017, the Turkish military had announced Operation Euphrates Shield had officially ended . However, Turkey’s military moves along its border with Syria and the latest attacks inside the country stoked fears that these moves could disrupt the push to eject ISIS from Raqqa, putting its concerns about increased Kurdish autonomy or a future independent Kurdistan over the need to contain the brutal terrorist group. Turkish Ministry of Defense Anonymous Turkish authorities effectively confirmed the country’s priorities to Reuters in March 2017. “Our soldiers will not be fighting together with people who shot us and killed our soldiers and are trying to kill us,” one unnamed official told the news outlet. “We told them [the United States] there are many alternatives for Raqqa and they didn’t disagree,” another explained. It’s not clear how or when the two sides will settle these issues. This is hardly the first time Turkey has spurned its long-time ally and fellow NATO member over military activities it sees as benefiting Kurdish rebels. When Saddam Hussein launched an offensive in Kurdish areas in northern Iraq in 1996, Turkey refused to allow American warplanes to stage strikes from their territory. Seven years later, the government in Ankara blocked the Pentagon’s plans to use Incirlik Air Base to launch a second front in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom. CENTCOM via the Freedom of Information Act Unfortunately, it also seems unlikely the U.S.-led coalition will be able to successfully defeat ISIS in Syria without finding some sort of resolution. Turkey is a key part of the program to train and equip so-called Vetted Syrian Opposition (VSO) groups to fight ISIS  and hosts a number of facilities supporting the project, not least of which is Incirlik. And though this effort has spanned at least five countries, as of August 2015, the coalition’s Syria Engagement Team only had representatives situated in Turkey and Jordan to coordinate with rebel groups across the border, according a heavily redacted report the author previously obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. On top of that, Turkish officers are part of the multi-national Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR), which coordinates all special operations activities against Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. At least of two individuals from the Turkey’s military were in attendance at a ceremony for members of the task force’s headquarters at an undisclosed location on April 14, 2017. Members of SOJTF-OIR, including members of the Turkish military, attend a ceremony in April 2017. , U.S. Army Not surprisingly, Turkey has favored ethnic Turkmen rebels over the Kurds. “We told them we have enough forces, enough Free Syrian Army,” one of the anonymous Turkish officials declared to Reuters. Neither the United States nor Turkey has seemed willing to make any concessions, leading officials in Anakara to even mend strained ties with Russia in order to pursue their specific goals. The YPG themselves seem undeterred by the developments, looking to continuing working with American forces battling ISIS around Raqqa in a build-up to an all-out assault on the city. Turkey’s offensive “is not an unexpected development,” Sipan Hemo, the YPG General Commander, told Al-Monitor . “We noted how the American troops working with us were upset that they couldn’t stop these Turkish attacks.” Kurdish fighters taking a break in Syria., AP The deployment of U.S. special operators and their Strykers to Dirbêsiyê makes it clear American commanders haven’t given up on this strategy just yet. But the time spent acting as peacekeepers can only detract from the campaign against ISIS and could ultimately give the terrorists space to regroup and counter-attack, not to mention put them at increasing risk of a disasterous friendly fire incident. “If these attacks continue, the Raqqa operation will suffer, as we will have to fight on two fronts,” Hemo conceded. “Certainly Russia, Iran, and Syria will be happy, because they all want the [U.S.-backed] Raqqa operation to fail.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Armored Vehicles Land Special Operations Stryker"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2020",Freighter Full of Sheep Accidentally Sinks Russian Spy Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian spy ship has sunk after a collision with a freighter carrying sheep near Turkey’s Bosphorus strait. The accident underscores the busy nature of the strategic entry point into the Black Sea and why Russia is actively seeking military bases along the Mediterranean. On the morning of April 27, 2017, the Russian Navy vessel Liman , officially a “research ship” assigned to the country’s Black Sea Fleet, hit another vessel off the Turkish coast and suffered a catostrophic hull breach. Dense fog in the area at the time was likely a factor. The Turkish Coast Guard rescued all 78 members of the crew. “All of the crew members of the Black Sea Fleet’s research vessel Liman are safe and sound and are preparing for evacuation from a Turkish rescue vessel to a Russian ship,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. Russian authorities initially identified the other ship as the “ Ashot-7 .” However, widespread media reports said the Togo-flagged Youzarsif-H , carrying nearly 9,000 sheep from Romania en route to Jordan, was actually the other vessel involved in the incident. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KJvJmk8bTv0 Despite its official classification, the Liman , a Project 861 Moma -class, is designed to gather intelligence above and below the waves. The ships have radars, hydro-acoustic listening gear, and other, unspecified “reconnaissance equipment,” according to RT . These sensors allow the crew to locate, track, and scoop up information about both surface ships and submarines. Before the accident, Russia had three of these Polish-built Soviet-era ships, which have a displacement of 1,560 tons, still in service. Collisions and other accidents in and around the narrow Bosphorus are not unheard of. A major shipping route and the only way in and out of the Black Sea, civilian and military ships frequently make the passage. A list on Wikipedia describes some of more than 450 incidents, which included numerous wrecks and fatalities, which occurred between 1953 and 2002. An undated photo of Liman., TASS For the Kremlin, the route is unfortunately the only way to get from its bases along the Black Sea out into the Mediterranean and beyond. And since Moscow forcefully annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and began actively supporting rebel groups in that country’s eastern provinces, this strategic complexities of the arrangement have only become more pronounced for the Russian Navy. Of the countries that sit along the Black Sea, three are NATO members – Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. Ukraine and Georgia both have tense relations with Russia and routinely conduct military exercises with their American counterparts. After Moscow forcefully annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region and then began supporting separatists in that country’s eastern provinces, the United States only stepped up these practice sessions. The Kremlin responded with increasing harassment and monitoring of U.S. Navy ships. In 2016, Liman itself sortied out to keep an eye on Exercise Sea Breeze along Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Separately, since 2012, Russia has had increasingly worrisome spats with Turkey over Moscow’s support of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. While the Black and Mediterranean Seas are international bodies of water, the Bosphorus is entirely under Turkish control. An international agreement, the Montreux Convention, allows, but restricts the movement of naval vessels through the strait. This complicated arrangement was one of the main reasons the Kremlin stood behind Assad, even as his campaign against anti-government rebels became increasingly brutal. Soviet authorities had signed a deal with Assad’s father, Hafez Al Assad, to operate a small garrison and service ships at the port of Tartus. Russia kept that base after the Soviet Union’s collapse. After rescuing the Assad regime from potential collapse, Russia has not only been basically gifted the naval base, but they have also been allowed to expand it drastically , taking over new docks that can support any vessel in the Russian fleet. Then, in late 2015, as observers continued to spot Russian naval vessels carrying military vehicles and other equipment through the passage on their way to Syria, there were real concerns that Turkey might try to cut off Moscow’s access to the vital waterway. Had this happened, it would have caused major disruptions to Russia’s activities in Syria. The only remaining supply routes would have been a circuitous sea path from country’s northern European bases via the Strait of Gibraltar or much more limited deliveries by air. On top of that, depending on where ships like Liman were located at the time, it would have prevented ships them from responding to new operational needs or short-notice crises in or out of the Black Sea. Of course, the two countries have improved their diplomatic relationship since then, finding common ground in the fight against Islamic State terrorists. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim expressed “sadness” over Liman ’s fate in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry Medvedev, according to the Turkish Anadolu news agency. Another Moma -class ship, the Jupiter , at sea with the Soviet Navy in 1987., DOD Still, this hasn’t solved the fundamental issues and officials in Moscow have been steadily looking for additional and more reliable facilities throughout the Mediterranean. The War Zone previously deeply explored the Kremlin’s outreach in both Libya and Egypt , which has included major discussions about basing or access to facilities. These requirements are only likely to increase as Russian forces continue operations in Syria and look poised to expand operations and cooperation into North Africa. In October 2016, the Russian Navy’s troublesome aircraft carrier Kuznetsov already had to refuel at sea off North Africa after Malta refused to allow it into port as it headed for the Syrian coast. The next month, the ship hosted Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar, who appears amenable to Russian military assistance. In turn, American officials accused the Kremlin of only supporting Haftar in order to secure access to ports the rogue general controls along Libya’s eastern shores. The loss of Liman in a simple accident can only serve to reinforce this existing desire to find additional ways to avoid the Bosphorus altogether, regardless of any diplomatic considerations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The USMC Is Interested In This Crazy Speedboat That Transforms Into A Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It sounds like something straight out of a James Bond movie or an episode of G.I. Joe. U.S. Marines arrive on a beach inside a speedboat that transforms into a submarine. But this isn’t a trailer for a new Hollywood blockbuster or a page out of a Batman comic. It’s part of real life U.S. Navy and Marine technology demonstration . On April 17, 2017, the two services kicked off the Ship-To-Shore Maneuver Exploration and Experimentation (S2ME2) Advanced Naval Technology Exercise 2017 (ANTX17) at Camp Pendleton in California. Defense contractors joined U.S. military personnel to demonstrate more than 100 different pieces of high-tech equipment , including a unique craft called the HyperSub. “Because it is a speedboat, the HyperSub can be deployed quickly and conveniently from nearly any dock, beach or other typical launch location,” HSP Technologies explains on its website . “Once on the water, the HyperSub can quickly transit to a desired location and, with the flip of a few switches, transition into a submarine.” The boat is just over 45 feet long and has a dry weight of 30,000 pounds. HSP brought a black painted prototype, dubbed Project X, overland to Camp Pendleton on a trailer. On the surface, two 480-horsepower diesel engines let it cruise at 30 miles per hour while carrying up to 6,000 pounds of cargo. Marines stand on top of the HyperSub at S2ME2 ANTX17., HSP Technologies The basic dimensions are similar in many ways with rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIB) that the U.S. military operates. However, the HyperSub is slower and heavier than many of those craft. And RHIBs don’t have the ability to submerge partially or fully beneath the waves like HSP’s product. Underwater, two Innerspace Corporation electrically-powered thrusters – the same types used on a number of small research submarines and unmanned undersea vehicles – propel the HyperSub up to six miles per hour. Battery and life support systems allow for an average of 12 hours of underwater operation, according to the Florida-based manufacturer. With a snorkel, the boat can continue to sail semi-submerged with its air-breathing diesel motors while recharging its batteries. HSP already offers security cameras as an optional extra, but the craft is big enough to accommodate more powerful military grade surveillance equipment and light weapons, such as machine guns and grenade launchers. One of the most obvious missions for a HyperSub with these systems would be special operations tasks, from infiltrating teams of elite troops to scouting hostile coastlines for secretive missions. The results of the tests at Camp Pendleton might spark interest within U.S. Special Operations Command, where seabasing and other maritime requirements are still emerging. https://youtube.com/watch?v=61IF-vcD-qo Marine Corps reconnaissance elements could be interested in the craft’s covert capabilities for reconnoitering landing sites before an amphibious assault and for forward deploying frogmen and special operations teams. On top of that, the HyperSub in its current form or the same basic layout in a larger incarnation could perform more conventional duties, like carrying Marines ashore during an amphibious assault or ferrying supplies to an established beachhead or forward base. This seemed to be what the Navy and Marine Corps had in mind for HyperSub’s role in the S2ME2 ANTX17 exercise. “A panel of government subject experts stated that the Hyper-sub ‘has the potential to significantly advance capabilities related to Ship to Shore manuver [sic; maneuver] concepts’” HSP wrote on its Facebook page on April 26, 2017. It is “a capability that we believe the Hyper-Sub is well suited for.” Yes, it comes in white!, HSP Technologies For decades, the very idea of an opposed amphibious landing has become more and more precarious. So, since the late 1980s, the Marine Corps has been studying ways to both speed up deployment of personnel from ships to beachheads and make them less vulnerable during that transit period. The appearance of increasingly deadly anti-ship cruise missiles, long-range maneuvering ballistic missiles, integrated air defenses, guided tube and rocket artillery, and more continues to threaten the ability of Marines to conduct these signature expeditionary operations. “Throughout my entire career, maritime supremacy was guaranteed, air supremacy was guaranteed,” Marine Corps Colonel Dan Sullivan, a participant in the exercise, told CBS This Morning . “Now … the pressure’s on.” HSP Technologies In future scenarios, large amphibious ships would have to keep further off shore and Marines might have difficulty just reaching the beachhead in the first place. Once there, they would have to contend with enemies who are also fielding more and more advanced weapons and other gear. As Sullivan noted in his interview, even irregular actors such as Islamic State terrorists are employing potentially revolutionary equipment, including small armed drones. HyperSub or a larger troop carrying craft based on the same principle might help hide Marines as they approached the shore. It could then sprint the final distance on the surface at top speed. Other systems on display at S2ME2 ANTX17 were clearly designed to increase the survivability of Marines in an amphibious attack, or simply remove them from the line of fire entirely. In addition to HSP’s hybrid boat, contractors showed off remote-controlled AAV-7 amphibious tracked vehicles carrying tracked and wheeled unmanned vehicles. Those battlefield robots had their own machine guns, small hex-copter surveillance drones, and mine-clearing rollers. Other unmanned air, sea, and land vehicles featured prominently in the event, too. All of this would help keep Marines out of danger during the initial landing, which would be the most dangerous part of any waterborne assault. It’s not clear how well HyperSub actually fits into the Marine Corps’ future plans. This was probably the reason for inviting HSP to the event in the first place. Unfortunately, in its prototype form, the craft has no sensors, weapons, defensive gear and armor, or any other mission equipment. Every one of those systems would add weight and potentially bulk, degrading the boat’s overall performance above and below the water. The Ghost super-cavitating boat, another start-up design still looking for a U.S. military contract., Juliet Marine Systems In many ways, HSP’s attempts to market the HyperSub as a military vessel mirror the efforts of Juliet Marine Systems to pitch their similar-sized Ghost super-cavitating boat . Since 2007, the company has been trying to garner interest in their design within the halls of the Pentagon. In 2014, the firm even proposed a scaled up, corvette-sized version as a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) replacement. So far, the Navy has been less than keen to test the Ghost and Juliet has resisted smaller offers from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in order to protect its proprietary design. Still, HyperSub inventor Reynolds Marion seemed optimistic his unique craft could be a benefit to Marines in his own interview with CBS during the S2ME2 ANTX17 media day. “I just always figured it would be a good idea as a kid to be able to have a really cool speed boat that could go out and dive when you wanted to dive,” he told the network’s Carter Evans. Ultimately, it will be for the Marines to say whether HSP’s product seems useful in a military context. It may turn out that the real market for these unique ships are billionaire oligarchs who have gotten bored with their mega yachts ‘ current stable of submarines and fast-boats.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 21, 2019",The USAF’s F-35s in Estonia Are a Message to Russia and Critics,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter has made its first trip to Estonia. Though small, the deployment is an important statement to Russia, America’s NATO allies, and critics of the often vexing aircraft . On April 25, 2017, U.S. Air Forces in Europe formally announced that two F-35As stealthy fighter jets and approximately 20 airmen had arrived at Ämari Air Base in the Baltic country’s Harjumaa County. The base sits less than 150 miles west of the Russian border and about 300 miles northeast of Russia’s geographically separated enclave of Kaliningrad. The pilots, maintenance specialists, and other support staff came from the active component 34th Fighter Squadron and the Air Force Reserve’s 466th Fighter Squadron, both based at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Earlier in April 2017, a total of eight F-35s and 250 airmen touched down at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom for training missions across Europe. It’s not clear whether the 20-person total included the crew of a KC-135 tanker from the Air Force’s U.K.-based 100th Air Refueling Wing, which also deployed to support the mission, security forces to guard the jets, or any other personnel. As it often does, the Pentagon insisted that the surprise move was long-planned, had no relationship with any current events, and was just like any other training exercise with a NATO. Neither the Estonians nor the Russians seemed inclined to agree. “The introduction of the newest fighter to Europe, with its state of the art systems will help the alliance maintain the fundamental sovereign rights of all nations,” Estonian Defense Minister Margus Tsahkna said at a ceremony filled with international press announcing the new arrivals. “Hosting such advanced aircraft is certainly a big recognition to Ämari Air Base and to the Estonian air force as a whole.” Guards protect one of two F-35As that arrived in Estonia today., RAIGO PAJULA/AFP/Getty Images It seems highly unlikely that Tsahkna wasn’t alluding to Russian aggression in nearby Ukraine. The Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania most recently gained independence from Moscow after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. All three were particularly concerned about Russia’s forceful annexation of the Crimea region in 2014, followed by the Kremlin’s active support for rebels fighting the government in Kiev. After the invasion of Crimea, the Pentagon quickly deployed other aircraft and ground troops along NATO’s eastern flank and stepped up regular training exercises and aerial surveillance missions in close coordination with all of the alliance’s members. America’s whole-of-government effort to calm its European allies became known as the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), while the U.S. military dubbed its part Operation Atlantic Resolve. For Estonia, in September 2014, the potential for serious conflict became frighteningly visible when Russian agents arrested – or kidnapped – an Estonian intelligence officer. After a year of pronouncements and negotiations, Russia swapped Eston Kohver for Aleksei Dressen , who Estonian officials had accused of treasonous activities on behalf of Moscow. So, for the Baltic States, the fear of a Russian intervention is very real. Earlier in 2017, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian special operations forces joined their American counterparts in West Virginia for practice sessions focusing on operations behind enemy lines and fighting insurgents. USAF The deployment of American troops with high-tech weaponry like the F-35 is a morale boost if nothing else. And the significance of the ERI and Operation Atlantic Resolve hasn’t been lost on Russian officials, either. “This is an action that threatens our interests, our security,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after the U.S. Army sent troops to Poland, with plans to move units into the Baltic States, in January 2017. “Russia doesn’t pose any threat to Estonia nor any other NATO member state,” Alexander Yakovenko, the country’s ambassador in the United Kingdom, told The Daily Mail . Russia regularly touts advances in both fighter aircraft and air defenses, especially long-range surface-to-air missiles and radars, as a veiled threat to NATO warplanes. There are S-400 SAMs in Kaliningrad and elsewhere in Western Russia , as well as plans to get the first batteries of the newest S-500 missile system into service by the end of 2017. On top of that, Russian Air Force and Navy planes routinely probe the borders of alliance members and separate, but still western-aligned countries like Finland and Sweden. Various advanced members of Sukhoi’s Flanker fighter family make frequent appearances, as do Tu-22M Backfire and Tu-95/142 Bear bombers. Moscow regularly sends Bears in the opposite direction, too. After the F-35s arrived in the United Kingdom, Tu-95s made their own shows of force off the coast of Alaska . Sometimes the incidents have been more threatening or dangerous. In August 2014, Russian fighters chased an Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signal-snooping spy plane out of the Baltic Sea and inadvertently into Swedish airspace. Eight months later, another Russian pilot barrel-rolled over an RC-135U Combat Sent, which was in the same area likely gathering details on the Kremlin’s air defense radar network. Oh, and then there’s Moscow’s harassment of U.S. Navy warships much further south in the Black Sea. In the past, the Air Force has sent F-22 stealth fighters and other fighter jets to the region in shows of force. To make up for the limited capabilities of all three Baltic air forces, NATO members send fighters to police the region’s airspace on a rotational basis, too. Having the advanced F-35s in the area could send the message the Pentagon continues to be serious about responding to these incidents. From Estonia, the jets could patrol a not insignificant portion of Russia’s border with NATO. But the threat of steadily improving, integrated anti-aircraft weapons and advanced fighter jets were also among the main reasons the Pentagon has been pushing for the F-35 in the first place. The Air Force has consistently argued that 4th generation fighters would be unable to survive any future, hypothetical shooting war in Europe or Asia against a near-peer adversary like Russia or China. “The question of an F-15 and an F-16 in a European scenario on its own,  neither one is going to do it,” Air Force Lieutenant General Mark Nowland, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, said earlier in April 2017, according to DefenseNews . “They both are going to get shot down and die.” However, it’s doubtful the jet’s low observable features will come into play during this particular deployment. Official pictures and videos show crews had fitted the jets with radar reflectors so they would appear on even civilian radars and make the  transit to the United Kingdom and onward to continental Europe as safe as possible. It also means the Russians most likely won’t get a chance to study the jet’s actual radar signature. Of course, in any actual combat scenario, the aircraft would not carry these devices. It might actually be the F-35 that ends up scanning Russian defenses along the Baltic. Lockheed designed the F-35’s mission computer to collect, analyze, and display electronic signatures from radars and other air defense assets to help pilots detect and avoid them during missions. With the ability to gather this information passively, depending on how functional the Joint Strike Fighters’ systems are, they may be able to act like small spy planes and scoop up various details during their upcoming training exercises. That being said, pilots may opt not to use all of the sensors available to them in order to prevent the Kremlin from finding out too much about those capabilities, too. The F-35’s advanced APG-81 AESA radar in particular would be of special interest to Russian intelligence. But it can operate in low-probability of intercept mode, and possibly even in heavily degraded training modes that would not compromise its full capabilities. That is if the jets’ pilots are allowed to turn it on at all. Regardless, critics have argued the Joint Strike Fighters may never be truly ready for combat. So, beyond just sending the advanced planes to stare down Russia, the Air Force’s deployment of F-35A to the United Kingdom and then onward to Estonia are important milestones for the program in general. In the face of serious cost overruns and delays, the Air Force in particular, which plans to ultimately buy a huge force of more than 1,750 of the stealthy jets, has been keen to show the aircraft are ready for combat. This push has only escalated since the service controversially declared initial operational capability (IOC) with the jets in August 2016. Putting up impressive numbers at major air combat exercises like Red Flag are one thing, but they can’t compare to actual operational deployments like the visits to the United Kingdom and Estonia when it comes to getting the jets out in the field, away from their usual creature comforts. USAF On April 24, this display of the F-35s abilities became even more important when the Government Accountability Office, one of the U.S. governments top watchdogs, published its latest report on the program. The nearly 50 page review warned about the potential for costs to keep climbing, despite attempts by the Pentagon to stabilize the project’s final price tag. “Cascading F-35 testing delays could cost the Department of Defense (DOD) over a billion dollars more than currently budgeted to complete development of the F-35 baseline program,” GAO stated up front in the review’s introduction. “The program’s projections are based on anticipated test point achievements and not historical data.” The investigators disagreed with the F-35 Joint Program Office’s estimations of how far delays in testing would set back the beginning of operational test and evaluation and how much the schedule slip would cost. Officials working on the Joint Strike Fighter insist the delay will only amount to 5 months and require an additional $532 million to complete development of the jet’s Block 3F software and mission systems. GAO concluded it would actually take an entire year and at least another $1.2 billion to move forward. Running off more than 8 million lines of code, the F-35’s computer brain is responsible for everything from flight handling to detecting and tracking targets and threats in the air and on the ground to diagnosing malfunctions and breakages. The Joint Program Office wants to start work on the next iteration of the system, Block 4, sometime in 2018, but needs to complete work on 3F first in order to know what works and what doesn’t. GAO is of the opinion that the latest delays would push back plans for full-rate production beyond April 2019. USAF At the same time, the F-35 has become a major issue for President Donald Trump and his administration. On the campaign trail and after his election victory , he singled out the aircraft as just one troubled U.S. government project that he would fix. In an interview with the Associated Press on April 24, 2017, Trump reiterated his claim that it was his personal intervention after taking office that saved the program hundreds of millions of dollars. “I saved $725 million on the 90 planes,” Trump said. “Now you know that’s a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of – it’s between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order.” Most experts agree that the deal with defense contractor Lockheed Martin likely only involved a smaller unit cost , something that the Pentagon had long expected to happen as overall production numbers increased. Whether or not Trump’s attempts to exert pressure on the F-35 by threatening to pursue an alternative design – and potentially leaking key details to competitor Boeing – have had any impact remains up for debate. This budgeting and politicking probably don’t matter much to officials in Estonia, who are clearly thrilled to have America’s newest fighter jet in their country. Whether the Russians get the intended message is another issue entirely. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces F-35 Fighters Stealth U.S. Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2019",The U.S. Army Wants to Call in Cyber Attacks Like Artillery Fire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During a recent experimental exercise, the U.S. Army put a pair of specially equipped dune buggies through a series of tests. Though the two vehicles’ main job is to find and knock out small drones – an emerging threat to American troops on future battlefields that The War Zone has written about extensively – engineers hope they’ll be able to perform a completely new mission in future, calling in cyber attacks like artillery strikes. The all terrain vehicles, dubbed “Hunter” and “Killer,” took part in the 2017 iteration of the Army’s Maneuver Fires Integrated Experiment (MFIX). The practice sessions ran from April 3 to April 13 at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. “This is just the first stage of the experiment,” Scott Patton, a science and technology strategist at the Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), told the service’s reporters during the event. “We came from the last MFIX and a lot of the feedback.” The results were Hunter and Killer. The Hunter configuration has equipment to detect and track targets, including small unmanned aircraft. The Killer system, not surprisingly, has gear to jam or otherwise disrupt their operation, causing them to crash. A US Army Special Forces soldier drives an MRZR during a training exercise., US Army Pairing the setups with the approximately 1,500 pound Polaris MRZR tactical all-terrain vehicles makes this capability more useful for light infantry, airmobile and airborne troops. These buggies have good off-road mobility, can fit inside some large helicopters, and are air-droppable from larger cargo aircraft. The Army’s other vehicle-mounted counter-drone systems need trucks or Stryker armored vehicles to move them around the battlefield. “How do you move it? How do you airdrop it? Can we move it somewhere rapidly for the light fighters?” is how Patton described questions soldiers had asked his team in 2016, prompting the work in the first place. He said the Battlefield Operating Systems Suites (BOSS) team at AMRDEC had the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions in mind when they crafted the two designs. Special operations forces could potentially be interested in such an electronic warfare weapon for the same reasons. A view of the displays inside either the Hunter or Killer vehicle – not the ability to send and receive Emails and messages., US Army But the engineers have much bigger plans for Hunter and Killer than just knocking down quad-copters. Much of the equipment, such as the infrared cameras and radio detection gear, has broader applications. AMRDEC described Hunter specifically as an intelligence gathering platform that could also function as a forward observer for artillery fire and airstrikes. The same computer software that helps pinpoint small drones and their control stations could, in theory, relay that location information to artillery units or pilots with GPS-guided munitions. With a nod toward growing Army activities in the Pacific and potential interest in the U.S. Marine Corps, the BOSS group noted troops could send similar targeting data to ships sitting off shore with rockets and missiles . And then there’s the matter of mobile cyber warfare. The Killer vehicle reportedly has undefined “cyber” capabilities and the ability to direct unspecified space-based systems. According to the Army, a soldier might eventually be able to call in a cyber attack just like an artillery strike. A look at the controller for the Hunter’s systems., US Army Of course, as the future of war becomes more and more reliant on networks of computers, the U.S. military and intelligence agencies have become more and more interested in both defending their own and attacking enemy computer systems. Still, not knowing what these mobile systems are or what they’re supposed to do, it’s hard to say what this might mean for American troops or how they might fight in the future. From what little we know, the offensive side of these operations can involve complex efforts to infect networks with viruses or other malicious software, such those programs in a trove of Central Intelligence Agency tools called Vault7 , which Wikileaks posted online in March 2017. However, since many target networks aren’t connected to the internet, individuals have to use some type of physical connection actually install the software on the target computer, either knowingly or unknowingly. American officials reportedly got the infamous Stuxnet virus into Iranian computer networks by having agents bring infected thumb drives into certain facilities. There have been unconfirmed that the United States or one of its allies may have launched a similar operation against North Korea’s missile program , reportedly causing or otherwise leading to the failure of a liquid-fueled ballistic missile on April 15, 2017. Former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden leaked details about remote activities focused on intercepting communications to glean intelligence. In cooperation with the National Security Agency, American forces now routinely conducts targeted strikes on terrorists and militants by using these systems to track specific cell phone signals , too. US Army military intelligence soldiers set up an antenna to grab voice communications during an exercise in 2015., US Army In addition, there are concerns that cyber warfare in future military operations could include spoofing GPS signals or otherwise disrupting satellites.  Russian forces and their allies in Syria and Ukraine have actively employed electronic warfare systems, which could include these capabilities. It seems more likely that Killer has similar gear that can find various signals and then jam or intercept those transmissions, or other intelligence gathering capabilities, rather than some sort of Hollywood-esque mobile hacking arrangement. Army military intelligence “ cyber soldiers ” have already experimented with using similar skills in various exercises. Even so, the Pentagon itself is still in the process of defining exactly what a cyber war entails, whether the operations are offensive or defensive. The same goes for operations involving satellites in space, which are now inherently intertwined with how many computer networks on the ground function and communicate with each other. “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists,” Douglas Loverro, then deputy assistant secretary of Defense for space policy, said in October 2016 . “Probably people are going to die on the ground where nobody’s going to die in space.” Loverro was talking primarily about a hostile power taking out a classified spy satellite, but the same complexities could apply to communications nodes. In 2007 , China shot a missile at an old weather satellite, sparking concerns about what that country might do in an actual conflict, but also immediately creating a cloud of space junk that was potentially dangerous to other orbiting bodies. Hunter and Killer on the move during MFIX 2017., US Army Patton and the BOSS team seemed to be aware of these difficult questions, even just in terms of deciding to hit a potentially hostile drone with some sort of cyber attack. “What happens in one theater will be different in another theater, and the rules of engagement [ROE] may be different,” he noted. “We want to be able to plug those ROEs in – what they can do, what they can automate – and then put the human in the loop when necessary. That’s the objective. We’re not there yet.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Cyber Warfare News & Features"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The U.S. Army’s Laser-Armed Stryker Has Blasted Dozens of Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With terrorists, militant groups , and other potential opponents increasingly employing weaponized drones , the U.S. Army is becoming more and more concerned about the dangers unmanned aircraft pose to its soldiers. In one recent exercise, the service showed off one potential solution, a specially modified Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) with a laser. The Army rolled out the testbed vehicle, called the Mobile High Energy Laser (MEHEL), for the 2017 Maneuver Fires Integrated Experiment (MFIX) at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. The event ran from April 3rd through the 17th, during which the vehicle knocked out dozens of small quad-copters and remote control target planes. “We were skeptical at first, when we were first briefed we’d be shooting down drones with lasers,” Army Captain Theo Kleinsorge, who commanded the MEHEL, told the service’s reporters afterwards . “We achieved a success rate well beyond what we expected we’d have and we are excited to see this go to the next step of the experiment, shooting beyond the horizon, and showing this technology can solve the problem.” A basic Styrker ICV weighs in at nearly 16.5 tons, has a top speed of over 60 miles per hour on improved roads, and usually carries a .50 caliber M2 machine gun or a 40mm Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher. The MEHEL still has a machine gun, but its main weapon is a five kilowatt laser. On top of the laser, the vehicle had has powerful cameras to detect and track targets, as well as electronic warfare equipment. The latter system can try and crash an unmanned aircraft by jamming the signal from its control station, as well as try and pinpoint the location of those sites. US Army But the directed energy weapon was more than enough by itself to burn up commercial quadcopter and hexcopter style drones. Kleinsorge said his team blasted approximately 50 unmanned targets over the course of the practice session. For each one, soldiers applied a “kill” sticker—a red “X” behind the silhouette of the specific type of mock enemy—to the side of the unique Stryker. The crew added these existing markers from tests earlier in 2017 at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico. Of course, this isn’t the first time the Army has experimented using lasers to blow up small drones. During the 2016 MFIX exercise, engineers brought an earlier version of the MEHEL with a two kilowatt laser. Participants referred to the newer variant as MEHEL 2.0. Last year, the 10-kilowatt High Energy Laser Mobile Test Truck (HELMTT)—itself an improved version of the earlier High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD)—torched mock enemies, too. “We absolutely blew lots of stuff up.” Adam Aberle, the HELMTT demonstrator program manager at the Army Space and Missile Defense Command’s Technical Center said at the time . A soldier points to the kill markers on the side of the MEHEL Stryker., US Army These latest results were both impressive and important, since the Army has become very eager to get systems like MEHEL off the test range and into the field. After the end of the Cold War, the U.S. military steadily pared down its short-range air defenses as the threat of an enemy air attack seemed to evaporate. Hostile aircraft haven’t attacked American troops since a bizarre incident in January 1968 when two North Vietnamese An-2 biplanes attacked a top secret U.S. Air Force radar site in Laos. However, as commercial drones have gotten increasingly more sophisticated, they’ve become more attractive to both terrorists and state militaries looking for cheap aerial weapons. With relatively minor modifications, a quadcopter can become either a useful tool to spot enemy positions and help guide artillery fire or a deadly attacker in its own right. Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria are prolific users of these modified hobbyist drones, but Iraqi security forces have begun to follow suit . Similar arrangements have appeared in other hot spots such as Ukraine’s simmering civil conflict , where drones in general are an important tool on both sides . The larger High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD), US Army The Pentagon has put these types of drones into what it calls groups one and two. Group one consists of unmanned aircraft that weight less than 20 pounds, fly no higher than 1,200 feet, and have a top speed of 100 miles an hour or less. Group two includes pilotless craft weighing in at between 20 and 55 pounds, which can reach altitudes of 3,500 feet, and have a maximum speed of less than 250 miles per hour. “Group one and two presents the greatest challenges for Army forces,” according to Army Techniques Publication 3-01.8 , Techniques for Combined Arms for Air Defense, which the service published in July 2016. “These systems are more mobile and less noticeable than dismounted scouts with the added benefit of greater standoff enhanced by electronic optics.” In addition to concerns about their surveillance capabilities, the manual warned of drones dropping munitions, smashing into targets themselves, or simply harassing friendly troops or aircraft. With no dedicated anti-drone weapons in the Army arsenal at the time, the authors recommended trying to elude the small craft first before considering trying to shoot them down. So, it’s clear the Army is taking the threat very seriously. In February 2017, the service sent two other Strykers with a separate anti-drone jamming system, obtusely named Counter Unmanned Aircraft System Mobile Integrated Capabilities (CMIC), for field tests in Europe. A vehicle like the MEHEL would give American commanders another purpose-built tool to destroy the intruders. Engineers hope the system would also allow soldiers to locate and then call in artillery or air strikes against a drone’s ground control station. There have been reports that the U.S. military has employed powerful jamming aircraft in these roles in Iraq. In its daily recap of strikes, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) has reported more than one attack on Islamic State unmanned aircraft operations sites since the beginning of 2016. And that’s not all the Army has in mind for lasers in the future. “Directed energy will hopefully very quickly see itself useful in the realm of breaching obstacle belts, in the realm of active defense, of not just shooting down [unmanned aerial systems], but the ability to destroy incoming anti-tank missiles, mortars, field artillery rounds, across the whole of what the counter-rocket, artillery, and mortar mission is currently,” Kleinsorge explained. Beam weapons could also help units reduce their logistical burdens, since they do not require a steady supply of ammunition. The Zeus HLONS destroys a target in Afghanistan., US Army Unfortunately, for directed energy weapons to be useful against drones or any of these other targets, engineers will have to continue working to make their effects reliable and consistent. One of the biggest problems for lasers and similar beams is their tendency to lose power over even relatively modest distances and suffer in cloudy, dusty, or similarly obscured conditions. These difficulties have proven stubborn for Army engineers. In 2003, the Army sent a Humvee with a laser called Zeus to Afghanistan to zap mines, improvised-explosive devices, and other unexploded ordnance. The system, referred to variously as the High-Energy Laser Ordnance Negation System or the Humvee Laser Ordnance Neutralization System—both abbreviated HLONS—blew up more than 200 objects during that deployment. Two years later, the service reported that figure had soared to approximately 1,600 targets in exercises and field tests. US Army In 2015, after another decade of work, the Air Force had begun tested a third generation Zeus laser. However, as of 2017, neither the Army nor the Air Force had adopted any variant of this system. With systems like MEHEL, the Army appears undeterred by the inherent complexities of directed energy weapons and seems to be pushing steadily ahead. Off the ground, a podded laser is slated to be tested aboard an Apache attack helicopter , one that could usher in a whole new set of capabilities for the deadly choppers. But it remains to be seen how effective any of these systems might ultimately be outside an experimental setting.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On April 12, 2017, one of the U.S. Air Force’s WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft , which scoops up air to search for tell-tale signs of nuclear activity, landed at Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. The plane’s arrival wasn’t surprising given widespread concern North Korea was prepping a sixth nuclear test coupled with reports of a potential American military response . “U.S. intelligence is always on alert for a possible North Korean weapons test,” an unnamed individual from the U.S. Intelligence Community told VOA on April 13, 2017. North Korean leader “Kim Jong Un wants his country to be validated as a nuclear power and a test would further that goal.” This new nuclear test could coincide with the annual Day of the Sun, a massive, annual national holiday commemorating the birth of the country’s founder and Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung. It would be North Korea’s sixth reported detonation of a nuclear weapon. But the WC-135W Constant Phoenix’s arrival just added one more aircraft to an existing armada of spy planes and drones on and around the Korean Peninsula. Whenever a U.S. official says the American government is closely monitoring the situation in North Korea, aerial snooping is undoubtedly an important source of that information. WC-135W, USAF The reclusive Communist regime has long been a major point of interest for America’s military. The United States and North Korea technically remain at war, bound only by a long-standing ceasefire agreement. Still, the Pentagon, as well as other U.S. intelligence agencies, has become more and more focused on the country’s activities in recent years. On Oct. 9, 2006, the isolated dictatorship conducted its first reported nuclear test at the remote Punggye-ri site, which experts believed failed function properly. In the next decade, the country’s government set off four more devices. On top of that, the expanding and improving North Korean missile arsenal, which might be able to carry those devastating weapons, has become increasingly a matter of concern for the United States and its allies. North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un inspects artillery troops., North Korean State Media “Pyongyang’s evolving ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program underscore the growing threat,” Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) told Senators during a hearing on April 4, 2017. “It continues to defy international norms and resolutions, as demonstrated by a number of provocative actions this past year, including their fourth and fifth nuclear tests.” Getting imagery and other details about those experiments and associated tests sites would be essential to understanding the true state of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. America’s array of powerful spy satellites would be one option. Unfortunately, satellites have regular orbits and it generally takes time to adjust them into new positions. This generally makes them best suited for long-term surveillance of static points. The Pentagon’s Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) employs multiple types of satellites and sensors to address some of these issues and provide greater coverage. According to defense contracter Lockheed Martin, the constellation can watch for the heat signature of enemy missile launches and track them in flight, gather details about those weapons and their capabilities, and simply provide a broad picture of activities down below. The system may even be sensitive enough to track smaller objects like aircraft and artillery rockets and can reportedly watched the shoot down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2017. Closer to earth, spy planes and drones are almost constantly zipping around North Korea. The Air Force and the Army have spy planes and unmanned reconnaissance aircraft permanently deployed in the region specifically to keep watch on the country and its bellicose government. On the Air Force side there is the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron, the 82nd Reconnaissance Squadron, and the Detachment 1, 69th Reconnaissance Group. The 5th’s U-2S Dragon Ladies are situated at Osan Air Base in South Korea, which sits less than 20 miles from the capital Seoul and about 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the country from North Korea. The 69th keeps a small number of RQ-4A Global Hawks at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam and often sends them on temporary duty to bases in Japan. The U-2s don’t fly directly over North Korea, as they would likely be too vulnerable to the country’s air defenses to do so even in a combat situation. However, with its long endurance, the aircraft can still patrol around the edges of international air space for hours on end, and peer deeply into the secluded country. A U-2S takes off from Osan Air Base in 2009., USAF This would put them more than close enough for various sensors packages to potentially pick up useful intelligence. Though best known historically for its ability to take pictures while directly over a particular place of interest, the Dragon lady can carry the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2 (ASARS-2) and the Senior Glass electronic intelligence suite. ASARS-2 would allow pilots to fly up and down the Yellow and East Seas, grabbing radar imagery well inland of the North Korean coastline. The exact range of Senior Glass’ components is classified, but it is reasonable to assume it could detect and intercept North Korean radio chatter and other electronic emissions far enough away to keep the Dragon Ladies out of any imminent danger. Able to fly at high altitudes, the U-2 could conceivably use a slanted flight pattern to point the long-range, hyperspectral cameras in the Senior Year Electro-optical Reconnaissance System 2 (SYERS-2) or even the wide-angle Optical Bar Camera at targets along the border, as well. Customary international law would let the planes fly within 12 miles of the country’s coastline. For some time prior to June 2008, the Air Force nicknamed these so-called “multi-intelligence” U-2 missions focusing on North Korea as Sable Game. Then for unknown reasons, the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, which controls the 5th in Osan, began referring to the flights as Ginger Game sorties. It is possible this name has changed again since then. USAF via FOIA Satellite data links, known as Senior Span and Senior Spur, mean the spy planes can send back some of this information back to base while still in flight so analyst can begin picking it apart. The Air Force has the 694th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group at Osan in part to help “exploit” this kind of data. Intended as an unmanned replacement for the U-2, the RQ-4A can carry many of the same sensors and perform many of the same functions. Having to fly from Guam would reduce how much time the Global Hawks could spend near North Korea, but dispatching them from Japan greatly increases their utility over the Peninsula. Global Hawk landing at Misawa Air Base in Japan., USAF Every summer, from May to October, the 69th sends its aircraft to Japan ostensibly to get the drones out of the way of typhoons. This year, no less than five RQ-4s will be sent to Japan. On April 10, 2017, the Global Hawks arrived at Yokota Air Base for their 2017 deployment . In the past, smaller detachments, usually just a pair of the large unmanned aircraft, have gone to Misawa Air Base. The RC-135V/W Rivet Joints from the 82nd Reconnaissance Squadron focus on listening in on other country’s military units and fly throughout the Pacific from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. Unlike the U-2s with their single pilot, the Rivet Joints can carry more linguists and analysts on board to begin looking into information immediately. Data links let the crews pass both raw information and any analysis back to base. An RC-135V/W Rivet Joint., USAF Since 2006, Rivet Joint missions have occurred under the nicknames Sable Wind and Ginger Wind. If it’s not already becoming clear, the words “sable” and “ginger” have and may still refer to Air Force spying around North Korea, while the second word indicates the actual aerial intelligence platform. USAF via FOIA In addition to these Air Force assets, the Army’s 3rd Military Intelligence Battalion has a whole fleet of smaller, shorter range intelligence gathering aircraft based at Camp Humphreys, less than 100 miles south of Seoul. As of June 2015, this included eight RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensors (GRCS) , three EO-5C Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Multisensors (ARL-M), and three so-called “ Saturn Arch ” aircraft, according a table the service released as part of a contract announcement. RC-12X, US Army The RC-12X is a militarized twin-engine Beechcraft King Air light utility aircraft with a signals intelligence (SIGINT) setup that can find and listen in on enemy communications. The four-engine EO-5C, which uses the de Havilland Canada DHC-7 airframe, has similar capabilities, along with synthetic aperture radar and powerful day and night-capable video cameras. You can regularly spot the ARL-Ms flying along the DMZ, scanning for any activity on the other side of heavily guarded border. An EO-5C Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Multisensor., US Army We don’t know the exact sensor suite in the Saturn Arch aircraft, which the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) first fielded in 2010 to help find improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan. Contractor-operated Bombardier Dash-8 aircraft carried the gear, which likely included some combination hyper-spectral cameras, laser-imaging systems, and airborne ground penetrating radars. These systems would be able to pick out changes in the terrain indicating someone had been digging or even spot suspicious objects buried close to the surface. In 2013, the Army’s Intelligence and Security Command, which had already assisted NGA with the project in Afghanistan, took over the Saturn Arch program completely. Two years later, three of the four of the aircraft had moved to South Korea. Though there is little concern about IEDs in South Korea, North Korea does have a long history of trying to dig tunnels under the DMZ for secret agents and commando teams. The sensors on the Dash-8s could potentially hept spot this kind of covert activity as well as keep an eye on physical changes across the DMZ. One of the four Saturn Arch aircraft., US Army In March 2017, the Army also announced it was sending a company of MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones to join the 2nd Infantry Division, which has elements throughout South Korea. The pilotless planes can perform attack and reconnaissance duties already, thanks to a electo-optical system that can see during the day and at night. The service plans to eventually buy a detachable SIGINT pod for the Gray Eagle that could expand the aircraft’s intelligence gathering capabilities as necessary. And then there’s the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 72, the unit overseeing the U.S. Seventh Fleet’s aerial patrol and reconnaissance forces. P-3C Orion and P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft and EP-3E Aries II spy planes rotate through deployments to the unit’s bases at Naval Air Stations Atsugi and Misawa Air Base in Japan. From there, they make routine trips to South Korea proper for training exercises. The EP-3E Aries IIs are dedicated intelligence gathers, but all three types could help monitor North Korean developments. P-3C with LSRS pod underneath at Andersen AFB in Guam. The radar is extremely capable, and can provide highly sensitive moving target indications and SAR/ISAR maps of complex littoral areas. It is even said to have an over-land capability that in some ways is superior to the USAF E-8 JSTARs., USAF The P-3s and P-8s are multi-purpose aircraft that can hunt submarines and surface ships. As such, they have full-motion cameras that work during the day or at night, as well as powerful radars. These systems can easily do double duty as surveillance equipment scoping out targets along the coastline. There is also a good possibility the Navy might decide to ultimately replace the EP-3Es with an intelligence-focused variant of the P-8. The Poseidon already has strong electronic intelligence gathering capabilities and In 2014, the service tested a version of the P-3’s shadowy Littoral Surveillance Radar System, dubbed the Advanced Airborne Sensor on the P-8. This cumbersome but incredibly capable system will be coming online in an operational form soon. Also, the P-8 has been tested with what appears to be an elaborate communications pod that could make it a major player in the signals intelligence gathering game, and may allow the 737 derivative to take over some of the EP-3’s missions. A P-8A Poseidon., USN The Air Force also routinely rotates other aircraft from its fleet of airliner-sized RC-135s to bases in Japan. From there, they conduct both scheduled patrols and contingency missions in response to potential crises. The RC-135S Cobra Ball and RC-135U Combat Sent have very different missions. The Air Force’s three Cobra Balls have specialized gear to track ballistic missile launches, which is especially important when it comes to North Korea. The two Combat Sents have equipment to detect and analyze electronic emissions from sites on the ground. Among other things, this means they can find and determine the relative capabilities of radar installations, a key component in figuring out the actual strength of an air defense network.  This information could be an important part of planning any strikes against well-protected North Korean targets such as missile test facilities, regime targets or nuclear sites. An RC-135U at Yokota Air Base in 2010., USAF The Combat Sents have flown Ginger Sent sorties, suggesting a specific focus on North Korea. The two Cobra Balls operate as part of unified, world-wide STRATCOM-led effort to track long-range missile activity – even in friendly countries like India and Israel – called Olympic Titan. The Air Force’s pair of Constant Phoenixes are similarly part of STRATCOM’s larger nuke monitoring mission, Glass Titan. There is also the strong possibility the Air Force may be flying one of its more shadowy spy planes or drones deep into North Korea. In September 2009, the secretive 30th Reconnaissance Squadron sent stealthy RQ-170 Sentinels to Kunsan Air Base in South Korea. While we don’t know exactly what their missions from Kunsan entailed, the deployment came less than five months after North Korean authorities conducted their second nuclear test at Punggye-ri, which appeared to be successful. USAF via FOIA What we do know is that the Sentinels are exactly the kind of asset the Pentagon would use to sneak deep into a denied territory like North Korea to spy on sensitive locations. With the apparent preparation for a sixth nuclear test, the RQ-170 could very well be flying highly classified missions over North Korea, examining its nuclear and rocket facilities and patterns of life around regime targets. The so called RQ-180 , supposedly a high-flying penetrating strategic reconnaissance top secret aircraft that is known to exist even by the USAF’s own admission, might well be flying new missions over the country as well. And then there’s a slew of other aircraft that could perform varying levels of surveillance if necessary. Land bases in the region host E-3 and E-8 radar planes, E-8 maritime patrol aircraft, F-16 and F/A-18 fighter jets with advanced radar warning receivers and camera-equipped targeting pods, and advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighters with their integrated electro-optical sensor and electronic support measures suites. In January 2017, the U.S. Marine Corps sent an operational contingent of F-35Bs to the Marine base at Iwakuni in Japan for the first time, making them available for various missions in the event of a crisis. They are currently operating in South Korea right now. The Air Force’s F-22 Raptor’s have also made surprise visits to the Peninsula and surely they put their uncanny ability to sniff-out radar and other electronic emissions to use. An F-16 fighter jet with a Sniper advanced targeting pod and HARM Targeting System (HTS)., USAF F/A-18s and F-35s could operate from carriers – like the USS Carl Vinson , which started heading for the Korean Peninsula this week – or amphibious ships. A supercarrier’s air wing is equipped with a cadre of E-2 Hawkeyes that can monitor aerial movements deep into North Korean airspace. Marine Corps aircraft, including helicopter and fast jets, can strap on highly capable electronic surveillance and jamming pods, like the Intrepid Tiger II , to keep tabs on enemy electronic emissions and communications along the DMZ. With various radars and other surveillance gear, American cruisers, destroyers, and most importantly submarines all have the ability to snoop around North Korea’s coastlines, too. President Donald Trump specifically mentioned the presence of subs in the area during an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo on April 12, 2017. An AV-8B+ Harrier carrying the Intrepid Tiger II pod during testing., USN In all, North Korea may be one of the most heavily monitored places on earth. And we have only mentioned America’s surveillance assets. South Korea and Japan have their own fleets of spy aircraft with varying capabilities. Whether Pyongyang decides to set off another nuclear bomb or not, it’s safe to say the Pentagon has the ability to keep a close watch what’s going on inside the reclusive country.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hanging above the U.S. Marine Corps’ pavilion at the Navy League’s 2017 Sea Air Space exposition was a half-scale model of a boxy drone so innocuous one of the uniformed representatives thanked me just for taking the time to ask about it. Though overshadowed by other technology at the event, the blandly named Supply Glider might be one of the most promising and important developments anyone brought to the show floor. Essentially an unmanned cargo container, the drone is one of a number of related projects the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is exploring as part of what the Corps’ calls “expeditionary advance base operations.” The basic idea is to create one or more systems that can get equipment and supplies to Marines ashore quickly and accurately, but at low cost and with reduced risks. “MCWL intends to develop a resupply delivery system that will increase military utility and drastically reduce costs,” a fact sheet on the program at the Sea Air Space convention explained. “The system will be able to supply a Marine rifle squad with one day sustainment without telegraphing the squad’s position, and will be disposable.” The Marine Corps is still finalizing the requirements, the MCWL personnel at the exhibition told The War Zone. The plan is for a gliding drone that crews can either drop out the back of their KC-130 tanker/transports like a traditional air-drop pallet or slung under an MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor or CH-53E/K helicopter and then released it in mid-air. Logistics teams will be able to quickly assemble the unmanned supply gliders from parts kits at land bases or at sea on board amphibious ships. The prototypes will have a structure made mostly of plywood and use a commercial GPS to guide them to their final destination, which should keep them cheap enough for Marines to discard in the field, MCWL representatives said. The final weight and launch parameters will ultimately determine the drone’s maximum range, they added. A 3D rendering of the LG-1000., Logistic Gliders, Inc. However, the model looked heavily inspired by an existing design from Logistic Gliders, Inc. The California-based company is one of the groups that has collaborated with the Marines on Supply Glider, along with InSitech and Yates Electrospace, Inc, which builds electrically-powered aircraft. Logistic Gliders, Inc. Since 2011, the Logistic Gliders has been working with both the U.S. Army and the Marines Corps on their cheap, boxy craft, which it says can carry loads up to 1,000 pounds. In March 2012, an LG-1000 prototype carried a simulated cargo with an unspecified weight 70 miles. More importantly, the LG-1000 with its environmentally friendly structure and commercial components cost just $600. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HZtaDfoRPaw That last part is a key point. Different branches of the U.S. military, along with U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), have experimented extensively with rapid resupply technologies for decades. You can read about some of those projects in a recent piece we wrote here at The War Zone. In concept, the MCWL’s gliders are closest to Mist Mobility Integrated Systems Technology’s Snowgoose GPS-guided paramotor . Snowgoose offered significant advantages over traditional aerial resupply methods, even GPS-aided types like the U.S. military’s Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS). Able to travel up to 200 miles from the launch point, the paramotor was a discreet resupply method that didn’t require a large and loud cargo plane to fly into harm’s way in order to be deployed. But while it’s cheaper to buy and operate compared to large cargo planes or helicopters, the Snowgoose is still relatively complicated and expensive to employ. In 2005, SOCOM bought approximately 75 unpowered versions, which the U.S. military called the CQ-10A, reportedly at a cost of approximately $500,000 each. The price tag of the improved gyrocopter CQ-10B, which had the ability to get back into the air under its own power and fly back to base after a mission, was $650,000. The B model cost around $300 per hour to fly. A Snowgoose used in Iraq., DoD In short, you’re not throwing away a CQ-10. This means any unit getting supplies this way has to spend additional effort either securing the drone or otherwise getting it out of the area. Though it looks like it might have a shorter range, a refined Supply Glider design could be a simpler and cheaper option. This could make it a good choice for both emergency and routine resupply missions. And the requirement for something like the Snowgoose or the LG-1000 isn’t going away. “By the end of 2011, more than 27,000 soldiers at 43 Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in Afghanistan relied solely on airdrop for everything from food to fuel,” Logistic Gliders says on its website. “As precision anti-aircraft weapons proliferate and conflict spreads to more remote regions, military supply chains of the future will face increasing pressure to reduce risk while increasing their reach.” The fact that these gliders can make it into tight and very hostile spots without putting a helicopter crew at risk, or relying on more cumbersome parachute systems, is highly attractive. And at such a low cost, the system could even be used for regular logistics as well. So, it might not be long before Marines in hot spots around the world are getting their emergency, or even daily supplies via a boxy glider drone.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 22, 2019",USAF To Keep Upgraded F-16s Till 2048 As Fate Of F-15C In Doubt,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is still mulling over whether to retire its fleet of F-15C/D Eagle fighter jets and re-equip those units with F-16C/D Vipers. At the same time, the service is looking to move ahead with an extensive F-16 overhaul, which could help tip the scales in favor of those aircraft. On April 12, 2017, Lockheed Martin, the company that makes the Vipers, announced the Air Force had decided to move ahead with a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for a portion of its existing fleet. The project would give each of the modified jets approximately 4,000 extra flight hours, extending the aircraft’s total life to 12,000 flight hours, keeping them combat ready through at least 2048. The project will cover 300 aircraft in Blocks 40 through 52. “This accomplishment is the result of more than seven years of test, development, design, analysis, and partnership between the U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin,” Susan Ouzts, the vice president of Lockheed’s F-16 program said in a press release . “Combined with F-16 avionics modernization programs…, SLEP modifications demonstrate that the Fighting Falcon remains a highly capable and affordable 4th Generation option.” By this point, the F-16 had been in dire need of SLEP-level upgrades for years already. In 2013, the Air Force blamed budget cuts for the decision to cancel scheduled upgrades and redirect the money into updating its F-22 stealth fighters. Two years later, the service deferred similar plans , ostensibly to free up funds for continued work on the Viper’s controversial future replacement, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In December 2016, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) announced it was once again looking for industry partners who might be able to do extensive work on the F-16. Evaluators at Hill Air Force Base in Utah had already signed off on a “kit” of prototype SLEP parts – likely the culmination of the seven-year process Lockheed cited in their press release. Lockheed Martin The draft plans outlined a desire to get an additional 6,000 flight hours out each upgraded fighter jet, rather than the final figure of 4,000 flight hours. The Air Force expected to buy an initial batch of 300 SLEP kits for its own F-16Cs and more than 40 more on behalf of unspecified allies operating two-seat F-16D trainers. At that time, the service had more than 1,000 F-16Cs and Ds just in its own inventory. Based on the associated documentation, the overhaul process would include replacing the wings, much of the aircraft’s external “skin,” supporting beams in the jet’s tailplane, and a series of internal bulkheads. The Air Force planned to issue separate contracts to build the parts and install them, potentially leading to separate companies handling these two tasks. But the Air Force did not even issue a formal “request for information” – a non-binding notice of potential interest in products or services – until April 10, 2017, just two days before Lockheed’s statement came out. As of April 12, 2017, there is still not official contract or estimated price tag for the SLEP. And that’s where the future of the F-15C/D comes in. As the Air Force considered whether or not to proceed with the F-16 updates, it was also debating whether to scrap the older Eagles – with the exception of the F-15E Strike Eagle – altogether. Faced with an unprecedented shortage of pilots , uncertain future budgets, and the F-35’s growing costs and repeated delays, the service had apparently been looking to save money by reducing the total number of different aircraft in its inventory. USAF “We do have capacity in the F-16C community to recapitalize that radar to serve the same function as the F-15 has done and thereby reduce the different systems that we have to sustain and operate,” Major General Scott D. West, the Air Force’s Director of Current Operations, said at a House Armed services Committee Hearing on March 22, 2017. Chairman Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, had started the discussion with a question about the state of the plan, catching defense experts and even many of his fellow committee members off guard. This was the first time the service had discussed the previously internal “pre-decisional” proposal in public. By the end of the meeting, there was a real concern the Air Force was already on its way to retiring the Eagles for good. It was an especially shocking development, since another extensive upgrade program was slated to give the entire fleet of F-15C/Ds – approximately 179 aircraft, not counting those set aside for training duties – decades more service life. A number of the jets had already received fast-scanning, state-of-the-art AN/APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars as part of an earlier refit program. The Air Force insists it hasn’t made a final decision on the plan. If it did decide to retire the Eagles, that probably wouldn’t begin until sometime in the mid-2020s, either. Lockheed Martin “We’re looking at all options all the time because until we get a budget, it’s really hard to plan,” Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein told reporters during a talk at The Heritage Foundation think tank on April 12, 2017. “I actually haven’t made a decision on any of the aircraft. We’re going to keep the F-15C around at least until 2020.” However, if cost is the major factor, an Air Force decision to finally go ahead with a SLEP for its F-16C/Ds could indicate the service was leaning toward gutting the Eagle fleet or might just help push it in that direction. Based on what has happened in the past, spending money on F-16 improvements could easily mean cuts to funds for F-15 updates. The Eagles are due for a massive, costly overhaul themselves, which could add even more impetus for sending them to the boneyard. A SLEP for the F-15C/Ds would likely include needing to replace each aircraft’s entire center fuselage section, the wings, and numerous other components. The final cost of such a proposal could be between $30 and $40 million per aircraft, Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, told Aviation Week at the end of March 2017. In August 2016, Boeing received more than $250 million just to stress test both F-15C/D and F-15E aircraft in order to figure out exactly what sections might fail and when. “In the Air Force, we need capacity, because we’re in high demand, whether you want to talk about what we’re doing in the Middle East or whether you want to talk about what we’re doing in the Korean Peninsula, or what we’re doing forward in Europe,” Goldfein said. “The way I look at it is not going to be about this platform versus that platform. It’s going to be how do we network these capabilities together to be able to do the mission that the nation is asking us to do.” Most importantly, to at all match the F-15C’s air-to-air capabilities, the F-16Cs would need their own AESA radar. Lockheed has already developed a version that might fit the bill, the F-16V , which features the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar among a host of other avionics improvements. On top of that, the company is selling is as an upgrade package for older models. Taiwan was first customer to take advantage of this offer and is in the process of converting its dated F-16A/Bs to the new configuration. In 2015, The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor pitched a similar version, the F-16IN , to India, which ultimately lost out to the French-made Rafale. After allegations of graft in the contracting process, the Indian government decided to put out another fighter jet tender and Lockheed has offered another improved F-16 model, the F-16 Block 70 . At the same time, the Air Force and Lockheed have been looking at other ways to expand the capabilities of the F-16. On April 10, 2017, Lockheed issued another press release announcing they had cooperated with the Air Force Research Laboratory, the Air Force Test Pilot School, and defense contractor CalSpan Corporation – which operates the unique F-16 Variable stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA) – to evaluate an unmanned Viper as a drone wingman. During experiment, dubbed Have Raider II , the F-16 VISTA coordinated with a regular Viper and a ground station, conducting mock ground attack missions autonomously based on a given set of parameters, while adapting to changing, simulated threats and other conditions. Whether it’s a drone F-16 or another unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), this so-called “manned-unmanned teaming” could help alleviate the Air Force’s pilot shortage. The Air Force has said it eventually wants this capability for its F-35As , as well. Lockheed Martin Ultimately, both the Air Force and Lockheed remain focused on getting the F-35A fully into service over any other fighter jet projects, even if the F-16 SLEP could to be a tacit admission that desired fleet of more than 1,750 Joint Strike Fighters is unlikely to materialize. The service’s overarching view is that fourth generation aircraft such as the F-15 and the F-16 would be doomed in a future conflict against any peer or near-peer adversary boasting a combination of advanced fighter aircraft and networked, long-range surface-to-air missiles. “The question of an F-15 and an F-16 in a European scenario on its own, neither one is going to do it,” Air Force Lieutenant General Mark Nowland, Air Force’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, declared at another event, according to DefenseNews . “They both are going to get shot down and die.” At the same time, F-16 sales has been shrinking to the point that Lockheed repeatedly raises the possibility of having to shutter the production line altogether. In March 2017, the firm announced it would stop making the jets in Texas and shift the work to a smaller, more flexible facility in South Carolina. But in its own press release about the F-16 SLEP, Lockheed stressed the project would simply ease the transition to the F-35 and made no comment about additional work beyond the 300 planned upgrade kits. When the Air Force held an industry day gathering about the overhaul program, Boeing – which also runs the A-10 rewinging program – actually sent more representatives than Lockheed did, according to sign-in sheets the service posted online. Regardless, the SLEP signals the Air Force’s desire keep at least some F-16C/Ds combat ready in the long term, which could give the service space to retire the F-15C/D, and make due with a potentially smaller F-35A fleet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 10, 2019",Russia’s Arctic Troops Are Getting These Specialized Mobile Air Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that Russia is building up its forces for combat north of the Arctic Circle and we have previously explored how the frigid wastes are increasingly a point of contention between officials in Moscow and their counterparts in other countries when it comes to territorial claims and resource rights. Now, the Kremlin has revealed it is building mobile anti-aircraft defenses specifically for its troops in the region. On April 5, 2017, photographer Vitaly Kuzmin spotted the two air defense systems as they prepared at the Alabino Proving Ground outside Moscow for Russia’s annual Victory Day parade . The event commemorates the country’s capture of Berlin and defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and has historically been an opportunity to show off new military hardware. In this case, among the participants, were units with the 9K331MDT Tor-M2DT and Pantsir-SA systems . Though almost entirely covered in tan tarps to protect their pristine paint jobs for the parade, a distinct winter-themed three color white-black-gray camouflage scheme was visible in the pictures. More importantly, both are variants of existing systems mounted on the DT-30PM tracked vehicle . A Soviet-era design also known as the Vityaz ATV, the nearly 60-ton carrier has two distinct sections with an articulating linkage connection the drive trains. The PM-variant introduced a new, more powerful engine compared to the older versions. Pantsir-SA, Vitaly Kuzmin On improved roads, the DT-30s have a top speed of 30 miles per hour. However, they have excellent mobility off road, even in loose terrain like sand and snow, thanks to the four, wide, powered rubber-band tracks. They are also amphibious, but move at only three miles per hour in water. In addition, the vehicles can operate in temperatures as low as negative 58 degrees Fahrenheit – the average winter low in the Arctic – and at altitudes as high as 4,000 feet. These features made the DT-series popular with the Russian Army, as well as the country’s natural resources extraction firms, including the state oil company Gazprom. Pantsir-SA, Vitaly Kuzmin On both the 9K331MDT Tor-M2DT and Pantsir-SA, the rear module holds the main weapon systems. In the front, retractable antennas on the Pantsir-SA suggest the air defense versions may use the carrier’s compartment for more than just carrying the crew. According to the manufacturers, both systems can take on helicopters, fast-moving fixed-wing aircraft, and cruise missiles at short and medium ranges. The Soviet-era Tor missile system has been in service since 1986. The weapon consisted of a group of 8 vertical launchers and fire control radar inside a rotating turret. The missiles came in two self-contained four-round “packs” for fast reloading. 9K331MDT Tor-M2DT, Vitaly Kuzmin Wheeled or tracked carriers could carry the whole setup and the power needed to operate it. At the time, the Soviet Union boasted it could shoot down nuclear-tipped AGM-86 air-launched cruise missiles, even in bad weather. In 1991, Russia introduced an improved version, the 9K331, also referred to as the Tor M1. This variant had a top speed of Mach 2.5 and a maximum range of just over 9 miles. An improved fire control system could track two targets at once and the missiles had unspecified improvements to make them more resistant to jamming. The weapons were reportedly precise enough to engage small, rockets, as well as aircraft and cruise missiles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=M2_sqScmBUM In 2007, missile maker Almaz Antey announced the new M2 variant. The further improved weapon system could now launch missiles at four separate targets at once and crews could fire within seven seconds of spotting a contact on their radar. Based on the nomenclature, the Tor-M2DT should be a subvariant of this version, but able to operate at extremely low temperatures. Pantsir is a turreted combination gun and missile system. Introduced in 2012, the complete system has six missile launchers and two, twin-barrel 30mm cannons. The 57E-series missiles have a top speed of Mach 2.3 and a maximum range of more than 12 miles, but it has no internal seeker. Instead, crews must steer them to their targets using an active radio command link. The launch vehicle has both radar and a long-range infrared tracking sensor, and can target up to four different enemies at once, depending on the particular variant. And while they’re intended for anti-aircraft work, Pantsir gunners can turn their guns on ground targets, as well. There is a mix of high-explosive, fragmentation and armor-piercing rounds available for the 2A38M cannons. Russian state media outlet TASS first disclosed plans for the Arctic-capable Pantsir-SA in February 2015, but only in their Russian-language edition (). The requirement reportedly came after tests showed the wheeled Pantsir-S1 performed poorly in tests. Initial mentions of the 9K331MDT Tor-M2DT began appearing in 2016, amainly on Russian blogs . Together, the weapons could give Russian troops in the Arctic climate a capable defense against aerial opponents, including both attacking aircraft and airborne forces. Pantsir-SA could provide additional firepower against light-armed opponents on the ground. And why might that be a particularly important statement for the Kremlin to make? https://youtube.com/watch?v=w32kaOYb7lo On February 2014, paratroopers from the U.S. Army’s 4th Brigade, 25th Infantry Division parachuted into an Arctic drop zone near Dead Horse, Alaska. This occurred around the same time the Russian military announced plans to create a dedicated command for military operations in the region. Since then, the brigade’s soldiers have conducted more parachute jumps above and below the Arctic Circle. The Russians have done the same . The most recent American practice session, nicknamed Spartan Pegasus 2017, involved both airborne and airmobile operations. The exercise scenario involved a hunt for a downed satellite . Whatever the impetus, the appearance of the 9K331MDT Tor-M2DT and Pantsir-SA are another clear reflection of Russia’s stated plans to militarize the Arctic and defend existing and future claims to territory in the region. It might mean other powers with interests north of the Arctic Circle will have to start preparing for more extensive contingencies, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 26, 2018",Sikorsky and Boeing Give us a Glimpse of Their New Attack Helicopter Concept,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sikorsky and Boeing have offered the first peak at their concept for a new gunship helicopter. The two companies are pitching the rotorcraft, based on their existing SB>1 Defiant transport design, to the U.S. Army as part of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. On April 10, 2017, Lockheed Martin, which owns Sikorsky, posted a sales video online that included a depiction of the “attack variant” of their FVL – Medium (FVL-M) contender.  The Army specifically wants the FVL-M to replace both the UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopter and AH-64 Apache gunship. It has not specified whether or not the transport and attack versions need to be based on the same aircraft, but obviously this would be very beneficial, and Sikorsky and Boeing appear to have chosen to develop two separate, but highly related designs with common components. The new pitch explains the new model will share engines, drive train, rear propeller and control surfaces, fuel tank, various internal avionics and electronics, and more with the SB>1 “assault” helicopter. However, the 3D-animated teaser does not give any specific details about the new gunship version or show off a real-life prototype or mock-up. In 2015, Sikorsky and Boeing first announced they were teaming up to build a rotorcraft for the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR-TD). This project is supposed to serve as a lead in effort for the larger, long-term FVL plan. This partnership led to the SB>1 Defiant , the unusual nomenclature standing for “Sikorsky and Boeing are greater than one.” A compound helicopter with a push-propeller and co-axial, rigid rotors, the firms boasted this new aircraft would be significantly faster than traditional helicopters, more maneuverable, more stable while hovering, and quieter. According to the April 2017 video, the final transport version will have a cruising speed of at least 280 miles per hour and handle so-called “hot-and-high” conditions with ability to hold a hover high off the ground in so-called at altitudes up to 6,000 feet and temperatures up to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. If these figures prove accurate, one imagines the more nimble-looking gunship model would have at least similar capabilities, which would be a significant improvement over existing attack helicopters. The U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Zulu Cobra has a max cruise speed of 184 miles per hour, while the Army’s larger AH-64D Apaches top out at 182 miles per hour. More speed would almost certain equate to more range for the new Defiant-based attack helicopter, as well. The AH-1Z has a combat radius of less than 150 miles and the AH-64D can fly about twice that distance under combat conditions before running low on refuel. The 3D artists conceptions of the SB>1 assault (front) and attack variants., Lockheed Martin But, from the video, the weapons arrangement looks to be no different from traditional attack helicopters. The proposal has a chin-turret with an automatic cannon that looks very much like the three-barrel, 20mm M197 gun on the Marine Corps’ AH-1s. As with both the AH-1 and AH-64 series, there are two stubby wings with four external stores pylons for various ordnance and two launch rails on the tips for air-to-air missiles – in this case the artist appears to have mounted AIM-9X Sidewinders – are on either side of the fuselage. In one of the frames, it appears that two of those racks may actually attach directly the chopper’s main body. These features are notable, since the last time the two defense contractors worked on an armed helicopter for the U.S. military, the result was the abortive RAH-66A Comanche . This stealthy rotorcraft had complex internal weapons bays to keep the aircraft’s radar signature as low as possible. The Defiant attack variant concept appears to be significantly more conservative when it comes to low-observable characteristics. Of course, all of this is undoubtedly subject to change as the joint venture gets to work on an actual, flying version. Regardless, both versions clearly draw heavily from Sikorsky’s X2 and the S-97 Raider armed scout helicopter. In 2008, the Connecticut-based helicopter maker unveiled the X2 as a high-technology demonstrator, with many of the features now on the SB>1, such as active vibration control to reduce noise. That development ultimately morphed into the Raider private venture. Sikorsky had initially pitched this rotorcraft to the Army as a replacement for the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopters. The service’s abrupt decision to ditch the Kiowas for Apaches effectively killed that plan. Concepts for the Raider had featured two traditional side-mounted weapons pylons and space inside for six combat troops. Now it appears, Sikorsky and Boeing have split that idea into two distinct FVL-M subtypes, though it still supposedly intends to market the S-97 separately. The S-97 Raider prototype., Sikorsky Both Defiant types will also benefit from decades of work at Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky, and Boeing, as well as other firms they had outright purchased in the past, such as Piasecki. Sikorsky itself became a subsidiary of Lockheed in 2015. These companies were responsible for numerous earlier military projects involving compound helicopters, including the AH-56 Cheyenne , the X-49A Speedhawk , the XH-59A , and RAH-66. By the end of 2017, the Army hopes to have started flight tests of at least one SB>1 prototype, and as its primary competitor, Bell Helicopter’s V-280 Valor. On April 10, 2017, Bell said its aircraft, a tilt-rotor derived in part from the V-22 Osprey, was 95 percent ready for those trials. Bell has shown plans to develop a more unified design that can perform both transport and attack duties depending on its configuration. According to Bell, the Valor has the same hot-and-high performance as the Defiant, but boasts a top speed 40 miles per hour faster than the Sikorsky-Boeing product. Boeing split from their long time V-22 partner, Bell, for the FVL tender, instead teaming up with Sikorsky. At the time this seemed to be a damning indictment of the V-280 Valor concept and its tilt-rotor technology, but Bell has continued with the program and it has drawn big interest from the Pentagon and foreign governments alike. Bell’s own artwork and teasers have depicted gunship versions with missiles launchers that retract into the fuselage or are otherwise hidden behind sliding panels. One 2013, video also has a version with externally-mounted rocket pods and a chin-mounted cannon or machine gun, too. With these relatively close performance specs, a compound helicopter that is closer to a existing designs and footprint might present a more cost-effective option than a tilt-rotor. Historically, the costs and complexities of tilting wing aircraft have been considerably higher than conventional aircraft or helicopters. In 2015, Japan became the first foreign customer for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey, despite decades of steady improvements to the design and repeated reports of interest outside the United States. Bell And cost is likely to be the biggest determining factor in the project. Recent Pentagon budgets have trimmed Army plans to buy additional conventional helicopters to meet existing operational demands and threatened to steal funds from future-focused projects like JMR-TD and FVL. In 2014, the service began investing in the UH-60V upgrade program in hopes of freeing up money for more advanced programs. At a hearing in February 2017, Army Vice Chief of Staff General Daniel Allyn complained that there still might not be enough money to reliably sustain the helicopter fleets he already had, let alone modernize. Funding shortfalls and the need to prioritize other programs were among the factors that led to the controversial decision to send all of the Kiowas to the boneyard. “Our multiyear programs for our aviation fleet are all on the floor,” Army Vice Chief of Staff General Daniel Allyn complained to legislators during a hearing in February 2017. “We cannot operate that way … And yet year over year, we’re put into this dilemma.” So, while Sikorsky-Boeing and Bell are pushing ahead with their plans, it’s not clear what the exact market will be for aircraft like Defiant and Valor, beyond fulfilling possible niche capability demands, even as the technology continues to mature.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 1, 2019","Meet RAMBO, the U.S. Army’s 3D-Printed Grenade Launcher","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has built and fired an almost entirely 3D-printed 40mm grenade launcher. Scientists and engineers hope the prototype will set the stage for projects in the laboratory and on the battlefield. The Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey modeled the proof-of-concept Rapid Additively Manufactured Ballistics Ordnance (RAMBO) on the Army-standard M203 grenade launcher and marked it “M203XX.” The production process for 90 percent of the components was at least partially automated, though engineers had to assemble the final weapons by hand. Certain springs and fasteners were too small and complex for a 3D printer. The project also produced training rounds based on the M781, but engineers had to manually add the explosive propellant right before the test shots. A number of other Army research and development and engineering activities, as well as other laboratories across the U.S. military and private companies, contributed to the project. These partners included the Army Manufacturing Program (ManTech), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC). “We chose the 40mm because it’s a relatively simple system, with the pressure and speeds involved,” Sunny Burns, an ARDEC materials engineer, explained to the service’s reporters . “It’s low velocity and low pressure so it’s not as critical as a small caliber system.” So, while the printers involved could have built a close approximation of almost any weapon, the materials available not have been strong enough to withstand the shock of even experimental use. First developed in 1950s, the Army’s low-velocity 40mm cartridges already have a particular design to keep pressure and felt recoil low, but still lob relatively large projectiles hundreds of feet away. The RAMBO barrel assembly (top) and a standard one from an M203A1 for comparison., US Army RAMBO is far from flimsy. Though many people think of 3D printing – or as the U.S. military prefers “additive manufacturing” – as only involving plastics, industrial printers can craft parts from a variety of materials. Picatinny’s grenade launcher features plastic and resin pieces, as well as aluminum and steel components. “We’ve tried to stay as much one-to-one as possible,” Burns said. “So if a part was aluminum we didn’t want to print in steel, we wanted to print in aluminum.” Beyond the varied materials, RAMBO is a testament to how far 3D-printing technology has improved over the years. ARDEC’s printers can make up complicated shapes that might have been an impossible proposition not too long ago. Most notably, the launcher’s barrel had to be rifled. The Army’s M203s and newer M320s both spin the 40mm grenades both for accuracy and safety. The rotating movement arms the rounds after they’ve traveled a certain distance, preventing them from blowing up in the shooter’s face. Rifling is “a pretty tricky process to get the tooling, and things like that take a lot of experience,” Burns noted. “Only one machinist in our machine shop had any experience doing it and we have around 30 machinists here.” ARDEC estimated it would’ve cost $50,000 to buy the equipment necessary to make a rifled 40mm barrel through the traditional method. This would have been prohibitively expensive for just one RAMBO prototype, even if technicians made a small batch of 10 to 12 for the project. However, the experiment wasn’t without problems. ARDEC’s machinery couldn’t build up all of the parts of the training round using the normal materials. The mass-produced M781s have a reinforced nylon cartridge case. The staff at Picatinny couldn’t print in that particular polymer, so they used other glass-filled plastics. Unfortunately, these substitutes weren’t strong enough and cracked during testing, which could have been potentially dangerous. Engineers ultimately redesigned the round to toughen up certain areas. A mix of 3D-printed training grenade and production M781 components., US Army But this is exactly what the Army and its sister services hope to get out of 3D printing. Rapid prototyping can speed up development of new systems, simplify the process of making changes, and generally reduce costs. Instead of having to buy tens of thousands of dollars of specialized equipment and paying specially trained contractors, engineers can draw a component on a computer and print it out with relative ease. Picatinny turned out most of the parts for RAMBO in less than 48 hours. If something goes wrong, all that you need to do is go back into the computer model, refine the design, and repeat the process. During the RAMBO project, this is exactly what happened with case design for the training grenades. ARDEC is also exploring whether or not the additive manufacturing process can ultimately include 3D-printed explosive charges for future prototype ammunition. In addition, the Army is looking to see if these methods are useful outside a laboratory or test workshop setting. One of ARDEC’s ideas is to give troops in the field the ability to quickly make up new weapon accessories and components. RAMBO has a 3D-printed rear pistol grip and rail attachment points. In the future, if soldiers didn’t like the grip angle or needed more space for sights, lasers, or other systems, they might be able to have a unit armorer just print out different options. “Some soldiers like a 45 degree grip handle in the front on their rifle and some like a 90 degree grip handle in the front,” Jim Zunino, another materials engineer at ARDEC, said. “With additive manufacturing we could potentially customize to each soldier’s liking.” A U.S. Air Force airman fires an M203 grenade launcher attached to an M4 carbine., USAF To this end, Picatinny is working on a concept involving forward-deployed teams with “expeditionary kits” of 3D printers and materials who can quickly fabricate new parts in the field. They might not even need to make entirely new components. If someone doesn’t like they handling of their weapon, engineers might simply be able to draw up pieces that fit onto the existing features without time-consuming modifications. The basic principle ARDEC is describing already exists on the private market in the United States. Magpul, which makes firearms and accessories, has what it calls a Mission Adaptable (MAID) pistol grip for AR-15- and M16-pattern weapons. With the arrangement, a shooter can easily replace the back strap and adjust the overall contour to their liking. Other companies make similar products for the AR-15/M16 family and other guns. In fact, a large portion of the polymer pistol market now has interchangeable grip panels and back-straps. With the right materials, the Army could simply 3D print these optional pieces. This plan would build on the experience of the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force, as well. Since 2004, the REF has sent teams of engineers and technicians to Iraq and Afghanistan to help quickly produce prototype systems and solve urgent requirements. The unit began fielding “Expeditionary Labs” (ExLabs), which were 20-foot shipping containers kitted out as transportable workshops. As of 2014 , the group had two 3D printers in its ExLabs Afghanistan. “You’re not going to be able to make a grenade launcher in one of the expeditionary kits we’re building, but if you want an additional Picatinny rail or grip we want to be able to give them that ability,” Zunino made clear. Experimental cased-telescoped ammunition, with polymer cases (top), and caseless ammunition., US Army On top of that, it’s possible ARDEC’s research could lead to improvements in the manufacturing of polymer-cased ammunition. Since the early 2000s, the Army has been actively working on a succession of small programs exploring the potential of caseless, cased-telescoped and polymer-cased ammunition. The main goal of all these concepts is to reduce the amount of weight an individual soldier has to carry. For more than a century now, companies have almost universally built small arms rounds with metal cartridge cases. With troops carrying hundreds of rounds, that weight quickly adds up. It’s not cheap, either. Using cases made of high-strength plastics or getting rid of them altogether, along with lighter magazines, would ease the burden on many soldiers in the field. Others services are interested in the concept too. “We have to have lighter equipment,” William Williford, executive director of Marine Corp Systems Command, said at the Navy League’s Sea, Air, Space 2017 conventional and exposition . Williford specifically mentioned polymer cartridges and magazines, but added that just transporting ammunition cans on plastic pallets might be a good place to start. In partnership with the Marines, other Army units, or elements elsewhere within the U.S. military, ARDEC could conceivably help fabricate prototypes of any of these systems of its 3D printers. And in a future combat situation, its engineers might be able to build up replacements on the spot. “We’re trying to explore what other techniques are out there that could be complimentary to current and future weapon system production,” Zunino said.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",U.S. And NATO Special Ops Just Fought a Fake Guerrilla War in West Virginia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To the casual observer, the scene might’ve looked like an odd cross between a reenactment of a past war and a demonstration of a future conflict. Elite special operators, some of whom were speaking foreign languages, were roving around the hills of West Virginia on foot, horseback, all-terrain vehicles, and by helicopter, while practicing specialized tactics, some of which are nearly a century old. But this wasn’t another remake of the movie Red Dawn or a weird time-traveling short story . It was a real life, routine exercise called Ridge Runner 2017 that occurred in February 2017. The particular group of participants – including special operators from the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all of whom are NATO members – and certain practice sessions suggested the event had a lot to do with Russia’s increasingly revanchist polices in Europe. Broadly, Ridge Runner’s “purpose is to provide challenging, realistic, and meaningful training,” the training program’s official website says. “In a changing world where global security threats are taking new forms in an increasingly swift and unpredictable manner, Ridge Runner is a training opportunity for [special operations forces] and [general purpose forces] to enhance their readiness to meet these missions.” The West Virginia Army National Guard runs the irregular warfare program for the benefit special operations forces and conventional troops, other government agencies, and sometimes American allies, all of whom who want to make use of the state’s unique Advanced Mobility Training Area. The “facility” is huge, covering approximately 500,000 acres of both public and private land, which state and federal authorities use under land agreements with the owners. Special operators conduct a mock sensitive site exploitation during Ridge Runner 2017., US Army The entire setup provides a real, populated zone with various natural and man-made features for troops and police to practice both containing mock insurgencies and terrorist movements in “friendly” territory and working “behind enemy lines” with “local forces” made up of other troops and civilian role players. The Pentagon refers to the latter task of training irregular forces in foreign countries to conduct guerrilla warfare against hostile governments or occupying forces as “unconventional warfare.” The 2017 iteration included members of the U.S. Army’s 10th Special Forces Group, the West Virginia Army National Guard, and the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, as well as the Baltic special operations forces.  The West Virginia State Police also took part in the event. Before Ridge Runner, during the Cold War, Green Berets had also trained in West Virginia as part of previous guerrilla warfare programs, including one known as Guerrilla USA. And the overall structure of newer training sessions, along with the practice area itself, shared many similarities with the Army’s Special Forces capstone qualification exercise, nicknamed Robin Sage . https://youtube.com/watch?v=5RS7wOfbbx8 Held at various times throughout the year, Robin Sage puts the latest batch of Green Beret candidates through that unconventional warfare scenario set in the fake region of “Atlantica” that covers much of the United States’ eastern seaboard. The basic premise is that the trainees must support resistance forces in the “Republic of Pineland” – North Carolina – against invading forces from “United Provinces of Atlantica,” which stretches from Maine to Virginia. US Army The focus of Ridge Runner can be more varied, but the unconventional warfare tasks would be similar. During the 2017 iteration, troops and police conducted heli-borne raids against simulated militant camps and practiced hunting for insurgents with dogs, among other events. After assaulting the mock compounds, special operators trained on how to pick over the sites for possible intelligence, a skill known as sensitive site exploitation. In addition, special operations forces learned how to perform less common military tasks. One of these events included covertly infiltrating into areas at night on horses. Some regions have roads that are too small for even small pickup trucks, if there are any roads at all, and animals might be the only mode of transport. American elite troops regularly practice how to utilize and care for both horses and pack animals like donkeys for specialized operations. In 2001, Green Berets famously rode around Afghanistan on horseback, supporting North Alliance fighters and fighting the Taliban. Another task involved a nearly 100 year-old method of sending messages from hard to reach areas. During that practice session, elite troops strung a rope trapeze with the physical message between two poles. Contractors from Colorado-headquartered Rampart Aviation flew a de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter low enough that an individual in the back could grab the line with a grappling hook. A contractor-operated de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter swoops down to pick up a message., US Army Pennsylvania dentist Dr. Lytle Schooler Adams invented this system in the 1920s. In 1937, he founded All American Aviation with the express purpose of picking up and delivering mail in remote regions. Between 1939 and 1949, his airline delivered approximately 75,000 pounds of mail to small towns and villages in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, according to the National Postal Museum . Today, most people would know All American Aviation by its current name, U.S. Airways. During World War II, Army aviators used the system to rapidly send orders and other information across the battlefield in lieu of radios. Early special operators also used the gear to deliver and recover equipment and intelligence from partisans and agents in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. On top of that, the trapeze arrangement proved useful for getting downed troop gliders back into the air and even snatching individuals right off the ground . In the 1950s, inventor Robert Fulton improved on the basic principle to create his famous Skyhook recovery device. For a special operations team today, the method could be useful if enemy forces had either jammed or tried to intercept radio communications, threatening to expose friendly positions or reveal sensitive information. Russian troops have employed electronic warfare systems to great effect, coupled with their own special operations forces on the ground, while supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine and government security forces in Syria. A special operator on horseback during Ridge Runner 2017., US Army And if the presence of the Baltic special operations forces was any indication, it appears that Ridge Runner 2017 may have been inspired by Russia in other ways, too. While the mock insurgencies and counterinsurgencies might reflect missions American forces, both conventional and special operations, might expect in their near future, for Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian operators it is a scenario they might be able to imagine in their own back yards. After Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region in March 2014, subsequently annexed the peninsula, and began supporting armed separatists fighting Kiev’s authority in the country’s eastern Donbas region, many of Russia’s neighbors worried they might be next. Semi-autonomous republics inside the Soviet Union until 1991, all three Baltic countries also have significant ethnic Russian populations who have at times agitated for greater freedoms and accused government authorities of trying to stamp out their culture. Since their independence, Baltic officials continued to worry about Kremlin-backed political movements, insurgencies, or even an outright invasion. In 2004, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania all joined NATO in no small part because of these concerns. A brief war in 2008 between Russia and Georgia only served to reinforce those fears. Georgia was another former Soviet republic that had been waging a low-level counterinsurgency campaign against pro-Russian groups. Authorities in Tbilisi decided to make a push to recapture the breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but ended up routed by Moscow’s troops. West Virginia State Police K-9 unit moves out., US Army Afterwards, in both of the de facto independent countries, the Russian Ruble became the official currency and citizens began to carry Russian passports, making it seem like total annexation was inevitable. The events in Ukraine, yet another former Soviet republic, only compounded the anxiety in the Baltic region. Then, In September 2014, the Russian Federal Security Service, a successor to the Soviet KGB that is also better known by its Russian acronym, FSB, detained Estonian Internal Security Service officer Eston Kohver under suspicious circumstances. Moscow claimed Kohver had crossed the border was attempted to conduct an intelligence operation on Russian soil. The response from Tallinn was that the FSB had kidnapped him. After a year in Russian hands, a show trial and a brief imprisonment, Kohver returned home as part of a prisoner swap. In a scene out of a Cold War spy drama, Aleksei Dressen, who Estonian authorities had charged with treason for working with the FSB, walked past Kohver on a bridge over Piusa River onto Russian soil. Special operations forces assault a building during Ridge Runner 2017., US Army If a conflict with Russia or Russian-backed partisans were to break out in the Baltics, special operations forces would likely be key actors to either tackle anti-government groups or lead resistance against occupying forces. A stay-behind force led by special operators might be critical in the event of an actual invasion. Thanks to the shared history of the Soviet Union, the capitals of present day Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all less than 200 miles straight down a major highway from the Russian border. In Lithuania’s case, the boundary is with Russia’s strategic enclave in Kaliningrad, which has significant forces permanently stationed within. In February 2016, the RAND Corporation think tank released a shocking report suggesting that Russian troops could seize control of the seats of government in Estonia and Latvia within three days. More damning, according to the analysis, NATO would be hard pressed to stop the offensive or even counterattack, despite American efforts to improve their military capabilities near the alliances borders with Russia. Baltic operators provide security during Ridge Runner 2017., US Army In 2014, President Barack Obama announced the beginning of the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), which led to an uptick in training exercises, troop deployments, and aerial patrols along NATO’s eastern flanks. The Pentagon’s dubbed the mission Operation Atlantic Resolve. In December 2016 , American officials decided to accelerate the initial deployments of new rotating force packages in the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania. The first Army contingents began arriving the next month, which prompted Russian officials to say they would respond in kind to the “provocation.” But during the 2016 election campaign and after his victory and inauguration, President Donald Trump repeatedly stated his desire for better relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Even more worrisome to residents in Baltics was the language of one his most vocal supporters. “I’m not sure I would risk a nuclear war over some place which is the suburbs of St. Petersburg,” Republican politician and Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich said on “ CBS This Morning ” in July 2016. Trump’s election “sent a shiver through the whole region,” Eerik-Niiles Kross, an Estonian parliamentarian who formerly acted as the country’s intelligence coordinator, told The New York Times after the election in November 2016. So, Baltic officials may be inclined to prepare for any contingency, with or without American help. Still, the lessons their special operations forces learned at Ridge Runner 2017 could only help with that type of planning.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 12, 2019",Miniature Smart Bombs Could Help Give the F-35 Firepower It Desperately Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At the Navy’s League’s Sea Air Space 2017 convention and exhibition, The War Zone learned ATK Orbital believes its Hatchet and Hammer miniature bombs might be a good fit for Lockheed’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The jets sorely need more firepower in their stealthiest configuration, but they still can’t attack fast-moving targets on the ground at all , a key capability for aircraft supporting troops on the ground. At the core of the issue is the F-35’s on board electro-optical targeting system (EOTS). While the sensor package can detect and track moving objects, it can’t hit them automatically. This is because there is no so-called “laser-lead” function, which would do the math to tell bombs and missiles how far ahead they’d need to fly to actually hit fast-moving land vehicles or boats . So, as of April 2017, a pilot in one of the U.S. Air Force’s F-35As in their Block 3i configuration has to manually gauge where to point the laser to try and hit a moving target. The Marine Corps’ less advanced Block 2B package lacks any automated functionality, as well. Lockheed and the Pentagon are working to address this issue in the up-coming Block 3F software and hardware, but have suggested the Joint Strike Fighters may not have a full moving-target “laser-lead” capability until the Block 4 upgrades begin to arrive, which is unlikely to occur before 2020, and likely some time after. Unfortunately, the Pentagon needs more options now . “The ability to hit a moving target is a key capability that we need in current close-air support fight,” Air Force Brigadier General Scott Pleus, in charge of the service’s F-35 integration office, told DefenseNews in February 2017. A U.S. Air Force F-35A drops a practice GBU-12/B laser-guided bomb., USAF Throughout the course of the Joint Strike Fighter project, critics have repeatedly panned the Joint Strike Fighter’s ability to conduct air strikes in support of ground operations in general, often pointing to the much more impressive armament and low-level flying characteristics of the blunt-nosed A-10 Warthog . To try and settle the argument, American legislators have mandated a fly-off between the two aircraft, which Pleus has said is slated to start in 2018 . If the F-35 still lacks the ability to hit tanks and trucks on the move when those tests kick off, it might almost guarantee an embarrassing outcome for the stealthy fighter and reinforce criticisms that the jets are still far from combat ready . The A-10 – as well as fourth generation fighters such as the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16C Viper – can carry newer targeting pods, including Lockheed’s own Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP), which have laser-lead capability. In addition, weapons, such as Raytheon’s GBU-49/B Enhanced Paveway II and the company’s still in development Small Diameter Bomb II, have this functionality built into the weapon itself. So, in February 2017, the Air Force posted a notice on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, asking for immediate proposals for a 500-pound class bomb for the F-35 with an integral moving-target capability. This requirement matched the description of the GBU-49/B, which the Pentagon ultimately picked as an interim solution. At a luncheon briefing at Sea Air Space 2017, Jack Crisler, Lockheed’s Vice President for F-35 Business Development and Strategy Integration, told reporters his company was still having active discussions with the U.S. military on how to quickly add the Enhanced Paveway II to the Joint Strike Fighter’s weapon “menu.” Regardless of if and when the GBU-49/B becomes available for the F-35, it will be the second work-around for EOTS’ long-standing moving target deficiency. The Pentagon knew at the beginning of the Joint Strike Fighter program that moving targets would pose a problem. When Lockheed subsequently developed EOTS, laser-lead technology was still coming of age. So the initial plan was to arm the jets with advanced cluster bombs to make up for the shortcoming. These Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispenser-Extended Range (WCMD-ER) dispensers, guided by a combination of GPS and inertial navigation system (INS), full of BLU-108/B Sensor Fuzed Munitions (SFMs) would be an interim fix until a more permanent solution came online. Each SFM consists of four, independent explosively-formed penetrator warheads, which ultimately separate from the main body and fall toward their targets. Each one detonates when its on board dual-mode infrared sensor picks up a vehicle. If it doesn’t find one, it explodes on impact with the ground. A fragmenting ring does give the weapon the ability to kill nearby soft-targets, like people, as well but this system is a far cry from Cold War-era containers full of unreliable hand grenade-sized bomblets. The U.S. military designated the WCMD-ER with 10 BLU-108/Bs as the CBU-105/B Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW). You can read all about this weapon here . But it goes without saying that a cluster bomb intended to strike groups of targets is very different from a missile or bomb outfitted with a unitary warhead intended to focus one individual point of impact. Dropping 10 submunitions to attack terrorists in a lone pickup truck would never have been cost-effective nor uncontroversial. It also wouldn’t have been precise enough to hit specific small vehicles in congested urban areas, which would’ve increased the risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties. In short, the weapon was always going to be an imperfect solution. Now it’s a moot issue. U.S. Air Force airmen load a a practice GBU-12/B onto an F-35A., USAF On June 19, 2008, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates declared the United States’ intent to dramatically scale back the use and sale of these cluster bombs. In his memorandum , he cited changing international norms and a moral imperative to protect innocent civilians from unexploded ordnance during and after conflicts. After 2018, American troops couldn’t use cluster munitions – including bombs and shells – where more than one percent of the submunitions wouldn’t reliably go off. In the interceding decade, regional commanders would have to approve their employment on a case-by-case basis. This appeared largely designed to calm officials on the Korean Peninsula , whose war plans relied heavily on beating back hordes of North Korean armored vehicles with SFMs. The new rules were a product of an increasingly vocal campaign in favor of the international Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which had banned signatories from building, using or exporting weapons that met very specific definitions eight years earlier. CCM did not prohibit members from stockpiling weapons that had fewer than 10 submunitions each weighing less than approximately 8.8 pounds, would detect and engage single targets, and had electronic self-destruct and electronic self-deactivating features. Though relatively minor modifications would have made the CBU-105 compliant with the CCM, the international stigma against cluster munitions became too much for defense contractor Textron. In September 2016 , the firm announced it would no longer make the SFM. This succession of events sent Lockheed and the Pentagon scrambling for another solution to the F-35’s moving target problem. And this is where Hatchet and Hammer begin to come into the picture. The CBU-105/B and its components on display at at the 2008 Singapore Airshow., Texcoco/Wikimedia Unveiled in 2012, Hatchet is an approximately eight-pound miniature guided bomb with a three and a half pound blast-fragmentation warhead. Though still in development, ATK Orbital plans to offer the weapons with GPS/INS guidance alone, or a combination of that navigation system and a laser, infrared sensor or even an active-radar homing arrangement akin to European consortium MBDA’s Brimstone, a company representative told The War Zone on the floor of Sea Air Space 2017. Thanks to advancements in so-called “ alternative warhead ” technology, it only reportedly takes six of them to saturate an area the size of a football field with deadly fragments. Relying on inert shrapnel rather than bomblets, the Pentagon’s goal with these warheads has been create cluster bomb-like effects without any potential for hazardous unexploded ordnance ATK Orbital has been working closely with U.S. Special Operations Command on the project, which would be ideal for attacking specific terrorists while reducing unintended casualties. Hatchet and similar designs promise to make a variety of small unmanned aircraft, many of which previously only had the payload capacity to carry out limited surveillance missions, lethal attackers as well. American special operators would likely employ the weapon from a variety of drones or the multi-mission launcher on newer AC-130 gunships . It is possible a miniature munition such as Hatchet killed Al Qaeda’s number two Abu Khayr al Masri , a son-in-law to the late Osama Bin Laden, in Syria in February 2017. A U.S. Air Force airman prepares to load a CBU-103/B cluster bomb, similar to the CBU-105/B, onto an A-10 Warthog., USAF However, the employee at the booth added that the weapon could be a perfect compliment for the F-35 or other manned fighter jets and ground attack planes. One of the particular benefits of the combination is that the larger aircraft would be able to engage exponentially more targets during one sortie. Rather than just having one 2,000-pound class bomb to drop on one single target, a similarly sized dispenser can potentially carry dozens or even hundreds of the diminutive bombs, each able to strike an independent target or used cooperatively to blanket an area with deadly shrapnel. The F-35 would only ever have been able to carry two CBU-105/Bs in its flush, internal bomb bay. The jets could’ve carried more on the wings, but would lose much of their stealth advantage in the process. But the ATK Orbital employee explained that the firm had already begun exploring the idea of a setup holding dozens of Hatchets that would attach to the F-35’s bomb bay door specifically, usually reserved for AIM-120 air-to-air missiles. This arrangement would keep the main internal pylon free for other, larger air-to-surface weapons. One thing Hatchet might not be able to do, no matter what plane drops it, is attack hardened targets or armored vehicles. ATK Orbital says it is working on an elongated, but still small guided bomb called Hammer with a penetrating main charge and a scalable secondary warhead – expected to weigh between three to five pounds depending on the configuration – for at least some of those scenarios. Still, miniature munitions won’t do anything to fix the core issue with the lack of laser-lead functionality. Until Lockheed makes improvements to EOTS, the tiny bombs will still need a built-in capability to compensate for a target’s speed and direction, or another aircraft, manned or unmanned, or troops on the ground with appropriate equipment capable of providing the laser-lead designation capability will be required. Under such a concept, the F-35s could drop Hatchets, which would sail toward the general target area thanks to its GPS/INS navigation system, where they would begin looking for the laser spot from of one those secondary sources. The U.S. military has already successfully employed the Viper Strike glide-bomb, which uses a similar combination of sensors, to attack moving targets since 2007. In 2015 , Lockheed announced plans for an Advanced EOTS (AEOTS), which would be ready to go as part of the F-35’s Block 4 upgrades in the 2020s. There is no word yet on how much that new system would might cost or what the total bill might be to install it across the existing fleet of F-35s. While it is possible that the company could simply opt to add its Sniper advanced targeting pod to the Joint Strike Fighter as a more immediate solution, Lockheed’s Jack Crisler was insistent that the internal system would be superior to any podded competitor, especially when the jet was in its stealthiest configuration. The Pentagon and Lockheed both seem to be focused on making sure the self-contained GBU-49/B is compatible for the Joint Strike Fighter first, which would give the aircraft at least one moving target option in the near term. The aircraft aren’t expected to have the necessary software updates to carry and launch the even more capable Small Diameter Bomb II until 2022 . In the meantime, both Pentagon and Lockheed have focused the blame for the F-35’s continuing moving target issue on the Convention on Cluster Munitions. U.S. Marines load a practice GBU-12/B onto one of their F-35Bs., USMC “The U.S., by treaty, is not allowed to use those weapons anymore,” Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan complained to reporters in February 2017. “So when that weapon left the inventory, we were left without a weapon that could hit moving targets.” This, however, wasn’t entirely true. Despite public pressure, the United States has still not formally adopted the CCM. On top of that, despite reports questioning this assertion, Textron repeatedly insisted the CBU-105/B met the one percent requirements outlined of Gates’ 2008 memorandum. It is possible the Pentagon could have sought out a new manufacturer for the weapons after 2016. However, when it comes to the F-35, a number of foreign partners – notably the United Kingdom – are signed up to the CCM, so the SFW wouldn’t have necessarily been an option for them regardless. But really, as the F-35 timeline slipped, and the ability to hit targets on the move with targeting pods and highly-precise weaponry became the norm, Lockheed and the Pentagon should have known the CBU-105 was no longer viable for that role regardless of the CCM or Gates’ Pentagon memo. “It’s probably important to know that we had a moving target capability until a treaty kinda took that weapon away from us,” Crisler added during his comments at Sea Air Space 2017, again referring inaccurately to Pentagon policy regarding the CBU-105. Whatever happens with EOTS, as time goes on, the Air Force, Marine Corps and ultimately the Navy will want add more capability to the F-35 series in general. But Lockheed will have to fix the laser-lead problem to get the most out of weapons such as Hatchet and allow pilots to attack multiple targets, including those on the move, while still maintaining their most stealthy configuration.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 10, 2018",America Is Still Training Ukrainian Troops to Fly a Drone They Hate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New video footage shows soldiers from the U.S. Army National Guard are still training their Ukrainian counterparts to fly the controversial RQ-11B Raven. This latest practice session occurred more than three months after Kiev’s forces complained bitterly to the international press about the tiny, pilotless planes. On March 29, 2017, members of the Oklahoma National Guard’s 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team flew at least one RQ-11B over the Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine. Approximately 250 guardsmen from the brigade arrived almost three months earlier , becoming a major component of the American-led Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U). On April 2, 2017, the guardsmen posted footage taken from the unmanned aircraft’s camera on the Pentagon’s main online media hub, the Defense Video Imagery Distribution System. The citizen soldiers were mentoring “Ukrainians conducting reconnaissance and observing fires with a RQ-11 Raven unmanned aerial vehicle during a combined-arms battalion live-fire exercise,” the official caption explained. The RQ-11B is a small, hand-launched pilotless aircraft with color a daytime video camera or an infrared night-vision type. Weight just over 4 pounds, the drone can stay aloft for between one and one and half hours, before it lands at a pre-programmed point. This gives the Raven an effective operational radius of just more than 6 miles. Troops on the ground can control the aircraft and watch the feed using hand-held controls. The video from Ukraine shows one of Yavoriv’s training areas, full of shell craters and trenches, as well as other emplacements, roads and the surrounding forests. With the exception of the operator’s hand briefly appearing at the beginning before the drone takes to the air, no troops or vehicles are visible. In service across the Pentagon since 2001, drone maker AeroVironment has made 1,000s of Ravens and sold them around the world. The United States itself has included them in aid packages to various allies. In July 2016, the Pentagon sent 72 to Ukraine as part of series of military assistance deals following’s Russia’s increasingly aggressive actions in the country. More than two years earlier, Moscow’s troops forcibly annexed the Crimean Peninsula and subsequent began support insurgents in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region. The small unmanned planes were supposed to help Ukrainian troops better monitor their surroundings, track enemy troop movements, surveil their borders and other similar missions. Kremlin-backed armed groups and Russian “volunteers” had access to their own drones, as well as armored vehicles and heavy artillery, all of which put Kiev’s security forces at a distinct disadvantage. In principle the Ravens would have been a step, if a small one, toward a fair fight. But in December 2016, Reuters dropped its bombshell report. According to their sources, the RQ-11s were not only under-performing in the Eastern European country, they might actually have been putting Ukrainian troops in danger. At issue was the Raven’s analog control system, which had not been a major factor for American troops fighting terrorists and insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. “From the beginning, it was the wrong decision to use these drones,” Natan Chazin, a military advisor working for Ukraine’s Chief of the General Staff, told Reuters . “The complex is analog, therefore command channels and data are not protected from interception and suppression by modern means of electronic warfare,” the country’s Air Force Command said in an Email to the news organization. Early in the conflict , the fighting in eastern Ukraine provided a perfect opportunity for Russian forces to test out their extensive arsenal of electronic warfare equipment. These included powerful, mobile jammers and other gear that could potentially spoof or intercept drone control systems. Ukrainian troops train with their American counterparts at Yavoriv in 2016., US Army When it came to the Raven, there was immediate evidence it was vulnerable to these state-of-the-art jamming systems. In November 2016 , a militia fighting for the breakaway Luhansk People’s Republic showed off a Ukrainian RQ-11 its troops had reportedly forced down. But far more worrisome was that insurgents or their Russian partners might have the ability to intercept and view the Raven’s camera feed. Depending on the drone’s route, the camera might end up showing Ukrainian positions to the enemy, becoming a sort of flying double agent. On top of that, the unmanned aircraft’s relatively short range meant it could not reach enemy artillery emplacements, a major point of interest, either. Both sides in the conflict have relied heavily on howitzers and rocket batteries to uproot troops from dug-in positions. For Kiev’s military, effective counter-battery operations have long been a major problem. An unnamed Ukrainian official had told Reuters troops were no longer using the RQ-11s on the front lines. The recent video doesn’t necessarily contradict these reports and may actually offer some confirmation. Less than 50 miles from the Polish border, Yavoriv is on the complete opposite side of the country from the hot spots in Crimea and Donbass. Ukraine’s western allies continue to use the site in no small part because there is no risk of becoming directly embroiled in the country’s conflicts or getting caught in the crossfire. The JMTG-U’s activities are no where near the front lines and officially are not supposed to be related the fighting further east. A Ukrainian BM-27 Uragan rocket launcher., Ukraine MoD But it is impossible not to see a connection between the increased US-Ukrainian military cooperation and Kiev’s desperate need for more troops, better training, and improved equipment to combat well-armed separatists and their Russian allies. And it’s hardly the first time Ukrainian authorities have spared with their counterparts in Washington over military assistance programs. Though the United States has sent more than $600 million worth of gear, a major point of contention immediately was that most of those deliveries were “non-lethal” or “defensive” in nature. “Blankets and night vision goggles are important,” Poroshenko quipped before a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Sept. 18, 2014. “But one cannot win a war with blankets.” Then, in November 2015, The Washington Post reported that a batch of Humvees sent to Ukraine was practically falling apart when it arrived. The dated models had been languishing in warehouses and quickly became a logistical nightmare for local troops. “Why would I pay to keep replacing tires when I could just buy a car?” a special operations forces soldier who identified himself only as Lieutenant Colonel Andrei told the Post . President Barack Obama and his administration had always favored sending batched of clearly defensive or protective supplies, focusing instead on sanctions and diplomatic initiatives to actually force a change in Russia’s policies toward Ukraine. The Pentagon’s apparent insistence on continuing to train with the Ravens—perhaps useful for helping Kiev’s troops on their path to modernization, but ill-suited to the country’s actual conflict—seems to be in line with this strategy. Members of the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team stand in sub-zero temperatures after arriving in Yavoriv in January 2017., OK ARNG Many legislators, including outspoken Republican Senator John McCain from Arizona had wanted to send better equipment and powerful weapons to Kiev’s forces and might’ve hoped a president from their party would be more amendable to the situation. However, while President Donald Trump has been rapidly expanding American military involvement in the Middle East and Africa since he took office in January 2017, he has repeatedly suggested it might be possible to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has been noncommittal on the situation in Ukraine. “We will work with Ukraine, Russia, and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border,” Trump told Poroshenko over the phone on Feb. 4, 2017, according to a White House statement. The call came amid a significant spike in fighting in the Donbass. There was no detail about what variation on Ukraine’s severely disputed borders he was referring to in this conversation. It seems like that the new administration will continue to defer proposals to send Javelin anti-tank missiles or other weapons to Ukraine for the foreseeable future. In addition, Trump will eventually have to decide whether or not to extend the JMTG-U’s mission, which is slated to end in 2020. In the meantime, the troops assigned to the unit in Yavoriv will have no choice but to practice alongside their Ukrainian counterparts using whatever equipment is on hand. At the moment, this apparently includes the Ravens, which may not ultimately play a significant role in the country’s conflicts.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2020",The U.S. Army’s UH-60V Brings Older Black Hawks Into the Digital Age,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is making progress on a program to upgrade older Black Hawk helicopters and extend their service life with all-new digital cockpits. The service hopes the plan will improve fleet readiness, ease training requirements, and most importantly help save money. On Jan. 19, 2017, the first prototype UH-60V Black Hawk made its first flight in Meridianville, Alabama. More than two years earlier, the Army had started outlining the requirements for the new version of the iconic helicopter. “What we’re doing is taking out the old cockpit, all the analog gauges, and we’re replacing them with state-of-the-art multifunction … displays and all of the computing hardware to go along with that,” Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Duus, the H-60 product manager at Army’s Program Executive Office Aviation, told National Defense in April 2017. With the V model, aviators will “have greater situational awareness in the cockpit and it also reduces their workload in the cockpit and allows them to focus more on accomplishing their missions.” The UH-60V is an improved version of the UH-60L, which first entered Army service in the late 1980s. While previous upgrade projects added improved communication and defensive systems, GPS-navigation equipment, and new weapons, there had been no changes to the aircraft’s cockpit controls and displays. US Army L variant pilots did have a GPS-enabled moving terrain map, but it was not part of the helicopter itself.  Aviators had to wear this digital kneeboard strapped to one leg during operations. “You had to divide your attention constantly between … the analog gauges which were located in various spots on the dashboard, down to your leg where the kneeboard resided for you to see the moving map,” Duus explained. The final product gives the helicopter a control setup functionally identical to the one inside the UH-60M, which the Army began buying in 2007. Northrop Grumman is supplying the all-new “glass” cockpit with four large multi-function displays for the UH-60V. Contractor Redstone Defense Systems (RDS) has been responsible for actually installing the equipment at the Army’s Aviation and Missile Research and Development Center (AMRDEC) Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. Under the existing plan, RDS will ultimately build three UH-60Vs for tests and develop a standard procedure for fitting the new equipment. Then, the company will send two complete upgrade kits to Corpus Christi Army Depot in Texas, where the Army already does a significant portion of its Black Hawk maintenance. There teams will craft two more V models evaluate how easy it really is to rebuild older aircraft with the new equipment. Ultimately, the Army wants to convert more than 750 UH-60Ls into the improved models. At the same time, it will finally start retiring up to 600 aging UH-60As, dating back to the 1970s. With more commonality between the remaining Black Hawks, the service should be able to reduce maintenance requirements. As it stands now, units with UH-60Ls have significantly different needs, both in terms of expertise and replacement parts, from those with UH-60Ms. In addition, the Army has to have repair crews trained to handle both analog and digital systems and large stockpiles of both sets of equipment. In an actual conflict, this could quickly become a logistical nightmare. The Army also expects the UH-60Vs to reduce strain on pilot training. Since Northrop Grumman’s cockpit will work much the same way as the one in the UH-60Ms straight from Sikorsky, new aviators will no longer need to go through variant specific courses to learn the controls. “For the aviator, you’re going to be able to go from a Victor to a Mike model or vice versa, and the buttons you push are going to be in the same spot,” Duus said. On top of that, pilots won’t necessarily have to go through refresher sessions, or at least not nearly as many, when they go to a new unit with a different type of Black Hawks. Army personnel and contractors work on a UH-60L at Corpus Christi Army Depot in 2012., US Army But by far, the biggest goal of the UH-60V project is saving money. In the face of budget caps and cuts, for the 2017 fiscal year, the Pentagon proposed a budget that trimmed $800 million from the UH-60M program, almost cut planned purchases in half in the process. The Army had wanted to buy 60 of the M models, but only had money left for 36. “Our multiyear programs for our aviation fleet are all on the floor,” Army Vice Chief of Staff General Daniel Allyn told legislators during a hearing in February 2017. “And yet year over year, we’re put into this dilemma.” The UH-60V offers features similar to the UH-60M at a fraction of the cost. The Army hopes it will cost approximately $4 million to update each L to the new version. The service has been buying brand new M variants for $16 million. If the upgrade package works out, the immediate need for new aircraft would go down significantly. Its also possible that if the project is successful, the other services or foreign partners might want to join the program and buy their own kits, further reducing the unit costs. The Army could then shift any of the money it saves around to other, longer-term aviation projects. “Establishing a program like 60 Victor just allows us to be fiscally smart as we set our sights on Future Vertical Lift and other capabilities like … the improved turbine engine program,” Duus noted. The Army’s plan is the eventually replace many of its existing helicopters, not just the UH-60 family, with one or more clean-sheet designs as part of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) project. These new aircraft could be helicopters, tilt-rotors or other designs . A UH-60L prepares to lift a Humvee during a training exercise., US Army Unfortunately, replacing the cockpit architecture in the UH-60L won’t do anything to improve the helicopter’s overall performance. Though the series has seen steady improvements, the basic shape and structure of the Army’s Black Hawks has not changed significantly in 30 years. The UH-60M is still using the same engine as the UH-60L. And troops only carrying more gear and vehicles are only getting heavier. “Years ago, four Black Hawks could move a platoon,” Army Major General William Gayler, head of the Army Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker, Alabama, told the service’s reporters in December 2016 . “Now, it takes eight or nine and, by 2020 – assuming the linear weight increases continue at the current rate – it will take 15 to 20.” The Army was well aware of this when it drafted the requirements for the UH-60V. The new cockpit was always supposed to just be “tier one” of a multi-stage upgrade program. A notional “tier two” Black Hawk, dubbed UH-60(X), would have more substantial changes. “The second tier will focus primarily on performance related capabilities needed to support the Army Vision that cannot be achieved today within acceptable cost, schedule and risk constraints,” according to a December 2014 report . “The achievement of tier 2 performance levels will rely on the development and qualification of technology that is currently not available.” One of the Army’s newer UH-60Ms., US Army The Army is already planning to put any cost savings from the UH-60V project into a broad Black Hawk engine upgrade program. The goal of the Improved Turbine Engine Program is a better, common engine for both the UH-60 and the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The new motor, or a variant thereof, could even end up in Future Vertical Lift prototypes. But that’s still a long way off. The Army doesn’t even expect to have started engineering and manufacturing development of the turbine before 2023 at the earliest. In the meantime, the service plans to field the hundreds of upgraded UH-60Vs between 2018 and 2023. By the time the last V model arrives, it still entirely possible they’ll all have to go right back to the depot to get new engines.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",America Is Expanding Its Secretive War in Somalia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Somalia teeters on the edge of famine , the United States has announced plans to expand its secretive war in the country. The new plan, which includes giving American forces on the ground greater authority to call in fire support, is in line with increasingly aggressive policies President Donald Trump’s administration has already adopted in Iraq , Syria , and Yemen . On March 30, 2017, the Pentagon announced it would provide additional unspecified strikes for both African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) peacekeepers and Somalia government forces. Both groups are battling Islamist insurgents from Al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to Al Qaeda. A major change in U.S. policy “This authority is consistent with our approach of developing capable Somali security forces and supporting regional partners in their efforts to combat Al Shabaab,” U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, wrote in a statement on March 30, 2017. “Somali and AMISOM forces have already achieved significant success in recapturing territory from Al Shabaab, and additional U.S. support will help them increase pressure on Al Shabaab, and reduce the risk to our partner forces when they conduct operations.” Though the Pentagon did not offer any specific details, these “precision fires” would most likely include manned and unmanned air strikes. However, it is possible that this could mean howitzer or rocket artillery attacks, which American troops already employ to great effect in Iraq and Syria . African Union peacekeepers from Uganda patrol near the site of Mogadishu’s once famous Bakara Market., AMISOM Similar to previous reports about policy changes in the Middle East, the new plan included relaxed rules on the procedures for calling in those attacks, according to The New York Times . Unnamed defense sources told ABC News that the Pentagon had termed the “southern” portion of Somalia – likely not including the largely independent Puntland and Somaliland autonomous regions in the north – as an “active area of hostilities” for the next six months. President Barack Obama’s administration had used that nomenclature to refer to larger campaigns, such as those in Iraq between 2003 and 2011 and in Afghanistan. The label would give American troops in Somalia far greater latitude to conduct their operations. Since his election campaign, Trump had been vocal about his plans to unleash the military against terrorists around the world. Now, American troops may be even closer to the fighting in Somalia, too. Trump’s changes represent the first major, public shift in what has steadily and quietly become a multi-faceted counter-terrorism mission in East Africa. By 2017, while the Pentagon had been actively fighting the terrorists in Somalia for at least a decade, Obama-era rules and restrictions had tried to keep their presence discreet and American troops away from direct combat. Al Shabaab fighters ride on trucks, all-terrain vehicles, and motorcycles., AP The Obama Doctrine at work in Somalia During the Obama administration, what public face there was for American military operations in Somalia focused almost entirely on support for AMISOM. In January 2007, the African Union approved the mission to help Somalia’s fledgling central government take control. For years, insecurity in the country had forced Somalia’s internationally-recognized Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to operate from offices in neighboring Kenya. The next month, the United Nations Security Council gave its own mandate to the peacekeeping operation. The Somali politicians walked straight into a volatile power vacuum. After its dramatic loss to Ethiopian troops fighting on behalf of the TFG in 2006, former members of a parallel authority called the Islamic Courts Union had scattered and gone into armed opposition. The Islamist rebels rebranded themselves as Al Shabaab and formally pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2012. The organization has had reported contact with other African Islamists, including the North African Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Nigeria’s Boko Haram. In 2015, a faction attempted to swing Al Shabaab into cooperation with Islamic State, which led to an internal power struggle. Officially, the terrorist group remains loyal to Al Qaeda’s international leadership, which many believe to still be in Pakistan. The organization’s internal security arm has a history of arresting and executing defectors and those who threaten to splinter off, often discrediting them as spies for Western powers in the process. AMISOM Al Shabaab is “Al Qaeda’s foremost African franchise,” the January-March 2017 edition of Special Warfare , the U.S. Army Special Operation’s Command’s official magazine, declared. “Although the group has likely been pressured by key territorial and leadership losses since mid-2015, its operational tempo has been mostly unhindered.” To help AMISOM keep this threat at bay in Somalia, the Pentagon has been training and equipping African troops heading for Somalia and providing other logistical support. Kenya and Uganda are the main force providers, though Djibouti, Sierra Leon, and Burundi have contributed forces as well. Ethoipia, which has a long and complicated history with its smaller neighbor, including a bloody war over the Ogaden region between 1977 and 1978, also has and continues to be nominally part of the mission. Since 2006, observers have accused its troops of human rights abuses in the Ogaden and its forces in Somalia proper have reportedly operated independently of the bulk of AMISOM. After it stood up in 2008, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) took responsibility for American military support to the African Union-led operation. Nearly a decade later, American forces continued to conduct this effort through at a network of so-called cooperative security locations across the continent. American Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles destined for AMISOM forces in Somalia., US Army From i ts hub at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti , the Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), with the help of an East Africa-focused special operations task force, coordinated the practice sessions and equipment deliveries. All of these American activities were under the umbrella of a larger regional mission, nicknamed Operation Octave Shield . The exercises include everything from small unit tactics to disarming improvised explosive devices, which Al Shabaab routinely employs to ambush AMISOM and government troops. Equipment includes everything from armored trucks to medical supplies. In 2015, just through the Pseudo-Foreign Military Sales, the Pentagon arranged the shipment of more than dozen mine-resistant vehicles with Soviet-era 12.7mm DShK and 7.62mm PKM-type machine guns, hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, dozens of radios, and other gear, worth more than $13 million in total. This information came from a series of records the War Zone obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request. The formal Letter of Offer and Acceptance for a Pseudo-Foreign Military Sales transfer approved for Somalia., US Army Unlike more conventional foreign military assistance, this process lets American officials drop military aid on partners without them having to put up any money or even sign the necessary paperwork. As far as the Pentagon is concerned, the transfers actually occur between its own purchasing agents. Formal letters exist to document the process, but clearly state “no purchaser signature required.” Some of the equipment the US Army approved for delivery to Somalia in 2015 under the Pseudo-Foreign Military Sales process., US Army And training programs could be a regional, interagency affair, sometimes involving the State Department or domestic law enforcement agencies. Between at least 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Army’s Security Assistance Command (USASAC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) apparently ran a previously unreported joint program called the Yemen-Somalia Agent Information Exchange Conference (YSAIEC). One of the records describing the Yemen-Somalia Agent Information Exchange Conference (YSAIEC)., FBI Reports The War Zone obtained from the FBI through a separate FOIA request only document plans in 2012 to train Yemeni agents on how to analyze the aftermath of terrorist bomb attacks. The Bureau ultimately canceled those training courses due to a lack of funding. We still don’t know the full extent of the program. In December 2016, in response to yet another FOIA, USASAC said it could find no record of any formal agreements with FBI specifically relating to the YSAIEC project. Ugandan troops with AMISOM in Somalia., AP Separately, in 2007, American forces quietly began targeting Al Shabaab and its leadership as part of a separate shadowy counter terrorism mission, known as Operation Juniper Garrett. In January 2007, the Air Force spent two days attacking terrorists, including at least one sortie involving a heavily armed AC-130 gunship . Six years later, a group of elite forces from Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), called Task Force 48-4, were reportedly spread throughout East Africa and Yemen hunting specific individuals. Reports The Intercept obtained in 2015 showed ground forces, drones and manned surveillance aircraft – including MQ-1 Predators, MQ-9 Reapers, P-3C Orions, U-28As, and contractor-operated planes – based in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya, as well as off the coast of Somalia itself. At the time, F-15E Strike Eagles , likely from the 48th Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom, were responsible for many of the actual air strikes. During 2015 and 2016, the Pentagon reported five targeted attacks on terrorists in Somalia. In March 2016, American aircraft notably killed more than 150 Al Shabaab fighters at a training camp near Raso, more than 100 miles north of Mogadishu. JSOC also conducted raids on the ground. In September 2009, members of SEAL Team Six and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment attacked a convoy carrying Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a member of the global Al Qaeda organization and intermediary with Al Shabaab, and his compatriots near the town of Barawe. The special operators killed Nabhan and captured other members of his entourage. On Jan. 23, 2012, special operations, possibly again from SEAL Team Six, successfully rescued American citizen Jessica Buchanan Danish national Poul Thisted from Al Shabaab. The terrorists had been holding the two westerns, who had worked been in the country working for the Danish Demining Group, the year before. Obama authorized the mission, dubbed Operation Octave Fusion , after learning that Buchanan’s health was failing. After the rescue, a team from the 379th Expeditionary Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, based at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, helped get her to a military hospital in Djibouti for treatment. An F-15E Strike Eagle refuels somewhere in the Middle East in 2016., USAF Not every raid was so successful. In January 2013, American forces supported a French mission to rescue intelligence agent Denis Allex. The operation failed and Al Shabaab militants murdered Allex. Almost 10 months later, SEAL Team Six returned to Barawe , but was forced to leave without killing or capturing their target after a sustained firefight. The Pentagon’s efforts don’t necessarily include the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) cooperation with its powerful counterpart in Somalia, the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA), either. NISA is in charge of the country’s premier anti-terror units, most notably Danab , meaning “lightning,” a reportedly battalion-size elite special operations force, part of the agency’s larger rapid reaction arm called Gaashaan , or “shield.” The United States also stepped up support for Kenya’s domestic counter-terrorism activities, as Al Shabaab began conducting attacks across the border. In 2012, Kenyan troops had helped local forces liberate the city of Kismayo in southern Somalia and much of the surrounding area from the group. The following year, Al Shabaab terrorists infamously killed more than 65 people in an attack on the popular Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya. The offensive also brought the peacekeepers into conflict with Somalia’s government, who worried the offensive was actually a land grab. Ultimately, authorities in Mogadishu and Nairobi settled the argument by granting the Jubaland region an autonomous status similar to Puntland and Somaliland. Al Shabaab remained a major threat and the insurgents claimed to have killed scores of Kenyan troops in two spectacular attacks on their bases in 2016 and 2017 . In both cases Kenya officials dismissed the terrorist claims, insisting their losses had been minor. Kenyan troops in Somalia., AP A harrowing past for the United States and Somalia In spite of all this bloody fighting, when it came to American military activities in and around Somalia, the Obama administration had routinely stressed that U.S. deployments were temporary and in response to specific threats.  In total, in 2016, AFRICOM launched nine “self-defense strikes.” Officially supporting AMISOM forces, these activities pointed to increasingly close coordination between American troops – likely special operations forces – and their African partners and their growing proximity to the actual fighting. “It has been difficult to track strikes against [Al] Shabaab as there are multiple actors involved in targeting the group,” U.S. Army veteran and journalist Bill Roggio wrote at the Long War Journal in January 2017. “[But] AFRICOM has loosely defined targets such as IED facilities and training camps as ‘counterterrorism operations,’ when in reality these are military operations since they are often launched against well-defended and well-defined targets in areas under direct [Al] Shabaab control.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=f8qWNJB0TtM However, as of January 2017, the only permanently deployed American troops in Somalia were the less than 10 individuals assigned to the Military Coordination Cell (MCC) in Mogadishu. On average, this group had approximately five personnel, Robyn Mack, an AFRICOM spokesperson, previously explained to The War Zone in an email. Officials refused to go into detail about the operations in Somalia, even as it became more and more obvious they were small, but enduring missions with “boots on the ground” in or at least near combat. Part of Obama’s reluctance undoubtedly had to do with the American public’s poor memory of the last U.S. intervention in Somalia. In 1992, then President George H.W. Bush sent troops to join a United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance mission in Somalia, which had been wracked by both famine and civil strife. U.N. forces found themselves increasingly unable to cope with the fluid situation where warlords and their militias still commanded immense power. Historically, in spite of Somalia being largely ethnically and religiously homogeneous, family-based clan relationships have repeatedly proved stronger than any central, independent government. U.S. Marines arrive in Mogadishu in January 1993., DOD In 1993, the international community attempted to step up the pressure with an expanded peace enforcement mission. The United States launched a separate, but coordinated effort to capture prominent militant leaders, most notably Mohammed Farah Aidid. On Oct. 3, 1993, a day-light raid on a house in downtown Mogadishu sparked a multi-day, running battle between American special operations forces and conventional troops and Aidid-allied militiamen. During the course of the fighting, Aidid’s militiamen shot down multiple UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and killed 19 U.S. personnel. Journalist Mark Bowden later immortalized the events in his book Black Hawk Down . The debacle noticeable soured many Americans on the Somalia mission in particular and foreign interventions as a whole. The last U.S. troops left the country in 1994, nearly a month before originally planned and with little fanfare there or at home. “There was no official flag-lowering today, just a brief handshake between an American Marine officer and an Egyptian captain at the airport,” The New York Times reported on March 25, 1994. “There was scavenging and even looting at the American camps even as troops were packing.” AMISOM troops cart away artillery shells Al Shabaab could use to build roadside bombs., AMISOM A murky path ahead Every subsequent U.S. administration was wary of repeating any part of the debacle, even after it became clear that Al Shabaab presented a major threat to the country and surrounding region. Now, Trump has apparently moved to formally expand both of these operations, or kick off an entirely new phase of America’s mission in Somalia, as his administration has already done in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. It’s not clear whether the additional fire support will be enough to change the situation or do so quickly. “The nascent Somali National Army [SNA] continues to lack the will and capacity to combat the group unilaterally and the Somali government continues to have little influence outside the capital,” the authors of the explainer in Special Warfare stated bluntly. “Despite the best efforts of the U.S. Government and the rest of the donor community, much of the SNA remains unrepresentative of the Somali population, as it features significant imbalances with regard to regional representation, clan, and loyalties,” State Department officials wrote in another backgrounder for a contract proposal aimed at hiring private advisors to help develop the country’s security forces. A Ugandan peacekeeper in Somalia., AMISOM On top of that, Somalia’s seemingly perpetual instability threatens to provoke a massive humanitarian disaster yet again. Earlier in March 2017, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien told the Security Council that nearly 3 million Somalis were at risk succumbing to a new famine. “What I saw and heard during my visit to Somalia was distressing – women and children walk for weeks in search of food and water,” he explained. “They have lost their livestock, water sources have dried up and they have nothing left to survive on.” This is exactly the sort of situation that might drive individuals to join Al Shabaab. Whether swayed by their ideology or not, the promise of the means to support one’s family would be attractive in a country where estimates put annual household incomes at less than $200. Economic pressures had been a major factor in the explosion of piracy off the country’s coast starting in 2005. The United States, NATO, the European Union and individual countries responded with a set of major naval operations that effectively ended maritime crime in the Gulf of Aden by the end of 2013. However, as an indicator of Somalia’s persistent hardships, pirate hijacked a small oil lighter Aris 13 and its Sri Lanka crew earlier in March 2017. The boarders claimed their actions were in response to the Puntland government permitting foreigners fish in the region’s territorial waters, threatening the livelihoods of local fishermen. They threatened to continue their attacks until authorities rescinded the permits. In addition, if Trump’s expanded military operations cause surge in civilian casualties – as has already happened in Iraq and Syria – terrorists would be keen to turn those deaths into more propaganda against the still weak central government. New, riskier raids, akin to a controversial one in Yemen in January 2017, could have a similarly negative impact. Of course, the Pentagon’s policies regarding Somalia are likely to change even more in the coming months, just as strategies have continued to evolve in other hot spots in the Middle East and elsewhere. However, it seems safe to say that America is entering a new chapter of its military interventions in East Africa.

All of the configurations use a twin-engine Beachcraft King Air 350-series platform, known as the MC-12S.

Sometime during the 2009 fiscal year, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) teamed up with what was then known as the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) to develop a radar powerful enough track both vehicles and individuals. The resulting system combined a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) with synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR) from a fast-scanning active electronically-scanned array (AESA). The SAR can build conventional images even through cloud cover, smoke and dust. A satellite-enabled tactical data-link let operators share the information quickly with command centers and troops on the ground with the appropriate receivers. The Air Force led the project and ultimately hired Northrop Grumman to build the pod and associated gear. By the end of 2009, a modified de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter—with the radar prominently fitted under the nose—had flown nearly 130 test flights, according to JIEDDO. As of 2011, the contractor-operated aircraft was zipping around Afghanistan. The VADER-equipped Twin Otter., Northrop Grumman Though engineers intended any aircraft with VADER to employ the system in combination with other sensors, such as full-motion video cameras, it had significant advantages over existing equipment by itself. The 400-pound pod could identify multiple targets across a wide field of view. By comparison, many turreted cameras on reconnaissance aircraft and drones have what is often called a narrow “ soda straw ” perspective. “Although the exact size of VADER’s field of view is classified information, it is much larger than that of the…EO/IR [electro-optical/infrared] camera,” the RAND Corporation confirmed in a 2015 report about VADER’s potential for monitoring America’s borders. Aircraft “equipped with VADER can acquire many more contacts than they would with the EO/IR system alone.” An MC-12S with only VADER would not be a perfect tool. The radar can only generate static images, although a sequence of pictures could show significant changes in the target area. Unsurprisingly, it would also not be able to pick up anything without a radar signature. The setup “alone cannot positively identify detections, it can do so in combination with other sensors,” RAND’s analysts noted. They suggested aircraft with the sensors would use them to spot potential points of interest, which crews would then focus on with cameras or other equipment. The feed from a VADER pod., DHS The biggest benefit of VADER was its ability to produce series of images to establish a so-called “pattern of life.” Commanders in Afghanistan reportedly employed the sensor-equipped Twin Otter to watch insurgents emplace roadside bombs, learning their habits and techniques, according to one 2010 Army manual . American forces had previously conducted this type surveillance with aircraft carrying wide-angle cameras, such as the aptly named Highlighter system. The Army’s complete EMARSS-V configuration clearly takes some of these factors into account. In addition to the VADER pod, to make the aircraft more versatile, each one will have a day and night-capable full-motion camera, as well as a signals intelligence (SIGINT) suite. In Word’s photo, there is no camera turret visible, but it may be retracted into what appears to be a recess behind the radar pod. Other similar aircraft, such as the Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Multisensor (ARL-M), have a similar arrangement. The cluster of antennas under the rear fuselage is undoubtedly part of the SIGINT system. Inside, each of VADER-toting MC-12S will have work stations with a standard, common computer architecture the Army has nicknamed Big Iron, along with datalinks to send any information quickly back to headquarters or troops on the ground. One of four MC-12S EMARSS-S, a signals intelligence focused version., US Army In addition, the Army only expects the EMARSS-V to be one tool in its larger aerial reconnaissance fleet. By 2020, the service wants 24 EMARSS aircraft in total, including the four VADERs, along with 20 more planes with other combinations of sensors. The MC-12S EMARSS variants will join 14 upgraded RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) and nine “newish” Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E). Like many of the EMARSS types, the Bombardier Dash-8-based ARL-Es started out as contractor-operated aircraft, which the Army subsequently bought outright for its own units. The Army hopes this combination of GRCS, EMARSS, and ARL-E will satisfy its need for airborne intelligence for the foreseeable future.  Of course, with initiatives like Big Iron giving easy access for improvements, we might see the service rapidly add new sensors and technologies as they become available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Crazy Tandem Rotor Drone May One Day Rescue U.S. Army Casualties,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army thinks a small, tandem-rotor drone could be rushing injured troops from the battlefield to field hospitals in the near future. Dragonfly Pictures, Inc. (DPI) DP-14 Hawk would be the latest way to getting casualties quickly out of harm’s way and into the care of medical professionals. Since at least 2016, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command’s (USAMRMC) Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) has been exploring how pilotless craft might speed up the casualty evacuation process. Though Army officials discussed a number of these developments during a conference at Fort Detrick in Maryland in January 2017, the DP-14 was clearly the star of the show. “Unmanned and autonomous platforms have the potential to completely rewrite the medical doctrine,” Army Colonel Daniel Kral, head of the TATRC said during the event. Kral explained that drones such as the Hawk could perform a variety of functions, from moving wounded soldiers into areas that might otherwise be too dangerous for existing helicopters or ground ambulances to delivering perishable supplies such as whole blood products. The DP-14 looks like a miniature version of Boeing’s CH-47 Chinook, the twin-rotor aircraft is 13.5 feet long and two feet wide. It can carry more than 400 pounds of cargo internally at a cruising speed of more than 80 miles per hour for almost 2.5 hours. DPI The Pennsylvania-based firm offers two side-mounted pods for additional, over-sized items. The company’s website shows Hawks configured to carry water, bales of hay or crop-dusting gear for agricultural work on these external pylons. In addition, artwork shows the drones carrying sling loads individually or in pairs. Able to enter a stable hover, the DP-14 can drop its payload within 3 meters of a specified point. DPI While crews tell the pilotless chopper where to fly, it uses its own on-board computers and 3D laser imaging technology to plot the route and navigate to its destination, according to DPI’s literature . The software is precise enough for the drone to land on uneven terrain or a ship pitching and rolling at sea. It also means the unmanned aircraft can continue to fly even if an enemy force jams or interrupts the GPS signal. These features could make the DP-14 ideal for rescuing troops in precarious situations. The smaller drones could touch down in relatively tight areas in mountainous, forested or jungle environments where larger medical evacuation helicopters, such as the UH-60 Black Hawk, would never be able to go. The laser-based navigation system could guide the drone through smoke, dust, or bad weather, too. Though there is no final price estimate for an Army version, DPI’s pilotless rotorcraft would likely be far cheaper than a Black Hawk or other conventional military helicopters. For the price as a single UH-60, the service could presumably buy multiple DP-14s. This fleet could quickly move in to schlep casualties about the battlefield “when dedicated medical evacuation assets are unavailable,” Kral noted. Of course, the drones wouldn’t necessarily be perfect solution. The small craft have no space for a medic, pararescuemen, or other additional personnel. The Army says a remote monitoring system would allow them to watch a wounded soldier’s vitals in transit, but no one would be able to respond to a significant change in their health. Artist’s concept of DP-14s sling-loading cargo singly or in pairs., DPI The DP-14 is slower than most full-size helicopters, too. Depending on how far the wounded individual is from medical attention, it might not be able to get there within the critical “golden hour,” the first hour after a major injury when many treatments have the best chance of success. Despite its relatively small size, there’s still no guarantee the unmanned helicopter will automatically be able to set down nearby, either. On top of that, just getting an injured individual in and out of the cramped confines of the Hawk might be complicated enough. And while the DPI says the top-mounted rotor assemblies make it easier to load the drone, the blades would still be spinning at chest or neck height for many individuals. Even if the DP-14’s engines came to a stop after landing, troops would have to be conscious to some degree of what are essentially spinning knives. This isn’t something anyone would want to worry about during a firefight or while struggling to save someone’s life. At the time of the conference, the Army was still evaluating the DP-14 as part of a project shared project between the TATRC and the Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.  Funding for the ongoing experiment came from the Defense Health Agency Joint Program Committee for Combat Casualty Care. DPI Even if they’re not perfect for medical evacuation, the DP-14s would be another important tool for commanders on combat. With few changes, the drones could move other personnel and supplies in support of various missions, including special operations and covert activities, as well. This is hardly the first time the U.S. military and foreign armed forces have looked at new aviation technology, especially developments in vertical lift, to improve casualty care and reduce combat fatalities, as well as transport cargo and personnel discreetly. During World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces and U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) developed numerous pods and sacks to strap onto fighter aircraft. Depending on the mission, these systems could carry both casualties and early special operators. Axis air arms performed similar tests. The Army went so far as to develop a “ Man Pick-Up Kit ” that could scoop troops or down aviators off the ground without a the rescue plane even having to land. This concept later evolved into the Cold War-era Fulton Recovery System , also known as the Skyhook, a notable feature in the 1965 James Bond movie Thunderball . This improved device involved a harness tethered to a balloon. The individual on the ground would inflate the balloon, extending the line into the air. An aircraft equipped with a special v-shaped hook on the nose would catch it and yank whoever was attached into the air. The crew would then real them into the back of the airplane. The U.S. Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) deployed the system primarily to recover special operations forces and secret agents from behind enemy lines, though it had the potential to rescue personnel stuck in dangerous situations. In 1962, during Operation Coldfeet , the CIA used the gear on a modified B-17 bomber to recover American military intelligence officials from an ice flow where they had been inspecting an abandoned Soviet research station in the Arctic. In 1996, the Air Force retired the last of the Fulton Recovery Systems. Artist’s concepts of Ryan’s Flexiwing powered hang gliders., Ryan Aeronautical via the San Diego Air and Space Museum But this was hardly the most unusual rescue project to come out of Cold War experiments. The major U.S. services tested inflatable miniature planes , jet packs and powered and towed hang gliders , among others. Starting in the Korean War, ever improving helicopters became a much more viable method of getting casualties from combat zones for life-saving treatment. The DP-14’s side-mounted pods do look very similar to the stretcher racks on Bell’s iconic 1950s-era Model 47 helicopters, which became even more famous thanks to the television show M*A*S*H . Similar experiments continued well after the Soviet Union collapsed. In the late 1990s, British company AVPRO cooked up under-wing pods for combat jets and gunship helicopters, such as the Harrier jump jet or Apache attack helicopter. Later promotional literature even showed the contains underneath the wings of Lockheed’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. As before, the firm expected its Extraction/Insertion (EXINT) unit could hold any sort of passenger, from casualties to elite troops. “It wasn’t just a hairbrained scheme thought up by some mad professor,” the ThinkDefence blog’s detailed review of the project explains. “[This was] a direct result of operational experience in the Gulf and Balkans conflicts.” Artist’s concept of downed pilots rushing to get into the EXINT pods under the wings of a Royal Navy F-35B., Via ThinkDefence On June 2, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces shot down an Air Force F-16 fighter during Operation Deny Flight. Captain Scott O’Grady survived the incident, but spent six days hiding from a local population he believed to be hostile, as well as ethnic Serb militias, before linking up with a U.S. Marine Corps rescue force. Nearly three years later, Serbian troops hit an F-117 stealth fighter during Operation Allied Force. Air Force rescuers picked up the pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Dale Zenko, within hours of his crash. In 2009, four members of the U.K. Royal Marines famously rode to safety in Afghanistan while strapped onto the sides of RAF Apaches. Images later emerged of American Marines performing a similar maneuver with their AH-1 Cobra gunships. A drone medical evacuation aircraft is a logical response to these concerns and subsequent developments. Downed pilots or wounded troops effectively trapped behind enemy lines are exactly the kind of situations where an unmanned rescuer, less conspicuous and a smaller target than a large chopper, might be especially useful. The DP-14 isn’t the first experiment with an unmanned aircraft in the vertical lift role, either. The rapidly expanding international markets for both drones and vertical take-off and landing aircraft mean there is no shortage of contenders for flying air ambulances. DPI’s offering is similar in size and scope to Mist Mobility Integrated Systems Technology’s Snowgoose GPS-guided paramotor . With a top-speed of approximately 40 miles per hour, the unmanned pod could travel nearly 200 miles depending on how much cargo it had crammed inside. In 2005, U.S. Special Operations Command began buying a number of Snowgoose systems, with the designation CQ-10A. The drone’s main limitation was the need for a speeding truck to get it up to speed and into the air. An improved CQ-10B model used the same basic shape, but employed a gyrocopter design, which allowed the unmanned cargo-hauler to get off the ground by itself. A U.S. Marine Corps K-Max helicopter., USMC But small might not be exactly what the Army necessarily wants. In August 2016, the service wrapped up a demonstration of the larger Lockheed Martin K-Max helicopter casualty evacuation role. The K-Max can operate with and without a pilot. Between December 2011 and May 2012, the Marine Corps explored using a K-Max drone to deliver cargo in Afghanistan. As part of the Future Vertical Lift program, the Army plans to eventually phase out all of its existing helicopters, something that could help pave the way for new capabilities like the DPI Hawk or a larger drone. Separately from the Army, the Navy and Marines are working on an autonomous drone version of the venerable UH-1 Huey helicopter for both cargo-carrying and casualty evacuation duties. Like the DP-14, the Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS) uses a laser-enable terrain-following system to get to and from the target area safely. Contractor Aurora Flight Services demonstrated the navigation gear on an Ex-Army UH-1H in February 2017. The TALOS UH-1H demonstrator., USN On the commercial side, in January 2016, Israel’s Urban Aeronautics completed the first untethered test flight of its AirMule. The company pitched the boxy “ flying truck ” as both a military and civilian tool, potentially replacing various traditional cargo and passenger carrying vehicles. In March 2017, European aviation giant Airbus unveiled an airmobile concept car . “The growing planned use of unmanned systems and robotics on the future battlefield affords both great opportunities for medical force multipliers,” Gary R. Gilbert, in charge of TATRC’s Medical Intelligent Systems program, said at the Fort Detrick conference. “We are already conducting research in how to use these unmanned systems to support medical missions.” In short, there are a lot of options beyond the DP-14, but a pilotless rescuer – or unmanned commando transport – of some description could definitely be part of the Army’s near future.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 15, 2018",A Higher-Risk US Strategy to Rout ISIS From Mosul Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is sending hundreds more troops to help with Iraq’s ongoing campaign to liberate Mosul from Islamic State. Meanwhile, U.S. special operators have moved to the front lines in the urban fight and are trying to blend in as they work with their Iraqi counterparts deep within the city. These are just some of the indications the White House has and continues to develop new polices in the fight to exterminate ISIS from the war-torn country. On March 27, 2017, various reports described the impending arrival of two companies of soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina – roughly 200 to 300 individuals, depending on the exact composition of the units. Officially, these troops will be there to aid Iraqi troops. “This is not a new capability,” Army Colonel Joseph Scrocca, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), told ABC News . “It provides more advise and assist assets to our Iraqi partners.” Though the Pentagon has not offered any further official details, the additional troops from the 82nd Airborne will likely help coordinate an increasing number of requests for air and artillery strikes from Iraqi and Kurdish forces in and around Mosul. The announcement came amid a dramatic uptick in total American attacks against Islamic State in general, as well as their apparent ferocity. And earlier in March 2017, pictures began to emerge of special operations forces, possibly U.S. Navy SEALs, right on the front lines of the fighting in Mosul’s western neighborhoods. Though clearly American—many have U.S. flag patches on their gear, these individuals appeared to be wearing the all-black uniforms similar to those of the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service (ICTS). In Iraq, many of the country’s security forces are instantly recognizable by their unique uniforms. On closer inspection, the uniform turned out to actually have a highly-subdued tiger-stripe camouflage scheme, but the intent was clear. Wearing what ICTS wears, or something close to it, could keep Islamic State fighters from singling out American advisers, help prevent friendly fire incidents in a region where terrorists wear a variety of patterns, shield American troops from public backlash from Iraqi operations, or simply better conceal American troops in an urban environment, according to a report by Military Times . Additionally, special operators around the world often have the authority to wear local uniform items and insignia as necessary and appropriate , both to conceal themselves among the units they are assisting during sensitive operations and instill a sense of camaraderie with their foreign partners. The change in uniform seems to coincide with a change in risk profile for US “advisors” in the Mosul fight. By many indications, these special operations personnel have been allowed to move to the front lines to fight directly alongside the forces they have “supported” for months. These and other developments all point toward an escalating American campaign against Islamic State under President Donald Trump. Compared to the risk adverse policies of President Barack Obama, the new administration appears pointedly more willing to launch air and artillery strikes that could cause civilian casualties and put American troops, including conventional forces, increasingly close to the front lines where they might get killed in combat. After taking office in January 2017, Trump insisted he and his new Defense Secretary James Mattis would institute a new plan to finally break the brutal terrorist group in both Iraq and Syria for good. Kick-starting the Mosul operation, which has dragged on longer than both American and Iraqi commanders would like, was undoubtedly a part of the overarching strategy. In October 2016, Baghdad’s troops, led by the elite ICTS, kicked off the offensive to liberate Mosul. The country’s Federal Police and government-sanctioned militias —both heavily tied to Iran—began battling Islamic State inside the city, as well. Nineveh Operations Center Despite significant gains, Islamic State was still defiantly holding on to whole neighborhoods nearly six months later. Even after clearing the eastern portion of the city, Iraqi troops faced renewed resistance from terrorist fighters as they moved across the Tigris River into the western half in February 2017 . After Trump took office, the Pentagon quickly moved to either loosen the rules of engagement or otherwise ease the process for calling in air and artillery strikes in Iraq and Syria. Some of these shifts may have started before the inauguration. In December 2016, the CJTF-OIR gave unspecified “battlefield commanders” the authority to call in “certain strikes” on their own, according to an Email the command’s public affairs office sent to Time’s Middle East Bureau Chief Jared Malsin. ICTF working deep inside battleground Mosul., AP By February 2017, select coalition troops (possibly special operations forces working hand-in-hand with their Iraqi and Kurdish counterparts, such as those in the dark uniforms in Mosul) had the “ability to call in airstrikes without going through a strike cell,” Air Force Colonel John Dorrian told the Associated Press . “There had been a noticeable relaxing of the coalition rules of engagement since President Trump took office,” an unnamed Iraqi special operations forces officer told The New York Times the next month. Previously, most requests for support had gone through the main coalition command center in Baghdad, where a team of individuals worked to quickly analyze and vet the particular circumstances. This procedure could be slow, taking up precious time troops might not have in an intense firefight. Having American troops embedded in Iraqi headquarters at brigade or even battalion level would streamline the process significantly. An Iraqi Federal Policeman keeps watch during operations in Mosul in March 2017., US Army The policy shift might let American troops or their Iraqi partners request fire missions in situations that the Obama administration would have deemed too risky. Fast-flying F-16 fighter jets, low and slow A-10 attackers and lumbering B-52 bombers, among others, had flown daily strike missions since October 2016. However, some Iraqi commanders were reportedly displeased with restrictions in place ostensibly to limit civilian casualties. For instance, though they did not explain why, as of November 2016 , the U.S. Air Force said it had not employed BLU-118/B or BLU-121/B thermobaric warheads in Mosul, nor had it dropped any BLU-122/B deep-penetrating bombs, all of which would have been ideal for destroying tunnels and underground bunkers. It is possible that the Obama administration had concerns about whether these powerful weapons might cause collateral damage. On March 10, 2017, an Air Force B-52H bomber obliterated a hotel in Mosul that Islamic State had turned into a command center. Based on the spectacular images, the aircraft may have dropped thermobaric bombs, which would be in line with the reported Pentagon rule changes. Trump’s Pentagon looks poised to similarly escalate operations in Syria, where American-backed rebel forces are preparing hopefully retake Raqqa. In March 2017, the Pentagon admitted a contingent of U.S. Marines had brought M777 howitzers and other equipment to an unspecified site north of Islamic State’s de facto capital in the country. U.S. special operations forces had also began making more visible moves to assert American power in the country, blocking various actors from taking control of the contested city of Manbij and helping local troops launch a daring raid on al Tabqa Dam. Starting in 2015, American and other coalition partners had expanded the use of tube and rocket artillery to try and be more responsive to the needs of Iraqi forces, but still deliver accurate support without increasing risks of collateral damage or relying on aircraft alone. As of March 2017, American, as well as French troops were still sending shells and rockets into Mosul. Unfortunately, if Mosul has been any indication, the lighter-armed Syrian forces will need at least as much, if not more coalition fire support to overtake Islamic State in Raqqa. Though ICTS and the rest of Baghdad’s troops continue to make progress, the pace of the Mosul liberation efforts continues to be slow for a variety of reasons. U.S. Army soldiers board a CH-47F Chinook at a tactical assembly area in Hamam al Alil, outside of Mosul, on Feb. 22, 2017., US Army At the most basic level is the matter of how many troops were and still are actually available for activities in Mosul and how effective they are and will continue to be in the weeks ahead. As of January 2016, the Pentagon assessed that it would requirement more than 35,000 troops to secure the city. Two months later , The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway pointed out that there were less than 10,000 assigned to Nineveh Operations Center in northern Iraq. The extra manpower militias and heavily armed paramilitary police have provided has been of mixed quality at best. By December 2016 , the fighting had become a grueling war of attrition on the city’s streets. ICTS and the separate, but equally elite Rapid Response Division risked ending up effectively destroyed in the sluggish, block-by-block fighting. Troops from the Iraqi Rapid Response Division fire a tactical rocket inside the city., AP The most experienced battalions within ICTS’ Golden Brigades “are suffering upwards of 50 percent casualties,” an unnamed Pentagon source warned Politico in December 2016. “If that rate stays constant the division could become combat ineffective in a little over a month, and perhaps even sooner.” Authorities in Baghdad have been loathe to give any official figures about just how many of its troops have died in the Mosul campaign. In November 2016, nearly 2,000 Iraqi and Kurdish troops died across the country, according to an estimate from the United Nations. Troops from the 9th Iraqi Army Division, one of the units the 82nd Airborne Division works with, load a rocket launcher during operation in February 2017., US Army From the very beginning of the Mosul operation, Baghdad’s forces faced a constant deluge of old and new threats. Well before the mission started, the Pentagon worried about booby-traps and chemical weapons , which could both cause mass panic among both troops and civilians and otherwise slow down operations. Tunnel networks that allowed fighters to move quickly between locations without detection were another major concern. On top of all that, Mosul was simply a dense urban area full of innocent bystanders, who Islamic State could actively use as human shields . But, by far, the biggest danger has been Islamic State’s stepped up use of suicide bombers driving extremely powerful vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). In workshops across the city, terrorists continue to pack cars, trucks and even heavy construction vehicles with huge explosive charges. Added armor plating made the vehicles resistant to incoming fire and harder to for government security forces to disable them at a safe distance. Since January 2017, numerous photos circulated on social media of these self-propelled bombs painted to look like regular sport utility vehicles and cars , possibly to try and hide them from coalition warplanes, as well. And then there’s Islamic State’s drones. The terrorists became adept at using small, commercial quad- and hex-copter types to find Iraqi security forces, guide VBIEDs to their targets, spot for artillery elements and just grab footage for slick propaganda videos. Some of the toy-like remote control aircraft can even drop improvised bombs fashioned from captured ammunition. In the meantime, the Trump administration’s increased air and artillery attacks have led to a similar surge in claims of civilians getting caught in the crossfire. Critics of the new policy have expressed concern that these incidents could undermine any long-term gains against Islamic State, while monitoring groups have been startled by the volume of additional allegations. Iraq’s own air assets have been increasingly active over Mosul, and especially its Mi-28 fleet of attack helicopters which often employs its cannon and unguided rockets while operating over the contested city. , THOMAS COEX/AFP/Getty Images “Since January and for the first time since Moscow’s intervention in Syria, alleged Coalition civilian casualty incidents in the war against ISIL [Islamic State] have outstripped claims against Russia,” independent monitoring group Airwars explained in a press release on March 24, 2017. “Almost 1,000 civilian non-combatant deaths have already been alleged from Coalition actions across Iraq and Syria in March—a record claim.” Particularly worrisome, on March 17, 2017, coalition warplanes reportedly hit a number of buildings in Mosul, killing more than 100 civilians. The Pentagon acknowledged it had flown missions in the area at the time and had begun the process of investigating the incident, but said the strike was “at the request of the Iraqi Security Forces” in an official statement . This indicated that Iraqi forces might have been calling in coalition fire support without advisers on the scene to adequately assess the situation, which in turn might be a component of the revised rules of engagement. So far, in spite of these criticisms and concerns, the Trump administration shows no sign of decreasing the total number of strikes or slowing the flow of American troops into the region. An Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service member sits in the turret on top of one of the group’s signature all-black Humvees near Mosul in February 2017., US Army “There is no military force in the world that has proven more sensitive to civilian casualties,” Mattis said at a press conference on March 27, 2017. “We are keenly aware that every battlefield where an enemy hides behind women and children is also a humanitarian field, and we go out of our way to always do everything humanly possible to reduce the loss of life or injury among innocent people.” “The same cannot be said for our adversaries, and that’s up to you to sort out,” he added. Regardless of any policy changes, as Iraqi troops move in to retake Mosul’s Old City , the battles are sure to become especially pitched and bloody. Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself a caliph of a new Islamic empire in 2014, sits within sight inside the neighborhood. Islamic State would suffer a massive blow to its standing if and when government troops finally reclaim the site. However, this loss alone isn’t likely to break the terrorist group’s resolve. “The military power of the coalition will remain where this fraudulent  caliphate has existed in order to set the conditions for a full recovery from the tyranny of ISIS,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on March 22, 2017 , indicating American involvement in the fighting and stabilization process could continue for months or even years. And while it hasn’t yielded any definitive results just yet, the Pentagon’s new strategy is clearly still evolving and it may be a while yet before we can truly know whether it’s working or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 17, 2020",Watch the U.S. Navy Test Fire Its Much Touted Railgun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than a decade, the U.S. Navy is still making slow but steady progress on its futuristic railgun. If the program can produce a functional and cost efficient weapon, it could give the service’s ships a deadly new way of attacking enemy vessels and forces ashore, as well as defending against aircraft and fast-flying missiles. On March 21, 2017, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) posted an official video showing a test of defense contractor BAE’s electromagnetic cannon at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division in Virginia. The experiment had taken place a little over four months earlier. The Navy program is also working with a second model from General Atomics, better known as the company behind the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones. The latest footage did not include any new details about the experimental weapon’s capabilities. According to the official fact sheet , the prototypes use high electric currents to create powerful magnetic fields, squirting out solid projectiles at speeds over 4,500 miles per hour, roughly six times the speed of sound. “Navy planners are targeting a 100+ nautical mile initial capability,” the Office of Naval Research’s website explains. “A variety of new and existing naval platforms are being studied for integration of a future tactical railgun system.” The Navy has been working on the project since 2005. Phase II, which would hopefully move the program from a technology demonstration closer to a plan to buy actual weapons, kicked off in 2012. One of the consistent goals has been to fit these hyper-velocity weapons on its new Zumwalt -class destroyers .  Full of electronics and equipped with a hybrid-electric propulsion system, these stealthy ships seem like a logical choice for the new weapons and their significant power requirements. USN In addition, the electromagnetic guns could replace the warship’s disappointing 155 mm Advanced Gun System. In 2016 , Navy officials admitted they were no longer planning to buy Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP) for the Zumwalt and her sister ships. Along with these GPS-guided shells, each with a price tag of $800,000, the howitzers were supposed to be a key feature of the new ships and one of the most important components of their main armament. Without the ammunition, there have been serious questions about how useful the guns will be when the destroyers make their first patrols. Less expensive existing guided cannon rounds, rocket artillery , or just more vertical-launch missile cells are all possible near-term substitutes for the LRLAP. If it works, the railgun could make the artillery systems obsolete entirely, since it would have the range and speed to provide fire support for friendly troops and take out incoming missiles. The latter point is especially important as Russia and China steadily improve and expand their anti-ship and cruise-missile arsenals. Both countries are interested in selling only slightly less capable models on the international market and Iran and North Korea have been eager to develop their own comparable systems to challenge America’s maritime power. Artist’s rendering of the USNS Millinocket with a fully-functional railgun turret on its rear flight deck., USN Inert projectiles and the lack of propelling charges make the railgun a safer and more economical alternative to traditional gun systems in many ways, as well. A ship with one of these weapons doesn’t have to allot any space to explosive propellants or risk ammunition stores exploding in combat. “Our need to carry gunpowder with us is a big vulnerability to our ships,” Robert Freeman, an ONR spokesman, told U.S. News and World Report in 2016. “A railgun could eliminate that need.” But while the Navy and its industry partners have successfully shot the experimental versions on land, they have yet to test the weapons at sea. In 2016, the service pushed off plans to evaluate the cannon’s performance on board an Expeditionary Fast Transport, previously known as the Joint High Speed Vessel. In the past, these twin-hull catamaran ships have helped test out other systems, including drones and aerostats, in maritime environments. In 2014, one of these ships, the USNS Millinocket did bring the railgun prototypes to Naval Base San Diego for a static display. The ship was not set up to shoot the weapons. The official reasoning for the delay was that preparations for a demonstration for the sake of demonstrating could slow down the overall project. “I would rather get an operational unit out there faster than do a demonstration that just does a demonstration,” Navy Admiral Pete Fanta, then the director of surface warfare and now the head of warfare integration, told Defense News in 2016. Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, then chief of naval research, holds an HVP in 2014., USN However, there were reports of continuing concerns about powering the weapon, adequately cooling it down, and just finding space in any candidate ship for the complex equipment. Earlier in March 2017, General Atomics proudly announced it had built a new high-energy pulsed-power container (HEPPC) for its railgun variant, which had twice the “energy density” as the previous model. This smaller unit took up an entire 10-foot shipping container. To try and further speed up development, the Navy had also spun off work on the actual projectile from the main program. Theoretically, engineers could make this “high-velocity projectile” (HVP) work with standard 5-inch guns on ships like the Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and in Army and Marine towed and self-propelled 155mm howitzers such as the M777 and M109A6 Paladin. Traditional chemical explosives could still boost these projectiles up to speeds of Mach 3. Armed with these rounds, ground artillery units might be able to defend against aerial threats, smaller incoming missiles and rockets and other targets they don’t have the range or speed to hit with regular ammunition. The major limiting factor would be whether existing barrels could take the punishment of firing the super-fast projectiles and for how long. General Atomics railgun fires a round during a demonstration at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in 2016., US Army The Army itself is interested in possibly replacing conventional tube artillery with railguns and their “ unlimited magazines ” at some point in the future. In April 2016, it test fired a prototype system from the back of a trailer during a demonstration at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, home of the service’s artillery school. In spite of these developments, the Navy hasn’t changed its timeline for when the electrically-powered cannons will be operational since at least 2015, according to a March 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service. The service still reportedly expects the guns to be in action by 2025. The potential for more difficulties – old or new – has not been lost on members of Congress, many of whom are looking to expand the defense budget, but have no interest in programs that might never produce results. “Although the Navy in recent years has made considerable progress, a number of significant development challenges remain,” CRS noted in its review. “Overcoming these challenges will likely require years of additional development work, and ultimate success in overcoming them is not guaranteed.” For Fiscal Year 2017, the Navy asked for more than $23 million to continue work on the railgun program. It remains to be seen whether legislators will match or increase this funding in the next budget cycle. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The U.S. Army’s Newest Spy Plane Is in Action in Africa and Latin America,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first version of the U.S. Army’s newest spy plane is in action in Africa and Latin America. At the same time, the service is finishing tests of three additional sub-variants in Arizona. On March 12, 2017, Scout Warrior first reported these overseas deployments. The War Zone subsequently learned only some of the four signals intelligence-focused versions of the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS-S) were snooping abroad. In an Email, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Sean Smith confirmed this particular model was supporting U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) operations. “There are no other EMARSS variants fielded or deployed at this time,” he added. Despite its name, the EMARSS-S has a suite of signal-snooping gear to track and listen in on enemy communications, as well as the ability to record full-motion video during the day or at night. Each aircraft also has work stations connected to the controversial Distributed Common Ground System – Army (DCGS-A) intelligence data network, which is supposed to help collect, compile, and distribute information rapidly across units. One of the four MC-12S EMARSS-S., US Army Sending the aircraft to work with AFRICOM and SOUTHCOM makes perfect sense for early deployments. The regions these commands work are relatively low threat environments for American aircraft, but offer no shortage of work tracking drug smugglers, terrorists, and insurgents in remote areas. In Central and South America and Africa, Army spy planes such as the RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) and EO-5C Airborne Reconnaissance Low – Multisensor (ARL-M) already fly routine missions, in cooperation with other aircraft and personnel from the U.S. Air Force , American law enforcement agencies, local security forces, and private contractors . After 9/11, the Pentagon found renewed interest in monitoring terrorist groups and potential hotspots in Africa with a similar mix of assets. In addition, the Army plans to ultimately replace a slew of older GRCS models – the RC-12Hs, -Ks, -Ns, and Ps, all set up to gather signals intelligence only – with EMARSS variants. This process could begin as early as the end of 2017. Smith noted in his Email that the service intends to field the remaining types after follow-on evaluations at Fort Huachuca wrap up on March 31, 2017. These plans, plus the EMARSS-S deployment, show the Army has made significant progress with a program that was almost the victim of budget cuts in 2012. In 2010, the service hired Boeing to build the first four aircraft, which eventually became the EMARSS-S. However, the Government Accountability Office subsequently told Army officials to put the work on hold and review concerns about whether the project fit with the service’s budget and priorities. Apparently, it did not. One of the Constant Hawk aircraft that the Army is converting into an EMARSS-G., US Army As part of its annual budget proposal in February 2012, the Army announced it would cancel the program entirely and send the planes Boeing had built off to the Air Force, instead. This would save an estimated $1.2 billion. “I can’t really speak to anything further on recon aircraft,” Barbara Bonessa, Deputy Director, Army Budget, said at a press conference. A reporter had asked her how the Army expected to meet ever increasing demands for intelligence aircraft, especially as the service’s existing Guardrails were only getting older. The Army’s 3rd Military Intelligence Battalion in South Korea had received the first RC-12H carrying the Guardrail Common Sensor system in 1988. So, in March 2013, the Army crafted a new plan. It would keep the four EMARSS aircraft Boeing had already built. In addition, they would consult with industry partners on what options were available to buy at least a dozen more planes on the cheap. This is where the other three EMARSS variants came in. Instead of buying all-new systems, the Army decided to purchase a dozen spy planes from contractors who were already flying them over Afghanistan and Iraq. As part of its own cost-cutting measures, the Air Force would send along eight MC-12W Liberty aircraft. A Guardrail Common Sensor aircraft., US Army The previously contractor-operated planes were a mix of Constant Hawks, Tactical Operations (TACOP), and Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER) types. The five Constant Hawks had day and night-capable video cameras only. Three TACOPs carried light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors ideal for detecting subtle changes on ground surfaces that could indicate someone has recently buried something such as an improvised explosive device. Northrop Grumman’s AN/ZPY-5 VADER can better track mobile targets and produce detailed radar imagery showing distinct individuals entering and existing vehicles – good for trying to monitor specific terrorists or insurgents. The Army would rename the Constant Hawks and TACOPs systems as EMARSS-Gs, standing for “geo-intelligence.” The VADERS would become EMARSS-Vs. The two variants would have basic signals intelligence systems to make them more versatile, as well. The Army would then transform the Liberties into multi-intelligence EMARSS-M, with a combination of signal-grabbing equipment and powerful video cameras. All the EMARSS types would get Army-standard gear, including new data links, DCGS-A work stations and self-defense equipment, according to one official briefing in 2015. This secretive aircraft may be an EMARSS type or otherwise related to the program., Rudaw The purpose-built EMARSS planes morphed into EMARSS-S to differentiate them from their new cousins. However, regardless of specific configuration, the U.S. military would refer to all the modified twin-engine Beechcraft King Airs carrying the various pieces of equipment as MC-12S. The concept of fielding multiple types of aircraft as a single aerial surveillance “system” and spacing out their development and deployment is not new to the Army. The Cerfirm Leader communications intelligence system spread different equipment across three different RU-21 types and the service fielded four slightly different versions of the GRCS between 1988 and 1998 before developing the more uniform RC-12X model. It is also possible other aircraft may be included in the EMARSS program. On March 5, 2016, a secretive Army Beechcraft King Air spy plane, wearing a civilian-style paint job and registration N6351V crashed in northern Iraq . In 2015, the Army released a table of all Army special electronic mission aircraft (SEMA) as part of a larger maintenance contract, which listed it as one of the MC-12W Liberties destined for conversion, but also mentions the eight future EMARSS-M aircraft. It remains unclear what unit was flying the plane when it crashed or what its particular configuration might have been at the time. What we do know for sure is the first MC-12S EMARSS are now in action. By the end of 2017, the bulk of the planes may be flying over foreign battlefields, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2019",U.S. Special Operators Want a Tiny Assault Rifle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. special operators are in the market for a tiny assault rifle. Finding a weapon that meets the proposed requirements could be difficult, but not impossible. In fact, it actually looks like a gun company has already shown one to the Pentagon. On March 9, 2017, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) posted a request for information regarding a new personal defense weapon (PDW) on FedBizOpps, the federal government’s main contracting website. Any interested company would have to provide information on a kit that uses the standard M4A1 lower receiver as the core of the gun. The weapon can’t be any longer than 26 inches with the stock extended, only 7.5 inches high and weigh 5.5 pounds or less. With the stock folded or collapsed, SOCOM wants the gun to shrink to no more than 17 inches long and hopefully just a mere 15 inches. This would make the weapons ideal for troops engaged in close-quarters combat or otherwise in confined spaces, as well as vehicle and helicopter crews. More importantly, however, the small firearms will fire the .300 Blackout cartridges, but will also have the ability to quickly switch to standard 5.56mm ammunition. US Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel train with Mk 18 Mod 1 carbines., US Navy The new cartridge seems to be at the heart of the project. The complete package would offer a handier weapon than a full-size rifle or carbine, but with more firepower than similarly sized 9mm submachine guns or pistols. The gun would also be more powerful than more exotic and compact PDWs on the market, such as the 4.7mm Heckler and Koch MP7 and 5.7mm FN P90. SEAL Team Six reportedly has a number of MP7s, while the US Secret Service uses P90s. Advanced Armament Corporation (AAC), in cooperation with Remington, developed .300 Blackout in the late 2000s. AAC’s initial business was designing and manufacturing sound suppressors. Founder Kevin Brittingham was interested in a new round that would be extremely quiet from even a short barrel, suppressed AR-15 or M16-type gun, but still be reasonably powerful and accurate. Taking notes from earlier work on .30 caliber rounds for suppressed guns, AAC’s Research and Development Director Robert Silvers led the project that ultimately turned out the new cartridges AAC initially planned two basic versions, a supersonic type with ballistics similar to the old Soviet 7.62mm bullet used in the AKM, as well as a subsonic variant specifically for suppressed firearms. Today, independent suppliers offer multiple loads, with different bullets and powder charges, offering varying performance under certain conditions. To keep thing as simple as possible, .300 Blackout uses the same case head and taper as a military 5.56mm cartridge. This means you only need to change a AR-15 pattern gun’s barrel to accommodate the new ammunition and can use your existing magazines. No additional special parts are needed to swap between the supersonic and subsonic cartridges. The Honey Badger Low Visibility Carbine., AAC In tests, the new rounds retained more power and accuracy as the test weapons got shorter and shorter. According to a 2012 AAC presentation , an AR-15 in .300 Blackout with a 9” barrel produced the same muzzle energy as an 5.56mm M4A1 carbine with its 14.5” barrel. However, the bullet was flying 400 feet per second slower in that instance, highlighting that the ammunition might be best suited to the PDW role or other shorter-range combat. AAC estimated a .300 Blackout gun with a 16″ barrel would have an effective range of 460 meters, but that the 9” version would still be useful out to 440 meters. By comparison, Colt says its 5.56mm M16 variant with an 11.5” barrel, the Colt M4 Commando , isn’t effective at ranges greater than 400 meters. The muzzle energy also had an impact on how bullets reacted when they hit their mark. From a short barrel, at a range of approximately 100 meters, .300 Blackout proved it could still reliably pierce through wood panels, car doors and auto glass and keep going. Many 5.56mm bullets have notable trouble penetrating these sort of obstacles, even with more energy from longer barrels. If they do make it through the barrier, especially when fired a gun with a barrel 10″ or shorter, the smaller projectiles often deflect off to one side, tumble, or fragment, making them less dangerous to anyone hiding on the other side. In the late 2000s, SOCOM started buying special “barrier” cartridges for special operators using M4s or other 5.56mm weapons specifically to try and correct these limitations. The PDW information request does not include any mention of a specific type of .300 Blackout ammunition. Despite the impressive specifications, Brittingham and his team were looking at a market that already had a variety of so-called “intermediate cartridges” aimed at civilian, law enforcement and military customers. This term commonly refers to rounds that are larger than .22 caliber ammunition like 5.56mm, but still smaller and lighter than more traditional .30 caliber rifle rounds. “Remington didn’t want to do this ammo,” Brittingham said in one 2011 interview . “They thought it was a stupid idea.” With more than 100 companies making various types of .300 Blackout ammunition by the end of the next year, the cartridge’s impressive ballistics and versatility seem to have proven otherwise. In July 2015 , the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Force announced plans to buy a carbine chambered for the American round. If this latest proposal is any indication, AAC seems to have had success with the U.S. military’s most elite troops, too. But building a gun to fit SOCOM’s needs will still be a challenge. Possible contenders such as the Colt’s Sub Compact Weapon (SCW) and short-barrel versions of the Sig MCX – a version of which in .300 Blackout reportedly won a similar Joint Special Operations Command contract for a “ Low Visibility Assault Weapon ” – don’t meet one or more of the stated requirements. Similarly, a company would not be able to simply offer a rebarreled version of the Mk 18 Mod 1 carbine – an M4 derivative with a 10.3” barrel – which U.S. special operations forces already have in their arsenals. An AAC AR-15/M16 pattern weapon in .300 Blackout with a 4.5″ barrel., AAC But AAC may already have the answer that question. In its 2012 briefing, the company unveiled what it called the “Low Visibility Carbine,” which also had the nickname “Honey Badger.” At six pounds and just over 24” overall with a compact suppressor and the stock stowed away, it’s very close to what SOCOM wants in its new gun. The gun maker added that barrels as short as 4.5” were feasible, showing off a picture of another especially stubby variant. And the Honey Badger firing subsonic ammunition “is as quiet as an MP5-SD, but with 3x the range,” one of the presentation slides declared. Heckler and Koch’s iconic integrally suppressed 9mm submachine gun is famously quiet. Of course, there’s nothing to prevent another company from making a similar firearm. Most of the basic components are readily available, even to civilians. The biggest barrier to entry would be meeting the weight stipulations, which could necessitate lightening various internal and external parts. All in all, it seems very likely that America’s elite troops who need a PDW may soon be carrying a version of AAC’s weapon—or something from another manufacturer that looks very much like it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2019",Why Russia Has Sent Troops to Egypt for Possible Operations in Libya,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian special operators have arrived at a base in Egypt ahead of possible operations in neighboring Libya. The deployment is the latest part of an apparent Kremlin strategy to reassert its influence in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as challenge United States power in those regions. Reuters was first to report on the contingent of just over 20 individuals, who brought unspecified drones with them to the Egyptian military base at Sidi Barrani. The facility is less than 50 miles from the Libyan border and less than 350 miles from the country’s eastern hub, Benghazi. “There is no foreign soldier from any foreign country on Egyptian soil,” Egyptian Army spokesman Tamer al-Rifai declared in response to the news. “Certain western mass media have been stirring up the public for years with such false information from anonymous sources,” Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told Russia’s state-run outlet RIA Novosti, also known internationally as Sputnik. It bears mentioning that foreign troops with the Multinational Force and Observers, including American forces, are based in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula as part of the terms of the 1978 Egypt-Israel peace agreement. In September 2015, the Pentagon expanded the size of its contingent in response to growing threats from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Khalifa Hafter, second from left, with other members of the LNA., AP Russia may have hired private military contractors or labeled the troops in Egypt “ volunteers ” to deny having an official mission in the region, tactics the country’s government has previously employed in Syria and Ukraine. Regardless, Moscow’s involvement in Libya’s multi-faceted civil conflict has been growing steadily since at least 2015. The North African nation has stumbled from one political crisis to another since a loose coalition of rebels ousted and executed long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi with the help of a NATO-led, United Nations-authorized coalition in 2011. Afterwards, numerous factions vied for political control, often fighting each other and terrorizing local civilians. After wrapping up operations against Gaddafi in 2011, the Pentagon largely pulled back from the country, successfully securing and helping destroy Libya’s chemical weapon stockpile, but having much less success training local forces and hunting for specific terrorists . Notably, in June 2014, American special operations forces captured Abu Khattala, linked to the infamous attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, and whisked him off to the United States to stand trial. As of August 2014, two competing governments had set up shop, one in the capital Tripoli and the other further east in the city of Tobruk. The following year, the U.N. backed a new unity government. Known as the Government of National Accord (GNA), this internationally recognized authority only began formally taking over ministries and other offices in March 2016. An LNA technical. , AP The Kremlin was a major critic of the Western-sponsored revolution and its aftermath. Moscow’s forces in Egypt look to be part of a larger plan to back a third party, the Libyan National Army (LNA), and its leader Khalifa Haftar, which controls Benghazi. The renewed engagement in Libya fits with Russia’s general narrative that the United States and its allies have failed in their promises to help the country. And while the Kremlin’s official line is that this and other partnerships in the Middle East and North Africa are all about fighting terrorism, these developments seem aimed more at challenging American dominance. The Soviet Union was a major support of Gaddafi and Russia continued that relationship after the Cold War ended. Nearly six years after Gaddafi’s ouster, Libyans had become “allergic to the West,” Veniamin Popov, a former Russian ambassador to the country, told Sputnik earlier in March 2017. “Even the Islamists say that Russia should take part in the settlement of the conflict in their country.” Haftar himself has had a complicated political history. He served as a military officer in Gaddafi’s army before running afoul of the enigmatic leader and ending up in prison. In 1990, he moved to the United States after officials in Washington helped secure his release. Though Haftar styles himself head of Libya’s national armed forces, fighting terrorists on behalf of the country’s central government, he has disputed the GNA’s authority and seems intent on becoming president. His spokespersons have declared taking over Tripoli is key to the group’s supposed counter-terrorism mission, implying that government officials are in league with dangerous Islamist extremists. “Tripoli is [the LNA’] strategic objective in its operation to combat terrorism,” LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said in a December 2016 interview with Sputnik . “The main forces of [Islamist] militants are concentrated in the city, hidden under other names.” This created tensions between Haftar and his former U.S. benefactors, pushing him closer to Russia. The United States – along with its own allies, such as the United Arab Emirates – publicly supports the GNA and its fight against Islamic State’s franchise in Libya. After Islamic State began to exploit Libya’s chaos, the Pentagon did return to the country. Between August and December 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force pounded terrorist targets in and around the city of Sirte, approximately 350 miles by road from Benghazi. In January 2017, B-2 stealth bombers flew a marathon mission to attack camps the fleeing militants had set up further south. But Hafter and his staff downplayed the sincerity and impact of U.S. military activities in Sirte on behalf of the GNA. “Not the U.S. and not any other party can free Sirte from [Islamic State], only our forces can,” al-Mismari said at one press conference . On top of that, he labeled the whole affair pre-election propaganda for the government in Tripoli. In June and November 2016 , the Libyan warlord also made trips to Moscow to meet with Russian foreign and defense ministry officials rather than reach out to the Americans. Also in November 2016 , he spoke with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu via satellite from the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in the Mediterranean Sea. The exact details of these discussions are unclear, but they reportedly included arranging arms shipments and training courses for LNA forces. The group already has a significant number of armored vehicles and its own air force . Getting information from surveillance drones flying out of Egypt would give Haftar’s troops another edge over their opponents. More firepower and intelligence would be especially important in light of recent events. On March 3, 2017, the Islamist Benghazi Defense Brigades launched a spectacular series of attacks on oil facilities the LNA controls in the country’s so-called “Oil Crescent.” But as Russia is no doubt aware, its support for Haftar and his independent objectives, which threaten to spark a deeper civil war, runs counter to American priorities in the region. For years now, Washington’s goal has been a stable, unified, pro-U.S. Libya focused on defeating multi-national terrorists. The new reality of Moscow’s presence hasn’t been lost on officials in Washington. During a hearing before members of the Senate Armed services Committee on March 9, 2017 , U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command agreed that the Russians were attempting to gain sway over whomever ultimately gained the most power in Libya and that this was not in America’s best interests. In addition, he agreed with Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) assessment that Moscow’s push in North Africa mirrored its policy in Syria, where Russian troops have been critical to the survival Assad’s regime. Russian MoD And the Russians did not arbitrarily decide to stage the latest iteration of this policy in Egypt, either. Cairo’s relationship with Washington was strained after the Egyptian military took control in a coup in 2013. Shortly afterwards, general-turned-politician Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and his administration began a major crackdown on political opposition, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, sentencing dozens to death and prompting international outrage. As American diplomats worried over worsening human rights abuses, Russia was quick to present itself as a substitute for American military aid. In 2014, Moscow and Cairo reportedly signed weapons contracts worth approximately $3.5 billion. This included orders for MiG-35 fighter jets, Ka-52 gunship helicopters and at least one Project 12421 Molniya-class corvette armed with long-range anti-ship missiles. In August 2015 , Sisi and Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin talked about forming a coalition to fight Islamic State in Syria, with both countries implicitly offering support for the brutal dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. A little over a year later, Russian and Egyptian paratroopers held their first ever combined training session in the African country, as part of an exercise dubbed “Defenders of Friendship 2016.” The two countries are looking to increase economic cooperation , as well. Republicans soundly criticized President Barack Obama for failing to counter the Kremlin’s revanchist foreign policy around the world in general. However, during the 2016 presidential election and after his victory, in spite of criticism from members of his own party, President Donald Trump suggested he would be willing to work with Putin to fight terrorism. But despite those overtures, officials in Moscow clearly show no intention of slowing their push into the Middle East and North Africa. It remains to be seen how the United States will ultimately respond to Russia’s growing involvement in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",U.S. Air Force Buying Special Drone-Snagging Shotgun Shells,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force security forces, as well as other military personnel and federal law enforcement agencies, may soon be getting a new tool to take down small commercial drones: shotgun shells with a net. The special cartridge is just one system the Pentagon has been looking at to manage the growing threat from small and readily available quad-and hex-copter-type unmanned aircraft. On Jan. 31, 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) announced plans to buy and evaluate 600 12 gauge SkyNet Mi-5 shells from AMTEC Less Lethal Systems (ALS). If the Air Force was happy with the tests’ results, the service would have the option of buying another 6,400 rounds. According to a so-called ”justification and approval” document, the Pentagon’s Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) put the urgent request together in response to the potential danger the certain small flying machines posed “vital national security assets,” a phrase that commonly refers to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. Government censors removed mention of the specific command that asked for the gear and its area of responsibility. Any federal agency has to submit one of these formal justifications for any contract it wishes to award “sole source” to a specific company without a long and drawn out competition. AFLCMC subsequently took over the actual purchase process. The components of the SkyNet Mi-5 next to a complete round., ALS “The current technology set of net projectiles is a very immature market,” the contract review explained. “The Skynet Net Gun system has been demonstrated at several locations in varying conditions during testing as part of the 2016 Air Force Research Laboratory Commander’s Challenge.” Groups from around the Air Force and private contractors demonstrated various prototype and production systems during this event, which had the Latin motto in caleo exitium para – roughly translating to “prepare for hot destruction.” A team from Lackland Air Force Base went so far as to use a small wheeled drone to try and snag a quadcopter on the ground with a large net. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FAILUw3FbKk “The most recent testing of the Skynet round occurred at Department of Energy Range 25 in Las Vegas, [New Mexico] in December 2016,” the justification report added. Compared to other dedicated anti-drone weapons, the SkyNet Mi-5 is relatively simple. Each shell contains five metal segments, each connected by a high-strength cord to a central point. “The five tethered segments separate with centrifugal force and create a five foot wide ‘capture net’ to effectively trap the drone’s propellers causing it to fail,” ALS says on its website. The Air Force said it will fire the projectiles from its standard Remington Model 870 shotguns. For the cartridge to work properly, Airmen will need to install “choke tube” with rifling to the gun’s muzzle to get SkyNet spinning. The contract options also included a possibility of purchasing 100 of these add-on devices. An airman holds a Remington Model 870 shotgun., USAF The Pentagon only wants the weapons to be able to handle remote-controlled aircraft in what it describes as Categories 1 and 2. The first group covers unmanned airplanes weighing less than 20 pounds and able to fly no more than 1,200 feet high. The second level includes drones between 20 and 55 pounds with the ability to reach altitudes of up to 3,500 feet. Drones in both categories generally wouldn’t be able to fly faster than 300 miles per hour. In addition to SkyNet, there has been steady work across the Pentagon on other equipment to battle the tiny unmanned aircraft, ranging from hand-held and vehicle-mounted jammers to fast-firing chain guns to lasers . Unfortunately, the Pentagon appears to be generally relying on ad hoc urgent contracts to purchase these systems in lieu of a more comprehensive, long-term approach. The Air Force posted the actual justification document on FedBizOps, the federal government’s main contracting website, just one day after Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told members of Congress that the Pentagon was still dragging its feet in setting up defenses against small unmanned aircraft broadly. “We’re going too slow,” Hyten declared on March 8, 2017. “We have to get the right policies and authorities out there so our defenders know exactly what to do, and then we have to give them material solutions to allow them to react when they see a threat and identify that there is a threat so they do they right things,” the officer in charge of America’s nuclear deterrent continued. “It’s not enough for me to tell our guys to take a shotgun and shoot down something.” A quadcopter fitting the Pentagon’s definition of a Category 1 or 2 drone., USAF There may also be concerns that projectiles might miss a drone and come down somewhere else, causing inadvertent damage or even casualties. This would be an especially serious concern for troops at sites situated near civilian communities. He went on to explain that his forces needed clear legal guidelines to go along with any new equipment, something civil aviation authorities have also struggled to develop in the face of rapidly improving technology. Quadcopters and other tiny pilotless aircraft pose real dangers to both first responders and military personnel at home and abroad right now . In June 2016 , firefighting helicopters battling a wild blaze in California had to briefly halt operations after a private drone entered the airspace. Four months earlier , U.S. Navy security personnel had spotted a small drone over the Kitsap-Bangor base, which is home to a number of nuclear-armed Ohio -class ballistic missile submarines. More recently, Islamic State modified commercial unmanned systems so they could drop small bombs on government troops and civilians in Iraq and Syria. In January 2017, the terrorists released a video of them using the improvised arrangement to attack an Iraqi M1 Abrams tank. Potentially even more worrisome, the brutal group has used the drones to spy on their opponents, help artillery units adjust their fire and even film slick propaganda videos of suicide attacks. The remains a quadcopter the US Army destroyed with laser during a separate test., US Army In July 2016, the U.S. Army included an entire section on the threat and how to respond to it on the battlefield in a new training manual called Techniques for Combined Arms for Air Defense . Category 1 and 2 drones were among “the greatest challenges for Army forces,” the handbook explained. If they prove successful, the net-filled shells will likely only be one component of a suite of future weapons for the rapidly expanding mission of counter-small unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS). Since 2016, multiple pictures have appeared on social media of American troops actually fielding rifle-like jamming sets in Iraq and Syria. For a wider layer and more automative form of defense, the Air Force itself has reportedly bought limited numbers of an Israeli “ Drone Guard ” system and Liteye’s Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS). On a higher-end of the spectrum, directed energy weapons and other counter-rocket, artillery and missile (C-RAM) like systems theoretically could make up the upper layer of area drone defense, but the Pentagon still has not fielded such a capability in a substantial and focused manner. The SkyNet, and other systems in development, would definitely give Hyten’s security teams and other troops a safer option to take out tiny drones. However, it looks like the Pentagon’s overall strategy still have to catch up with the times.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 10, 2019",America’s Counter-Terrorism Fight in Yemen Is Entering a New Phase,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s counter-terrorism fight in Yemen is entering a new phase. But how much the Trump administration will ultimately change the course of U.S. military operations in the country remain uncertain. The United States has been actively, but quietly fighting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) since at least 2009. On Jan. 29, 2017, a deadly and controversial special operations raid in the Al Bayda Governorate suggested President Donald Trump and his administration were moving away from previous campaigns focused almost entirely on manned and unmanned air strikes. The two known official operational nicknames associated with operations in Yemen – Operations Copper Dune and Yukon Viking – are old and “won’t be used again,” the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) public affairs office told The War Zone in an Email. While the Pentagon’s top headquarters for operations in the Middle East declined to provide any new monikers for activities in the country, this further suggested the Trump administration had updated the operational plans. The exact timeline of events is unclear. The most recent official mention of either operation is a brief note about Yukon Viking operations in one 2015 report . At the time of writing, CENTCOM had not yet responded to follow-up questions about when these previous missions formally ended. USAF Those dates would be key to understanding how and why the Pentagon changed track in Yemen. During the 2016 election campaign and after his victory, Trump consistently declared his intention to step up America’s fight against terrorists. After details emerged suggesting the January 2017 raid had been a debacle with uncertain results , the president said military officers at an unspecified level had crafted the plan before he entered office. “This was a mission that was started before I got here,” Trump told Fox News in February 2017 . “This was something they wanted to do. They came to me, they explained what they wanted to do ― the generals.” Pres. Barack Obama reportedly refused the approve the operation, though unnamed sources told the Washington Examiner they disagreed with that assertion. On Twitter , Obama’s National Security Advisor Susan Rice said the Pentagon had never shown a plan for that specific mission to the White House during her tenure. Whatever the case, Trump made the final decision to authorize that raid, marking the apparent escalation in America’s long-standing mission in and around Yemen, which has been on-going for nearly a decade. After 9/11, one of the first things officials in Washington did was establish a military presence in Djibouti to respond to terrorist threats in both the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa. When Al Qeada’s franchise in Yemen and Saudi Arabia morphed into the single AQAP entity in 2009, the Pentagon quickly began a secretive campaign of air strikes and missile attacks aimed at the group. Multiple controversies steadily came to define U.S. operations in the country. On Dec. 17, 2009, as part of Copper Dune, the U.S. Navy launched a flurry of BGM-109D Tomahawk cruise missiles at what the Pentagon believed was a terrorist camp in Yemen’s Abyan province. Each carrying more than 150 submunitions, the weapons slammed into the village of Al Majala, killing more than 40 innocent civilians. How many, if any, terrorists died in the attack remains unclear . American and Yemeni authorities sought to cover up the debacle according to diplomatic cables former U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning subsequently leaked to Wikileaks. US Army Almost two years later, a drone strike killed AQAP spokesman and recruiter Anwar Awlaki. The 2011 attack provoked a still on-going debate about whether the U.S. government acted legally in killing one of its own citizens aboard. Awlaki’s teenage son Abdulrahman Awlaki died a month later in another aerial strike. The January 2017 raid reportedly resulted in the death of his then eight-year-old daughter Nawar Awlaki. In 2013, yet another unmanned mission mistook a group of vehicles carrying a wedding party for a terrorist convoy. The incident claimed the lives of another 13 innocents. Still, there were many more strikes that appeared to successfully hit their mark. Between 2002 and 2016 , American military forces and intelligence agencies conducted more than 200 aerial attacks, killing hundreds of AQAP terrorists. And on the ground, the Pentagon was similarly working hard to deliver military aid to Yemen’s military, while U.S. special operations forces were training and fighting side-by-side with their Yemeni counterparts. Between 2006 and 2014, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency coordinated deliveries worth more than $500 million in total, including helicopters, drones, trucks, small arms, night vision goggles, medical supplies and even clothing. By April 2014, U.S. special operations forces were actually flying Yemeni choppers during operations, because the country’s own pilots had not yet gotten certified to fly at night, according to CNN . On Dec. 5, 2014, both countries partnered on a mission to try and rescue American journalist Luke Somers and South African humanitarian Pierre Korkie from AQAP. Unfortunately, that operation failed and terrorists murdered both men during a protracted firefight. “This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen,” Obama explained to reporters in September 2014. “It is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America’s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.” USAF But then, at least in Yemen, everything seemed to fall apart. Also in September 2014, Houthi rebels linked to Iran and Yemeni troops loyal to the country’s former President Ali Abdullah Saleh seized control of the capital Sana’a. Internationally recognized President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi fled to neighboring Saudi Arabia. With no functional government left to work with, American diplomats and special operators evacuated from the country. U.S.-supplied military aid promptly went missing. Fearing an Iranian ally was about to take control of Yemen, authorities in Riyadh rushed to put Hadi back in power. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened directly starting in 2015, first launching its own massive aerial campaign and then eventually deploying ground troops. Disinclined to get directly involved in this new conflict, the Obama administration directed the Pentagon to provide aerial refueling, intelligence and logistics support. At the same time, AQAP wasted no time in using chaos to regroup and recruit new followers. American special operators did not return publicly to Yemen until April 2016, when they arrived and teamed up with forces from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Adding even more complexity to the entire mission, while the UAE’s troops were part of the Saudi-coalition, they had steadily turned their focus from the Houthis to the AQAP. Emirati troops were reportedly part of the January 2017 raid. Knowing all of these details, it is possible the collapse of the Hadi government and ensuing civil conflict could have forced the Pentagon to end Copper Dune and Yukon Viking outright for want of reliable partners on the ground by 2015. But from what information is available, Trump does seem more willing than Obama to approve action in Yemen. Since the president has repeatedly stated a desire to keep such operations secret, we may not yet know just how much the scope of American operations has expanded since the new administration arrived in Washington, either. After Secretary of Defense James Mattis sent a new plan to defeat Islamic State to the White House in February 2017, additional american special operators and regular troops appeared across the Middle East, particularly in Syria, indicating a major increase in the size of military operations across the region. The next month, the Pentagon announced it wanted to send additional forces to Afghanistan , as well. US Army Of course, after the dramatic raid in Al Bayda, the Pentagon kicked off an expanded air operation with more than 20 strikes on suspected Al Qaeda members on March 2, 2017. Though a significant increase in the size of the mission, this aerial assault would have been keeping with the previous strategy. The new administration may have relaxed the rules of engagement, giving the overall mission room to grow, but also increasing the potential for more collateral damage. As March 2017, the basic American military posture in the country seemed to involve active counter-terrorism operations against Al Qaeda-linked fighters, as well as continued tertiary support to Saudi-led forces battling anti-government forces. And starting in 2016, American forces had really struggled to avoid getting entangled in the complicated fight against the Houthis, with rebel forces firing missiles and using remote-controlled boats to attack both U.S. and Arab warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In October 2016, American destroyers responded to those provocations with a barrage of cruise missiles . “Our primary focus in Yemen remains protecting the U.S. homeland from threats … operating within Yemen’s ungoverned spaces,” CENTCOM commander Army Gen. Joseph Votel told members of Congress on March 9, 2017. “Ongoing U.S. unilateral counter-terrorism operations and determined efforts by UAE … have degraded and disrupted AQAP’s operational networks and reduced their access to sources of financial support.” Though he did defend the value of the January 2017 operation, Votel unsurprisingly did not offer any comments about a shift in policy or go into great detail about the operations at all. But America’s fight in Yemen is changing, even if the full extent of the new strategy remains to be seen. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 1, 2019",U.S. Marines Secretly Set Up Artillery Base North of Raqqa,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In March 2016, the Pentagon confirmed that U.S. Marines had quietly set up an artillery base south of Mosul, Iraq after one of the individuals at the site died in an Islamic State attack. Now, the leathernecks appear to have secretly moved into northern Syria on a similar mission. Marines and 155mm M777 howitzers from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Group have moved into the country to support Washington-backed rebels who are gearing up to eject the brutal terrorists from their de facto capital Raqqa, according to a report by The Washington Post ’s Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Dan Lamothe. The revelation comes just days after pictures appeared on social media of American special operations forces moving very publicly into the contested Syrian city of Manbij. “For the base in Syria to be useful, it must be within about 20 miles of the operations U.S.-backed forces are carrying out,” Gibbons-Neff and Lamothe explained. “That is the estimated maximum range on many rounds fired from the M777 howitzer.” They added that rocket-boosted, GPS-guided Excalibur shells have a range of nearly 30 miles. For operations within a densely populated area like Raqqa and its suburbs, these precision-guided projectiles would be critical as American troops would undoubtedly try to avoid causing collateral damage and killing innocent civilians. A US Army M777 at Kara Soar in 2016. , US Army The Marines’ latest deployment would also be the first time the Pentagon has sent regular troops into Syria proper, marking a significant escalation there in the American campaign against Islamic State. Previously, American forces in the country had generally been limited to special operators working with local fighters. An unnamed Pentagon official told Military.com that the Marines had been on the ground “weeks ago” and had multiple batteries of howitzers in place. U.S. Army High Mobility Rocket Artillery Systems (HIMARS) batteries had blasted targets inside the country, but from sites in neighboring Turkey and Jordan. These increasingly popular weapons consist of a six-round 227 mm rocket launcher on the back of an otherwise-standard 6×6 truck. The GPS-guided M31 rocket has a 200-pound warhead and can hit targets more than 40 miles away. The local artillery support will likely be essential if Syrian forces expect to retake Raqqa any time soon. If the Iraqi-and Kurdish-led offensive to liberate the city of Mosul, which began in October 2016, is any indication , the rebel troops could be looking at a months-long fight. Even with daily coalition air strikes and artillery fire, Islamic State continues to hold out in the eastern portion of the Iraqi city thanks to tunnels, human shields, and other reinforced positions. A US Army HIMARS launcher fires a rocket during a training exercise in Kuwait. , US Army The reported Syrian deployment follows a larger trend of American howitzers and rocket artillery backing up local ground offensives against Islamic State. As already noted, Marine artillerymen previously brought their M777s to Iraq in order to help secure the routes to and the area around Mosul in the lead up to the push into the city itself. Though the Marines ultimately left the site near Mosul, which they initially named Fire Base Bell, U.S. Army troops arrived with their own M777s to continue the mission. To play down the active combat mission, the Pentagon had quickly renamed the base the Kara Soar Counter Fire Complex. In September 2016, additional soldiers brought M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers into Iraq. Also able to fire the precision Excalibur shells, these mobile weapons were still pounding Islamic State more than six months later. And for nearly a year, Army HIMARS units had been lobbing hundreds rockets at terrorist positions. These weapons were particularly effective in built-up areas, since they would fall straight down on their targets cause damage within a relatively small blast radius. However, the biggest advantage of these ground-based systems is their ability to operate in bad weather or other conditions that would prevent fighter jets, attack aircraft, and gunship helicopters from flying strikes. Positioned within range of the front lines, howitzers and rockets can often respond faster to rapidly changing situations. By the end of 2016, American artillery fire was apparently so prevalent and routine in Iraq that U.S. Central Command didn’t even bother to announce the total number of fire missions. “Ground-based artillery fired in counter-fire or in fire support to maneuver roles are not classified as a strike,” the Pentagon’s top headquarters for operations in the Middle East says in daily press releases. Unfortunately, sending in the Marines puts more American troops in the middle of an increasingly complicated conflict with uncertain objectives. Since the country descended into a brutal civil war in 2011, rebels, terrorists, foreign forces, and troops loyal to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus have all battled each other. An M109A6 Paladin fires toward Mosul in 2016. , US Army Officially, since 2014, the Pentagon’s mission in both Iraq and Syria has been to defeat Islamic State—not to overthrow Assad. During his campaign and after his election victory in November 2016, Pres. Donald Trump vowed to expand the this American military mission specifically, and suggested he was willing to work with Syria’s government and Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin to achieve its goals. However, some of the groups who have aligned themselves with the United States are ultimately seeking regime change, or in the case of many ethnic Kurdish forces, potential independence. The confusing agendas and close proximity of armed groups have already led to serious and potentially deliberate incidents. In June 2016 , Russian aircraft struck American-backed Syrian troops at an outpost in At Tanf. Then, in September 2016 , the Pentagon acknowledged American warplanes mistakenly bombed Syrian government troops. Russia conducted another strike that killed Turkish soldiers in February 2017. But adding more American troops to the mix might be a part of a larger plan. When U.S. special operators arrived in Manbij last weekend in Stryker armored fighting vehicles, their very open presence appeared to be a complicated effort to keep various American partners from fighting each other, as well as shielding them from regime-aligned forces and Russian air strikes, while keeping the focus on Islamic State. The Marines could do the same for Syrian forces while supporting a concerted offensive into Raqqa. Whatever the reality is, putting Marines on the ground will definitely be a similar boon to American-supported groups as they battle their way into the terrorist hub. We’ll just have to wait and see whether they’ll be able to escape getting dragged into the larger conflict in the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 19, 2019",Check Out the Marine Corps’ Fearsome-Looking Upgraded Shotguns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Marines Corps is fielding improved shotguns in a variety of units. Combined with an accessory kit, Marines are able to pick a weapon that best suits the mission at hand. The so-called “Military Enhancement Kit” (MEK) for the 12-gauge Mossberg 500A2 includes a new barrel with a fearsome-looking muzzle device, fixed and collapsible buttstocks, and a replacement pump with attachment points for accessories on three sides. The Marines have had standard Mossberg 500-series shotguns in service since at least the 1980s. The upgraded components offer an advantage in “multiple tactic scenarios,” Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Michael Flor explained in a video presentation on the system. He noted that Marines fast-roping from a helicopter or an Osprey could get the longer, basic M500A2 tangled in the rope or caught on the aircraft itself, potentially causing a serious accident. Before the MEK, the Corps only issued the Mossberg in one standard configuration, with a basic 18.5-inch barrel and no easy way to strap on flashlights, lasers, vertical forward grips or other accessories. The new version has a similar overall length, but actually has a 16″ barrel with a special vented muzzle device specifically to help with blasting open locks and hinges on doors. In addition, Marines can choose to fit a compact, sliding buttstock similar to the one on the M4 carbine to trim additional inches off the gun, or dispense with a stock altogether and go with a pistol grip. Armorers can still install an improved, fixed stock when appropriate. The MEK appears to have made its debut in the U.S. military in April 2009, when U.S. Army’s 10th Special Forces Group bought the gear for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Four months later, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command announced plans to buy more kits from a company called Pro Patria, Inc. in North Carolina. At that time, it cost the Army nearly $625 to buy the MEK’s two separate packages. The 2009 deal was worth more than $680,000 in total. “This is a critical mission requirement as the current barrel assemblies on the issued Mossberg shotgun system are inadequate and presents a safety problem,” the Army explained in its justification to sole-source the contract directly to Pro Patria without a formal competition. When blasting down a door, the vented barrel would help chuck debris away from the shooter, help relieve pressure from the gasses trapped inside, and reduce recoil. USMC But while the MEK will certainly make the Mossbergs safer and handier, don’t expect to see Marines necessarily using them any more often than they are now. The weapons have proven themselves useful in very select situations, such as close-range security details or breaking down doors. The new upgrades are almost entirely focused on improving the gun’s handling in the latter situation. Of course, with American troops carrying shotguns into battle since World War I, the services have tried repeatedly to make the firearms more broadly useful in combat. Weapons designer and U.S. Army officer Carroll Childers famously spent decades trying to refine one such weapon while working at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Virginia. His initial concept, dubbed the Special Operations Weapon, would be a fully-automatic multipurpose tool for elite and regular troops fighting in built-up areas, against guerrillas on the jungle or while guarding outposts during a conventional war. Three name changes later, Pentagon had expanded the requirements to include a suite of new ammunition that would include regular pellets, explosive grenades, illuminating flares and more. An unmodified Mossberg 500. , USMC All of this eventually morphed into the futuristic-looking Close Assault Weapon Systems (CAWS) project. By then, Childers no longer had any involvement in the program and was disgusted by how U.S. military officials had twisted and upended his original ideas. “My concept was never about to develop a gun for the sake of ‘re-inventing the shotgun,'” he wrote to Benjamin Schemmer in 1982. Schemmer, then-editor of Armed Forces Journal , had just written a piece about the latest incarnation of the program. “Although, this will be the end result if the politicians, strap hangers, meddlers, and hand-wringers continue to get involved,” Childers continued in his tersely worded letter, which Small Arms Review posted in its online archive . “Nobody said a ‘shotgun’ was magic.” A Marine breaches a “door” with a regular Mossberg 500 during a training exercise. , USMC In the end, the Pentagon balked at the complex CAWS and bought hundreds of a special version of the Benelli M4 called the M1014 as the new standard for all the services instead. This 12-gauge weapon was similar to stereotypical pump-action shotgun, but had the ability to fire in a pump-free semi-automatic mode. It also featured a collapsible stock. “I think the M1014 is the best shotgun the Marine Corps has right now,” Gunnery Sgt. Trocon Bestman, an anti-terrorism force protection Marine, told the service’s reporters in 2015. “We used others in Iraq and the M1014 was the most accurate I’ve used for breaching in comparison to those shotguns.” Beneli M1014 in a Marine’s hands., USMC However, the Mossbergs, along with similarly old off-the-shelf 12-gauge Remington 870 types, continued to serve Marines around the world. There is a similar commercial accessory kit available for the 870s, called the Modular Combat Shotgun. If these upgrades are any indication, regular pump-action shotguns still have a lot of service life left, albeit in limited roles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",THAAD Might Not Be Ready to Take on North Korea’s Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On March 6, 2017, the first elements of a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) battery arrived in South Korea. While the deployment followed a series of North Korean missile launches, that latest provocation may have been in response to the imminent American plans , rather than vice versa, as the Pentagon implied in its announcements. “Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday’s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea,” U.S. Navy Adm. Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), said in a statement . “We will resolutely honor our alliance commitments to South Korea and stand ready to defend ourselves, the American homeland, and our allies.” Sending THAAD to the Korean Peninsula has long been controversial. In addition to North Korea’s accusations of more Western aggression, Chinese officials repeatedly argued the missile battery could be aimed at their country’s nuclear deterrent. South Korea protesters worried the unit could make them priority targets or pollute the environment. South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group ultimately agreed to host the battery at a remote, defunct golf course to allay those concerns. But beyond all of these political issues, there is a much bigger one lurking: does THAAD even work? Most notably, the system still has yet to prove it can take down a surrogate for missiles like North Korea’s worrisome Musudan . Pyongyang’s troops first successfully tested that missile in June 2016. Since long-time leader Kim Jong Il died in 2011 and his son Kim Jong Un took over, the reclusive country has been steadily and publicly expanding and improving its ballistic missile arsenal in general. South Korean and U.S. Army officials stand in front of a THAAD launcher on Guam in 2016., US Army In theory, the THAAD works by detecting incoming ballistic missiles and then firing interceptors to destroy them high above, and well before they hit the ground. Tracking a fast-flying projectile with powerful radars, such as the trailer-mounted AN/TPY-2 or the floating Sea-Based X-Band (SBX) and then knocking it out of the sky is a complicated procedure even when everything is working properly. As of January 2017, a complete THAAD battery included the missiles in their wheeled launchers, an AN/TPY-2, fire control equipment and other supporting gear. Lockheed Martin In active development since the 1990s, the THAAD program has suffered repeated delays, quality control issues and other problems. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin kicked off the first flight tests kicked in April 1995. THAAD did not successfully hit a target of any kind until its 10th test in June 1999. A year later, the Pentagon gave Lockheed Martin a new contract to start the engineering and manufacturing development of the system. Engineers did not test fire the refined system until November 2005. Part of that delay had been beyond the Maryland-headquartered defense contractor’s control. The firm had subcontracted work on the rocket motors to Pratt and Whitney’s space propulsion division. Between August and September 2003 , explosions at Pratt and Whitney’s production complex in San Jose California killed one employee, caused significant damage and physically rattled the surrounding community. Lockheed Martin scrambled to find someone else to make THAAD motors and Pratt and Whitney ultimately closed the accident-prone plant. It wasn’t until 2012 that THAAD managed to shoot down a mock medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). The weapon has repeated that feat multiple times since. However, as of December 2016, the system had still not proven it could shoot down an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) surrogate, according to the Pentagon’s Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation’s (DOT&E) annual report . In commonly accepted terms, an MRBM has a range of between approximately 1,000 kilometers (just over 620 miles) and 3,000 kilometers (under 1,870 miles), while an IRBM can hit targets nearly twice as far away. Many experts believe North Korea’s Musudan, also referred to as the BM-25 or Hwasong-10, is in the IRBM category. US Army When Army missile defenders touched down with THAAD on Guam in 2013, they adopted the nickname “Musudan Manglers.” Unfortunately, there is no definitive proof at this point THAAD can actually defeat all the North Korean missiles the Pentagon cites as the reason for its deployment South Korea in the first place. Even more problematic, the Pentagon has not yet deemed the missiles suitable for general service. “The THAAD program continued work on achieving a Full Materiel Release of the first two THAAD batteries,” DOT&E’s routine review added. These units “achieved Conditional Materiel Release in February 2012.” The Pentagon agreed to that conditional release in order to get the missiles to Guam. In its 2013 review , DOT&E said the system had only a “fundamental capability” and that there were still more than 30 significant problems for Lockheed Martin to fix. Sending THAAD out into the Pacific in that state had been “better safe than sorry, better something than nothing,” John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, told Foreign Policy in April 2013. The concerns do not appear to have been entirely unwarranted. In 2015 , the Army quietly replaced all of the THAAD missiles on Guam with new ones to “maintain operational readiness.” The service touted the operation as a major feat of logistics, but offered no details as to why it needed the replacements. To be fair, none of this proves THAAD can’t do its job. The system has steadily improved its record over the decades, continuing to knock down targets in tests. In 2016, the missiles smashed a short range ballistic missile (SRBM) surrogate and an MRBM-type target near simultaneously during a flight test in the Pacific Ocean near Wake Island. MDA The program’s engineers plan to try and hit a mock IRBM for the first time during the 2017 fiscal year. In 2018, they want to try and test the system in conjunction with a Patriot missile battery. In December 2016, DOT&E said only four of its original 39 recommendations remained unresolved. Of course, if and when Lockheed works all the kinks out of THAAD, the system will still has significant limitations. For the interceptors to be truly effective, commanders have to position the launchers near potential targets, along likely flight paths, pointed opposite where the warheads might fall. Based on publicly available information , the weapon can only pinpoint and fire at targets in an 120-degree cone and over a finite range. Not just that, but THAAD has not been thoroughly tested or lacks engagement capability against targets that fly extreme apogee flight profiles, a tactic North Korea could use to hit targets in Seoul and military bases not too far south of the DMZ. Even if the battery is situated properly, that might not be enough. The single THAAD battery in South Korea has just two launchers, each with eight interceptors at the ready. In any realistic future attack scenario, North Korea would launch dozens of missiles or more at targets across the southern portion of the peninsula and potentially beyond , using both road-mobile weapons , and in the not so distant future, even ballistic missiles launched by submarines . Those submarines will also likely voyage outside of THAAD’s engagement envelope before launch. Both of these launch methods are very hard to track, often alerting U.S. early warning satellites only as the missiles take flight, leaving little time for missile defenders to reorient themselves towards the threat. American and allied forces would need dozens of launchers and a constantly active constellation of space, surface and ground-based sensors spread across East Asia to have a reasonable chance at not getting overwhelmed by the ensuing barrage. So far, the Army has never fired a THAAD in anger against a real threat. Hopefully, the troops in South Korea won’t need to respond to an attack before they know exactly what the missiles can do and have them in the right places.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 2, 2018",U.S. Army M1 Abrams Tanks in Europe Are Getting Explosive Reactive Armor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army soldiers in Europe are adding extra protection to their M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks in the form of explosive reactive armor. The explosive-filled packages could help the tanks stand up to increasingly advanced tanks and anti-tank munitions, like the ones Russia is developing or has already fielded to its own forces. In January 2017, troops from 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division began arriving at sites across northeastern Europe as part of Pentagon’s efforts to deter Russian aggression, known as Operation Atlantic Resolve. The next month, soldiers and contractors started fitting the Abrams Reactive Armor Tile (ARAT) suite to 1st Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment’s tanks in Germany. “The ARAT looks like a good package,” Army Capt. James England, head of 1-66th’s Company B, told the service’s reporters. “In our current operating environment, should we have to engage a near-peer threat, we have to retain that mobility.” The kit includes racks that attach to the Abrams’ hull and turret. Once in place, crews slot in a set of explosive-filled “tiles.” The hull arrangement is two layers, with curved tiles on top of boxy ones, while the turret only gets a single group of the angled versions. When an incoming shell or rocket hits the blocks, they detonate, helping prevent the projectile from penetrating into the vehicle and protecting the crew. As with most reactive armor systems, ARAT tiles work once and then tankers must install new ones. Reactive armor first became widely popular in the 1970s. Capt. James England stands in front of one of the full kitted-out tanks., US Army The “near-peer threat” England was talking about is clearly a Russian Army that appears to be rapidly modernizing. In addition to American TOW missiles, both Soviet-era and newer Russian-made anti-tank weapons—along with Iranian copies—have made a mark on recent fighting in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. In 2015 , Houthi rebels in Yemen blew up a Saudi M1 with what looked like an Iranian copy of the 9M113 Konkurs. The next year , Islamic State terrorists hit an Iraqi Abrams with a newer 9M133 Kornet, causing a spectacular explosion as the tank’s ammunition cooked off. On top of all that, in 2015, the Russians debuted the first all new tank anyone had seen in years, the T-14. The clean-sheet design boasted an unmanned turret, active protection systems and potentially advanced, high-velocity ammunition. In addition, Moscow’s troops hope to get a whole suite of other tracked and wheeled armored personnel carriers and support vehicles, including the heavy T-15, which shares the same “Armata” chassis as the T-14. Since the Kremlin decided to intervene in the civil conflict in Ukraine’s eastern regions in 2014, many of Russia’s best military capabilities have been on display. While the T-14 hasn’t made an appearance, Moscow’s participation in the conflict has been defined in part by the deployment of significant numbers of T-72B3 tanks . Despite the name, this is a significant improvement over earlier models that make the tanks comparable in many respects to the later T-90. The upgrade package involves a “frame off” rebuild resulting in “essentially a new tank,” the U.S. Army’s Foreign Military Studies Office explained in the February 2016 edition of its magazine OE Watch . The overhauled tank has additional sensors, communications equipment and an internal firefighting system to protect the crew. The biggest update is a powerful new engine, packing 300 more horsepower, giving the tanks a top speed of over 40 miles per hour on paved roads and an unrefueled combat range of approximately 300 miles. Russia’s T-14 tanks, Vitaly V. Kuzmin Needless to say, if a conventional fight broke out, American troops in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States would face very real threats. In response to these concerns, the Army began rushing development of new weapons geared toward a high-intensity conflict, such as a version of the Stryker armored personnel carrier toting a powerful 30 mm automatic cannon. ARAT is similarly supposed to show the Army is serious about the situation and the mission. However, reactive armor is and has always been a far from a perfect solution. “Depending on what terrain you’re in, whether you’re in rural or urban terrain, the purpose of angled tiles is so that a blast will go down or upwards, which will allow the impact to deflect outward rather than at the tank crew,” 1st Sgt. Ryan Dilling, Company B’s top non-commissioned officer explained. https://youtube.com/watch?v=i3Q1Mj7HHL4 “If you have dismounts on the ground and they’re working in close proximity of the tank, you’d want to angle the tiles down so if there was a blast, it would go out and down to minimize the effect against Soldiers nearby,” Dilling added. “If you were in an urban environment and you had adversaries shooting from second or third stories or even on rooftops and the tiles were activated, the blast would push out and upwards toward the threat.” Reactive armor was a key piece of the Army’s Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK), which General Dynamics Land Systems crafted in the late 2000s. The only problem here is that in urban warfare, tanks have to work with infantry, who might not be thrilled about being so close to the explosive bricks no matter how they’re oriented. Time and time again, history has shown the cramped confines of cities give defending troops an advantage over relatively slow and large armored vehicles as they navigate the streets. Abrams without the ARAT kit in Poland in 2017., US Army Fighting in built up areas would be a given in any prospective European conflict, given the densely populated nature of much of the continent. The capitals of NATO members Estonia and Latvia are both less than 200 miles from Russian border—or one tank of gas for a company of T-72B3. This is why the Army has been working to add a so-called active protection system to the Abrams, as well as the Bradley fighting vehicles, Strykers and the future Armored Multipurpose Vehicle (AMPV). Though manufacturers and military forces are understandably tight-lipped about the specifics, these systems—including Israel’s Trophy and Russia’s Arena —generally link a physical interceptor of some sort to radars, infrared optics or other sensors. When the system detects an incoming projectile, it fires its own to shoot the threat out of the sky or blow it up. See one in action on the battlefield here. Of course, these systems have many of the same disadvantages of reactive armor. The systems have a limited number of shots and armor crews generally cannot reload them from the safety of their vehicles. In addition, the intercepting projectiles might be just as much of a threat to nearby troops under the right circumstances, depending on the equipment’s design. As such, the Army’s end game has moved close and close to a directed energy weapon for active protection. A laser would pose a significantly lower threat to supporting soldiers and reloading would only be a matter of a recharging the batteries. Unfortunately, those systems aren’t likely to be ready until 2030 at the very earliest. Of course, there’s no guarantee Russia’s flagging economy will support Kremlin plans to buy the hundreds of T-14s or other weapons. And regardless, Moscow has generally preferred to use economic and political pressure, political and para-military proxies and other “hybrid” activities to exert influence on its neighbors rather than open, conventional warfare. In the meantime, American tankers in Europe will stare down Russia with vehicles covered in high-explosive tiles.

Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 17, 2019",Docs Show Navy Got ‘UFO’ Patent Granted By Warning Of Similar Chinese Tech Advances,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Secretary of Navy is listed as the assignee on several radical aviation technologies patented by an aerospace engineer working at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) headquarters in Patuxent River, Maryland. One of these patents describes a “hybrid aerospace-underwater craft” claimed to be capable of truly extraordinary feats of speed and maneuverability in air, water, and outer space alike thanks to a revolutionary electromagnetic propulsion system. Sound far fetched? You’re not alone. A primary patent examiner at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) thought so too. But then the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of the Naval Aviation Enterprise personally wrote a letter addressed to the examiner claiming that the U.S. needs the patent as the Chinese are already “investing significantly” in these aerospace technologies that sound eerily similar to the UFOs reported by Navy pilots in now well-known encounters. This raises the question, are the Chinese developing or even already flying craft leveraging similar advanced technology and is the Navy now scrambling to catch up? The Wondrous Inventions Of Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais The bizarre saga of the U.S. Navy and its sudden willingness to admit that its personnel regularly encounter unidentified objects in the skies keeps getting stranger. Why the sudden shift in policy? What is the motivation for disclosing these encounters to the public? News outlets of all types have for months been discussing the matter, yet we still don’t know exactly what is actually happening here. Clearly, the narrative is being carefully controlled by the Department of Defense and the Navy. We can only base our speculation on what has been released to the public over the last few years through the media and what is public record. With that said, maybe the most curious additions to the still-developing saga is a set strange aerospace patents filed by one Salvatore Cezar Pais, an aerospace engineer at NAWCAD. While attempting to dig up as much information as possible about the inventor and these patents, I came across some supplemental documents in the USPTO’s databases that seem to imply that Navy leadership knows that these technologies are actually feasible – or that they want us or someone else to think that they are. Little information can be found about Salvatore Cezar Pais; he has virtually no web presence. What is known is that he received a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 1999 and that he currently works as an aerospace engineer for NAWCAD at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland – the Navy’s top aircraft test base . Pais has published several articles and presented papers at American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conferences over the years describing his work in electromagnetic propulsion, revolutionary room temperature superconductors, and topics like his PhD dissertation: “Bubble generation under reduced gravity conditions for both co-flow and cross-flow configurations.” NASA helped fund his dissertation, a copy of which they have on their website here . A full list of his publications can be found here . The Navy’s Patented Hybrid Underwater Aerospace Craft Pais is named as the inventor on four separate patents for which the U.S. Navy is the assignee: a curiously-shaped “ High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator ;” a room temperature superconductor ; an electromagnetic ‘force field’ generator that could deflect asteroids; and, perhaps the strangest of all, one titled “ Craft Using An Inertial Mass Reduction Device .” While all are pretty outlandish-sounding, the latter is the one that the Chief Technical Officer of the Naval Aviation Enterprise personally vouched for in a letter to the USPTO, claiming the Chinese are already developing similar capabilities. The patent was first applied for on April 28, 2016, over a decade after the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group encountered strange Tic Tac-shaped aircraft and nearly a year after Navy pilots across multiple squadrons flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana and NAS Norfolk experienced a string of bizarre encounters with unidentified aircraft, some of which, like the Tic Tac, seemed to possess exotic performance capabilities. The hybrid aerospace-underwater craft in Pais’ patent, meanwhile, is described as being capable of incredible feats of speed and maneuverability and can fly equally well in air, water, or space without leaving a heat signature. This is possible, Pais claims in the patent, because the craft is able to “engineer the fabric of our reality at the most fundamental level” by exploiting the laws of physics. The concept is fairly simple, although the engineering required to make it a reality is anything but. All matter contains energy on the quantum level. By theoretically creating its own incredibly dense and polarized energy field, the hybrid craft is claimed to be able to create a quantum ‘vacuum’ around itself which allows it to repel any air or water molecules with which it interacts. Thus, the craft can essentially ignore aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces, or so it is claimed in the patent. Hybrid Aerospace Underwater Craft , A depiction of the hybrid aerospace underwater craft included with the patent application., USPTO Throughout his patents and publications describing the hybrid aerospace underwater craft (HAUC), Pais writes that the radical feats of speed and maneuverability of which the craft is supposedly capable can be achieved by coupling “high-frequency axial spin” or “accelerated vibration” with “high-frequency vibrations of electrically charged systems.” In other words, if you can a) create a room temperature superconductor capable of storing an incredibly high amount of energy and b) get the energy field created by that superconductor moving at incredibly high speeds around or within the craft, you can create a polarized energy vacuum around it which allows it to basically ignore the energy of the air or water around it, thereby removing its own inertia and mass from the equation. In his most recent publication, Pais describes the hybrid aerospace underwater craft as a roughly cone-shaped vehicle that would appear round from the front or rear: “the HAUC is conical in configuration, with an elliptical cross-section, similar in geometry to a hypersonic glide vehicle / dart .” Interestingly enough, the descriptions of the craft in several of Pais’ publications and even the patent for “ Craft using an inertial mass reduction device ” include room for a crew compartment shielded by a Faraday cage . Shortly after the patent for the hybrid craft was approved in 2018, Pais presented another related paper, “ Room Temperature Superconducting System for Use on a Hybrid Aerospace Undersea Craft ” at the 2019 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SciTech Forum in San Diego this past January. In the paper, Pais writes that “the achievement of room temperature superconductivity (RTSC) represents a highly disruptive technology, capable of a total paradigm change in Science and Technology,” and adds that its “military and commercial value is considerable.” The capabilities described in the paper should certainly sound familiar to anyone who’s been following the Navy UFO stories over the last several years: It is possible to envision hybrid aerospace-undersea craft (HAUC), which can function as a submersible craft capable of extreme underwater speeds (lack of water-skin friction) and enhanced aerial/underwater stealth capabilities (non-linear scattering of RF and sonar signals). This hybrid craft would move with great ease through the air/space/water mediums, by being enclosed in a Vacuum/plasma bubble/sheath, due to the coupled effects of EM field-induced air/water particles repulsion and Vacuum energy polarization. HUAC with Components , Images of the craft in the patent application include a descriptions of the various components such a craft could possess such as: microwave emitters (300); a resonant cavity filled with a noble gas such as xenon (150); a crew compartment (55); a Faraday-type cage to protect crew against electromagnetic fields (58); a cargo bay (57); a power plant system (56); and a frustrum, or nose cone, which is “rotatable about its own axis (25).”, USPTO To help me understand the underlying theory behind the hybrid craft technology described in the patents, I spoke with Dr. Brian Collett, a Hamilton College physics chair who teaches courses in electromagnetic theory and quantum physics. Collett told me that while patents and peer-reviewed articles about theoretical physics are one thing, the descriptions of the HAUC and the claims in Pais’ research “bear no more resemblance to quantum physics as I understand it than does ‘The Force’ from Star Wars.” Moreover, Collett adds, “a working room temperature superconductor would have far more radical uses that are actually within the bounds of possibility” than a hybrid craft that can theoretically create a quantum vacuum around itself. Other physicists I’ve conferred with have stated the same thing – although most of them refused to go anywhere near on the record concerning the hybrid craft patent based on how outlandish it seems. Why then would the Naval Aviation Enterprise CTO personally vouch for this patent to the USPTO? The ‘Future State of the Possible’ Just because something is patented doesn’t mean it’s currently in production or even possible. Private entities and the U.S. government both regularly patent forward-looking technologies to ensure that they own the rights to them when or if they’re ever fully realized. The patent for the hybrid craft is set to expire on September 28, 2036. That being said, the unorthodox circumstances surrounding the approval of this patent have us wondering why the Chief Technology Officer of the U.S. Naval Aviation Enterprise, Dr. James Sheehy, personally vouched for the legitimacy of this beyond-revolutionary aerospace technology in the Navy’s appeal to the USPTO. Sheehy assured the patent examiner in charge of this application that the aircraft propulsion method described in the patent is indeed possible or will be soon based on experiments and tests NAWCAD has already conducted. While plenty of commenters online have seen the patents and claimed that any old crackpot scientist can attempt to patent crazy-sounding technologies far beyond what is currently technologically feasible, I would hesitate to call the CTO of the Naval Aviation Enterprise working on behalf of the Federal Government a crackpot. Then again, it’s not impossible. The application was initially rejected by Patent Examiner Philip Bonzell on the grounds that “there is no such thing as a ‘repulsive EM energy field,'” and that “when referring to the specifications as to ascertain about the microwave emitters needed in this system it is seen that for a high energy electromagnetic field to polarize a quantum vacuum as claimed it would take 10^9 [T]eslas and 10^18 V/m.” That’s roughly the equivalent to the magnetic strength generated by most magnetars and more electricity than what is produced by nuclear reactors. Obviously, the examiner believed it’s impossible with today’s technology to create the insane amount of energy needed to generate the EM field that would propel this craft in the manner described in the patent application. What would be needed to generate such amounts of energy is perhaps the potentially revolutionary room temperature superconductor described in one of Pais’ other patents for which the Navy is listed as the assignee. Superconductors are materials that can conduct electricity with zero resistance, meaning the electrical currents carried through them never degrade or dissipate like they do in metals, such as copper or silver. A drawing from Pais’ patent “Piezoelectricity-induced Room Temperature Superconductor.”, USPTO Superconductors also create their own repulsive magnetic fields when placed near magnets, enabling applications like the levitating Maglev trains currently floating at high-speed in Japan and China. Most superconductors today require extremely low temperatures to operate, however, making them impractical for most uses outside of laboratories or large scale industrial applications. Room temperature superconductors for years have been something of a “Holy Grail” of science for engineers, because, once realized, they would open the doors for incredible new forms of power transmission and storage, electric motors, and magnetic levitation devices. According to documents available to the public at the USPTO website, the Patent Office rejected Pais’ and the Navy’s application for this craft on March 30, 2018. After it was rejected, the NAWCAD’s patent attorney, Mark O. Glut, appealed the decision and submitted further documentation to ensure the patent office that this craft is indeed “enabled,” meaning it can actually be built and can perform as described in the patent. USPTO Rejection Based on Energy Requirements , One of the USPTO patent examiner’s grounds for rejection is based on the fact that the energy levels required by the craft are insanely high. , USPTO One of the most compelling items in the collection of appeal documents is the letter accompanying the final appeal written CTO Sheehy concerning the U.S. Patent Office’s rejection of “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device.” In the letter dated 15 December 2017, Dr. Sheehy claims that Salvatore Pais has “already begun a series of experiments to design and demonstrate advanced High energy Density/High Power propulsion systems” that are described in the patent. USPTO Final Rejection , A notice of final rejection sent by the USPTO prior to receiving Dr. James Sheey’s letter. , USPTO Furthermore, Sheehy claims that “the realization of this result demonstrates that this patent documents the future state of the possible and moves propulsion technology beyond gas dynamic systems to field-induced propulsion based hybrid aerospace-undersea craft.” Have a look at the letter yourself: Sheehy Letter to USPTO , Naval Aviation Enterprise Chief Technical Officer Dr. James Sheehy’s letter to the USPTO examiner in charge of the ‘hybrid craft’ patent. , USPTO It’s important to note that Sheehy doesn’t go so far as to say on the record that the Navy currently possesses this technology and instead notified Patent Examiner Philip Bonzell that he agrees that “this mode of acceleration/movement is beyond the state of the possible, at least at present.” Sheehy, of course, adds that “China is already investing significantly in this area” and “would prefer we [the U.S.] hold the patent as opposed to paying forever more to use this revolutionary technology” as he asserts “this will become a reality.” Remarkably, it seems to boil down to the ol’ “ we must not allow an Inertial Mass Reduction Device gap! ” Perhaps because of that threat from the Chinese looming, the USPTO finally issued a notice of allowance for “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device” to the Department of the Navy on October 31, 2018, at a fee of $1,000 USD. No reason was given for why the patent was eventually approved. It’s important to note, as well, that U.S. patent law ends at America’s borders. The Navy can patent anything it wants to, but those patents would not necessarily keep a foreign country from developing and patenting similar technologies. The Dawn Of Electromagnetic Propulsion? Normally, I would agree with others that these patents are likely just the Navy ensuring that when or if this technology does become available, the U.S. will be able to control it. However, these are not normal times. Thanks to To the Stars Academy (TTSA) , the Department of Defense, and the media at large, not only are we now being told that Navy pilots have witnessed aircraft behaving exactly like the craft these patents describe, but some of the pilots’ visual descriptions of those anomalous aircraft even seem to be uncannily similar to the drawings of the aircraft as depicted in Pais’ patents. One of those patents depicts a curiously and distinctly shaped gravitational wave generator that resembles the Tic Tac-shaped object reported by retired U.S. Navy Commander David Fravor and other Nimitz Carrier Strike Group pilots in encounters that took place in 2004 off the Baja Coast. Hybrid Craft and Tic Tac Gravitational Wave Generator , Images from two separate patents: “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device,” left; and “High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator;” right. , USPTO.gov Furthermore, in regards to claims that these patents may simply be speculative “math theory,” as the patent examiner called them in one of the rejections, it’s important to remember that scientific and engineering research sometimes reach tipping points in which incremental progress made over decades suddenly culminates in large paradigm shifts that bring the theoretical into the realm of the possible. Massive bursts of associated funding also can really help, of course. The patents appear to draw upon established theoretical research; included in the Navy’s patent appeals and Pais’ most recent publication are references to decades’ worth of peer-reviewed research in room temperature superconductors and macroscopic quantum effects and even notated copies of several studies related to Pais’ research. In the publication, Pais also thanks Naval Aviation Enterprise CTO Dr. James Sheehy “for the many hours of thought-provoking discussions on the concept at hand.” Pais Acknowledges Sheehy , Pais frequently acknowledges Sheehy throughout his publications. , USPTO Interestingly enough, both Pais’ research and some of his patents also contain acknowledgments to the work of Dr. Harold E. Puthoff, co-founder and Vice President of Science and Technology of To the Stars Academy . Puthoff is an electrical engineer and inventor who has published research on polarized vacuums, but has also been extensively involved with paranormal and somewhat pseudoscientific topics such as remote viewing . According to their website , TTSA’s goal is to advance “our current understanding of scientific phenomena and its technological implications.” The stated mission of TTSA’s Aerospace division is to find “revolutionary breakthroughs in propulsion, energy, and communication” and the company claims it is “currently working with lead engineers from major Department of Defense and aerospace companies with the capability to pursue an advanced engineering approach to fundamental aerospace topics,” such as Space-Time Metrics Engineering (STME) . This is a theoretical concept in which quantum vacuums are engineered as a means of propulsion. It remains unclear how TTSA intends to follow through with and secure funding for these ambitious goals. In a press release marking the official launch of TTSA on Oct. 11, 2017, former Program Director for Advanced Systems at Lockheed Martin Advanced Development Programs at the Skunk Works, Steve Justice, described how TTSA was working on developing revolutionary “Advanced Electromagnetic Vehicles” that will “dramatically reduce the current travel limits of distance and time” and “mimic the capabilities observed in unidentified aerial phenomenon by employing a drive system that alters the space-time metric.” Without a doubt, these advanced electromagnetic vehicles that TTSA says it plans to develop sound uncannily like the electromagnetic hybrid aerospace underwater craft in Pais’s patent. TTSA Craft Concept , Image of a revolutionary craft concept shown during a TTSA livestream presented by former Skunk Works Program Director for Advanced Systems Steve Justice. , To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences Few Answers, But Plenty Of Questions We reached out to NAWCAD for any information or clarification regarding these patents and were referred to Kurt Larson, NAWCAD’s Public Affairs Director. Larson informed us by phone and email that “when it comes to patent applications, [NAWCAD] cannot provide any context outside of the filed patent application documents.” Similarly, USPTO policy states that applications for patents are not generally open to the public, and “no information concerning them is released except on written authority of the applicant, his or her assignee, or his or her attorney, or when necessary to the conduct of the business of the USPTO.” As striking as the similarity between the claimed capabilities of the hybrid craft and those of the objects described by Navy personnel, it’s still unknown whether these patents are related to the ongoing UFO revelations. As The War Zone has noted in previous articles , there could be multiple simultaneous explanations for these varied incidents and a number of motivations for disclosing them to the public. Perhaps the few pieces of footage that have trickled out over the last several years that some claim to show advanced craft could be the Navy’s way of subtly hinting that this concept actually works and is being tested in the field by either the U.S. or the Chinese. The fact that Sheehy would lean so heavily on the Chinese threat in the last bullet point of his appeal letter to the USPTO seems to suggest that the Navy may already be playing catch-up to a terrestrial foe. It is also important to note that if the Navy had wanted this patent to remain classified, it could have filed the patent under the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 ( 35 U.S.C. ch. 17 ), a law which allows patents to remain classified if they might pose a possible threat to the national security of the United States. Instead, all of Pais’ patents are currently fully available to the public. If such a propulsion technology was so revolutionary and if the Navy indeed wanted to keep this technology out of others’ hands, it’s curious that they would choose to make the patent public. Maybe the Navy is signaling to its adversaries that it, too, is aware of this revolutionary capability and to whom it belongs. Unchecked Request Not to Publish , Navy attorneys chose not to check “Request Not to Publish,” which would have filed the patent under the Invention Secrecy Act. , USPTO Also, consider the fact that Senators, including the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Community, have been briefed in recent weeks by Navy officials about the unexplained sightings Navy pilots have reported. Even President Donald Trump recently stated in an interview that the Navy UFO reports could be due the fact that pilots “see things a little bit different from the past,” a comment which could be taken to mean that pilots are witnessing new types of aerospace technology for the first time. Trump seemed to indicate that he does not believe the objects reported by Navy pilots are evidence of anything extraterrestrial and took his interviewer’s UFO question in stride without any apparent surprise, an indication of just how far into the mainstream the UFO discussion has become. Consider as well the comments made by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, reportedly a key figure in securing funding for programs like the now-infamous Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program and its associated studies. Earlier this year, Reid stated that the U.S., Russia, and China are currently in a “UFO race.” We know the Chinese have already publicly made major strides in electromagnetic naval capabilities including railguns and aircraft catapults , as well as other highly advanced defense technologies . Could Reid have meant that these three military powers are currently scrambling to be the first to master the technology behind a hybrid aerospace-undersea craft and deploy it on a substantial scale? If so, where does the Navy, and the Pentagon as a whole, currently stand in that clandestine race? Furthermore, Pais notes in the paper that such a technology “would permit swift movement of the HAUC beyond our Solar System.” Is this an undisclosed reason why we suddenly need a Space Force ? Is this what Air Force Lieutenant General Vera Linn Jamieson was referring to last year when she casually dropped during an unrelated interview that in “different galaxies in the future we’re going to actually have capability that we have right now in the air”? And this is hardly the only highly peculiar thing that Air Force leadership has spouted off about in regards to the future of America’s military footprint in space. It’s also possible that this patent is just another facet of an information operation that goes along with a larger UFO narrative to promote the Pentagon’s undisclosed interests. But the inclusion of China, a very terrestrial potential foe and America’s chief technological adversary, as a direct competitor when it comes to the technology seems odd and even counterproductive if that were the case. On the other hand, some may say that this could be proof of two superpowers struggling to mimic the capabilities of something they are observing, but do not fully understand on a technological level. Considering all the unknowns, all possibilities are worth examining. But taking the information surrounding this patent at face value , it seems to point further to the possibility that the technology could indeed be manmade.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2019",F-22 Raptors Deploy To Qatar For The First Time Ever Amid Iran Tensions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has deployed a contingent of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar for the first time ever. This comes just over a week after the Iranians shot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator drone, or BAMS-D, flying over the Gulf of Oman. That incident had sent already elevated tensions between the United States and Iran skyrocketing, almost leading to U.S. military strikes on Iranian targets. The U.S. government has since hit the regime in Tehran with new sanctions and is now reportedly looking to put together a new regional military coalition to put additional pressure on Iran. On June 28, 2019, U.S. Air Force’s Central Command officially announced the arrival of the F-22s at Al Udeid, which had occurred the day before, rather than their typical base of operations in the region, Al Dahfra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Aviationist had been the first to report that the Raptors were heading to the Middle East after plane spotters noticed them arrive and then depart Moron Air Base in Spain earlier in the week. Online flight tracking software had then picked up a number of KC-10 Extender tankers dragging the stealthy fighter jets across the Mediterranean Sea. “These aircraft are deployed to Qatar for the first time,” AFCENT’s public affairs office said in an extremely brief statement . They are at Al Udeid “in order to defend American forces and interests in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility,” it continued. An F-22 touches down at Al Udied on June 27, 2019., USAF A trio of F-22s taxi at Al Udied on June 27, 2019., USAF It is unclear how many F-22s are now in Qatar. The Aviationist reported that nine jets, identified as belonging to the Virginia Air National Guard’s 192nd Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base, had arrived at Moron between June 25 and 26, 2019, but that only six had departed. Another three remained at Moron, at least initially, after suffering technical issues. The photos that the Air Force released of the jets arriving in Qatar only show five together at once, though this does not necessarily mean the sixth aircraft wasn’t present, as well. The Aviationist said that its sources had indicated that a dozen F-22s were slated to head to the Middle East in total as part of the deployment. A picture showing five F-22s flying over Al Udied Air Base in Qatar on June 27, 2019., USAF The technical issues the 192nd’s F-22s experienced in transit are not necessarily surprising. Availability rates across the entire Raptor fleet are notoriously low and the Air Force recently publicly admitted that the jets would not reach a Pentagon-mandated target of an average mission capable rate of at least 80 percent by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year. In addition to this being the first F-22 deployment to Qatar, this also marks the return of Raptors to the Middle East for the first time since late 2018 . Before then, the stealth fighters had regularly deployed to Al Dahfra for years . Sending them back to the region given the current state of affairs makes good sense. Another F-22 lands at Al Udied., USAF A pair of F-22s taxi after arriving in Qatar., USAF It is worth pointing out that in 2012 , after an Iranian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft tried to bring down an MQ-1 Predator drone flying over the Persian Gulf, that the Air Force sent F-22s to escort the unmanned planes for a period afterward. Of course, the service already has a number of other options in the region, so this certainly does not automatically mean this deployment is tied directly to the RQ-4A shootdown . Sometime between late 2018 and early 2019, the Air Force had also sent non-stealthy F-15C Eagles to the UAE to take the place of the F-22s. In April 2019, the service deployed a number of stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters there, as well. Additional F-15Cs had also arrived at an “undisclosed location” in the Middle East in May 2019. Beyond all these fighter jets, F-15E Strike Eagles had arrived at Al Dahfra earlier in June, too, and four B-52s had deployed to Al Udeid the month before. The F-35s had already helped fill some of the gaps left by the departure of the F-22s, notably being able to perform in the same kind of higher-risk missions, including in areas within the range of Iranian air defenses. They had also brought powerful sensor fusion and data sharing capabilities, enabling them to act as a “‘quarterback’ for the coalition joint force” during larger air operations, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein had said at the time . The Raptors had offered similar capabilities in the past and will now offer U.S. commanders in the region additional capacity for these sorts of tasks. A pair of US Air Force F-35As from Al Dhafra Air Base, at center, fly with two British F-35Bs , at left, and two Israeli F-35Is , at right, during an exercise in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea on June 25, 2019., USAF So far, we have only seen the F-35s operating in non-stealth configurations , though. On top of that, the F-22 remains the most capable air-to-air platform in the world. It can also race into enemy territory, including to make precision strikes on targets using precision-guided Small Diameter Bombs and Joint Direct Attack Munitions , in full stealth mode. Regardless, all of these deployments are part of what has become a steady , if still relatively limited flow of additional U.S. military assets and personnel to the region in response to intelligence that has reportedly indicated an increased risk of threats to American forces and U.S. interests from Iran and its proxies in the region, which first emerged in May . The U.S. government and some of its allies have blamed Iran for a series of attacks on commercial petrochemical tankers in the Gulf of Oman, which the Iranian government denies, despite a growing amount of evidence pointing to their involvement. At the same time, some American allies and partners have implied that the case against the regime in Tehran is still far from concrete. “Honestly we can’t point the blame at any country because we don’t have evidence,” UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, said during a press conference in Moscow on June 26, 2019 , alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. “If there is a country that has the evidence, then I’m convinced that the international community will listen to it. But we need to make sure the evidence is precise and convincing.” Then came the RQ-4A shootdown, which Iran continues to claim was in response to the drone violating its airspace. The United States has denied this, saying that the unmanned aircraft, as well as a manned P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft operating in the same area at the time, was in international airspace. After reportedly aborting U.S. military strikes on Iran, President Donald Trump’s Administration has hit Iran with all-new economic sanctions and says it is continuing to work toward building an “ international consensus ” regarding Iran malign behavior across the Middle East and beyond. Iran, for its part, has said that the United States needs to ease sanctions before any potential negotiations on de-escalating the situation could begin. On June 27, 2019, The Wall Street Journal also reported, citing anonymous sources, that the U.S. government was looking to form a new regional coalition , with a third party at its head, that would step up monitoring of Iranian activities using warships and aerial surveillance. This ostensible goal would be to deter future Iranian attacks and to be ready and in position to gather information and evidence about any such incidents that might still occur. The U.S. Navy already leads one multi-national regional task force, Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150), which has the stated mission of ensuring freedom of maritime movement throughout the Middle East and protecting commercial shipping, though primarily from terrorist threats. There remains a possibility that further Iranian actions might provoke a more direct U.S. military response, as well. After the RQ-4A shootdown, there were reports that the United States had launched cyber attacks against Iran and was looking at other clandestine options . On June 28, 2019, the Senate also rejected an effort to curtail Trump’s ability to launch strikes without consulting Congress. “Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force,” Trump had Tweeted out on June 25, 2019 . “It doesn’t make any difference. Whatever they want to do, I’m ready,” the President said later that day , implying he was also open to a diplomatic path. The return of F-22s to the Middle East certainly offers U.S. military commanders in the region more options no matter how the situation continues to evolve in the near term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 22, 2019",Army Tried To Get Data On Soviet Lasers With Bond-Like Sensors Hidden In Consumer Cameras,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to intelligence gathering, one of the biggest hurdles can just be finding a way to get close enough to the target to get any meaningful data. During the Cold War, the U.S. Army devised a small sensor that sounds straight out of a James Bond movie, which an individual could hide inside a camera lens to try to discreetly record the signatures from lasers on Soviet armored vehicles, helicopters, and other weapon systems in East Germany. The Army’s then-brand-new Intelligence and Security Command initiated the project, nicknamed Trivial Tiger, in 1977. Declassified details of the program are included in an INSCOM history covering activities during the 1978 Fiscal Year, which a private individual received through the Freedom of Information Act request in May 2018. Government transparency website GovernmentAttic.org then posted a copy of this document online in July 2018. “A means of delivering these microminiaturized devices into the proper area was studied with the resultant sensor/camera piggy back configuration,” according to the historical review. “[The] object of the project was to acquire Electro-Optics signals believed associated with such tactical devices as field artillery range finders, helicopter-borne target designator, and other weapons associated systems that might use lasers to increase offensive operational effectiveness.” It’s not entirely clear how the system worked or what kind of data it necessarily recorded and how. The sensors themselves were modified variants of devices that INSCOM had first developed under a separate project called Gravel Stream. Almost all of that section in the history is redacted, with only a portion of the last sentence left uncensored. US Army troops patrol the Berlin Wall in West Berlin in 1986., Roland Holschneider/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images It says “[redacted] position horizontally polarized, thereby changing its mini-directional transmit capability, severely impacting on the possibility of success,” which could reflect trouble with placing the sensors and attempting to operate or receiving information from them remotely. This could explain the decision to convert two of the five Gravel Stream types into the hand-held Trivial Tiger versions. It could also imply that the sensor was recording information about possible laser signatures in a format that could be transmitted via radio frequency. We do know that the Trivial Tiger configuration was small enough to slot in between a regular Nikon camera and a 1000 millimeter telephoto lens. This had to be the case since the U.S. Military Liaison Mission to Commander in Chief, Group of Soviet Forces in Germany , routinely used these cameras already. Inserting the sensor inside made it less likely that the Soviets would notice anything out of the ordinary. A rare 1970s-era Nikon Nikkor-P 1200mm f11 lens, similar to the 1000mm lenses that the U.S. Military Liaison Mission would have had access to in 1978, attached to a modern DSRL camera., via Nikon Rumors The kind of laser systems the history describes were just beginning to come into their own in the 1970s and gathering any information on what frequencies they operated on or their other characteristics would have been immensely important to the U.S. military. With this information in hand, American engineers could devise defensive systems to detect and even counter them. These could warn friendly forces on the ground, at sea, and in the air of impending attacks, since laser range finders or designators would be indicators of enemy forces targeting them. This might also alert those same forces that they were under surveillance or that an enemy was just nearby based on those signal signatures. Today, laser warning receivers are a common feature in various self-defense systems for vehicles and aircraft. And planning to give them to the U.S. Military Liaison Mission made good sense given its unique situation. This unit was the product of a broader deal then-allied powers – the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France – agreed to at the Potsdam Conference in Germany very shortly after World War II. The ostensible goal was to set the ground rules for the occupation and rebuilding of the German nation and to increase transparency about military activities between the various parties to prevent any confusion or dangerous altercations. The trailer below for the documentary Keep The Cold War Cold includes video footage that members of the U.S. Military Liaison Mission captured during their operations in East Germany. Even as the Soviet Union drifted apart from its former allies and Germany came to exist as two separate countries, the Military Liaison Missions continued to operate in both the East and the West. Both sides understood the inherent intelligence-gathering value and worked to exploit it as much as possible. The U.S. mission liaising with Group of Soviet Forces in Germany was no different and operated out of a building in the city of Potsdam in East Germany proper with its personnel exploiting quasi-diplomatic status to move with relative freedom around East Germany taking pictures and recording video of military facilities and activities whenever possible. As such, the unit was, until 1990, a highly reliable source of information about new Soviet equipment and combat doctrine. The Trivial Tiger sensors would have been a perfect addition to the Military Liaison Mission’s intelligence gathering toolkit. Even if the Soviets had become aware of the equipment, it’s not clear how they would have been able to directly counter it short of seizing the cameras from American personnel, which would have caused a major incident and threatened the mutually-beneficial liaison arrangements across Germany. The situation could still be dangerous for all involved, though. In 1985, a Soviet guard shot and killed a member of the Military Liaison Mission who was taking pictures of a base in Ludwigslust, East Germany. The Soviets claims that U.S. Army Major Arthur Nicholson refused to heed warnings that he was in a restricted area. A low-quality scan of a picture a member of the U.S. Military Liaison Mission in East Germany took of a MiG-23 combat jet., DOD After subsequent negotiations, the Soviets issued a blanket order to their forces not to use force against Western military personnel unless under direct threat. They violated this policy again in 1987, wounding another member of the U.S. Military Liaison Mission. After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the issue became increasingly moot. We don’t know if the Military Liaison Mission ever received the sensors, though. They were only delivered for testing during the 1978 fiscal year and we do not have access yet to the historical review for the next fiscal cycle. We do know that the U.S. military shared information about Trivial Tiger with its counterparts in the British Commanders’-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany. Spreading the sensors around to other allied elements would have made good sense and increased the opportunities to potentially collect valuable information. To think that the Army had developed this sensor package, which was small enough to conceal inside a camera without being detected, more than four decades ago, one can only imagine the advanced equipment that the service’s spies have access to now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 26, 2019",Navy May Slow Aviation Ops Due To Budget Shortfall As It Ground Super Hornet Demo Team,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is reportedly looking at a major budget shortfall of at least $100 million for aviation operations and maintenance for the rest of the fiscal year. The service is now looking at cutting flight hours for fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft assigned to operational and non-operational units, curtailing deployments for certain helicopter squadrons, grounding an entire air wing, and more to close the funding gap. This might help explain the abrupt announcement yesterday that the Navy’s Super Hornet Demonstration Team was canceling the rest of its performances for 2019 and could have a serious impact on attempts to improve readiness across naval aviation communities. USNI News got the scoop on the Navy aviation community’s budget woes on June 27, 2019, citing anonymous sources. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Roy Kelly, Commander of Naval Air Force Atlantic, who is in charge of the bulk of East Coast-based naval aviation units, was reportedly among those to alert the service’s senior leadership that he might have to begin truncating various flight activities in order to save money. The 2019 Fiscal Year ends on Sept. 30, 2019. “Naval aviation is at its highest readiness in more than a decade, and we will ensure our deployed forces remain ready and continue to effectively meet their missions in accordance with the congressional guidelines and appropriations under the law,” U.S. Navy Commander Ron Flanders, a spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Force, the service’s top aviation command, told USNI News , declining to confirm or deny the funding gap. “We constantly look for ways to deliver on that, and we continue to consider specific steps to best manage our resources and our costs.” Rear Admiral Kelly is considering reducing flight hours for all units under his command for the rest of the fiscal year and could even ground an entire air wing, according to USNI News ‘ sources. Naval Air Force Atlantic oversees Carrier Air Wings One, Three, Seven, and Eight, as well as the Strike Fighter Wing, Helicopter Maritime Strike Wing, and Helicopter Sea Combat Wing assigned to the Navy’s Atlantic Fleet. Kelly could also scale back the deployment of detachments from Helicopter Maritime Strike and Helicopter Sea Combat Squadrons, which operate MH-60R and MH-60S Seahawks respectively, something that could have a cascading impact on the capabilities or outright deployability of ships that rely on these helicopters for support. A US Navy MH-60R Seahawk., USN The Rear Admiral has also discussed halting flyovers, such as those over sporting events, until further notice. USNI News says that the Navy has not made any final decisions as to what course or courses of action to pursue in order to deal with the funding shortfall. The service could also ask Congress to allow them to shift funds from other accounts to help keep units flying. However, on June 26, 2019, Strike Fighter Squadron 106 (VFA-106), the “Gladiators,” which manages the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Demonstration Team, said that the team’s remaining performances for the year were canceled, which came as a surprise to the Air Show community. VFA-106 is the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) assigned to Commander, Strike Fighter Wing, Atlantic Fleet. “As the East Coast Super Hornet Fleet Replacement Squadron, the mission of VFA-106 is to provide the fleet with superbly trained replacement aircrew to support fleet readiness,” a post on the official Facebook page for the Super Hornet Demonstration Team read. “This mission will always take priority over displaying the remarkable Super Hornet across the country.” The Tailhook Legacy Team, which includes a Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 122 (VFA-122), the “Flying Eagles,” will finish the rest of its schedule. VFA-122 is the FRS assigned to Commander, Strike Fighter Wing, Pacific Fleet. It is curious that Rear Admiral Kelly has been the only one named so far as raising concerns about shortfalls and that the East Coast Super Hornet Demonstration Team is cutting its schedule short while the West Coast Tailhook Legacy Team will continue without interruption. This raises the question about whether the budgetary difficulties are actually isolated to East Coast aviation units. USNI News did not identify the exact cause or causes of the shortfall, either. One possibility might be that the Navy expended more funds on naval aviation operations and maintenance than it expected to in order to try to improve readiness rates. Naval aviation readiness across the board has been in steady decline for more than a decade due to a combination of factors and has reached critically low levels in recent years, an issue The War Zone has explored in great depth here . In September 2018, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis specifically mandated that the Navy, as well as the Marines, increase the average mission capable rates of their F/A-18 Hornets, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to at least 80 percent by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year. The U.S. Air Force also got the order to ensure that its fleets of F-16 Vipers, F-22 Raptors , and F-35s met this same target. A chart showing declines in mission capable rates across the entire Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) from August 1998 to August 2017., USN In April 2019 , senior Navy officials told Congress that the Super Hornet mission capable rate had hit 75 percent, up from 50 percent the previous year. The Navy and Marine Corps have not offered similar specifics about readiness improvements among their fleets of older model Hornets or F-35s. The Air Force has itself already acknowledged that its F-22s, at least, will not meet the 80 percent goal. If the lack of funds is at all related to efforts to improve readiness, this also raises questions about the sustainability of any of those gains in the long term if the overall defense budget only increases at relatively modest levels in the coming years or if it gets cut . Since President Donald Trump took office in 2017, the defense budget has already grown significantly, especially with regards to funding for operations and maintenance. Navy personnel onboard the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower move an F/A-18F Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 105 (VFA-105) in the ship’s hangar deck in April 2019. VFA-105 is one the squadrons assigned to Strike Fighter Wing, Atlantic Fleet., USN This report of a naval aviation funding shortfall comes as a battle over the next defense budget appears to be brewing on Capitol Hill. On June 27, 2019 , the Senate passed their version of the annual defense policy bill, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets the defense budget topline and includes various spending requirements. The Senate’s NDAA outlines a $750 billion spending plan, while the House version, which passed last week, sets the total defense spending figure at $733 billion. The two bills feature distinctly different language on a variety of topics, as well, especially regarding nuclear modernization plans . If the House and Senate cannot reconcile these issues before the end of September, it could precipitate yet another partial government shutdown. In the meantime, it remains to be seen what the full extent of the naval aviation funding shortfall is and what options the Navy might choose to trim back spending before the end of the fiscal year and what impact those decisions might have on naval aviation operations and readiness. It’s amazing this is even an issue at a time of record high defense budgets that have been specifically plowing more funding into the readiness.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 11, 2019",Rolled Over Stryker Crushed Army Ranger In Fatal Training Accident Last Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The member of the U.S. Army’s elite 75th Ranger Regiment involved in a fatal vehicle accident last year died after he fell out of his Stryker wheeled armored vehicle when it rolled into a ditch more than 40 feet deep during a training exercise. The vehicle eventually came to rest on top of him. The Rangers have been employing the 8×8 Strykers for nearly 15 years now, but the special operations unit’s use of the vehicles became more widely known after a particularly visible deployment to Syria in 2017. U.S. Army Special Operations Command first announced the death of 1st Lieutenant Connor Bednarzyk, a 25-year old originally from Virginia, in an unspecified “single tactical vehicle accident” on Sept. 10, 2018 . The actual accident had occurred three days earlier on a training range at Fort Benning, Georgia, which is where the 75th is based. Bednarzyk’s had received his first assignment in 2016 as an infantry officer in the 4th Infantry Division, before joining the Rangers. Records show that he had deployed briefly to Afghanistan earlier in 2018. Bednarzyk’s formal position at the time of the accident was as the leader of 2nd Platoon, Company E, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. Company E is the Forward Support Company (FSC) for 3rd Battalion and 2nd Platoon handles distribution of supplies, such as fuel, water, and ammunition, and performs various transportation functions. The accident report, a redacted copy of which The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, notes that Ranger FSCs are unique in that the individuals assigned to many of the traditional support positions are in fact qualified as infantrymen, known the Army by the Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) code 11B, giving them a more multi-purpose character. In addition, battalions would often use personnel and vehicles, such as Strykers, assigned to the FSCs to provide Ground Assault Force (GAF) packages to move Rangers to and from their objectives. A picture the US Army released of 1st Lieutenant Connor Bednarzyk after his death in September 2018., US Army During the training exercise in September 2018, Company E provided two GAFs, each with four M1256 Strykers. A four-Stryker GAF could carry a single Ranger platoon. The M1256 variant is infantry carrier version of the newer Double-V Hull (DVH) Stryker, which, as the name implies, has an improved V-shaped underbelly to better deflect the blasts from improvised explosive devices and mines and protect the occupants inside. The Ranger first began using the original M1126 infantry carrier variant in 2005. At the time of the accident, Bednarzyk was acting as the vehicle commander of one of the M1256s. The vehicle was riding in also had the driver and a radio telephone operator (RTO) to handle communications. Stryker infantry carriers belonging to elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment in Syria in 2017., AP Sept. 7 marked the third day of GAF training exercises as part of a larger pre-deployment exercise. At approximately 9:00 PM local time, Bednarzyk’s Stryker and three other M1256s deposited Rangers from Company C, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment for nighttime exercise at the designated drop off point within Fort Benning’s Digital Multipurpose Range Complex (DMPRC) without issue. They then turned around and began to drive back to their staging area in the dark. Less than 10 minutes after dropping off the Rangers, Bednarzyk’s vehicle began to drift and subsequently veered off the right-hand shoulder of the road, rolling into a 41-foot ditch. The 1st Lieutenant, standing in the commander’s position, was thrown from the vehicle. The 20-ton armored vehicle rolled over, sustaining significant external damage, and came to rest on top of him. A map of the areas of the Digital Multipurpose Range Complex at Fort Benning where the exercise and subsequent incident occured., US Army via FOIA The driver and RTO remained secured in the vehicle and were able to dig themselves out with what appear to have been only minor injuries and began to call for medical help and search for Bednarzyk in the dark. They eventually found him, unresponsive and without a pulse, pinned under the vehicle. At almost 10:00 PM, emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene and spent approximately 20 minutes attending to the Lieutenant before pronouncing him dead at the scene. It remains unclear exactly what led to the accident itself. The Army’s five findings and accompanying recommendations are entirely redacted under an exemption to the FOIA that allows U.S. government agencies to legally withhold information because it discusses ongoing internal matters and because releasing the details might prejudice the final outcome. It also allows them to do so if the information might give an inaccurate impression about whether or not the U.S. government intends to pursue a particular course of action. But it’s also a mechanism that agencies so routinely abuse to conceal controversial or embarrassing information that experts have dubbed it the “withhold it because you want to” exemption. A photo of Bednarzyk’s Stryker after the accident., US Army via FOIA In 2016, the Army had begun testing an improved DVH Stryker design with improvements to increase engine power and other performance. The DVH Strykers are heavier than the original design. The upgrades improved mobility while driving up and down steep grades, according to a 2017 report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. Bednarzyk’s Stryker was one of the earlier models, but was also driving on a relatively level roadway at the time. As a wheeled vehicle, the Stryker does have higher ground pressure than its tracked counterparts and it is not uncommon to hear about the vehicles getting stuck in the sand, mud , and other soft terrain. “Our initial understanding is that the vehicle drifted right under Iimited visibility (dusty, dark, white Iights on) and a soft shouIder collapsed under the weight of the vehicle,” the Army’s report says, suggesting this may have been a factor in the accident. A view of the top of the Stryker post-mishap., US Army via FOIA Strykers also have a high center of gravity and the danger of rollovers, especially when traveling at higher speeds, is well known . In the mid-2000s, the Army instituted new driver training requirements and added improved safety features, including new seatbelts , to help mitigate these issues. It is also not clear how much experience Bednarzyk, or the vehicle’s driver, had with the Stryker, in general, or the DVH model specifically. Bednarzyk’s time in the 4th Infantry Division had been with a dismounted infantry unit. The Army’s accident report also notes that Company E only received the Strykers between January and February 2018, specifically for the exercise. The support company personnel received training on how to operate them between April and May 2018, as well as a course on how to employ the vehicle’s remote weapon station in July. Still, it is important to note that the GAF had conducted day and night maneuvers on Sept. 5 and 6 without any issues. But that the Army had five major findings and had recommendations about how to deal with each one of them does indicate that there was at least some combination of procedural or technical issues that became apparent after the accident. Regardless, the accident also shines a light on the regular integration of Strykers into Ranger operations, though one might not think of armored vehicles as being a feature in special operations forces missions. These can be especially valuable in areas where there is a greater threat from conventional forces armed with heavier weapons. As noted, in 2017, Ranger Strykers appeared in and around the contested city of Manbij in northern Syria, where they provided a buffer between Turkish troops and local Kurdish forces and also helped shield the latter from forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. These Strykers also simply represent the vast majority of the traditional armored vehicles organic within the U.S. special operations community. Army Special Forces units have a much smaller fleet of 6×6 Pandur armored vehicles , also known as Armored Ground Mobility Vehicles, though they are now working to acquire a replacement design . Hopefully, the Army has learned valuable lessons from the accident that claimed Bednarzyk’s life and has been able to implement any necessary changes to help prevent similar Stryker mishaps from occurring in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 29, 2019",Russia Reportedly Developing Its Own AC-130-Like Gunship From Converted An-12 Cargo Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is reportedly looking to develop an AC-130-like gunship armed with a pair of 57mm automatic cannons, as well as additional smaller guns. The first phase of the project would involve the conversion of an Antonov An-12 Cub cargo plane into a flying testbed to experiment with different weapons and tactics, techniques, and procedures. State-owned media outlet TASS reported the new development on June 26, 2019, citing an anonymous source within Russia’s state-run military-industrial complex. This individual disclosed the new information on the sidelines of the Army-2019 international military and technical forum, which had opened the day before. This annual event offers, among other things, an opportunity for Russian defense contractors and the Russian military to show off new and improved aircraft, vehicles, weapons, and other military hardware, as well as systems still in development. Work has begun to “develop a flying [artillery] battery – an aircraft directly supporting troops on the battlefield, similar to the American AC-130 gunships,” the source told TASS . “The An-12 military transport aircraft with two 57mm guns will be used as a flying laboratory.” This individual did not say what company or companies would be involved in the project, what type of 57mm guns they would install on the An-12 , or why they would use that particular plane as the testbed. The four-engine Soviet-era turboprop cargo plane has been out of production since 1973, but the aircraft remains in Russian military service and is roughly analogous to the C-130 Hercules , which serves as the basis for the AC-130. A Russian Air Force An-12BK cargo plane. , Igor Dvurekov via Wikimedia The most likely candidate for the 57mm gun is the increasingly popular BM-57, a modernized derivative of Soviet-era S-60 anti-aircraft gun . UralVagonZavod (UVZ), Russia’s main tank and armored vehicle manufacturer, as well as its numerous subsidiaries, have been experimenting with mounting this weapon on a variety of different vehicles, including the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle and T-15 heavy armored personnel carrier , in recent years. At the MILEX-2019 military trade show in Belarus in May 2019, Alexander Potapov, UVZ’s general director, said his company was working on how to possibly integrate 57mm cannons onto other platforms besides vehicles. This included exploring the potential to mount the guns on Russian Navy ships and Russian Air Force aircraft, he added, according to TASS . https://youtube.com/watch?v=-d_7XNA8IKc It’s not entirely clear why the Russians might be interested in creating their own version of the AC-130 now, either. The general concept of converting cargo planes into armed gunships has been around for more than 50 years now, but the U.S. Air Force has remained the largest and longest operator of such planes . Today, that service uses them almost exclusively to support special operations forces and at night, where they can also use their powerful sensor suites to also perform persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and armed overwatch missions. Russian special operations units, commonly known as Spetznaz , have been steadily taking some inspiration from their Western counterparts and have been increasingly employed overseas in various limited conflicts, especially in Syria , all of which might have prompted demands for a capability akin to an AC-130. The general principle behind the side-firing gunship is, by now, well-established and combat-proven. A plane with guns sticking out one side and flying in a tight circle over a particular target can provide precise fire even without the aid of modern sensors and combat-aided stabilization and targeting systems. To this day, variants of the AC-130 employ simple holographic sights meant for small arms and light weapons mounted facing out one of the side windows in the cockpit to help the pilot keep the aircraft stable in its orbit around the target area. In addition, though automatic cannons fire high-explosive shells, they also simply offer a smaller blast radius than traditional bombs and missiles, making them well suited to engaging targets that may be dangerously close to friendly forces. The U.S. Air Force had been working to develop gunships that would almost exclusively employ precision-guided munitions , rather than guns, but has steadily reversed course for this reason. For the Russian Air Force, which still relies heavily on unguided munitions , a side-firing gunship could be an especially valuable, not to mention cost-effective, addition for providing more precise fire, especially in lower-risk environments. For instance, Russia remains heavily engaged in Syria, fighting various militants and terrorists opposed to the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, often in urban environments, where more precise aerial fire support able to engage opponents relatively close to friendly troops could be invaluable. The gunships would also be able to rapidly engage multiple targets with overwhelming firepower and loiter over a particular part of the battlefield for an extended period of time. A mix of different caliber cannons, as is found on American AC-130s , could give Russian gunships additional flexibility. Russia could also look to arm these aircraft with other munitions, including unguided and guided bombs and missiles. It wouldn’t be the first time the Russians have explored the idea of using a cargo plane as a bomber. In 2015, the Russian Air Force experimented with four-engine Il-76MD jet transport modified to carry bombs . The Soviet Antonov design bureau originally designed the An-12 with provisions for bomb racks on the main landing gear sponsons so it could serve as a bomber, if necessary, before removing those features in subsequent variants. It also experimented with a cargo bay-mounted “conveyor” that would have dropped bombs right out the back. An Il-76MD cargo plane with pylons for ordnance under its wings during a test in 2015. One unguided bomb is visible attached to the aircraft in this picture., Ilyushin With a suitable sensor suite, the aircraft could perform the nighttime ISR and overwatch missions, just like U.S. Air Force gunships. Russia has already developed a host of electronic warfare and countermeasures systems that could help ensure the survivability of an armed cargo plane flying under the cover of darkness, as well. A version of the President S directional infrared countermeasures system, which uses turreted lasers to blind and confuse the seekers on short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, would be one particularly useful addition for operations in the Syrian theater, where this threat has been particularly pronounced . There’s also no particular reason why Russia would have to stick with the An-12 as the platform for an operational gunship. Blackwater founder and notorious private military contractor Erik Prince had proposed converting smaller twin-engine An-26 turboprops into side-firing gunships as part of a plan to form a private air force to support the government of Afghanistan. Many of Antonov’s smaller designs also had similar bombing capabilities to the An-12, too. The Indian and Iraqi Air Forces have been particularly significant users of the An-32 in the bomber role in the past. With this in mind, a Russian-made side-firing gunship design could find significant interest on the export market. Lockheed Martin is already pitching a kit to convert C-130s into armed special operations platforms and Airbus and Leonardo offer similar conversions for the twin-engine C-295 and C-27J turboprop cargo planes respectively An Iraqi Air Force An-32 in the bomber role with bomb racks mounted on the fuselage., Iraqi Air Force TASS’s source didn’t say when the An-12 testbed might be ready or give a timeframe for when operational gunships might begin to enter Russian service, but there are definitely reasons why the Russian Air Force would be interested in acquiring its own gunships. Also, when compared to the Kremlin’s near-constant claims of often dubious high-tech military hardware developments , this particular project is very plausible and makes good sense given Russia’s experiences in Syria. We’ll just have to wait now to see when and if a Russian take on the AC-130 concept actually emerges.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has launched a new effort, nicknamed Golden Horde, to network together various precision-guided munitions, including the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb and the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, as well as the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy , so that they can operate as autonomous swarms after launch. This could help them penetrate past or otherwise overwhelm enemy air defenses, as well as maximize the effects on particular targets or engage completely new ones that may suddenly appear over the course their flight. U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Anthony Genatempo, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons, offered the first details about Golden Horde at a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Life Cycle Industry Days at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio on June 20, 2019. The officer also announced that Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is leading this new swarming munition effort, had canceled an earlier program known as Gray Wolf. This project, which The War Zone previously explored in detail , had sought to develop an entirely new family of low-cost swarming cruise missiles. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman had been working on experimental Gray Wolf prototypes since December 2017, but the Air Force appears to have determined that the program is unlikely to produce practical results in the near term. The first phase of Gray Wolf program will end either this month or next month, after which the Air Force will not proceed with two previously planned phases, according to Air Force Magazine . The service had originally planned to continue the swarming cruise missile effort through at least 2024. A Lockheed Martin press release announcing the Air Force’s initial contract award in December 2017 had also said that there would be four developmental phases, indicating that the Air Force had already scaled back the project before canceling it outright. A briefing slide describing the now-canceled Gray Wolf program., USAF We don’t know the exact reasons why the Air Force canceled Gray Wolf, but Golden Horde’s plans to focus on ways to network together existing munitions seems like a lower risk proposition than developing an entirely new weapon system. It seems likely that Golden Horde would leverage at least some of the work done on Gray Wolf, too. Brigadier General Genatempo said that lessons learned from the U.S.-led cruise missile strikes on chemical weapons sites in Syria in April 2018 and other feedback from operational units also played a role in the decision. “The success of that mission [in Syria] was from a huge amount of mission planning, because each of those weapons was dropped at a certain time and had a preplanned flight,” Genatempo explained . “There was no thinking or talking amongst themselves as to, ‘You know what? The first two of us that got here 4 minutes earlier, we actually took out this target, so the two of you that were coming in behind us just to make sure, you can go to Target B.’ And within that 4-minute flight time, there would be time to adjust to go target B.” Weapons such as the AGM-158 and the forthcoming GBU-53/B StormBreaker , previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb II, featuring multi-mode targeting systems that include imaging infrared seekers. These already helps increase precision and enable greater autonomy since the weapons can identify and home in on their targets independently after reaching the designated area by using their own internal imagery database. AGM-158 JASSM missiles loaded on a B-1 Bone bomber ahead of the strikes in Syria in April 2018 ., Anonymous With increased networking capability, these weapons could send back images of the target right before impact that show the extent of the damage. This data, in turn, could feed into a computer algorithm that would automatically shift other weapons still in flight to new targets after a certain amount of destruction. A manned operator could also make the final decision after the system alerted them to the developing situation. With such a system in place, a launch platform might not even have to designate targets before releasing a swarm of weapons, with those bombs and missiles using a pre-programmed hierarchy of priority to focus and refocus on targets as they appear and get destroyed. This would also enable the swarm to quickly turn its attention to pop-up threats, such as point air defense systems, and engage them first, to reduce the threat to the rest of the swarm. All of this would also reduce the risk to the aircraft employing the weapons, as they would have more flexibility in planning routes and avoid enemy defenses before and after launch. “What our warfighter is really interested in is, if I have a very large weapons truck like an F-15[E Strike Eagle] or like one of our bombers that can drop multiple of these munitions, is there a way to act in such a way to provide better effects on targets?” Genatempo added . “Or better ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] back to a command-and-control node?” An F-15E Strike Eagle carrying a load of 20 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs., USAF Gray Wolf had envisioned subsequent development of versions of the swarming cruise missile with expanded sensor packages and electronic warfare suites to help spot targets and clear the way for the actual munitions. Depending on the exact capabilities of the weapons that Golden Horde brings together, it is possible that the swarms will have elements able to perform these sorts of roles, as well as kinetic strikes. The desire to add the ADM-160, which is actually a family of decoys that The War Zone has looked at in detail in the past, to the mix already points to this kind of potential capability. The latest MALD-X variant , which is still in development, is specifically intended to be a networked system that can rapidly adapt to changing situations. This could involve rapidly switching between emitting different signatures to mimic those of different aircraft or munitions or fine-tuning electronic warfare jammers on the fly to respond to various threats. In addition, the U.S. military as a whole is becoming increasingly interested in the idea of so-called “ cognitive electronic attack ,” which refers to the idea that an electronic warfare system would be able to detect and categorize threats and then begin targeting those waveforms, even if they were previously unknown, right in the middle of a mission. The MALD-X’s data links could allow it to receive that new information from off-board sources, including other decoys flying the area, as well. As with munitions in the swarm, autonomous data sharing and prioritizing would help any combination of MALD variants to focus their efforts of maximum effect, too. The data each node collects could even be used for real-time autonomous route planning, shifting the course of munitions based on the status of enemy air defenses and the electronic warfare tactics being employed against them. If Golden Horde results in something of a “modular” networking capability that the Air Force can readily integrate into various types of weapons, it may be relatively easy to add this functionality to other systems down the line, including both new munitions and unmanned air combat vehicles . The service is separately working on a multi-purpose AI computer brain called Skyborg that could potentially turn various aircraft into autonomous unmanned platforms. The Air Force’s new experimental XQ-58A Valkyrie is one potential host for the Skyborg AI., USAF In addition, the Syria example points to the decided possibility of including other services and their respective munitions and launch platforms , including ship-launched missiles, in networked operations down the road. The ability for various ships and aircraft to fire weapons from multiple vectors that would then act as one or more swarms would offer an impressive capability. One of the key benefits of a swarm by itself is its ability to overwhelm enemy defenders who have to try and prioritize how to respond while the networked munitions continue to adapt and change their own plans. “We are still unraveling the onion on what that may actually mean as far as operational capability goes,” said of early work on Golden Horde and its possible concepts of operation. The service is pushing to begin exploring those possibilities soon and hopes to conduct its first flight experiment within the next 12 months, according to Aviation Week . With that aggressive schedule in place, we may begin to hear more about the progress of the Golden Horde in the coming months. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The future USS Billings , a new Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ship that the U.S. Navy recently took delivery of, sustained damage after hitting another vessel in Montreal, Canada yesterday. The warship had been on its way to future homeport in Mayport, Florida ahead of its formal commissioning and the hope is that this incident will not delay its entry into service. The incident reportedly occurred on June 24, 2019, after two tugs assisting the future Billings in Montreal harbor cast off their two lines. For still unknown reasons, the LCS lost control and smacked up against the side of the Rosaire Desgagnes , a bulk cargo ship, which was moored nearby, according to First Coast News .  A spokesperson for Naval Surface Force Atlantic told The Maritime Executive that the Navy ship’s starboard bridge wing had been damaged, as a result, but also that a full damage assessment is underway. “The Navy is conducting an investigation to understand what happened and why,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Courtney Hillson, a public affairs officer at Naval Surface Force Atlantic informed WOKV News in Jacksonville. “We will incorporate lessons learned to ensure we conduct safe and effective operations.” A video of the future Billings up against the side of the Rosaire Desgagnes subsequently appeared on the Shipspotting Canada Facebook group . You can also view the video here if it does not appear below. There were no reported injuries to personnel on either ship. There is no word yet about potential damage to the Rosaire Desgagnes . We don’t know yet when the future Billings might restart her voyage to Florida. Her commissioning date, August 3, 2019, remains unchanged. Construction of the future Billings began in 2014 and she was launched in 2017. The Navy officially took delivery of the ship in a ceremony at the Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard in Wisconsin in February 2019. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the Freedom -class LCS, but Fincantieri Marinette Marine, an American subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri Marine , is the subcontractor responsible for actually building them. The future USS Billings during acceptance trials on Lake Michigan in December 2018., USN The ship left the shipyard for Mayport earlier in June. After delivery, new Freedom -class LCSs must sail through the Great Lakes and up the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to get out into the Atlantic Ocean and then make their way to their future homeports. It is perhaps good that this incident occurred now, during the summer, rather than during the winter months, when ice can block the St. Lawrence. After her delivery in September 2017, the Freedom -class USS Little Rock sailed to Buffalo New York for her commissioning in December 2017. She then found herself waylaid in Montreal due to ice , remaining stuck there until March 2018. USS Little Rock docked in Montreal in December 2017., USN The predicament of the future Billings also brings up memories of the USS Montgomery , an Independence -class LCS, which suffered two similar accidents , on top of a pair of engineering casualties , shortly after her commissioning in September 2016. On Oct. 4, 2016 , a tug collided with Montgomery , leaving a foot-long crack in her hull, as she was leaving Mobile, Alabama to escape Hurricane Matthew . After temporary repairs, she continued on her way. Then, on Oct. 29, 2016, she hit the wall of one of the locks in the Panama canal, causing another crack in her side, this time 18 inches long. Montgomery eventually reached her homeport of San Diego, California and received more permanent repairs. The Navy does not appear to have ever released an estimate or final total of cost of fixing that ship. The Independence -class Littoral Combat Ship USS Montgomery ., USN From what we know so far, the future Billings ‘ accident isn’t related to the ship’s design in any way, but this latest incident certainly can’t help the image of the LCS program. The Navy has had difficulty employing the perpetually underwhelming ships at all, let alone as intended , and no LCS of any type deployed in 2018 due to a confluence of factors. This came after a major restructuring of the entire LCS program that resulted in, among other things, the relegation of the first four ships to test and training duties . Concerns about the limited capabilities of the ships finally drove the Navy to begin a program to acquire a new class of frigates in 2017. The service hopes to pick a winning design this year, though there are now fears that Congressional requirements could upend the effort. In the meantime, hopefully, the full extent of the damage to the future Billings will remain limited and it will be able to make it to Mayport on time for commissioning.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 16, 2020",The United Kingdom Becomes The Third Country To Send F-35s Into Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense says that Royal Air Force F-35B Joint Strike Fighters have been flying combat patrols over Iraq and Syria for more than a week. This is a major milestone for Britain’s stealthy fighter jets, which only reached initial operational capability in January 2019. A pair of F-35Bs, also known by their formal nickname Lightning II, from the RAF’s 617 Squadron, flying from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, conducted the first combat patrol over Syria on June 16, 2019, according to an official statement . The detachment of six Joint Strike Fighters in Cyprus has since flown a combined total of 12 sorties over both Syria and Iraq. The jets have been at Akrotiri since April 2019 and conducted Exercise Lightning Dawn the following month as a workup to actual combat missions. The United Kingdom is now the third country to deploy its F-35s for combat, after Israel and the United States . The RAF F-35Bs are conducting these “armed overwatch” missions equipped with a pair of 500-pound class Paveway IV dual-mode precision-guided bombs in their internal bays, along with two AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM). So far, the British jets have not actually engaged any ground targets. “This first operational mission for the UK’s F-35 Lightning confirms the impressive progress which we have made in introducing this formidable new capability into service,” Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, the RAF’s top officer, said in an official statement . “It is [a] testament to the outstanding abilities of our dedicated and highly trained air and ground crew that 617 Squadron has achieved this important milestone so quickly and so effectively.” The combat deployment is an important step forward for the United Kingdom, which plans to eventually buy a total fleet of 138 F-35Bs that the RAF and the Royal Navy (RN) will operate together as part of the joint service Lightning Force. Some reports in the past have raised the possibility that some of the future purchases might be of conventional F-35As. At present, the entire force consists of 17 B models split between the 617 Squadron and test and training elements based in the United States. One of 617 Squadron’s F-35Bs takes off from Akrotiri on June 24, 2019., Press Association via AP Images The RAF expects its components of the Lightning Force to eventually take over many of the roles that the venerable Panavia Tornado had previously filled. The service officially retired those aircraft, nicknamed the Tonka, in March 2019 after almost four decades of operations. Tornadoes had been a regular component of RAF operations in Iraq and Syria right up until the end. Those swing-wing combat jets notably took part in the U.S.-led cruise missile strikes on parts of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s chemical weapons apparatus on Apr. 14, 2018 . RAF Eurofighter Typhoons have been filling in for the Tornadoes in the meantime and have been steadily increasing their role in the Middle East in recent years, too. But the deployment of the F-35Bs offer important new capabilities, both for British forces still conducting operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq and in regards to the U.K. military’s overall regional presence. Most importantly, the Joint Strike Fighters offer sensor fusion and data-sharing capabilities that certainly weren’t found on the now-retired Tornadoes and offer additional functionality over even the systems on its Eurofighters. The F-35B’s Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provides a non-traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability and its powerful electronic warfare suite can passively grab information on electronic signatures from radars and other emitters during flight. Two of 617 Squadron’s F-35Bs in a hangar at RAF Akrotiri., Press Association via AP Images This means that the jets might be recording data regarding Syrian , Russian , or Iranian air defenses , as well as ground-based electronic warfare jamming systems , even though 617 Squadron’s mission in the region is focused on fighting ISIS terrorists. This “ electronic order of battle ” information could be extremely valuable in the event that the United Kingdom joins with the United States or other allies and partners to conduct strikes against higher risk targets, like the chemical weapons sites it destroyed in Syria in April 2018. The small number of RAF F-35Bs also have the ability to exploit their sensor suite and data links, as well as their stealth features, to serve as leaders and pathfinders for non-stealthy aircraft during larger operations, including those involving coalition partners, if called upon. Underscoring the possibility of future F-35 missions alongside friendly forces, on June 25, 2019, the U.K. Ministry of Defense also revealed that its Joint Strike Fighters had flown a training mission with U.S. and Israeli F-35s. The latter would have been some of Israel’s unique F-35Is , while the former were likely U.S. Air Force F-35As, which deployed to the Middle East for the first time in April 2019. The sorties over Iraq and Syria will also simply provide valuable experience in a real-world combat environment for the RAF’s first operational F-35B squadron, which will be extremely valuable in the service’s development of tactics, techniques, and procedures on how to operate and employ the still very new aircraft. Despite its obvious operational character, 617 Squadron is itself clearly something of an operational test and evaluation unit. “The F-35s are the most advanced jets our country has ever possessed and will form the backbone of British air defense for decades to come,” U.K. Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said in comments at RAF Akrotiri . “They have passed every test their training has thrown at them with flying colors and their first real operational mission is a significant step into the future for the U.K.” U.K. Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt speaks to the press about the RAF’s first F-35B combat deployment from the cockpit of one of the jets at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus., Press Association via AP Images The squadron is set to embark on board the first-in-class aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , along with jets from the dedicated 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron, later in the year to train for shipboard operations. The ability of the UK’s F-35Bs, as well as those from allied countries, to operate from the Queen Elizabeth is an important component of the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s current plans on how to employ that ship. “This Autumn, our aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will return to the East Coast of the United States to conduct Operational Trials with our Lightning Force, taking this 5th generation capability to the next level as they prove their ability to operate from the sea,” Admiral Tony Radakin, the Royal Navy’s top officer, said in a statement. “For decades to come, this exciting new combination of aircraft carriers and F-35B Lightnings will provide a potent, globally deployable carrier strike capability, a powerful conventional deterrent and the centerpiece of our country’s expeditionary forces.” As it stands now , the RN only expects to receive 42 of the total 138 F-35Bs, 24 of which will be assigned to operational units, with the balance dedicated to training and other tasks. This is simply not enough to provide a full complement of combat aircraft for the Queen Elizabeth . As such, U.S. Marine F-35Bs are already slated to join elements of the Lighting Force on the carrier for her first operational cruise, set to occur in 2021. Jets from 617 Squadron could join them, along with aircraft other RAF and RN units that have stood up by then. The RAF’s 207 Squadron, which will also call RAF Marham home, is the slated to be the next F-35B unit to stand up. US Marine F-35Bs train on board HMS Queen Elizabeth during a test in 2018., Crown copyright Another F-35 user deploying the jets for actual combat operations is an important demonstration of the type’s suitability for real-world missions, as well. Just recently, new reports emerged highlighting significant ongoing technical issues across all three Joint Strike Fighter variants. Data about U.S. Air Force, Marine, and Navy F-35 fleets have also underscored the high costs and continuing difficulties in operating and maintaining the aircraft, too. Those issues notwithstanding, the missions over Syria and Iraq show that the United Kingdom is aggressively pushing to begin integrating their F-35Bs into more routine operations, include actual combat deployments. These operational deployments are only likely to keep expanding in size and scope as the Lighting Force continues to grow in the coming years.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s official, the Navy has sealed a $29.7 million deal for a second-hand C-130J Super Hercules from the Royal Air Force to replace the Blue Angels’ beloved C-130T ‘Fat Albert’ transport. That aircraft was just retired as it had reached the end of its service life after spending the last 17 years with the team and flying over 30,000 hours in support of crazy schedule. You can read all about the bittersweet end to this aircraft’s career in this past article of ours . But now we know Fat Albert’s future actually looks very bright as the surplus C-130J will bring a whole new level of performance to the Fat Albert routine and a far newer aircraft to shuffle the team around. The ex-Royal Air Force C-130J being purchased is what that service calls a Hercules C5. It is the standard (short) fuselage Super Hercules configuration. The RAF intends to continue operating its fleet of stretched C-130J-30s. We were among the first to report on the Navy’s plan to acquire the RAF C-130J for the team back in March on 2018 . We noted the following at the time: According to our friends over at Flightglobal.com , the RAF intends to operate their 14 C-130J-30 airframes that feature stretched fuselages through 2035, but their short-fuselage C-130J models, known as C-130J C5s, have been placed in storage: “In a controversial move, the UK government’s Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010 proposed removing the RAF’s entire C-130J fleet from service. But with the service facing a looming tactical airlift shortfall and delays to the introduction of tactical capabilities for its incoming Airbus Defence & Space A400M Atlas, this decision was partially reversed in its 2015 review, which identified a need to retain 14 Hercules. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows the RAF’s C4-model C-130Js as being aged between 17 and 21 years. Its short-fuselage C5-standard examples have already been retired from use or placed in storage. The UK acquired an original 25 “Super Hercules”, with one having been destroyed after sustaining damage from an improvised explosive device on landing at a remote airstrip in Iraq in 2007.” The most iconic C-130 on Earth, C-130T Fat Albert poses over some gorgeous Montana terrain., USN Up until today, it looked as if the deal for the used Super Hercules was in doubt as little had been heard of it even as the team’s famous C-130T was being flown off to its final resting place. An official statement from Naval Air Systems Command reads : The Navy announced award of the Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron’s new “Fat Albert,” the Blue Angels’ logistics cargo plane, June 13. Scheduled for delivery in spring 2020, the $29.7 million contract was awarded to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (UK MOD) for a divested C-130J Super Hercules. Cost savings associated with acquisition of the used aircraft and other airworthiness requirements is approximately $50 million less than the cost of a new aircraft. “This is a win-win for the U.S. Navy and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence,” said Capt. Steven Nassau, PMA-207 program manager.  “Just as the Navy recognized the imminent need to replace the Fat Albert aircraft, the UK MOD was divesting of an American made, C-130J; aircraft allowing us to acquire a suitable replacement aircraft at a major cost savings.” In March 2018, PMA-207 received congressional approval to proceed with acquisition of the UK MOD C-130J with funding from Foreign Military Sales proceeds. The last dedicated Fat Albert, a C-130T Hercules, retired May 2019 and now serves as a ground-based training platform in Fort Worth, Texas. Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron will continue flying Navy or Marine Corps C-130 Hercules assets until the replacement aircraft is complete. RAF C-130J., RAF/Crown Copyright With a delivery date set for spring of 2020, it sets the team up for a 2021 season that could feature a new primary mount—the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet—as well as an upgraded Fat Albert transport, both of which will also come with significantly reformulated routines. The C-130J can do some amazing things in the right hands. You can read all about the Blue Angels plans to convert to the Super Hornet here. All said, this seems like a great deal. The Marines don’t take a hit by having to give up one of their prized KC-130Js, while at the same time the Blues get an upgrade and the Navy doesn’t have to shell out roughly $75 million for a brand new airframe. On top of all that, America’s closest ally gets to unload an airframe it no longer wants. Talk about a second shot at life for an airplane!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 29, 2019",Air Force Admits F-22 Raptors Won’t Hit 80 Percent Mission Capable Target On Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has now publicly acknowledged that the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter fleet will not hit an 80 percent mission capable rate target by the end of this current fiscal year. There are also questions about whether the readiness gains that the service has made with respect to the F-22 will be sustainable in the future. U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Fighters and Bombers, gave the status update to reporters during the Life Cycle Industry Days at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio last week. In March 2019 , former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson told members of Congress that the F-22s were unlikely to reach the 80 percent goal by the 2019 Fiscal Year, which comes to a close on Sept. 30, 2019. In September 2018 , former Secretary of Defense James Mattis had demanded that the Air Force take all possible steps to get the average F-22 mission capable rate up to at least 80 percent by the time Fiscal Year 2019 wrapped up. His memo also set the same targets for Air Force F-16 Vipers , Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets , Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters across all three of these services. “The MC [mission capable] numbers are higher than they’ve ever been,” Brigadier General Collins told reporters . He did not give an official figure, stating that the actual mission capable rate for the F-22 fleet was classified. Historically, these rates for the Raptors have been notoriously low , typically hovering around 50 percent. The actual full mission capable rates, which refer to the percentage of the fleet that is, on average, capable of meeting all mission requirements, may have been substantially lower than this, as well. An F-22 Raptor., USAF “We clearly see the benefits” of a boost in resources, Collins added. During the fiscal year, the Air Force reprogrammed funding from other parts of its budget to help purchase additional stocks of spare parts, the officer explained . The service had also paid Lockheed Martin to keep an additional maintenance bay open “seven days a week” in its Marrietta, Georgia facility to increase F-22 depot capacity. Improving the readiness of the F-22, in particular, is important given that it remains one of America’s most advanced fighter jets. The notably short-sighted decision to dramatically curtail the planned purchases of Raptors in the first place has left the Air Force with a relatively small fleet overall, which only exacerbates the impacts of low readiness rates. At present, the Air Force has around 186 F-22s in total, but only around 125 of them are assigned to combat-coded units. The Raptor fleet has suffered a number of serious mishaps over the years, too. Just in 2018, one F-22 suffered a belly landing and another jet that ended up on its side , mishaps that caused significant damage to both aircraft. Another one of the stealth fighters suffered a catastrophic engine failure last year, too, but was able to land safely. In 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highlighting how low availability and poor utilization of the fleet as a whole had limited F-22 units’ abilities to train for and otherwise be prepared to participate in high-end conflicts where their stealth and other capabilities would be absolutely essential. An F-22 undergoes an engine test at a facility at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia., USAF So, even if the F-22 fleet hasn’t hit an 80 percent mission capable rate, significant progress in that direction is certainly a positive development. Brigadier General Collins wouldn’t give a fixed timeline for when the Raptors might finally hit that target. But there are also concerns about how sustainable these readiness improvements are, even in the near term. In March , former Secretary of the Air Force Wilson had highlighted 2018’s Hurricane Michael , which decimated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, a major F-22 hub, as one of the major factors preventing the Raptors from reaching the 80 percent mark. F-22s in a hangar at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida after Hurricane Michael., USAF Now, Collins has said that the disaster actually helped improve the readiness rates, because it reduced the total flying hours across the F-22 fleet. The return of forward-deployed F-22s from the Middle East in February 2019, marking the first time in years that Raptors have not been operating in that region, along with a pair of earthquakes in late 2018 that damaged Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, also contributed to reduced flying demands across the fleet. All of this, in turn, led to an easing of maintenance and logistics demands. Preventive maintenance, in particular, often occurs based on flight hours. So, when the jets fly less, they also need to go in for inspections and get parts replaced on a less frequent basis. Reduced flying time also means less need to remediate the Raptor’s sensitive stealth coating, which is time-consuming to apply and maintain , in general. The challenge now will be to ensure that the positive trends continue when the fleet’s flight hours increase again. Consolidation of the Raptors at fewer bases is one avenue the Air Force is looking at that could help make reductions in maintenance and logistical demands more permanent. In March 2019 , the Air Force proposed reorganizing F-22 units and basing a third of the jets at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, turning it into the service’s main training hub for the type in the process. Distribution of the US Air Force’s F-22s as of 2018. The service now plans to permanently move the Raptors shown here at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia., GAO “The permanent solution must address readiness and pilot production by ensuring the F-22 FTU [formal training unit] is set up at a location that optimizes readiness and supports the secretary of defense’s requirement to improve mission capable rates to 80 percent,” U.S. Air Force spokesman Robert Leese said at the time . While the final plan is still awaiting Congressional approval, F-22s from Tyndall, along with their pilots, have already dispersed to units in Virginia, as well as Alaska and Hawaii. At the same time, the small size of the F-22 fleet overall inherently makes it difficult to realize any cost savings through economies of scale. Combined with the complexities and maintenance intensive nature of the fighter, in general, it may remain persistently difficult to sustain Raptor readiness rates, especially during high-tempo, long-term combat operations during a major conflict. F-22s taxi to the runway during a major short-notice combat readiness exercise, also known as an “Elephant Walk,” at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska in March 2019., USAF Even relatively minor drops in mission-capable rates could have outsized impacts on the operational capacity of the F-22 fleet. For perspective, just working with the raw numbers, with an 80 percent mission capable rate for combat-coded Raptors, this would still only mean that around 100 of the aircraft are operational any given time. The total number immediately available for deployment would likely be lower given training requirements and operational planning, which would keep some of the aircraft in reserve to respond to new contingencies on short notice and to replace combat losses. In the meantime, it’s not clear what will happen now that there is no doubt that the F-22 will fail to hit the 80 percent target by the end of September. Mattis’ 2018 memo did not outline any punitive measures if the services could not meet the readiness targets, but the Air Force may still need some sort of official waiver, according to Air Force Magazine . “We’re in discussions with OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense] on the way forward,” Brigadier General Collins explained. All told, the Air Force is clearly aware of the importance of increasing the readiness of the F-22s, and keeping it at those elevated levels, in order to maximize the fleet’s operational capacity. At the same time, the service still clearly faces significant hurdles in doing so. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 9, 2019",Soldiers Can Look Like Star Wars Bounty Hunters With This Crazy Helmet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It looks like it belongs in the latest science fiction action movie, and seems like it could be more at home on Kylo Ren’s head than on a real soldier’s, but this helmet is very much real. Japan’s Devtac, along with the Trust International Group, are working on a new modular ballistic headgear, dubbed Ronin II, aimed at giving special operations and special tactics units more protection, and more flexibility, than what their current headgear offers. The markets for combat headgear, and especially maxillofacial shields , have exploded in recent years. The hockey-like helmets that special operators have worn for decades have given way to much more specialized cranial protection . Meanwhile, the ability to attach ballistic face shields to existing helmet, especially those worn by helicopter crews, have become the norm. (This has, incidentally, also led to some pretty surreal and sinister pieces of art .) Yet it seems most special operations soldiers still aren’t happy with their helmet choices. Elaborate helmet systems have been in development with an eye on integrating wearable technologies, such as helmet-mounted displays and augmented reality glasses , and to lessen the chances that its wearer would experiencing traumatic brain injury during a blast from an IED. But even the most basic of these units remain bulky , like a motorcycle helmet, and It seems that for many special operations units, less is often more when it comes to headgear and other wearables. With this in mind, the need for a platform that offers enhanced protection and a high level of customization without the bulk is clearly there. This seems to be where relatively tiny Devtac is trying to find a niche, offering a new headgear that includes a high degree of ballistic protection ( level 3A ), not just for the head but also the face and eyes, in a relatively streamlined package. , Devtac’s Kevlar-reinforced Ronin helmet has been tested against cartridges up to 44 magnum—you can see the tests below—and the system can be easily altered on the fly. Plus, some of the pieces can be attached via neodymium magnets instead of small screws. For instance, an operator could put on individual solid cheek shields for high-risk operations such as when clearing buildings, and can easily remove them once operating in a lower threat environment. The removable cheek piece also allows for a far better weapon-to-cheek weld for the user’s strong side. Alternatively, a single piece wrap-around armored mandible shield can be attached for the best possible ballistic coverage. Also, different picatinny rails and slots to attach helmet-mounted displays, cameras, and night vision optics can be configured depending on the mission needs and available technology. The eye pieces are actively defogged using a small electronic fan system that is integrated directly into the helmet chassis. The helmet system is supposed to feature a peripheral field of view of 160 degrees, which is fairly impressive, and is relatively lightweight considering the protection it supposedly provides. As to whether this thing is actually comfortable, functional, and tactically relevant, I have no idea, but it was one of the stars of IDEX 2017—a large arms trade show in Dubai—and many special operations and special tactics units are said to have ordered samples for testing. What I do know is that it looks scary as hell, so it has that going for it. Some will likely malign what seems to be Devtac’s roots in the airsoft community, although they would be foolish to do so. Often, meaningful defense innovations come from outside the traditional “big defense” R&D umbrella, and for something as unglamorous and niche as the special operations helmet market, who knows, Devtac may have a winner on their hands eventually.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2019",Our Holiday Gift Guide For The Aviation Or Military Geek In Your Life,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The gift giving season is upon us once again and it seems that finding a thoughtful present for the ones you love has never been harder. But if you have someone in your life that loves aviation, military technology , and history you’re in luck! The War Zone’s annual gift guide is here with a bunch of options that will result in huge smiles when the wrapping paper meets its doom on Christmas morning or a Hanukkah night. USAF Raven Rock : The U.S. Government’s Secret Plan To Save Itself While The Rest Of Us Die (Tyler’s recommendation) This is Tyler’s top book recommendation for the year. Rarely do we get such a well researched, thorough, and fascinating read to chew on. It not only takes the reader through the evolution of America’s Continuity of Government plans, elaborate network of secret doomsday bunkers, and the ever changing command and control infrastructure used to deploy America’s nuclear arsenal, but it also tells the story of how the advent of nuclear weapons has shaped our own lives in ways you probably never realized. We interviewed author Garrett Graff to discuss his awesome book last May and our in-depth conversation just scratched the surface of what this unique book delves into. Suffice it to say, Raven Rock will be a home run with even the nerdiest military history nuts among us. Bookcover Stealth Fighter: A Year In The Life Of A F-117 Pilot (Tyler’s recommendation) What a treat this book is.  Lt. Col. William B. O’Connor, an EF-111 Raven pilot before joining the F-117 program and getting his “Bandit” number, takes us on an incredibly insightful and wild ride into the dark world of F-117 operations. The chapters on Operation Allied Force are worth the price of admission alone. This book is an especially good companion to earlier titles like Ben Rich’s Skunk Works as it details the Nighthawk’s story from a pilot’s perspective once it was fully mature and a more integrated part of USAF and coalition air operations. Considering the F-117 is still making headlines a decade after its official retirement, the timing is right for gifting this book to anyone interested in aviation and air combat. Bookcover Combat-Ready Kitchen : How the U.S. Military Shapes the Way You Eat (Joe’s recommendation) It’s cliche to say that “an army marches on its stomach,” but that doesn’t make it’s any less true. Anastacia Marx de Salcedo’s 2015 Combat-Ready Kitchen: How the U.S. Military Shapes the Way You Eat is an amazingly detailed, but still easy to read look at the evolution of feeding troops from the times of ancient Greece and Rome to present day. The US military in particular, together with big-name private food processing companies, have turned combat rations and food preservation into a delicate science. The book walks readers through everything from canned food to the newest, long-lasting rations, known as Meals Ready-to-Eat, or MREs. Unfortunately, the US military has since abandoned its plans to begin serving up a shelf-stable pizza that could last for years! This book is a fun stalking stuffer to crack open after binging on turkey and stuffing. Bookcover Yeager: An Autobiography (Tyler’s recommendation) This is an absolute staple for anyone interested in aviation, military history, and/or air combat, and 31 years after its initial release it takes on special significance as this year marked the 70th anniversary of Yeager’s legendary sound barrier breaking flight. Although the man was largely defined by this monumental historical achievement, his life has been incredibly eventful and absolutely packed with achievement and encounters with historically significant and famous people. Just a few highlights of many include becoming an ace flying P-51s in WWII, surviving a harrowing escape from the Nazis after being shot down only to demand he be cleared to return to combat, as well as being an enlisted pilot that became a general. The list goes on and on. You even learn about Chuck’s super power of sorts, his almost super-human vision. Yeager’s “colorful” voice isn’t lost on the reader to say the least. This is Forest Gump with flight suits, radar altimeters, holographic gunsights, and mach airspeed indicators. And if you ever wondered about the mystique of the flight test world and how Edwards AFB and the culture surrounding it became such a big deal, then this is a must read. If anything else, it’s simply awe inspiring how much this guy packed into his life, and he is still alive and tweeting on a daily basis! Bookcover Tree of Smoke: A Novel (Joe’s recommendation) Denis Johnson’s 2007 Tree of Smoke: A Novel may not be new, but it was a welcome addition to the Vietnam War genre. A fictional story, the book follows the arcs of a number of different characters as they get deeper and deeper into the Vietnam quagmire, all brought together by a steadily brewing and engrossing conspiracy. The book pulls no punches and does its best not to take a position on who might have been right or wrong in the conflict, instead painting a deep and complex picture of the circumstances as the story’s main events unfold. If you haven’t heard of this book before or had a chance to give it a look, now would be a great time. Or gift it to a friend and ask them to check it out first! Bookcover The Chopper Boys : Helicopter Warfare in Africa (Joe’s recommendation) We appreciate that it can be hard to find easily accessible information about conflicts on the African continent, but South African war correspondent A.J. Venter’s The Chopper Boys: Helicopter Warfare in Africa is a great primer of African conflicts past and present, underscoring the transformative nature of helicopters in warfare throughout Africa and the central role they continue play in the fighting to this day. The original 1995 edition of the book was getting increasingly out of date, but in 2016, Venter released a new, revised edition with additional entries covering France’s intervention in Mali and Nigeria’s campaign against Boko Haram terrorists since 2014. This is a great read for those who want to better understand warfare in an area of the world that is chronically misunderstood. Bookcover Above and Beyond (Tyler’s recommendation) This one came out of the blue on a Sunday afternoon for me. Multiple people told me to check out this documentary on the making of the Israeli Air Force. I really didn’t rush to watch it as I already knew the story—or so I thought. Then I ordered it on demand without even realizing it was the same film that was recommended to me and was blown away. This documentary does an amazing job of getting firsthand accounts of what has to be one of the world’s most creative and desperate undertakings. The story is as moving as it is flat out inspiring, detailing how regular people became national heroes in an effort to lie, steal, and cheat so that the young Jewish State would acquire an air force before it was too late. Downright amazing events are recalled, and there are huge parallels with the birth of the IAF and Star Wars of all things. I cannot recommend this film enough. You can buy the DVD or you can gift an Amazon Prime subscription as the documentary is free to watch if you are a member, plus that special someone will get all the other benefits the service provides. Movie promotional poster The Americans (Tyler’s recommendation) This one may seem to come out of left field, but there is good reasoning behind it. FX’s banner action-drama depicting Soviet spies living as an average American family in the 1980s is not only critically acclaimed and fantastically acted and produced, but it also uses a tremendous amount of source material we talk about here regularly at The War Zone. Russian espionage has become a dinner table topic once again in the United States, so there are fantastic parallels there as well, but key defense programs and initiatives that took place in the early 1980s are often the target of our anti-hero illegally transplanted spies—with some very familiar projects making cameo appearances. Not all the information is perfectly accurate or adheres to the historic timeline, but that really won’t distract even the most hardcore mil-tech enthusiast as the show is fantastic and it does far better presenting these topics than most fictional programs do. Plus, who the hell doesn’t love a great spy yarn? Especially one that has some very true roots . You can buy the seasons on DVD or you gift an Amazon Prime membership, as the seasons are available on their streaming service. If you have Comcast you can purchase an FX+ subscription for $5.99 a month, which will give you commercial free access to the show. That would make a great stocking stuffer! Get caught up now before the sixth and final season airs next year. DVD title cover Any apparel and accessories from Sierra Hotel Aeronautics (Tyler’s recommendation) This company makes some of the coolest vintage aviation apparel imaginable that will be a mega hit for anyone who loves airplanes and military history. They offer absolutely the highest quality gear with some of the most awesome designs you can find anywhere—most of which are torn straight from the pages of military aviation history. From VX-4 “Evaluators” squadron shirts to unique SR-71 caps you can’t go wrong with anything on their site. Don’t forget to grab a couple keychain tags as well. They are the best stocking-stuffer and I haven’t had to search for my keys once since putting one on my keyring! Sierra Hotel Aeornatics Any of Squadron Poster’s gorgeous aviation artworks (Joe’s recommendation) It’s been a long time since we taped up paper posters of our favorite fighter jets and bombers next our beds, but if you’re itching for something similar—and a little more adult—its hard to go wrong with Squadron Poster’s beautifully stylized, aviation themed art. Though there’s a heavy focus toward the US military units and their aircraft, past and present, there’s a number of non-American themed options as well. And while you can spend hundreds of dollars on their well crafted canvas artworks, especially from the new Jet Black Collection, they do offer posters you can frame yourself at very reasonable prices. You should be able to easily find something that fits your interests or is a favorite of a family member or friend, whether it be a sleek fighter jet such as the F-16 Viper or F/A-18 Hornet , the legendary SR-71 spy plane , or the stealthy B-2 bomber . There are even ones touching on more obscure aircraft and units such as the US Army’s shadowy DHC-7s and the US Air Force’s flight test community . Not a fan of posters or don’t have any more room left on your wall? They do t-shirts, too! Squadron Posters Canon 100-400mm L II and Canon EOS 70D (Tyler’s recommendation) I get constant emails from people who are frustrated with their air show and airplane spotting pictures and want to know what gear to buy. There is one solution that will give you the best results versus cost and will get you invested in a system that has a huge array of lens and accessory options. This would be the Canon 70D and the 100-400mm L II super telephoto lens. I have used pretty much everything out there from monster 500mm L primes to 1D class camera bodies, and although you can buy better image quality for many thousands of dollars more, the 70D and 100-400mm L II combo is just outstanding, both in terms of image quality, versatility, affordability, and portability. Sure there are newer and more expensive choices for camera bodies, but when it comes to capturing fast action at long ranges, the 70D gives me relatively smooth images at high pixel rates. Also, the 100-400mm works great with full-frame bodies as well, so if you want to get a camera body better suited to low light and portraiture photography later on you can grab a 5D and still leverage the reach of the 100-400mm L II. None of this comes cheap per se, but it is by far the best bang for the buck out there and you won’t feel the need to upgrade soon after purchasing the setup. The 100-400mm L II lens runs roughly $2,000 and the body will run you a cool $750, but you won’t regret it. Many of the images on my Flickr page were taken with this combo, while older ones were largely taken with the first iteration of the same lens and the much older 50D body. Canon Blue Angels Aircraft Collection Desk Model (Tyler’s recommendation) There is nothing like a quality wooden aircraft model for someone’s desk, bookcase, or curios cabinet, and there are few models like this one offered up from Aiken’s Airplanes. This amazing setup displays the historical lineage of all the Blue Angels’ aircraft throughout the years in their iconic blue and gold paint jobs. It will cost you close to $500 but it’s truly an awesome sight to behold. And no worries if your targeted audience is all about the USAF, a Thunderbirds version also exists! Don’t fret if you aren’t looking to spend that much, you can get a great model for a fraction of the cost. A good move would be to ask what your loved one or friend’s favorite plane is and any other details about it, and order up that exact airplane. For instance, our writer Joseph Trevithick would probably like this AFSOC U-28 , whereas I would love this YF-23 Black Widow or this X-45 UCAV demonstrator .  Alternatively you could get them a spacecraft , or even the whole Shuttle Orbiter fleet . Or go nuts and buy them the whole boat, literally ! There’s even an option for Kim Jong Un ! Trust me, whatever route you go they will be thrilled and will remember you every time they look at it. Aiken’s Airplanes The ultimate home air combat simulator package: Oculus Rift , Digital Combat Simulator World— Nevada Test and Training Range Map , Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS , Rudder Pedals , and an Oculus ready gaming PC with a powerful graphics card (Tyler’s recommendation) This is the ultimate gift that will keep on giving for anyone who dreamed of flying high performance military aircraft. The injection of virtual reality into the flight simulator space is absolutely revolutionary. It’s not a better screen or a homemade cockpit, it’s being there to the point it is frightening at times. And that goes for any game genre really but the flight simulation niche is especially well suited for VR for obvious reasons. Digital Combat Simulator, the successor of Lock-On: Modern Air Combat, is the outright king of air combat simulation. Now with new maps and a wide variety of incredibly detailed and superbly modeled combat aircraft, DCS World is becoming more awesome by the week. A-10C, F-15C, F-5E, Mirage 2000, AV-8B, JS-37 Viggen and many more are already available to fly, but the biggest game changers are on the way. Those are the F/A-18C Hornet and the carrier that goes along with it, and maybe most exciting, F-14 Tomcat. I can’t dive into all the features of these aircraft and map modules, or of DCS in general, but I would highly recommend you do some googling and youtube video watching to get an idea of what this incredible “sandbox” style software suite is capable of. And yes it is all entirely capable of playing cooperatively online. Oculus is the most supported VR platform for DCS, but the HTC Vive also works without some key features. Adding the Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS for your primary controls not only feels and look amazing, but they make operating complex virtual aircraft while “inside” VR much easier. The all-metal stick in particular is simply awesome in feel and quality. Pair this setup with whatever rudder pedals you want and you are set for precision flying. Running VR at good frame rates and decent graphics complexity level settings isn’t a cheap endeavor. You need an Oculus ready PC that is optimized for gaming. This includes some odd-ball requirements like having a PCI-E USB 3.0 expansion card , and a very powerful discreet graphics card. The best one on the market today is Nvidia’s powerhouse GTX 1080 Ti. You can get by spending roughly $1500 on a PC to make it happen, but really, to give you good future proofing you are going to be closer to $2000, and that’s not buying something pre-made. I would highly recommend not buying an “off the shelf PC” and going to Fry’s and having them build a system for you. Not only will this cost less but you will also get higher quality components and a tailored system built by a qualified tech. If you have an existing PC with a decent processor, motherboard, and RAM, you could also remodel that computer for quite a bit less and get good results in VR as the graphics card does the vast majority of the heavy lifting. For the computer geeks among us, you guys can just build your own PC, which is really pretty easy and a lot of fun. In the end we are talking about a roughly $3,000-$3,500 proposition here if you are starting from scratch, but a lot of this is just buying a great computer that will give you years of service and high-end gaming capability. But when you add VR to the mix, justifying the cost isn’t just about buying a new game console or something, this is a revolutionary sea change in entertainment. And although VR is still in its infancy, it is fabulous, stable, and does not disappoint. So if you have the means, this gift package will provide pretty much the most immersive entertainment experience on the planet that no game console can compete with.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late last August, Russia put on a massive international arms expo and weapons bazaar that featured demonstrations of both air and ground components of Russia’s military. In addition, hundreds of pieces of military equipment were put on display. The annual spectacle, officially dubbed the International Military-Technical Forum 2017 but better known simply as “Army 2017,” took place at the sprawling Alabino Military Training Ground and Kubinka Air Base outside of Moscow. This was the third iteration of the event, which the Kremlin seems intent on making each year bigger than the last. Hundreds of thousands of people attend the event as spectators and dozens of official delegations from various militaries around the world also visit to talk weapons and tactics —and especially business—with Russian state defense firms and with those of other countries who are bound tightly within Moscow’s geopolitical orbit. There is no other event quite like it in the world—it’s distinctly Russian.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 1, 2019","Meet The AIM-260, The Air Force And Navy’s Future Long-Range Air-To-Air Missile","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy have been quietly working together to develop a new air-to-air missile called the AIM-260 that will replace the venerable AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM. The two services are worried that the Chinese, in particular, have begun to outrange American fighter jets with their own advanced air-to-air missiles . U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Anthony Genatempo, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons, provided details about the new missile in interviews with Aerospace Daily and Air Force Magazine during the Life Cycle Industry Days at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. This event is primarily meant to help Air Force Materiel Command share updates and potential new opportunities with defense contractors, but is also open to the press. The AIM-260 program, also known as the Joint Air Tactical Missile (JATM), has actually been going on for more than two years already, but this is the first time the Air Force or the Navy has publicly discussed it. At present, the only official mention of the project that is publicly available online appears to be a notice about the assistant program manager, an employee of Naval Air Systems Command, winning an award for outstanding logisticians in 2017. “It is meant to be the next air-to-air air dominance weapon for our air-to-air fighters,” Brigadier General Anthony Genatempo told Air Force Magazine . “It has a range greater than AMRAAM, different capabilities onboard to go after that specific threat set, but certainly longer legs.” Airmen move an inert training version of the AIM-120 AMRAAM during an exercise. The JATM is set to eventually replace the AIM-120s as the standard long-range air-to-air missile across the US military., USAF The threat set Genatempo was talking about is future aerial opponents riding in advanced fighter jets, such as those that Russia and China are developing and are beginning to field, such as the Su-57 and the J-20 , respectively. Those two countries have also been developing new, longer-range air-to-air missiles to go with those aircraft. The Air Force officer said that the appearance of the Chinese PL-15 , which uses a dual pulse rocket motor, in 2016 was the key factor that drove the Air Force and the Navy to begin the JATM program. Last year, a pair of J-20s flew a particularly notable flight routine at the biennial Zuhai air show with their ventral weapons bays open, showing a full load of four of these missiles. A J-20 with four PL-15 missiles in its main ventral weapons bay, as well as a pair of PL-10s on mounts that pop out from its cheek bays, at the 2018 Zuhai Air Show., Rabbit/Chinese Internet There has been much speculation and confusion about what missile this nomenclature refers to over the years and its exact capabilities, but this would seem to suggest that the U.S. military is concerned that it may be close to matching, or even exceeding, the range of the latest AIM-120D variant. Raw range, of course, isn’t the only factor in air-to-air combat and the AIM-120D has a host of other advanced features, which The War Zone has previously examined in depth . There is also a possibility that there remains confusion within the U.S. military about the exact nomenclature of Chinese air-to-air missiles. In late 2016, images also emerged of an even longer-range Chinese missile , which has been referred to as both the PL-15 and as the PL-21 . A Chinese J-16 fighter jet carrying a pair of long-range missiles that have been referred to as both the PL-15 and the PL-21., Chinese internet Whatever the case, in 2017, the JATM program office hired Lockheed Martin to develop the new air-to-air missile. Otherwise, there are still few details about the design. Genatempo did say that the AIM-260 will not use a ramjet, the European Meteor air-to-air missile does, and will have a similar form factor to the existing AIM-120, but did not explain how it would then be possible then to achieve a significant increase in range, according to Aerospace Daily . It is possible that advances in rocket motor and warhead technology may be enough to provide a considerable boost in range when combined with a new, streamlined body. For example, Northrop Grumman’s AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) leverages similar developments, including a warhead that offers improved lethality in a smaller package, to create space for additional rocket fuel. A briefing slide showing the internal configuration of the AGM-88G AARGM-ER and the considerable space inside devoted to its solid rocket motor., USN Brigadier General Genatempo didn’t offer any specifics about the other “different capabilities” the AIM-260 would have as compared to the AIM-120. A dual-mode seeker that includes radar and an imaging infrared capability could be a very important addition in an age of ever-improving countermeasures . This would give the missile a means of homing in on its target even in the face of electronic warfare jamming during the terminal phase of flight. Similarly, if the missiles optics were get blinded or confused, it could fall back on its radar seeker. An ability to home in on a target’s emissions, such as those from its own radar, could also give the JATM additional flexibility. The AIM-260 itself will very likely feature advanced two-way data links in order to send and receive new information, allowing for more precise targeting, complete retasking of the missile in flight, and engaging targets based on data from offboard sources. The latter functionality would allow a fighter pilot to engage targets beyond the range the sensors on their own aircraft or fire the missile without having to activate their own radar, increasing the likelihood that enemy forces would detect them. The AIM-120D already has a two-way data link that has some third party targeting capabilities. But keeping the weapon within the same size constraints of the AMRAAM will be especially important in order to integrate it into existing stealth fighters, such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , which must carry their weapons internally in order to maximize their stealthy characteristics. The F-22 and the non-stealthy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet are slated to be the first aircraft to carry the JATM, which Genatempo said is expected to begin flight testing in 2021 and begin initial operational testing the year afterward. After that, integration on F-35 variants will occur, according to Air Force Magazine . It seems likely given this timeframe that the missile could find its way onto other Air Force fighter jets, including the services future F-15X Advanced Eagles . “As I bring up JATM production, AMRAAM production is kind of going to start tailing off,” Brigadier General Anthony Genatempo added. There is also no explanation for why the new missile is called the AIM-260. The joint service designation system for missiles involves a three letter prefix – in this “AIM” for “Air Intercept Missile” – followed by an arbitrary number that is supposed to follow in sequence. The designation sequence has only recently hit the 180s , at least publicly, and it is highly unlikely that is has jumped so far ahead on still-classified projects alone. As such, “260” appears to be a deliberate choice with a specific meaning. It could be a reflection in some way of the missile’s performance or a completely different reference, similar to the out of sequence designation for the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . The Air Force chose that nomenclature because the plane would be the “first bomber for the 21st century.” Regardless of what the designation means, a new air-to-air missile with a significantly greater range over the AIM-120D, as well as other improvements, will be a boon to both stealthy non-stealthy U.S. fighter jets. Improved networking capabilities down the road could allow non-stealthy aircraft, such as the Super Hornet, to act as missile trucks and engage targets beyond the range of their own radars and other sensors while also keeping as far away as possible for enemy aircraft and air defenses. It is also worth noting that the AIM-260 appears to be just one part of a future family of advanced air-to-air weapons. The JATM program is separate from the Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW) project. You can find T he War Zone ‘s analysis of the LREW missile, which Raytheon is developing, here . Concept art of the Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW)., DOD The Air Force Research Laboratory is also continuing its work on smaller, next-generation, hit-to-kill air-to-air missiles as part of the Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM) and Small Advanced Capability Missile (SACM) programs. But the Air Force and the Navy appear to be very focused developing and fielding of the JATM in the near term. The AIM-260 sounds like an exciting and critical new capability for America’s fighter jets to help them keep their edge against potential opponents.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 20, 2019",Here’s Everything We Know About The U.S. Strikes On Iran That Never Came,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump says American forces were “cocked and loaded” to strike targets in Iran overnight, but that he called off the operation because he felt estimates that there would be approximately 150 Iranian casualties was not a proportional response to the loss of an unmanned aircraft. This comes as Iran, which admits to shooting down the U.S. Navy RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator drone, or BAMS-D, says it refrained from destroying a manned aircraft that it claims violated its airspace around the same time. Trump explained his decision in a series of Tweets on June 21, 2019. In doing so, he confirmed a story earlier in the day from The New York Times , which had first reported on the abrupt shift in plans, citing anonymous sources. Other outlets , citing other unnamed individuals , had already added weight to the report that the U.S. military had been about to strike Iran, before receiving an order to stand down. “We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night.” Trump later qualified the statements in an interview with NBC ‘s “Meet The Press,” according to an excepted published on June 21, 2019. The President said that he had not actually given final approval for the operation. “No, but they would have been pretty soon, and things would have happened to a point where you would not turn back, you could not turn back,” Trump told Chuck Todd in the interview when asked about whether planes were already in the air heading toward Iran. “Nothing was green-lighted until the very end because things change.” Trump did not specify what targets U.S. forces planned to strike. Newsweek had reported earlier that one of them was a Russian-made S-125 surface-to-air missile system site. An unnamed Pentagon official had told that outlet that the United States believed this weapon was employed to shoot down the BAMS-D. Iran has publicly said that it used the 3rd Khordad , a road-mobile variant of the country’s Raad , or Thunder, a locally produced analog to the Russian SA-11 Buk . We also don’t know what U.S. assets might have been alerted for the operation. Since May 2019, the United States has sent a succession of additional aircraft, ships, and ground units to the region, including the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her associated strike group and four B-52 bombers . The Abraham Lincoln Strike Group includes the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Leyte Gulf , five Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, and a Los Angeles -class attack submarine, all of which can fire Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles . Additional Tomahawk-armed submarines may also be within range. The B-52s could also conduct stand-off strikes using air-launched cruise missiles, such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). In April 2018, the United States, along with France and the United Kingdom, launched a series of strikes against targets in Syria using a mixture of sea- and air-launched cruise missiles from a similar mix of launch platforms . Online plane spotters did pick up at least two of the four B-52s in the region, using the callsigns Grimm 21 and 23, flying over the Persian Gulf at around 7:40 AM local time, which was reportedly after the final decision to stand down came through. There are also still outstanding questions about the exact timeline of events. Newsweek reported that crews onboard U.S. Navy ships in the region were only alerted of the impending mission “within an hour” of when it was supposed to occur. It is unclear how far in advance American forces had actually been preparing to conduct the strikes given reports of how long the decision-making process appeared to last and Trump’s statements that he never actually authorized them in the end. The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and elements of her strike group underway earlier in 2019., USN In addition, it seems hard to believe that he would not have been informed about the potential casualties so late in the decision-making process, though that would not necessarily have precluded Trump from asking the question again later on and making a snap decision to abort the mission. It is also unclear whether these were projected Iranian military or civilian casualties, or a mix thereof. ABC News , citing anonymous sources, says U.S. officials had worried about possible collateral damage from the strikes. There is no indication that the targets themselves were of a civilian nature, such as government buildings, though. There are separate, unconfirmed reports, that Trump had received some additional information about the situation that ultimately swayed him not to launch the strikes. This includes possible intelligence that portions of Iran’s leadership were infuriated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) decision to shoot down the drone, pointing to potential friction within the country’s various governing bodies over how to respond to American policies . But there is no question that the matter of proportionality would have been a factor in the decision-making process, something The War Zone highlighted during its coverage yesterday of the shootdown and possible reactions to it . The loss of a drone meant that there were no U.S. casualties. So, it would be difficult not to see subsequent U.S. strikes that killed Iranians as an escalation and one that would be highly likely to provoke a response in kind from the regime in Tehran. A B-52 bomber arrives at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in May 2019. These aircraft may have involved in the planned strikes on Iran., USAF In a particularly interesting development, the Iranians themselves have now outlined a similar threshold in their own decision to bring down the BAMS-D. Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the IRGC’s Aerospace Forces, who command that conducted the shootdown, claimed that a manned aircraft had also violated Iran’s airspace at the same time as the drone, but that his forces refrained from destroying it. “With the U.S. drone in the region there was also an American P-8 plane with 35 people on board,” Hajizadeh said, according to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency . “This plane also entered our airspace and we could have shot it down, but we did not.” It is not clear what plane he was referring to exactly. The U.S. Navy’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft does not carry a crew of 35 individuals, but The Washington Post has reported, citing an unnamed U.S. defense official, that a P-8 was flying in the same general area at the time. It seems very possible that Hajizadeh simply misspoke. The presence of the Poseidon would also explain the source of video and images that the Pentagon has subsequently released showing the shootdown that appeared to have been taken by another aircraft. The P-8 also has impressive electronic support measures and electronic intelligence capabilities, which could have helped in identifying the specific weapon the Iranians employed and geo-locating the launch site. Further analysis of the imagery that the U.S. government has released so far also lends more weight to the American position that the BAMS-D was flying in international airspace and came down in international waters. It also indicates that that P-8 was flying slightly closer to the Iranian coastline than the drone, though it was also in international airspace. At the same time, Iran has now displayed parts of the BAMS-D wreckage, seen in the pictures below, which it claims it recovered in Iranian territorial waters, though it has not released any imagery or other details about the retrieval process to support that assertion. Regardless, Hajizadeh was clearly seeking to convey the message that Iran could have killed Americans, but deliberately decided not to, instead choosing to make a statement about the country’s resolve without causing casualties. IRIB screencapture IRIB screencapture IRIB screencapture IRIB screencapture IRIB screencapture Unfortunately, despite Iran and the United States now both having publicly declared that they made choices to avoid military action that could have led to casualties and potentially sparked a larger conflict, there no guarantee the U.S. government might not choose to follow through on a military response in the future. Various assets, including the Leyte Gulf , are reportedly now on alert for a possible new tasking in the next 72 hours, according to Newsweek . It is possible that, as with the Iranians, the revelation that the United States could have struck, but didn’t, could serve as a signal of the U.S. government’s preparedness to act, but actual desire to de-escalate the situation. Initial reports had suggested that Trump had called on Iran to seek a diplomatic avenue to resolving escalating regional tensions, via Oman, or risk an American military response, but that the Iranians rebuffed this offer. A spokesperson for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council subsequently denied that there had been any such backchannel messaging and Trump made no mention of this in his Tweets. Iran’s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has previously publicly rejected any prospect of negotiating with the Trump Administration. Trump himself has publicly said that he favors talks, but that neither side was ready to do so. In his Tweets, Trump also said that he had chosen to implement additional sanctions on Iran over the incident, which was another potential course of action The War Zone had identified yesterday, but the U.S. government has not yet confirmed that this is the case or what those new economic restrictions might cover. The Trump Administration has adopted a policy of “ maximum pressure ” against Iran that has already included various efforts to isolate Tehran diplomatically and economically. The U.S. government’s stated objectives in doing this has been to goad Iran into abandoning a host of policies, including any potential ambitions of developing a nuclear weapon , support for international terrorist and militant groups , and more . Clearly, at least so far, this has not worked out as planned. A spokesman for Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani, has since called upon the United States to ease existing sanctions as the only means to averting a conflict. Whether or not Congress will, or can, take steps to intervene and block potential military action against Iran also remains to be seen. Various legislators have come out in favor of strikes , or other “ measured responses ,” as well as called for caution and restraint , largely along party lines. The revelation that the Trump Administration was prepared to conduct strikes without seeking Congressional approval has also prompted criticism that the President is exceeding his authority. The coming days could be absolutely critical in determining whether the situation continues to escalate or whether Iran and the United States begin finding ways to ease tensions that have been rapidly building for more than a month now. Late on June 20, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration barred U.S.-registered aircraft from flying over the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman due to the potential for sudden developments that might “place commercial flights at risk.” The U.S. military had previously pointed out the potential risks to commercial aviation from Iran’s decision to shoot down the BAMS-D. There are still similar concerns about possible threats to commercial shipping in the region following attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman, including limpet mine attacks on a pair of ships earlier in June. The U.S. government blames Iran for these incidents , as well, though Iran has denied any responsibility. On June 21, 2019, India announced that it would deploy warships to the region to safeguard its shipping interests and the United Kingdom had previously announced it was sending a contingent of Royal Marines to the area to bolster its force protection posture. With U.S. military assets in the region still reportedly poised to strike, it may only be a matter of hours before we will know for sure how the Trump Administration has decided to proceed.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 28, 2019",Recent UFO Encounters With Navy Pilots Occurred Constantly Across Multiple Squadrons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the biggest questions surrounding the most recent known spate of UFO encounters with U.S. Navy pilots—those that occurred off the southeastern seaboard of the United States between 2014 and early 2015—pertains to how persistent they actually were. We know Super Hornet aircrews from Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), the Red Rippers, detected unknown objects multiple times on radar and one aircrew even had a close encounter visually with one of them, but what about the rest of the many Hornet squadrons based at Naval Air Station Oceana, not to mention the E-2 Hawkeye squadrons from nearby NAS Norfolk? We have the answer to this question and it is remarkable. A source with knowledge of the events has made it clear to The War Zone that presence of the mysterious objects in the restricted training airspace off America’s east coast was so pervasive that it was largely common knowledge among local flying units. They noted that the majority of the Super Hornet squadrons equipped with AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars—you can read all about this technology and how it was key in detecting these objects in our exclusive piece on the subject —at the time were having the same experiences, as well as the crews flying the new E-2D Hawkeye with its incredibly powerful AN/APY-9 radar suite. It literally became such a common and near everyday occurrence that Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers from the base would talk about it informally with regularity. The E-2D Hawkeye is one of the most capable aerial surveillance platforms ever created. , Northrop Grumman But that doesn’t mean formal action wasn’t taken. Beyond filing an official safety report after one of the jets almost hit one of the unidentified objects—described eerily as a translucent sphere with a cube structure suspended inside of it—Notices To Airman (NOTAMs) were posted regarding the dangers potentially posed by unknown aerial vehicles flying in the same military operating areas that aircraft from NAS Oceana frequented for training. This action was taken by the base’s command leadership as they couldn’t figure out how else to address the bizarre issue and its perceived threat to their aircrews’ safety. We have since filed Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of these NOTAMs, as well as documents regarding how the decision to file the NOTAMs was made at the command level. Another burning question surrounding these events pertains to whether or not additional visual encounters occurred beyond the one near miss with the Super Hornet and the ‘cube inside an orb’ object. Our source tells us that there were many more , and yes, they all resulted in the exact same description of the object. So, we are talking about a uniform set of very strange looking objects here that were spotted on radar, by infrared targeting pods, and by the naked eye, frequently over 2014 and the first part of 2015 above the waters off America’s southeastern coastline. VFA-11’s color jet pulls in to park at NAS Oceana. , USN As we noted in our last piece on the subject , these encounters dropped off to the point they were described as fleeting and inconclusive at best once VFA-11 and its carrier air wing went on cruise to the Middle East in early Spring of 2015. In addition, we know that the carrier strike group and its aircraft were equipped with key new sensor fusion technologies for that deployment, a fact that is eerily similar to the circumstances surrounding the now famous ‘Tic Tac’ incident nearly a decade earlier. All of which makes these objects’ presence during the time leading up to that deployment that much more curious. Yet at the same time, the fact that the volume of these recent encounters seems much greater and spread over a much larger period of time versus the infamous incident in 2004 is puzzling. And none of this even addresses the very peculiar physical appearance of these objects, but we have another report on that subject that will be filed in the very near future. Still, at least we now have a much better sense of how widespread these encounters were and the cultural impact that they had on the Navy’s east coast master fighter jet base. This also underscores just how taboo this topic was to military aviators. The fact that these types of events could have been so pervasive, yet kept so hushed-up outside of Navy tactical aircraft aircrew circles, is telling in itself and provides good evidence as to why the Navy had to officially change is procedures for its personnel reporting such strange incidents. All this comes as Congress is taking a high-interest in the subject as of late, with multiple briefings being given to key lawmakers with the military’s top witnesses. Whatever the case may be, we are definitely entering into uncharted territory when it comes to this long shunned and abused topic. What exactly that will mean when it comes to actually getting to the truth of the matter remains to be understood.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2019",Everything We Know About Iran’s Claim That It Shot Down A U.S. RQ-4 Global Hawk Drone (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as the U.S. is building international support for its case against Iran and its supposed involvement in attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman and other recent nefarious acts in the region, Iran has announced that they have shot down an American drone. And not just any drone, an RQ-4 Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) spy drone. This is the most advanced unmanned system currently being employed operationally by the Air Force in a non-secretive manner. RQ-4s, which carry a full suite of electro-optical, radar, and electronic intelligence gathering systems spy from on high, often skirt along the edge of territorial boundaries in order to peer into a targeted country from a slant angle, are highly active in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Iran’s IRNA news agency says the drone was shot down when it entered Iran’s airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in Hormozgan province. This stretch of Iranian coastal territory lays near equally on both sides of the Straits of Hormuz. Kouhmobarak sits on the southern approach to the strait, very near where the tanker attacks occurred. Kouhmobarak is located just to the west of where the attacks on tankers occurred. , Google Maps The entire stretch of Hormozgan province is a prime area where American aerial surveillance aircraft—in particular unmanned ones—patrol to update intelligence on Iranian military activities, to monitor communications, and to update the status of Iran’s electronic order of battle—where Iran’s air defenses are and in what state—on a regular basis. Right now, in the aftermath of the tanker attacks, these flights would be absolutely crucial for providing real-time strategic and tactical intelligence, as well as gathering further evidence regarding Iran’s role in the mining of the ships. The U.S. denies that any aircraft had entered Iranian territory, but is keeping mum on if an aircraft was lost. In addition, the RQ-4 flies at upwards of 65,000 feet, so this would have been a sophisticated radar-guided surface-to-air missile that shot the aircraft down, not a shoulder-fired, heat-seeking missile. Iran has plenty of capability in this regard, including an advanced version of Russia’s S-300 system . Firing on an aircraft with this type of weapon would definitely be viewed as an escalation. Alternatively, the aircraft could have been brought down by an Iranian fighter aircraft, but this is less likely. Just before the tankers were struck last week, the U.S. says Iran tried to shoot down a lower-flying MQ-9 Reaper drone with a modified shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile, which did not hit its target. If Iran took down any drone, let alone a Global Hawk, the act lends a huge amount of credit to the claim of an early attack by the Pentagon. There have also been reports that the variant of Global Hawk that was shot down was actually a U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drone. There’s an issue with those reports—to our knowledge, there are no MQ-4Cs in the region. In fact, the MQ-4C is slated to make its very first deployment ever to Guam—which is literally on the other side of the planet—this Summer. This could have changed and it is possible that one deployed in an emergency capacity, but we have no evidence of that as of yet. An MQ-4C Triton., USN Two other possibilities exist outside of the aircraft being an RQ-4, there are also EQ-4s in the region that fly regularly. These are Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) configured aircraft that work exclusively at providing a networking and communications hub capabilities for data-links and radios used by local forces. It is unlikely that this was the aircraft shot down as it wouldn’t need to be loitering off Iran’s coast as it does not have a surveillance mission. An EQ-4 operating in the Middle East. , USAF The other possibility is the RQ-4N BAMS-D (Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator) aircraft that were the experimental precursor to the Navy’s MQ-4C. We are not aware of these aircraft, which live at the Navy’s main aircraft test base at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, being in the region, but it is possible. One of the BAMS-D aircraft., USN Beyond that, it could be a totally different type altogether. Iran has a track record of claiming certain drones were shot down that weren’t. A strategic asset like the RQ-4 would be a serious prize. The loss of an RQ-4 isn’t just an escalation of what could instantly become a bloody shooting war in the region, it also represents a significant technological loss, depending on how intact the aircraft’s components were when they struck the ground. The systems onboard the RQ-4 are highly sensitive in nature and Iran and its friends Russia and China would love to get their hands on even pieces of them. Also, Iran’s push to take down American drones isn’t necessarily new. Iran has tried to molest U.S. drones operating near its airspace in the past. In 2013, a Predator was given an F-22 escort to counter Iran’s hostility to the unmanned aircraft, leading to what became a high profile story in the media about F-22s surprising Iranian fighter pilots. Regardless, if Iran’s claims are even remotely true, and a U.S. drone was swatted down by their hand, the security situation in the airspace off the Iranian coast has just become far more volatile. Will will update this post when more information comes available. UPDATE: 12:50am PDT— We are now getting multiple reports that officials within the Pentagon are confirming that this was an MQ-4C. This means the aircraft secretly deployed to the region. They are also adamant that the loss occurred in international airspace. It’s important to discuss the MQ-4C’s capabilities here in the context of the situation. It is not just a standoff radar, imagery, and electronic intelligence gathering platform optimized for the maritime environment. It uses its MTS electro-optical turret to check targets out in detail by dropping down to lower altitudes and approaching them. In other words, it is meant to fly at lower altitudes as well as higher ones, unlike the Global Hawk. It also has a lower operating altitude than the RQ-4 in general. It has anti-icing systems for penetrating bad weather because of these factors. So there is a chance it may have been operating at medium altitude, or even lower momentarily, depending on its mission profile and what its operators were seeing. This puts it into a larger number of SAM systems engagement envelopes. MQ-4C isn’t just a ‘blue water’ surveillance tool. It can watch areas of interest in the littorals and keep track of an enemy’s actions in a high fidelity manner. It is an amazing system. The closer you get to say a port of interest the better the quality of certain types of intel it can gather. So just staying far away means you are not maximizing the aircraft’s unique capabilities as a multi-intelligence gathering platform. Fusing radar, electronic, and image intel together—all of which the aircraft can provide—over long periods of time is really why its capabilities are so awesome. To get the best out of all three, closer proximity to a target area may be required. So there are tradeoffs when it comes to risk versus reward. Also, if this was indeed an MQ-4C on its first deployment, a secret one, remember it would have been totally new to the Iranians too. They could have been seeing a Global Hawk doing stuff a Global Hawk doesn’t do. This would draw interest and likely targeting priority. UPDATE: 1:37am PDT— Our friend @Aircraftspots has done some awesome work tracking potentially the aircraft in question that would have arrived just five days ago in the Middle East. There is a discrepancy with the serial number and identity of this aircraft. It does not belong to an MQ-4C, it belongs to a BAMS-D demonstrator that we mentioned in the article above. And flying it from NAS Pax River makes perfect sense as that is where they live. The only operational MQ-4C squadron is located at NAS Point Mugu on the other side of the country. So, it looks like DoD officials are likely confused and what was probably lost was a BAMS-D. These airframes were recycled from early Block 10 RQ-4A Global Hawks that the USAF no longer wanted and used for experimental testing and proof of concept work during development for what would become the MQ-4C Triton. You can see the exact aircraft in question here , also it is featured in the text above when we talk about BAMS-D. UPDATE: 2:05pm PDT— Iran’s state-run media says the system used to shoot down the aircraft was the Raad (Thunder) air defense system. It is a road-mobile, medium-range SAM system loosely analogous to Russia’s SA-11 Buk. It has the ability to shoot down aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. Update: 4:28am PDT— We have official confirmation, as we exclusively stated, it was a BAMS-D. UPDATE: 5:22am PDT— Keep in mind, BAMS-D, like the Global Hawk and the MQ-4C to a degree, has a zero penetration mission. It doesn’t fly into contested airspace. It is literally a sitting duck. The only reason it would do so would be if it was off the leash or there was a major navigational malfunction. It is far more likely Iran just shot it out of international airspace as the Pentagon states. UPDATE: 5:40am PDT— Here is the “clear message” the head of Iran’s hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, is saying Iran sent with the shoot-down: “The downing of the American drone was a clear message to America … our borders are Iran’s red line and we will react strongly against any aggression … Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran.” UPDATE: 7:30am PDT— We have our first reaction from President Donald Trump in the form of the very brief Tweet below: Just days ago , Trump had told reporters, with regards to Iran, “We’ll see what happens. Let me just say this: We are very prepared.” UPDATE: 7:50am PDT— Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, told reporters that he had met with the President and that Trump felt “his options are running out.” There are also reporters that the National Security Council led a meeting about the situation and possible responses to it at the White House with senior military leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, but without President Trump. There is another meeting now set to occur with Trump this afternoon. UPDATE: 9:30am PDT— U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Guastella, commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command and the Combined Forces Air Component Commander for U.S. Central Command, has just given a very brief press briefing with additional details about the shootdown and has also provided a map, showing the location where the BAMS-D drone crashed and where the Iranian surface-to-air missile originated. Guastella said that the unmanned aircraft was flying at “high altitude” and was 34 kilometers (approximately 21 miles) from the Iranian coast at the time of the attack and that it fell into international waters. There is no word yet on whether the U.S. miliary has recovered any part of it, but Navy ships are reportedly moving to the area, if they are not there already. A screen capture of a map that the Pentagon has provided showing the approximate locations of the BAMS-D drone and the Iranian surface-to-air missile launch site., DOD screen capture “This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, UAE and Muscat, Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians,” Guastella added. It is worth noting that the distance across the Strait of Hormuz between the UAE and Iran in the area where the shootdown occurred is less than 60 miles. UPDATE: 10:15am PDT— The U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet has now released a video showing the smoke trail from the BAMS-D drone after an Iranian missile struck it. The official caption does not say what other asset filmed the shoot down, but various Navy ships and U.S. military manned and unmanned aircraft have been operating in this particular area in the aftermath of the attacks on the two oil tankers last week. UPDATE: 10:25am PDT— President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters during a press availability at the White House alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has said he believes the shoot down may have been a mistake by Iranian personnel who were “ loose and stupid .” He also added that the United States “will not stand for it.” “I think probably Iran made a mistake – I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down,” he said. “But this is a new wrinkle, a new fly in the ointment what happened, shooting down a drone. And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.” UPDATE: 10:40am PDT— We now also have unconfirmed footage of Iranian personnel firing the Raad (Thunder) missile at the BAMS-D drone. UPDATE: 10:55am PDT— Iran’s semi-official Fars News Agency , has released a video showing Iran’s claimed timeline of events. The video indicates that Iranian forces tracked the BAMS-D drone as it flew from Al Dafra Air Base, through the Strait of Hormuz, and into the Gulf of Oman, all the while in interntional waters, before returning and flying the same basic route back to base. However, the Iranians say that when the drone came near Kouhmobarak, it turned and entered their airspace, prompting the shootdown. It is worth noting that U.S. military manned and unmanned intelligence gathering aircraft routinely fly these over-water routes in international airspace around Iran’s borders and that they are extremely well established. The map below, which dates to 2013, shows one of these routes in the Persian Gulf. USAF via FOIA UPDATE: 11:40am PDT— Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has given precise map coordinates for where Iran says the drone was flying when it targeted it and also claims Iranian forces recovered portions of the unmanned aircraft that landed in the country’s territorial waters.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hours after Iran shot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator drone, or BAMS-D, flying over the Gulf of Oman, the U.S. government is considering “measured responses” to the incident, which it says was an unprovoked attack in international airspace. The United States faces difficult decisions about how exactly to respond and when. Right now, it is around 3:45 AM local time in the region and, if the U.S. military were to launch strikes in retaliation, they could be coming very soon. It has now been close to 24 hours since the shootdown occurred. Iran does not deny destroying the drone, but claims that it had violated the country’s airspace, something the U.S. military categorically denies. The United States has now released two maps, including one showing the drone’s flight path, as well as video footage and stills of the incident. Iran has released similar material in support of its claims. You can find details about everything we’ve been able to determine so far in The War Zone ‘s earlier marathon live coverage of the unfolding story. “The UAV was fired on from Iranian soil. It was in international waters,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told reporters after leaving a briefing for senior members of Congress at the White House on the situation regarding Iran at around 4:30 PM EST. He added that the Trump Administration was looking at unspecified “measured responses.” A map the U.S. military released in the even on June 20, 2019, showing the location of the BAMS-D drone at the time of the shootdown, along with the respective national boundaries of Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. The screencap appears shows the missile heading for the unmanned aircraft., DOD A screen grab of another map the U.S. military released showing the approximate location of the shootdown, as well as the Iranian surface-to-air missile site., DOD The Tweet below, from Iran’s Fars News Agency shows the flight path the BAMS-D drone took according to the Iranian government. This could potentially involve military action. The U.S. military could seek the destroy any number of symbolic targets, including those related to Iran’s air defense network, in retaliation. The specific surface-to-air missile system that Iran used to bring down the Global Hawk, the 3rd Khordad, is road-mobile and could be extremely difficult if not impossible for the United States to strike it specifically. The 3rd Khordad air defense system is a variant of Iran’s Raad , or Thunder, which is itself analogous to the Russian SA-11 Buk . The U.S. government could also seek to launch non-kinetic attacks, such as cyber attacks, against Iran. President Barack Obama’s administration reportedly planned to launch a massive cyber warfare campaign on Iran in the event that the negotiations with the regime in Tehran over its nuclear ambitions failed. Nicknamed Nitro Zeus, this operation could disabled sections of the country’s power grid, as well as air defenses, military command and control centers, and more. The Trump Administration could also choose a combination of diplomatic and economic options aimed at isolating Iran from the international community and global markets. In recent years, the U.S. government has already stepped up its so-called “ maximum pressure ” campaign against the Iranians through increasingly broad sanctions . The question is whether or not something such as sanctions alone would be enough of a statement. There are reports that the White House is divided over how to “reestablish deterrence,” which is to say respond in such a way as to make clear to Iran that these sort of actions will not go unanswered. Finding a truly proportional response that does not simply lead to further escalation could be especially complicated in this case. Iran did shoot down a U.S. military aircraft, but an unmanned one, so there were no casualties. U.S. strikes might cause Iranian casualties, which would be very likely to provoke a new response in kind from Tehran. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, told reporters that he had warned the Administration that it “may bumble into a war” after the White House meeting. He added that the Democratic Party position remains that Trump must get Congressional approval before launching any strike against Iran. “Now I told the President that these conflicts have a way of escalating,” Schumer added. “One of the best ways to avoid bumbling into war, a war that nobody wants, is to have a robust, open debate and for Congress to have a real say.” It is unclear if Trump actually needs Congress to sign off in this case. When the Trump Administration authorized a cruise missile barrage at targets in Syria in April 2018, which it did in response to a chemical weapon attack on innocent civilians in that country, the justification was solely based on the President’s authority to act in the national interest in has the capacity as Commander-In-Chief. “The President could lawfully direct airstrikes on facilities associated with Syria’s chemical-weapons capability because he had reasonably determined that the use of force would be in the national interest and that the anticipated hostilities would not rise to the level of a war in the constitutional sense,” the Justice Department said in a subsequent memo . There remains considerable debate over whether this was an valid legal justification , but it is certainly one that the Administration could readily seek to apply in this particular case. President Trump himself has indicated that he is looking to avoid conflict, but that the shootdown cannot go unanswered. “But this is a new wrinkle, a new fly in the ointment what happened, shooting down a drone. And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you,” he told reporters during a press availability with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who visited the White House earlier on June 20, 2019. “You’ll soon find out,” he said in response to a question later in the day if the United States would strike Iran. The War Zone will definitely be keeping a close eye on the situation in the coming hours. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Navies Q-4 Sea U.S. Navy Unmanned"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2020",The Air Force’s Special Operations PC-12s Finally Have An Official Nickname,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command’s secretive U-28A intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft now have an official nickname, Draco, the Latin word for dragon. These unassuming planes have become an increasingly important component of U.S. counter-terrorism operations around the world since their introduction more than a decade ago. The Air Force announced the plane’s new nickname on June 19, 2019 , but said that the official approval had come the month before. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) first began flying the U-28As, which are militarized variants of the Pilatus PC-12M single-engine turboprop, in 2006. “Over the battlefields of the global war on terror, Draco has come to mean unparalleled special operations intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support, especially to the men and women on the ground in the line of fire,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Chad Anthony, the commander of the 319th Special Operations Squadron, one of the units that flies the U-28A, said in a statement . ‘Aircrew and special operators who have flown and worked with the Pilatus U-28A have known it as Draco since its first combat deployment in June 2006.” The 319th is one of four squadrons that presently fly the U-28A. The others are the 34th, 318th, and 5th Special Operations Squadrons (SOS), the latter of which is an Air Force Reserve unit. At present, the Air Force’s Draco fleet consists of 28 aircraft in total. USAF The push to finally give the U-28A an official nickname dates back to at least the 2010-2012 timeframe, according to the Air Force. “Lieuantent General Eric Fiel, the AFSOC commander at the time, had told us we ought to name the aircraft,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Robert Masaitis, who is presently head of the 492nd Special Operations Training Group, but previously served as the head of the 34th SOS, said . “Between the two, then later three squadron commanders, we could agree that ‘Draco’ was probably the obvious choice,” he continued. “I’m glad to see we’re bringing this initiative to fruition after all this time, as the U-28 has become so much more than the single-engine, non-descript ‘utility’ aircraft we brought into the service over a decade ago.” U-28A morale patch, from: https://t.co/2ZyKkO0wjk pic.twitter.com/2zVWSZXH02 — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) August 16, 2017 The exact intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities of the U-28A are unknown and not all of the aircraft share the same configuration, different iterations of which have appeared over the years. It is known that the majority of the aircraft have a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as signals intelligence systems to geo-locate and monitor hostile communications and other emitters. There are also reports that some of the aircraft may have a synthetic aperture radar imaging capability. A U-28A., USAF In recent years, AFSOC has been upgrading the U-28As to a configuration known publicly only as EQ+. This update includes the addition of new sensor turret with a high-definition, multi-spectral imaging full-motion video camera, which also offers better stand-off range, according to Pentagon budget documents . This allows the aircraft to fly at higher altitudes and otherwise operate further away from its target, reducing risks to the plane’s crew and potentially making it less likely that the subject or subjects of interest would even be aware they’re under surveillance. In addition, despite their diminutive size, the U-28As have an extensive communications and data-sharing suite. This allows them to push the information they gather back to command centers for further exploitation or straight to personnel on the ground, all in near real-time. A U-28A downrange., USAF “We can be right overhead; we don’t even need the satellite,” a U-28A pilot from the 319th SOS, identified only as Captain David, told Military.com in 2018. “We can talk directly to the guys on the ground and provide that good coverage for them.” But perhaps most importantly, the small U-28As are relatively cheap to fly and maintain and can operate from small airports and forward operating bases with limited infrastructure. A standard non-military PC-12 reportedly costs just around $500 per flight hour to operate. “We can provide four hours’ station time, plus an hour there and back, and land using less fuel than it takes a C-130 just to start and taxi to the runway,” Captain David had also told Military.com . Given the worldwide popularity of the PC-12 on the commercial market, the U-28As can also typically keep a lower profile when deployed abroad to support sensitive missions. Some of the planes have even flown with civilian-style paint jobs, rather than the standard AFSOC two-tone gray scheme, in order to be particularly discreet. AFSOC also operates a fleet of C-146A Wolfhound light transport aircraft, militarized Dornier Do 328s, which it refers to as “non-standard” and that wear civilian-style schemes for similar reasons. It also used to fly C-145A Coyotes, a modified version of the PZL M28 Skytruck, in similar roles, but has since shifted these aircaft to units tasked with helping to train and advise friendly foreign air forces and repainted them in the standard gray scheme. You can read more about both of these aircraft in this past War Zone story . The C-145As, C-146As, and U-28As, of course, all have various features that make them stand out as military aircraft to trained observers. Even in a civilian-style paint scheme, the Draco’s underbelly equipment gondola and sensor turret are readily apparent. A C-146A Wolfhound in its distinctive civilian-style paint scheme., USAF Still, the U-28A’s capabilities, together with its low operating cost and discreet nature, have made particularly ideal for supporting small counter-terrorism missions across Africa and in the Pacific region , though they have served in larger conflict zones, such as Afghanistan and Iraq . Specific details about any of these missions remain sparse, but, as of 2018, the entire Draco fleet had amassed some 500,000 flight hours, according to Military.com . A Draco notably crashed as it headed back to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti from an unspecified mission on Feb. 18, 2012, killing all four individuals on board. The Air Force later concluded that spatial disorientation likely led to the mishap. A satellite image from February 2017 showing a U-28A, at top right, at the US military facility in Baledogle, Somalia ., Google Earth The U-28A’s various features and performance have certainly contributed to its longevity in U.S. military service, which has had something of a convoluted history so far.  As noted, the Air Force originally described the aircraft publicly as small “utility” aircraft , despite their intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The service had also purchased a number of commercial PC-12s , not to be confused with the U-28As, for “non-standard” missions alongside the C-145As and C-146As. Further confusing matters, the U.S. military also hired private contractors to fly modified PC-12s with ISR equipment in support of various shadowy missions, especially in Africa . A US Air Force PC-12 in a civilian-style scheme and also carrying a US civil registration code rather than a military serial number., USAF AFSOC had also previously planned to retire them for good between 2014 and 2015 and replace them with MC-12W Liberty aircraft, which are modified twin-engine Beechcraft King Airs. The primary driver in that initial decision was the looming prospect of heavy depot maintenance across the U-28A fleet, which had found themselves flying far more often than the Air Force had expected. In 2013, U-28As began hitting the need for a 20,000 flight hour inspection, which cost $595,000 per aircraft, according to an AFSOC history the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. At that time, the projected cost of 35,000 flight hour inspections, which the Air Force expected the planes to begin needing in 2017, was $1.14 million per plane. A U-28A sits on an airstrip in Niger in 2012. This aircraft notably appears to lack the ventral sensor gondola., Sputniktilt/wikicommons AFSOC felt that the costs, combined with expenses of upgrading the sensors, communications, and data-sharing equipment on the aircraft as time went on, outweighed the capabilities that they provided. However, Congress disagreed , prompting a debate about the U-28A’s future that finally came to a close in 2015. “There was [a] discussion about moving to the Liberty birds,” now-retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Bradley Heithold, then head of AFSOC, said at an Air Force Association event in March 2015 . “That discussion is over.” An Air Force MC-12W., Bill Word The MC-12Ws have since gone to the Air National Guard , where they joined a number of other modified Beechcraft King Air intelligence and surveillance aircraft, known as Javaman , as well as to the U.S. Army . The King Air remains an extremely popular ISR platform and a myriad of other types are in Army service, as well as with U.S. Special Operations Command , and among contractors supporting U.S. military missions overseas. Amid persistently high demand for aerial ISR assets, AFSOC had already decided to begin converting its remaining commercial PC-12s into the U-28A configuration in order to expand the size of the fleet, too. It has been working to bring all of the aircraft up to the EQ+ standard, as well. The newly christened Dracos look set to be monitoring targets of interest and keeping watch over special operations forces around the world for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 13, 2019",Navy Explosives Expert Shows Off Evidence Of Iranian Involvement In Tanker Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States has provided more details about the evidence it has collected that links Iran to the attack on the Kokuka Courageous , one of a number of commercial tankers that have suffered attacks in the Gulf of Oman since the beginning of May . The U.S. military has also dismissed the possibility that a “flying object” such as a rocket or missile hit the ship, saying the damage the ship sustained is consistent with a limpet mine attack. This additional information comes as the United States prepares to send additional forces to the Middle East and amid a spate of rocket attacks against foreign oil companies and military facilities hosting American troops in Iraq that injured at least three people. U.S. Navy Commander Sean Kido, head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 11 (EODMU 11) provided the updates at U.S. government-organized event for journalists in the United Arab Emirates on June 19, 2019. EODMU 11’s main mission is explosive ordnance disposal, including the safe removal of naval mines, but also has the organic capability to conduct related weapons technical intelligence duties to identify the characteristics and origins of recovered explosive devices. The unit is presently assigned to the Navy’s Fifth Fleet’s Commander, Task Group (CTG) 56.1 and is responsible for performing those missions, as well as other combat diving and salvage operations , throughout the Middle East. Reporters inspected physical evidence at an American military facility in the Port of Fujairah, which sits on the Gulf of Oman, and then rode on small Navy boats to see the Kokuka Courageous for themselves. That tanker, along with a second one that suffered a limpet mine attack on June 13, 2019, the Front Altair , are both presently in Fujairah undergoing inspection. The U.S. government also blames Iran for a separate set of attacks on four other tankers right off the coast of the UAE that occurred roughly a month ago and says limpet mines were also involved in those incidents. US Navy patrol boats prepare to take journalists to see the Kokuka Courageous. , AP “The limpet mine that was used in the attack is distinguishable and it’s also strikingly bearing a resemblance to Iranian mines that have already been publicly displayed in Iranian military parades,” Kido told reporters . “There are distinguishing features,” though he reportedly declined to elaborate . The U.S. military has previously handed out a picture of a conical 90-pound limpet mine that a company in Iran, which has ties to the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), produces. A photo of an Iranian-made limpet mine., Fars News Agency U.S. military investigators displayed a circular magnet they had recovered from the Kokuka Courageous ‘s hull, one of a number arranged in a circle that would have held the mine in place. The United States had previously released images of this object, which remained stuck to the ship after Iranian forces arrived to remove an undetonated mine hours after the attack. A magnet from a limpet mine that U.S. military personnel recovered from the side of Kokuka Courageous ‘s hull., AP There was also evidence that nails had helped affix the mine to the ship. Navy personnel in the area the time said that they observed the Iranians using a crowbar to pry the mine off, according to Kido . The Navy officer said that U.S. personnel had found fragments of “aluminum material, as well as a composite material” from the mine that did detonate, too. “We recovered biometric information which can be used to build a criminal case to hold the individual responsible,” Kido added, including a handprint and individual fingerprints. The U.S. military had previously released a photograph showing the handprint on the side of Kokuka Courageous ‘s hull. The handprint on Kokuka Courageous ‘s hull., DOD “The damage at the blast hole is consistent with a limpet mine attack,” Kido continued. “It’s not consistent with an external flying object striking the ship.” This last part directly contradicts statements from Yutaka Katada, president of shipping company Kokuka Sangyo, which owns the Kokuka Courageous , who said last week that the ship’s crew had reported at least one “flying object” hitting the ship. It remains possible that what the sailors saw was the attackers trying and failing to shoot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone with a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile in the lead up to the incident. Kido offered no explanation as to why the U.S. government has not recovered any notable evidence from the Front Altair , despite that ship also being safely in Fujairah now. This second tanker experienced a major fire after the attacks, which took hours to bring under control and may have damaged or destroyed similar evidence to that found on the Kokuka Courageous . The officer did say that the placement of the mines significantly above the waterline indicated that the attackers wanted to damage both of the ships, not sink them. For its part, Iran continues to vociferously deny it had any involvement, despite the mounting evidence pointing to at least complicity in the attacks. To date, no group of any kind has claimed responsibility for the tanker attacks in May or June. Since May, the United States has been warning about the increased risk of attacks from Iran and Iranian proxies, especially against U.S. military personnel, across the region, though that these threats are imminent remains murky . But there have been a series of rocket attacks in Iraq in the past few days, raising concerns about whether this may become a more routine occurrence in that country, at least. On June 17, 2019 , three rockets hit Camp Taji, a base where U.S. and other foreign military forces are training their Iraqi counterparts, but did not reportedly cause any casualties. Another rocket attack on a second facility caused a small fire. It is unclear who the target or targets were, however, with reports that the latter attack seemed to be focused on an Iraqi air defense site. Iraqi troops train at Camp Taji in May 2019 as part of a U.S.-led coalition-sponsored training program., US Army Earlier today , a single rocket hit the Burjesia residential and operations headquarters, which sits west of the city of Basra and is situated within the Zubair and Rumeila oil fields. The facility, which the Iraqi Drilling Company operates, hosts workers from U.S.-headquartered ExxonMobile and six other foreign oil companies. The rocket injured three people, prompting firms to order their personnel to evacuate. More attacks have reportedly occurred since then and there are unconfirmed photographs purporting to show Iraqi security forces securing abandoned improvised rocket launchers. ExxonMobile had reportedly evacuated its personnel from Iraq in May 2019, following the U.S. government decision to order all non-essential diplomatic personnel out of the country and the issuance of a number of serious travel advisories. The oil companies workers are said to have just begun to return . No one has claimed responsibility for any of these attacks, either. An earlier attack on the Green Zone in Baghdad involving a single rocket on May 19, 2019, appeared to be linked to Iranian-backed militias. The U.S. government also blames Iranian-supported groups for similar indirect fire attacks on the U.S. consulate in Basra last year. It is unclear what, if any, impacts these new rocket attacks, especially the one resulting in casualties outside Basra, may have on the overall situation in the region. Despite calls for military action from some members of Congress , President Donald Trump’s administration has remained focused more initially on trying to build a consensus among its allies and partners about Iran’s responsibility for the tanker attacks and other acts of aggression. Some countries, such as Germany, remain unswayed by the evidence the United States has proffered up so far and have called for “ maximum restraint .” “We’ll see what happens,” Trump had told reporters on June 18, 2019. “Let me just say this: We are very prepared.” The day before, the U.S. government announced that it would be deploying an additional 1,000 personnel to the Middle East. Reports said that this force package would include additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, force protection troops, and engineers, similar to other deployments that the United States announced in May. These earlier plans included a squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles, which arrived at Al Dhafra Air Base on June 19, 2019 . “Even this moment right here, communicating to Iran that we are there to deter aggression,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters after meeting with the heads of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command in Florida on June 18, 2019 . “President Trump does not want war, and we will continue to communicate that message, while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.” But Pompeo also made clear that the U.S. government was not about to take sole responsibility for safeguarding the continued flow of maritime commerce in the region, especially through the contentious and strategic Strait of Hormuz . “The United States is prepared to do its part, but every nation that has a deep interest in protecting that shipping lane so that energy can move around the world and support their economies needs to make sure they understand the real threat – the real threat to their interests in the region, and the real threat to their countries’ economies if we’re not successful in doing that,” he said. Some took Pompeo’s remarks to suggest that the United States might be seeking to form an international coalition to escort commercial ships through the region, though the U.S. government has not formally announced any such plan. The United Kingdom, which has also publicly blamed Iran from the attacks on Kokuka Courageous and Front Altair, has also announced plans to deploy a contingent of Royal Marines to the area. Unfortunately, despite the public overtures from all the parties involved about their desire to avoid war, the growing evidence tying Iran to the tanker incidents along with these new rocket attacks in Iraq show that the situation exhibits few signs of de-escalation at this time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 26, 2019",Congressional Meddling Could Begin To Sink The Navy’s Frigate Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The House of Representatives has passed a defense spending bill that includes language that could upend the U.S. Navy’s future frigate program , also known as FFG(X). The bill, which still has to pass in the Senate and receive President Trump’s signature to become law, would withhold all funding for the FFG(X) program if the Navy were to pick a ship design that didn’t incorporate only American-made components in a number of critical subsystems, including its propulsions system and various auxiliary equipment. The service has already warned Congress that this will delay their schedule for buying and fielding the ships by at least a year, might lead to significant cost increases for the program, and would render worthless months of risk-reduction work already done at the cost of tens of millions of dollars on possible designs that will not meet these criteria. Defense News was first to report this potential debacle after obtaining the Navy’s formal response to the House Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Defense, or HAC-D, which is dated June 17, 2019. The House voted 226-203 to a pass a nearly $1 trillion minibus spending package consisting of four different bills, including the defense appropriations one with the frigate program stipulations, on June 19, 2019. Defense News ‘ David Larter was nice enough to share the full text of the Navy’s information paper on Twitter , which includes the specific language in the bill. You can read in full below: DOD The obvious goal is to protect and ensure work for American companies for what is likely to be a lucrative shipbuilding program for years to come. It is worth noting that this provision in the spending bill also affects the TAO Fleet Oiler program. The Navy has already selected a design for that class of ships, which will be known as the John Lewis -class , and says it will not be impacted by this decision. The same cannot be said about FFG(X). As the Navy notes in its paper, the future frigate program has been focused entirely on ships derived from in-production “parent designs,” specifically to keep costs and risks low, as well as to speed up development and acquisition process. For more than a year, the service has been working with a number of shipbuilders to refine their offerings to meet its particular specifications, which you can read about in more detail here . General Dynamics Bath Iron Works has partnered with Spains Navantia to offer a version of the latter’s F100 frigate , while Fincantieri Marine Group is pitching a variant of its Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate, via a U.S.-based subsidiarity. These two established European designs could easily run afoul of the new Congressional requirements. A model of Fincantieri’s FREMM-based design., Joseph Trevithick The Navy says that it has already stipulated FFG(X) designs use a number of foreign-made components, which are already in use on ships it operates now, as another way of helping to keep costs low. The service did not name the other ship classes that use these parts in its information paper. But, with this in mind, it’s not clear if Australian shipbuilder Austal, which has been working on an expanded derivative of its Independence -class Littoral Combat Ship by way of its American subsidiary Austal USA, might also have trouble meeting Congress’s demands. Virtually nothing is known about the ship that Huntington Ingalls Industries has been working on and Lockheed Martin already announced their decision not to compete for the final FFG(X) contract in May 2019. “There are certain several FFG(X) components that would fall into this broad language which are not currently available in the U.S. marketplace (e.g. Auxiliary Propulsion Units and exhaust cooling, etc.) which would result in redesign to obtain equivalent capability with U.S. parts,” the Navy wrote in its information paper. “Finding U.S. suppliers would drive developmental systems into the program as new equipment is engineered and qualified to U.S. standards.” Austal’s FFG(X) design, which is derived from their Independence -class Littoral Combat Ship., Joseph Trevithick The Navy noted that the FFG(X)’s conceptual phase is almost over, that Naval Sea Systems Command has approved a final complete specification for the future frigates, and that many of the shipbuilders that have been under contract already have since made firm decisions about various subsystems. A new requirement to use only U.S.-made components would force them in various cases to have to redesign their ships to accommodate them, which in turn could cause more schedule delays and open the door for additional cost increases and design risks. “The Navy does not agree with the proposed language in the HAC-D bill,” the service had told legislators just days ago in no uncertain terms. “An insertion of change of this magnitude would negate much of the progress achieved during the Conceptual Design phase. This would result in a loss of design maturity and the FFG(X) DD&C [Detail Design and Construction] award will be delayed by a minimum of one year.” An overview of the participants in the FFG(X) Conceptual Design phase. Lockheed Martin has since dropped out of the effort., USN In its response to lawmakers, the Navy underscored that trying to avoid these kinds of developmental delays and risks, and the costs that go along with them, was the entire point of employing the “parent design” strategy, to begin with. The service also pointed out that no other ships would be bound by this restriction, save the John Lewis -class. As already noted, the plan has been for any FFG(X) to use as many components as possible in common with existing Navy ships and the service says the House bill would implicitly prevent them from doing this in a number of cases, including with regards to foreign-made fuel oil purifiers. This, in turn, could lead to additional maintenance and logistical issues by inserting the need for entirely new parts into the supply chain that may not be interchangeable with existing components. This would also limit commonality with ships in service with allied and partner navies that use the same parent design, another potential benefit of the Navy’s present plan, especially for future coalition operations . A rendering of the future USNS John Lewis, the first of a new class of oilers, which Congress also included in its new protectionist provision., General Dynamics-NASSCO At present, the service expects to issue the DD&C request for proposals no later than September 2019 and award the contract in 2020. In January 2019, NAVSEA had also said it would be targeting an average unit cost of $800 million per ship , down from a projected $950 million in 2018. That revised cost target would almost certainly be at risk of the new spending bill’s language become’s law. Of course, it’s not clear whether or not that will happen. The House passed its bill strictly along party lines, with no Republicans voting for it, and a companion bill could run into numerous issues, related or not to the FFG(X) language, in the Republican-controlled Senate. Whether or not President Trump, who has often opposed spending packages approved by his own party, would sign it is another question. On top of that, the separate annual defense policy bill, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2020 Fiscal Year presently includes language that directly contradicts the protectionist provisions in the new spending bill. If both were to become law, it is unclear which would take precedence. Regardless, all of this can only add uncertainty to the FFG(X) program that the Navy can ill afford, especially as it moves closer to releasing the final FFG(X) request for proposals. Hopefully, lawmakers will be able to find a compromise that they feel sufficiently protects U.S. industrial interests, but does not impose painful costs of this extremely important program.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 2, 2018",Marine One Has A Plush New Interior,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We got a rare glimpse of President Donald Trump riding in a VH-3D from the White House to Andrews AFB in George Stephanopoulos’s television special President Trump: 30 Hours that aired last Sunday on ABC. The short clip showed the inside of the aging helicopter sporting a brighter and more modern motif than anything we have seen in the past. It’s clear—Marine One got a major interior makeover. In fact, it looks a lot like the renderings we have posted that show the concept for the VH-92 Marine One replacement helicopter’s interior, both of which look similar to interior found on Trump’s own private 757 jet. The look is dominated by light cream-colored seating surfaces, polished woodgrain, and chrome or nickel plated accents. It isn’t clear if the Trump White House had any role in selecting the decor and design of Marine One’s updated cabin, but it would seem like a remarkable coincidence if not. You can see in this past article of mine all about the interior of Marine One over the years, that up through the Obama years, it was a gray upholstery covered affair with thick blue curtains and a wood-trimmed header structure surrounding the upper part of the cabin edges. It is very much a different look from the clean and more elegant affair seen in the video clip. Obama White House/Pete Souza Obama White House/Pete Souza Even the small handful of photos of Trump aboard Marine One since becoming President show the same interior from the Obama years. So by all indications, this new interior concept is very much that—new. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) Prime Minister Abe and President Trump aboard Marine One., Donald Trump Twitter When I say Marine One, I mean at least one, but probably more like some or even all, of Marine Helicopter Squadron One’s (HMX-1) VH-3D variants of the legendary, and largely retired from military service around the globe, Sikorsky Sea King helicopters . The unit has 11 still in service. The type, along with eight VH-60Ns “White Hawks” that also serve as Marine One, will be pulled from service between 2020 and 2023, with the new Sikorsky VH-92 taking their place entirely. Ongoing contracts have been in place to continue to enhance and sustain the VH-3Ds through their out of service date, which is coming up fast. One has to wonder if installing new interiors in these helicopters just to have them all pulled from service by mid-2022 makes sense. At the same time, it’s largely programmatic funding, and it ensures the aircraft goes out on top. ABC News video screencap We have seen similar upgrades to the C-32A fleet that serve as Air Force Two, getting entirely new interiors and upgraded avionics systems. These aircraft will be replaced in the not too distant future, an initiative that is gaining steam now. Earlier last week, we also saw the VH-92 making some more test landings on the White House’s South Lawn. We were first to publish the first photo of such an operation last year and it’s good to see it get a lot more coverage this time around. Trump, who is very familiar with owning and operating luxury helicopters, privately toured the VH-92 while it was at the White House, as well. The VH-92 really looks great in the role and an award for low-rate production of six airframes was just awarded to Sikorsky . Of course, we couldn’t mention the VH-3D’s swankier interior without bringing up the Air Force One replacement program that the President himself has a direct hand in. Although the exterior paint , capabilities reduction , and the price of the program have gotten all the publicity, Trump wants to change a number of interior features, as well. We are hearing these include a larger executive suite with a dedicated bed—not pull-out sofa-sleepers—and a larger bathroom and dressing area, among other changes to the working areas. This really isn’t an odd ask as these features are now standard on large private jets. I would imagine the interior motif will look similar to what we are seeing with Marine One and his own plane, which is actually pretty tasteful. Hopefully, we will get some better shots of Marine One’s updated interior in the future, but unlike Presidents that came before him, very few if any official high-quality shots of Trump flying on the Presidential helicopter exist in the public domain.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 1, 2022",Russia’s Most Modern Warship And Its Escorts Have Entered The Caribbean Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of Russia’s newest warships, the first-in-class Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov , is sailing in the Caribbean and may be headed toward Cuba. The ship’s presence in the region might incite the ire of the United States, especially if it also makes a visit to a port in Venezuela, where the U.S. government and Russia continue to support competing political factions. Wherever it sails, its impact might be somewhat muted by the fact that the rest of its flotilla consists of three support ships, including a heavy tug that often shadowed the Russian Navy’s accident-prone and now indefinitely out of commission aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov . The Admiral Gorshkov transited from the Eastern Pacific Ocean into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal on June 17, 2019. The Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet says that it expects the first-in-class Project 23120 multi-function logistics ship Elbrus , the medium ocean-going tanker Kama , and the heavy ocean-going tug Nikolay Chiker to all have crossed into the Caribbean by tomorrow, according to an official statement . There is no formal word yet on where the ships are headed. The flotilla has already traveled some 26,000 miles since leaving the Northern Fleet’s main base in Severomorsk in Russia’s far north in February 2019. This included stops in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and Sri Lanka in the India Ocean before visiting China. There the Admiral Gorshkov took part in a major naval parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. The ships also stopped in Ecuador before sailing to the Panama Canal. “It is assumed that in June the ship will carry out tasks in the Caribbean for some time,” an unnamed “informed source” told Russian media outlet Interfax , according to a story on June 18, 2019. “It is expected that he [ Admiral Gorshkov ] will go to one of the ports of Cuba.” But the bigger question is whether or not Russia will send the frigate to Venezuela, where the Kremlin continues to support dictatorial President Nicolas Maduro , who has been in a protracted political standoff with opposition leader Juan Guaido since January 2019. The United States and a significant number of Latin American countries, along with others around the world, have recognized Guaido as the legitimate head of government. Maduro, with substantial support from its own international partners, chiefly Russia and Cuba , has refused to step aside and has brushed off attempts to depose him more forcefully . A picture a Japan Maritime Self Defense Force aircraft took of Admiral Gorshkov sailing in the Western Pacific Ocean in May 2019., JMSDF The crisis continues, though it has largely faded from international headlines. But if Admiral Gorshkov sails into a Venezuelan port it is almost certain to draw a rebuke from the United States and could lead to a new surge in tensions in the region. The U.S. government was strongly criticizing Russian military deployments to the Latin American country even before recognizing Guaido’s authority. It notably responded very angrily to the Russian Air Force’s deployment of two Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bombers, along with various other supporting aircraft and personnel, to Venezuela in December 2018. The Admiral Gorshkov , which only entered service in July 2018, is one of the most advanced ships in the Russian Navy and a stop in Venezuela would be sure to turn heads, especially in the United States. Among its other features, the ship is one of the first to carry the Poliment-Redut air defense system, which consists of the Poliment phased array radar and the Redut surface-to-air missile system, a navalized derivative of the ground-based S-350 . This system only completed state trials weeks before the frigate left on its worldwide cruise. The frigate also has 16 vertical launch cells capable of accommodating the Kalibr land-attack cruise missile. Kalibr is a combat-proven weapon , which gives the ship a real long-range land attack capability. The vertical launch system array can also fire the Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missile. There are plans to integrate the hypersonic Zircon anti-ship missile onto the ships in the future. The ship also has some of the most modern sensors, including additional surface search and fire control radars beyond Poliment phased array, anywhere in the Russian Navy, as well as relatively new electronic warfare suite. It reportedly has the 5P-42 Filin countermeasure system, as well. This consists of multiple high-power strobe lights, as seen in the video below, which are intended to disorient and nauseate enemy personnel and blind and confuse sensors on hostile ships and aircraft, especially at night. https://youtube.com/watch?v=JSoeUQRFq98 But if Admiral Gorshkov , and the rest of its flotilla, go straight to Cuba and makes no other stops in the region, its presence is still unlikely to go unnoticed by the U.S. government. It is the latest example of a larger trend on the part of the Kremlin to reinvigorate its relationship with the regime in Havana and ensure it has a firm base of operations in the United States’ backyard. The multi-purpose logistics ship Elbrus , also seen by a Japanese aircraft sailing with the Admiral Gorshkov in the Western Pacific in May 2019., JMSDF The heavy ocean-going tug Nikolay Chiker. , JMSDF Though the Russian government has been pursuing these policies for the better part of the last decade, the desire to ensure firm relationships with countries in the Western Hemisphere became even more pronounced after 2014, amid international criticism over its seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula and active involvement in a conflict in that country’s eastern Donbass region. The United States and NATO, in particular, subsequently stepped up military activities along Russia’s borders in Europe, which the Kremlin routinely complains about . So, being able to needle the United States in the same way in return has only become more important for Russia. In 2014 , Russian reactivated a Soviet-era listening post on the island. Two years later , the Kremlin announced its intention to re-establish additional military facilities in Cuba. Of course, the Admiral Gorshkov is hardly the first Russian naval vessel to arrive in Cuba in recent years. For example, in 2016 , the Neustrashimyy -class frigate Yaroslav Mudry , along with a tanker, visited Havana. The Vishnya -class spy ship Viktor Leonov is a regular visitor to the island, too. But again, sending the first and so far only Project 22350 frigate is clearly meant to be a demonstration of the latest and greatest the Russian Navy has to offer. It also comes as the U.S. military has been calling attention to increasingly regular Russian naval presence in the Western Hemisphere for years now , though generally with a greater emphasis on submarine activities . In response, the U.S. Navy recently reactivated 2nd Fleet to help better oversee operations along the East Coast of the United States, in the North Atlantic, and the Arctic , while 4th Fleet remains responsible for the Carribean and the South Atlantic. Of course, the complete composition of the flotilla does also underscore the continued difficulties the Russian Navy actually has in truly projecting power far from the country’s shore. Sending three support ships, including the Nikolay Chiker , doesn’t necessarily inspire confidence in Admiral Gorshkov ‘s ability to conduct protracted long-range operations. The tug is one of two the Russian Navy has, which form a class that, for a time, held the world record as the most powerful ships of their type in the world. Nikolay Chiker is far better known for being on call to tow the hapless Admiral Kuznetsov back to port in the event of one of its numerous, and sometimes deadly, at-sea accidents and breakdowns. The aircraft carrier is now indefinitely after the only floating dry dock capable of accommodating it sunk in an accident last year. The Kremlin now plans to put together multiple smaller floating dry docks to try to finish a major overhaul of the carrier and get it back to the fleet. But, so far, after tens of thousands of miles of sailing, Admiral Gorshkov has escaped needing the tug’s services. We don’t know for sure why Nikolay Chiker is part of the flotilla and it may simply be accompanying the frigate out of an abundance of caution given how new it is still. Whatever happens, we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on Admiral Gorshkov ‘s progress in the Caribbean in the coming days and weeks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Northrop And Raytheon Have Been Secretly Working On Scramjet Powered Hypersonic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman and Raytheon have revealed that they have been working together on a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile, which uses an engine that is entirely 3D-printed. Their design is competing against one from Lockheed Martin under the Defense Advanced Research Project’s Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept program, or HAWC. The two companies publicly announced their partnership at the 2019 Paris Air Show on June 18, 2019 , but they have been working together secretly for years on HAWC, according to Aviation Week . DARPA began the HAWC program in 2014, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). “We have a flight test planned for the near future where we will begin flying this particular class of weapon system,” Tom Bussing, the Vice President of Raytheon’s advanced missile system division, told reporters in Paris. “This weapon is fundamentally game-changing. There’s nothing like it.” Raytheon had revealed concept art of the missile ahead of the Paris Air Show. From what we can see so far, the design has a relatively typical layout for this weapon concept, with a rocket booster attached to the rear of the main scramjet-powered weapon. The booster motor will accelerate the missile to near hypersonic speed in order for the scramjet to work properly, before falling away. Concept art of Northrop Grumman and Raytheon’s HAWC design, at right, along with an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design. Raytheon had submitted a bid to build this kind of hypersonic vehicle for DARPA’s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program, as well as one for the US Air Force’s Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) program, but lost out to Lockheed Martin in both cases. , Raytheon The two partners offered few details about the scramjet itself, but said that it leveraged their decades of combined experience in hypersonics. This includes the development of the scramjet-powered X-43A hypersonic test vehicle for NASA. General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL), then part of Allied Aerospace, built the engine for this craft in the 1990s. In 2003, Alliant Techsystems (ATK) bought GASL. In 2015, ATK merged with Orbital Sciences Corporation, which had also worked on the X-43A program, to form Orbital ATK. In 2018, Northrop Grumman purchased Orbital ATK, renaming it Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, the division of the company that is now working with Raytheon on HAWC. The X-43A remains the fastest jet-powered air vehicle to date after it hit a top speed of Mach 9.6 – approximately 7,000 miles per hour – during a flight test in 2004. But John Wilcox, Northrop Grumman’s Vice President of Advanced Weapons and Technology, said that the new engine was multiple generations ahead of the one developed for the X-43A. He also said that the company had built the scramjet entirely using advanced additive manufacturing processes, commonly known as 3D printing, which helped reduce the design’s total weight. It is reportedly half the weight of the scramjet Boeing developed for its experimental X-51A Waverider more than a decade ago. Finding ways to keep the overall size and weight down is important for HAWC, which is meant to be a relatively small hypersonic weapon that even a fighter jet-sized aircraft might be able to carry. The X-43A weighed 3,000 pounds and required a modified B-52 bomber to lift it. As for the overall design of Northrop Grumman and Raytheon’s missile, like the X-51A, it is also a “waverider” design, which “skips” on top of the shockwaves produced during high-speed flight to produce additional lift. The main missile has a contoured nose that hides its inlet, the design of which is classified, according to Aviation Week . Ensuring proper airflow into the scramjet engine at extremely high speed, while also keep drag to a minimum is a complex task. Boeing’s X-51A Waverider., USAF The shrouded inlet could also offer stealthy characteristics, making the missile even more difficult to spot. The extreme speed and atmospheric flight profiles of hypersonic weapons, together with their maneuverability, already make hypersonic weapons, in general, difficult, if not impossible to spot, track, and intercept. This makes them ideal for penetrating through heavy air defenses to execute short- or no-notice strikes against time-sensitive targets or otherwise critical targets. A powered design, such as the one that Northrop Grumman and Raytheon are working on now, would potentially have unique performance over the unpowered boost-glide vehicles , another common type of hypersonic weapon, as well. You can read more about the game-changing capabilities of both powered and unpowered designs in a past War Zone feature here . It’s also important to note that DARPA and the Air Force have described HAWC as some of a technology demonstration that would lead into the development of a more refined hypersonic cruise missile. So, it is unclear when the missile, or a follow-on design, might actually become operational. An overview of the HAWC program., DARPA A first flight would certainly be an important step in that direction. While Raytheon’s Bussing did not say specifically when the first flight of their design would occur, in its most recent budget request, DARPA said HAWC flight testing was set to begin in the 2020 Fiscal Year, which starts on Oct. 1, 2019. It is possible that the program, or Northrop Grumman and Raytheon’s particular design, is moving ahead of schedule. HAWC program schedule details from DARPA’s Fiscal Year 2020 budget request., DOD “We’re on track for both to have flights … before the calendar year ends,” Dr. Steven Walker, head of DARPA, told reporters on May 1, 2019 , referring to HAWC and a second hypersonic weapons program known as Tactical Boost Glide (TBG). But when “you actually get into the building of these things and qualifying the hardware, … things tend to slip,” he added. There is a real push throughout the U.S. military to move quickly to both develop and actually field hypersonic weapons for air-launched , as well as sea- and ground-based applications . Just last week, the Air Force revealed that it had conducted the first captive-carry flight test of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon , or ARRW, which is an air-launched unpowered boost-glide vehicle design. Hypersonic developments among potential opponents, especially Russia , have been driving the United States to speed up its own work in this space. China is also actively pursuing hypersonic weapons . Work on advanced scramjets could also support the development of hypersonic manned or unmanned aircraft down the road. DARPA is separately working on a hybrid engine that combines the features of a traditional jet turbine with that of a ramjet or scramjet under the Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program. This configuration, also known as a turbine-based combined-cycle propulsion (TBCC) arrangement, would allow an aircraft to accelerate from a standing start to hypersonic speeds and then slow back down, making it more practical for regular use using conventional runways. Orbital ATK, and now Northrop Grumman, is working on the AFRE effort. There are other similar developments publicly the works elsewhere, as well, including Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design division’s SR-72 hypersonic plane concept , and that’s to say nothing of other projects that might be in progress in the classified realm . All told, the exciting and potentially revolutionary work within the U.S. military on hypersonic weapons seems to be moving ahead at its own increasingly feverish clip. Northrop Grumman and Raytheon’s flight test of their HAWC design, likely to come within the next six months, will be another important step forward in these developments.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Draken International, the adversary support contractor with the world’s largest private tactical jet air force, is working hard to bring their fleet of 22 ex-Spanish Air Force Mirage F-1M fighters to life. They will serve as the backbone of the firm’s so called ‘fourth generation’ fighter threat emulation capability, with features that primarily include a capable air-to-air radar and supersonic performance. Draken aims for the planes to fulfill the ever expanding demand for advanced private adversary support , both at home in the U.S. and abroad. The awesome photo of the F-1’s glowing cockpit was taken by our friend and top aviation photog, José “Fuji” Ramos , who is a Visual Media Consultant for Draken International. Being brought on in such a role with the firm isn’t all that surprising as Fuji has deep roots in the Naval Aviation community.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 16, 2019","Kim Jong Un’s Praetorian Guards Are Really A 100,000 Man Personal Army","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There seems to be a real fascination with Kim Jong Un’s security and how exactly he goes about his business while paranoid of assassination attempts and decapitation strikes from afar and from potential competition within his own circle of power. It turns out that Kim doesn’t just have a Secret Service-like agency tasked with his protection. He has his own 100,000 man army with a stove-pipe command structure that reports directly to him. This elite unit is known as Guard Command. Kim’s personal protection unit, which is made up of the best that Guard Command has to offer, usually melts into the shadows during his appearances. But recently, members of a select offshoot of this special outfit have become something of an international sensation, as they have appeared running in unison alongside the Supreme Leader’s Mercedes Pullman Guard armored Limousine on multiple high-profile occasions . https://youtube.com/watch?v=jvDva0ro2WA This human phalanx of fit North Korean commandos dressed in tailored business suits with earphone pigtails dangling from their heads definitely appears to mean business when it comes to defending their principal, but they also serve a major propaganda tool. The spectacle visually highlights Kim’s near-sacred importance and the might of his sprawling security apparatus. Back home, Guard Command serves to protect the ruling family’s interests throughout the country and includes a range of capabilities, as well as a large assortment of equipment used to carry out its unique missions. In the fabulous research document North Korea House Of Cards: Leadership Dynamics Under Kim Jong Un , the Committee For Human Rights In North Korea describes Guard Command as such: The GC (Ho-wi Sa-ryeong-bu), which is also referred to as the Bodyguard Command, is responsible for the safety and welfare of Kim Jong-un, his family, and senior North Korean officials. Its origins begin in 1946, when elements of the 90th Training Command were made responsible for providing security for North Korea’s emerging leadership. It has been restructured several times. Since the 1990s, it has been growing in importance as the center of the regime’s Praetorian Guard. The GC numbers close to 100,000 personnel dispersed across the country in a number of battalions, regiments, and brigades. In addition to providing for the personal security of Kim Jong-un and other high-ranking officials, it conducts surveillance on high-ranking political and military officials. It also shares responsibility for the defense of the capital with the Pyongyang Defense Command and the Pyongyang Anti-Aircraft Artillery Command. Located in Puksae-dong, Moranbong District, Pyongyang, the corps-sized GC is equipped with tanks, artillery, and missiles. It has several combat brigades stationed at the Kim family’s residences and other critical facilities throughout the country. Various subunits within the GC’s structure execute a wide variety of roles. These include maintaining and guarding the Kim family’s palaces and shrines, controlling access to the Capital via checkpoints, providing medical care not available to any other North Korean in order to prolong the “Dear Leader’s” life, and protecting other North Korean elites. A logistics group supports all these endeavors in a traditional sense but also procures the luxury items and consumables only available to the Kim family and the regime’s top power brokers. One unit, the Rapid Response Force, is made up of a couple thousand hardened soldiers with a fleet of armored personnel carriers and heavy weaponry who are dispersed throughout Pyongyang. Their sole responsibility is to counter a coup attempt at a moment’s notice, by grabbing and holding strategic command and control and information facilities to ensure that the regime is not successfully overturned. Another unit focuses on communications and is likely the force that would convey Kim’s nuclear weapons release commands if they were issued. It is described by North Korea Leadership Watch as such: The Guard Command’s Security Department manages and monitors all telephone and Internet communications by members of the DPRK leadership. One section of the Security Department is tasked with meeting KCI’s communication needs (telephone, fax, Intra/Internet) to issue instructions and orders. In cooperation with the Ministry of People’s Security, the Guard Command’s Security Department also manages the personnel and technical maintenance of hardwired telephone and fax lines used by senior government, party and military leadership in Pyongyang and provincial capitals. The Second Guard Department of the Guard Command works to protect Kim and his family directly and has some of the most capable troops in the entire order. They work directly with an even more select group of bodyguards that are part of the so-called Office Number Six, to coordinate Kim’s personal protection operations. CHFRINK report Office Number Six is made up of highly experienced GC operatives with at least a decade of dedicated service and provides the innermost protective circle around Kim Jong Un. They also provide a key administrative function—planning and executing the Supreme Leader’s events and travel arrangements. The CFHRINK report describes this shadowy unit in detail: The Office of Adjutants (Office 6) coordinates the protection of the Supreme Leader. It presumably liaises with the Guard Command and other elements of the internal security apparatus. Adjutants from this office accompany Kim Jong-un on his guidance inspections. According to one source, the adjutants form the inner circle of security around the Supreme Leader and are the only people allowed to carry guns in his presence. Under Kim Jong-il, this office had approximately 1,200 officers and soldiers, the size of a KPA battalion. … Office 6, which reports directly to Kim Jong-un’s Personal Secretariat through the GC, takes the lead in all of Kim Jong-un’s public appearances. It is responsible for the protection of the Supreme Leader at the closest range. As such, it provides security inside the first two layers of security in a seven-layer cordon every time the Supreme Leader travels outside of his Party headquarters or one of his residences. In addition to providing physical security, which is the responsibility of the Bodyguard Department, Office 6 has a number of other functions. The Plans Department coordinates the Supreme Leader’s events in terms of the list of participants and the operational aspects of the protection plan. An editorial bureau attached to Office 6 is responsible for how the images and news of the Supreme Leader are crafted by North Korean media. Here is a chart showing how Kim’s security is organized for events: CHFRINK report In some ways, this arrangement is somewhat analogous to America’s Secret Service Uniform Division and the President’s Protection Detail, but in North Korea, the whole operation is highly militarized and operates on a much grander scale. Kim’s guards have been seen wearing various military garb and carrying different weapons, but it is rare they make it into official photos released by the tightly controlled North Korean media. , North Korean State Media The SSD, or State Security Department, that is mentioned in the organizational chart above, doesn’t have to do with Kim’s personal protection primarily, but considering we are talking about the North Korean police state, their involvement in Kim’s travel planning and protection during visits is worth noting. The CHFRINK report states: SSD carries out a wide range of counterintelligence and internal security functions normally associated with the secret police. It is responsible for finding anti-state criminals—those accused of anti-government and dissident activities, economic crimes, and disloyalty to the political leadership. In addition, it runs political prisons and has counter-intelligence and intelligence collection responsibilities. It monitors political attitudes and maintains surveillance on people who have returned from foreign countries. Department personnel escort high-ranking officials, guard national borders, and monitor international entry points. The degree of fear it instills in the political security bureaus of the KPA, which have representatives at all levels of command, is uncertain. However, it occasionally takes actions against members of the elite. The MPS, or Ministry of People Security, acts as the state police in North Korea, so their involvement with Kim’s movements doesn’t need explanation. Guard Command supposedly goes to North Korean highs schools to find the best specimens to fill out its ranks. According to defector Lee Young Kuk who was the personal bodyguard for Kim Jong Il for over a decade, well-proportioned bodies and the lack of scars are desirable features for candidates, and they must come from families with impeccable loyalty to the party dating back multiple generations. Training, which lasts years, includes smashing granite slabs on your chest with a sledgehammer, breaking light bulbs with a single finger, and crushing tiles with your head, as well as a lot of fairly brutal martial arts. CNN did an interview with Lee Yong Kuk, it stated: Lee says he went through very similar training before he was considered fit to protect a leader. “It’s tough training,” says Lee. “But why do it? It’s to build up loyalty. A handgun won’t win a war and taekwondo serves nothing but the spirit, but it creates loyalty.” His training also involved more traditional methods. Target practice, physical, tactical and weight training, swimming and using a boat. But that’s only part of the preparation. A large part of the training, he claims, is ideological brainwashing. Lee says he was trained to believe Kim Jong Il was a god — and that the only reason he was born was to serve and protect the “Dear Leader.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=WKR_gC_yBPU Lee noted that even with all his power, Kim Jong Il was an uneven and violent man that was struck with fear at all times: He recalls “two faces” to the man, describing him as someone who could give out gold when he was happy, and death sentences when he was not. “When Kim Jong Il would arrive in his vehicle, 60- to 70-year old advisors would run away and throw themselves onto the grass. They had dust on their clothes but they wanted to hide from him,” says Lee. “They are scared because even when he was happy he would be rude and could chop off their heads. “He remembers a senior official who once used Kim Jong Il’s private elevator and ashtray. When Kim found out, he sent him to a concentration camp, where the man died. But his successor, the man now negotiating on equal footing with the U.S., is even more brutal according to the veteran bodyguard: Lee knew the North Korean leader was cruel when he was serving him. But, he says, it was only after he escaped to South Korea, his new home, that he realized Kim was a true dictator, as his father Kim Il Sung had been before him, and his son and current leader Kim Jong Un is now. But he is worried that Kim Jong Un may be the worst of all. “Kim Jong Un ended up killing his uncle, who even Kim Jong Il could not kill,” said Lee. “As power was handed down to the third generation, it became crueler. Kim Jong Un has created loyalty, but it is fake and based on fear.” Regardless of who in the Kim family is crueler, the massive security apparatus surrounding the top echelons of the regime is a manifestation of what it takes to sustain a reclusive military dictatorship with a royal-like family at its pinnacle. And all of it costs gobs of money, which could be used to satisfy the basic needs of North Koreans, namely clean water, consistent electricity, and especially a steady diet of basic nutrition. Yet considering the closed society they come from, one in which the common man must be an idolator of the Kim family and the party they rule, as well as their extreme training, indoctrination, and not lack of distractions, North Korea’s top bodyguards are no laughing matter and their dedication is likely among the most extreme on the planet. Guard Command’s workload and repertoire seems to be on the precipice of a drastic expansion as Kim Jong Un’s profile rises on the world stage. Just the idea of a “Young General” that travels outside of North Korea’s own borders is a new concept , at least in the years since Kim Jong Un rose to power, and his father wasn’t much of a globetrotter either as he hated to fly. But the unit was behind the impressive logistics ballet that brought the young ruler to Singapore for the historic, albeit hollow, summit with the American President. With all this in mind, we are likely to be seeing a lot more of the General Guard and Office Number Six’s ‘unique’ capabilities, and they may even be descending onto Washington, D.C . in the not so distant future. While the Secret Service may be the best-known head of state protective unit in the world, and the Pope’s Swiss Guard is certainly the most colorful, Kim Jong Un’s force is by far the most expansive.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",The B-52 Looks Set To Become The USAF’s Hypersonic Weapons Truck Of Choice,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though the U.S. Air Force plans to keep its B-52H Stratofortresses in front line service through at least 2050 , its clear that the aircraft are becoming more vulnerable to increasingly advanced air defense networks and would have to rely heavily on long-range stand-off weapons during any potential high-end conflict. At the same time, the iconic bombers look set to get a new lease on life as the service’s principle platform for a slew of air-launched hypersonic weapons , a role that they are better suited to fill than any other existing American combat aircraft. Earlier in August 2018, U.S. Air Force Colonel Lance Reynolds, the Program Manager for B-1 and B-52 Systems, briefed industry representatives on the status of both bombers during a meeting at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. The B-1 and B-52 Systems division is part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Bomber Development Branch, which is located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. Reynolds’ presentation says that between the 2016 and 2022 fiscal years, the Air Force will conduct demonstrations of no less than seven different weapon systems, including various nuclear-capable strategic types, on the B-52, also known affectionately as the BUFF, for Big Ugly Fat Fellow. Of these, four are in-development hypersonic weapons. Broadly speaking, hypersonic weapons encompass unpowered and powered vehicles that fly at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. The Air Force plans to test the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) vehicle, which the service has been working together on with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), on the B-52 first. In its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, DARPA said that it was planning to conduct the first flight test of the TBG some time in that time frame, which begins on Oct. 1, 2018, and ends on Sept. 30, 2019. The goal is to have an operationally representative prototype by 2023. A slide from US Air Force Colonel Lance Reynolds’ briefing showing various B-52H-related developments and potential future upgrades as of July 2018., USAF In development since 2014, the TBG is unpowered and will use a rocket booster to accelerate the vehicle to both a high speed and altitude. It will then come screaming back down toward its target at approximately Mach 20. For this to work, the weapon will need to get the boost glide vehicle at least near the edge of space, if not briefly put it into orbit, and the final design could turn out to be an air-launched ballistic missile or something very similar in concept. The Air Force is also working with DARPA on an air-breathing hypersonic missile known as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC). A flight test demonstration of that weapon on the B-52 is supposed to occur before the end of the 2020 fiscal year, according to Colonel Reynolds’ briefing. HAWC will use a rocket booster to get the missile up to speed, at which point an air-breathing high-speed scramjet engine will take over, keeping the vehicle going at between Mach 5 and 10 . The video below from Lockheed Martin in 2015 shows concept art for the TBG vehicle at around the 3:38 mark in the runtime. It’s not clear if either TBG or HAWC, collectively referred to as the High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW) program, will ever lead to operational weapons or if these designs will serve more a test beds for further developments . The Air Force already plans to leverage work on the TBG project to support its own Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, which is pronounced “arrow.” Lockheed Martin has also been leading the work on both the TBG and HAWC. That same company has, unsurprisingly now secured the contracts to develop both the ARRW and a new air-breathing design called the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon , or HCSW, which you’re supposed to pronounce as “hacksaw.” A slide from a separate US Air Force briefing in 2017 describing the High Speed Strike Weapon program, which encompasses the Tactical Boost Glide and Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept efforts., USAF ARRW, which has also now received the designation AGM-183A, will be an unpowered, air-launched boost glide type vehicle with the same basic characteristics as the TGB. The Air Force hopes ARRW’s first flight will occur in 2021 . That same year, the service wants a conduct the first test launch of the HCSW. As with TBG and ARRW, the limited publicly available information about this vehicle’s characteristics describes a system that is very similar to HAWC. Though HCSW’s name implies that it will be conventional, it is possible that ARRW may be nuclear-capable. Colonel Reynolds’ presentation mentioned work on integrating a “special weapon” – a long-standing euphemism for nuclear weapons – onto the B-52 between Fiscal Year 2016 and 2021. This could also be a reference to the more traditional Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) cruise missile, which will be able to carry a nuclear warhead. You can read all about that new weapon here . An underwing pylon loaded with AGM-86 air-launched cruise missiles sits in front of a B-52H bomber. The Air Force expects the LRSO will replace the AGM-86 when it enters service., USAF Even just adding the ARRW and HCSW to the B-52’s arsenal would be significant developments. We at The War Zone have explored in depth why hypersonic weapons are so important on multiple occasions in the past. These vehicles have raw speed and inter atmospheric flight profiles that alone make them largely immune to enemy defenses. A weapon system that flies at a mile per second across a distance of 1,000 miles significantly reduces the time in the kill chain from when the U.S. military identifies the target to when it actually strikes it. For an opponent, this translates to a far shorter amount of time in which to spot the incoming threat and decide to either try and shoot it down or evacuate critical assets and personnel from a particular site. Nuclear- or conventionally-armed hypersonic vehicles therefore offer a game-changing option for conducting strikes with little warning against time-sensitive and other critical targets. The extreme speed and range of hypersonic weapons also makes them especially applicable to non-stealthy launch platforms, such as the B-52s, since it would allow the bombers to remain far away from enemy air defenses when launching the weapons. In addition, the BUFF already has an established capability to carry oversize payloads over long ranges and each bomber, depending on the size of the Air Force’s future ARRW and HCSW designs, could offer a significantly greater volume of fire over other available launch platforms. The B-52s could potentially hit targets deeper inside hostile territory by flying right to the edge of those defensive networks, as well. Bombers in general also offer the added flexibility of being able to remain on airborne alert near a certain region, acting as a potential deterrent to an outright conflict, and are easier to recall if necessary to de-escalate a situation. This also helps explain why the Air Force plans to keep the BUFFs in service until 2050, even as the service plans to retire the B-1 bomber and continues procurement of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . Combined with new fuel-efficient engines and other upgrades to the B-52’s conventional weapon and data sharing capabilities , sensors and defense systems , will be an especially cost effective launch platform for deploying these weapons. This may also explain why the service is looking to buy all-new under wing pylons for the BUFFs that can carry individual payloads weighing up to 20,000 pounds. It has already used B-52s to test various experimental hypersonic vehicles in the past, as has NASA. An upgraded B-52J would probably be one of, if not the best possible choice for the hypersonics mission, while still retaining the ability to readily perform other conventional and strategic roles as necessary. Of course, the bombers will just be one part of the hypersonic weapon picture, as the U.S. military as a whole is looking to increase its capabilities in this regard in the face of similar developments in both Russia and China, the United States’ most likely near-peer opponents. Earlier in August 2018, China announced that it had successfully test launched a new, air-breathing hypersonic vehicle, called the Starry Sky 2 , which reportedly reached a top speed of approximately Mach 6. This vehicle uses its own supersonic shockwaves to generate lift and stay airborne and is similar sounding, at least conceptually, to the U.S. Air Force’s X-51A Waverider . In March 2018, Russia said that it was suspending work on a new intercontinental ballistic missile to focus on developing its Avangard nuclear-capable hypersonic boost glide vehicle. The Kremlin has already put the Kinzhal , an air-launched variant of its Iskander quasi-ballistic missile, into service and claims that it is capable of hypersonic speeds. Colonel Reynolds’ industry day briefing also noted the continued work on the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy-X (MALD-X), which the U.S. Air Force and Navy are working on together under the auspices of the Pentagon’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office . MALD-X isn’t a kinetic weapon, at least not yet, but is instead capable of launching electronic warfare attacks against hostile air defenses and otherwise confusing them. That program recently finished up a flight test program and you can read about that novel air-launched system in more detail here . Existing and future upgrade programs already looked set to ensure the B-52 would continue to be an important tool for the U.S. military in number of different capacities . Adding weapons such as ARRW and HCSW to the mix will make the bombers indispensable in future conflicts, especially as this hypersonics continue to take center stage.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2019",Air Force Museum Condition Unknown As Wright Patterson AFB Says 150 Homes Hit By Tornado (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A tornado and other associated severe weather tore through the Dayton, Ohio area overnight, which is home to the U.S. Air Force’s Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, damaging dozens of houses in one of the base’s residential areas. There is no word yet on any damage, or the extent thereof, to other parts of the base, which is home to Air Force Materiel Command, the 445th Airlift Wing and its C-17 transport aircraft, the Air Force Research Laboratory, the National Museum of the Air Force, and much more. The first reports that a tornado might have touched down on or near Wright-Patterson began to emerge around 11:15 PM local time on May 27, 2019. As The War Zone noted initially , the storm in the Dayton area was part of a larger weather system throughout the midwest, which ultimately generated dozens of tornados across multiple states, including six in Ohio . The damage to communities near Dayton was reportedly among the most severe , with the tornado, along with driving rain, generally high winds, and large hailstones leaving thousands now left without power . Thankfully, there are no reports of any fatalities at present and there have only been a small number of minor injuries. The Air Force has so far only disclosed that approximately 150 homes within the base’s Prairies at Wright Field housing area suffered damage and causing one minor injury. The base’s public affairs office released the images below: USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF The Air Force also released the following official statement regarding the damage at Prairies at Wright Field: “Approximately 150 homes in the Prairies at Wright Field housing area were damaged, some significantly, during the storm that passed through the Dayton area late on May 27. “There has been one minor injury reported at this time.  Base emergency response crews are expected to continue damage assessments throughout the day.  More damage reports are expected as light improves and personnel report to duty. “The Prairies Child Development Center and Youth Center will be closed May 28.  Crews will assess damage to those facilities to determine when they can reopen. “Damage to facilities on Area A and Area B appears to be minimal at this time.  The base will be open for normal duty operations.  Any personnel adversely impacted by the storm and unable to report for duty should contact their individual supervisor, first sergeant or commander. “Personnel who live in base housing and sustained personal property damage as a result of the storm may be able to file a claim with the Air Force after first filing a claim with your renters or vehicle insurance.  Ensure you document the damage to substantiate your potential claim.  For further information contact the Base Legal Office at (937) 257-6142.” Though the base remains open, it is unclear if any other areas suffered significant damage, as well. The tornado reportedly hit the National Museum of the Air Force, which is situated roughly a mile and a half southwest of the main base. On May 28, 2019, the Museum announced that the Early Years Gallery , which has displays covering the beginnings of U.S. military aviation, including a reproduction of a Wright Brothers 1909 Military Flyer , the first heavier-than-air military flying machine ever, would be closed for repairs. Hopefully, the total damage to Wright-Patterson will turn out to be relatively minor. The Air Force is still recovering from two other serious weather-related disasters. In October 2018, Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, while flooding earlier this year left half of Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska temporarily underwater . The service is already asking for billions of dollars in emergency funding for repair efforts and it expects that it will take years to complete that work. There is another good indication that the majority of the base escaped the weather largely unharmed. Russia’s Tu-154M-ON Open Skies aircraft left Moscow earlier on May 28, 2019, and is headed to Wright-Patterson. From there, it will fly a number of surveillance missions over the United States under the Open Skies Treaty , which you can read about in more detail here and here . The storms do not appear to have upset those plans. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 2:05pm EST— The National Museum of the Air Force has now confirmed that it did suffer minor damage in the storm, but has also said that no aircraft or artifacts were damaged, according to Military.com reporter Oriana Pawlyk.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2018",NASA Captured Two Jets’ Supersonic Shockwaves Merging By Applying New Tech To An Old Idea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has used an upgraded aerial camera system to take the first air-to-air picture of the supersonic shockwaves from two different planes interacting with each other. NASA will use this same system to gather data to support the development of the experimental X-59A Quiet Supersonic Transport , or QueSST, and for future research into aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound. NASA released the image, and others from the same series of tests using the new airborne camera system, on Mar. 5, 2019 . A Beechcraft B-200 King Air carrying the improved imagery equipment had taken the shots of two T-38 Talon jet trainer aircraft as part of the fourth phase of the Air-to-Air Background Oriented Schlieren program, or AirBOS . The planes had flown the missions from the Armstrong Flight Research Center, which is situated within Edwards Air Force Base in California. “I am ecstatic about how these images turned out,” a J.T. Heineck, a scientist working on the AirBOS program out of NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, said in an official interview . “With this upgraded system, we have, by an order of magnitude, improved both the speed and quality of our imagery from previous research.” NASA’s new camera system uses the so-called “ Schlieren technique ,” which is hardly new. German physicist August Toepler first came up with the concept in 1864. At its most basic, the concept involves using a high intensity light source and high quality lenses or mirrors to capture reflected light particles that end up disturbing “fluids” – including air – as a fast-moving object passes through them. The video below offers a more detailed explanation. One of the applications of this kind of photograph has been to capture supersonic shockwaves to better understand how they form and then interact with an aircraft and their surroundings. To do this requires a plane carrying the camera to fly in a very specific position at exactly the right moment as another one goes screaming by faster than the speed of sound. The product of more than a decade of research and development, the cameras NASA used in these latest flights is higher fidelity and can capture images faster, making it easier to grab a shot a the desired moment. The new system can also capture three times more data than previous types. It only takes a day to install the cameras in the B-200, rather than a week or more with either earlier systems, reducing the time it takes to schedule flying experiments. Two of NASA’s Beechcraft B-200 King Air aircraft, including N7NA, which had gondola underneath the fuselage for oversized sensors and instruments., NASA But even then the process isn’t exactly simple, especially if you’re trying to capture pictures within the relatively short window as the planes go from transonic to supersonic speed. Being able to grab a photo of two planes flying in formation close together is even more complicated and air-to-air photography can already be complex , in general. NASA says that getting the image of the pair of T-38s required the B-200 to fly an orbit at 30,000 feet and come around to the exact right heading just as the two jets flew their own route 2,000 feet below. The new cameras are digital, but the high resolution images they grab at 1,400 frames per second – more than 20 times the fastest setting on many personal cameras – can fill up the system’s available memory in just three seconds. Another image of the two T-38s from the same AirBOS test, showing the planes flying too far apart for their shockwaves to meet., NASA A solo shot of a T-38 that NASA took with the new AirBOS camera system., NASA “The biggest challenge was trying to get the timing correct to make sure we could get these images,” Heather Maliska, the sub-project manager for AirBOS. “Our operations team has done this type of maneuver before. They know how to get the maneuver lined up, and our NASA pilots and the Air Force pilots did a great job being where they needed to be.” The new camera system will be an extremely important tool for NASA going forward. One of AirBOS’ goals was to have the equipment ready before the X-59A QueSST begins flying. The design of this aircraft is supposed to minimize the impact of sonic booms and could be a stepping stone to practical commercial supersonic air travel . The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) in the United States, as well as a foreign air traffic regulators, have severe restrictions in place on supersonic aircraft flying over populated areas due to the disruptive and damaging sound and shockwaves they produce. NASA hopes the X-59A’s shape will allow it to fly at an altitude of 55,000 feet and cruise at Mach 1.4 without anyone down below feeling anything more pronounced than an additional “heartbeat.” The AirBOS camera system will help NASA gather important additional data regarding how sonic booms work ahead of the X-59A’s first flight, presently scheduled to occur in 2021, and then support testing of the actual plane in 2022 and 2023. It will also help prove that the aircraft performs as advertised to the FAA and others, which could lead to relaxed restrictions on supersonic flight by future aircraft using similar design features . Having a better idea of how multiple supersonic aircraft act when flying close together could also be important for understanding the potential risks and challenges of more routine flight above the speed of sound. The cameras will be useful for any other supersonic flight research, as well. The increased fidelity of the imagery means scientists and engineers will be able to observe physical phenomena in ways not previously possible giving them a greater understanding of what is happening. An earlier lower resolution “Schlieren” image of a T-38 flying at supersonic speeds., NASA “What’s interesting is, if you look at the rear T-38 [in the pair photo], you see these shocks kind of interact in a curve,” Neal Smith, a research engineer with AerospaceComputing Inc. working at at NASA Ames’ Fluid Mechanics Laboratory, said. “This is because the trailing T-38 is flying in the wake of the leading aircraft, so the shocks are going to be shaped differently. This data is really going to help us advance our understanding of how these shocks interact.” We’ll also hoepfully be seeing more of these beautiful and unique high-resolution Schlieren images in the future, too.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",Lockheed And Airbus Join Forces To Disrupt U.S. Aerial Refueling Marketplace And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin and Airbus have announced that they will work together to pitch various aerial refueling solutions to the U.S. military. The two companies say the will explore everything from contracting out aerial refueling tankers to collaborating on the development of a next-generation tanker aircraft . The American defense giant and European aerospace consortium revealed their new partnership in a joint press release on Nov. 4, 2018. The memorandum of understanding between the two firms comes after the U.S. Air Force announced a desire to add 14 new aerial refueling squadrons as part of a larger proposed increase in its overall force structure . The service has also suffered repeated setbacks in getting the first of its new Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tankers . In addition, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps have increasingly turned to contractors to provide aerial refueling services for training as well as developmental and operational test and evaluation activities in recent years. “Reliable and modernized aerial refueling is an essential capability for our customers to maintain their global reach and strategic advantage,” Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s Chairman, President, and CEO said in the press release . “By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well-positioned to provide the United States Air Force with the advanced refueling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges.” “The U.S. Air Force deserves the best aerial-refueling technology and performance available under the sun and this great industry team, Lockheed Martin and Airbus, will offer exactly that,” Tom Enders, Airbus CEO, also said. Airbus’ well-established A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), already in service around the world and certified to refuel numerous American-made combat and combat support aircraft, will be at the “heart” of the partnership. An Australian KC-30A uses its probe-and-drogue systems to refuel a US Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, in the foreground, and a Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A Hornet ., Airbus This is hardly the first time Airbus has teamed up with an American firm to pitch the A330 MRTT directly to the Air Force. In the early 2000s, the European firm submitted this aircraft as an option in a competition that Boeing subsequently won, but which turned into a massive scandal. Darleen Druyun , then the Air Force’s top civilian procurement official, spent nine months in prison after a federal court found she had deliberately manipulated the contracting process in Boeing’s favor. Airbus, then known as European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), working with Northrop Grumman, re-submitted the A330 MRTT to the rebooted tanker competition in the mid-2000s. This time, the Air Force selected the Americanized version of this aircraft, known as the KC-30A, which was fitted with a refueling boom in addition to the probe-and-drogue system, reshuffling equipment that the Navy and Marines, as well as many foreign countries, utilize. The Air Force had to abort its contracting process a second time after a successful protest from Boeing. While the US Air Force did not adopt the KC-30A version of the MRTT with the boom, the Royal Australian Air Force did., RAAF A third iteration of the tanker competition led to the Air Force picking Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus over the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45A, another U.S. military designation applied to the A330 MRTT, in 2011. This contract had gone ahead, but the KC-46A program has suffered repeated technical problems , delays, and cost overruns since then. The Air Force has yet to take formal delivery of the first Pegasus after Boeing missed the latest agreed-upon deadline, which had been set for some time in October 2018. These difficulties, combined with the increasing age of the service’s KC-135R/T Stratotanker and KC-10A Extender fleets, may well open up space for a challenger to Boeing’s long-held dominance of the U.S. military tanker market in the future. The Air Force has already had to consider pushing back plans to begin retiring the KC-10s from 2019 to 2024 . That being said, it isn’t all that likely that Lockheed Martin and Airbus will propose direct sales of A330 MRTT yet again. Instead, a leased or contractor owned-and-operated model should be the consortium’s primary focus. The Air Force has considered using leased tankers in the past and Airbus could leverage the business model it has already developed for the United Kingdom and other European countries as head of the AirTanker consortium. The U.K.’s Royal Air Force (RAF) is AirTanker’s primary customer and presently leases nine A330 MRTTs, known as the Voyager in RAF service. In addition, the United Kingdom has access to five more planes as necessary as part of an agreed upon “surge” capability as part of the 30-year contract that began in 2004. When the surge planes aren’t in use, thanks to the MRTT’s modular configuration that also allows it to act as a cargo and passenger transport, AirTanker can also remove the aerial refueling equipment and lease them to airlines and air cargo services essentially as standard A330s. Though it generally gets little attention, the Air Force regularly uses its tankers in the transport role and the KC-46A also has a purpose-built, reconfigurable multi-role interior . The conversion process to turn the A330 MRTT into a civilian configuration reportedly takes around three weeks depending on the desired interior layout. For the United Kingdom, its deal with AirTanker creates a cost-sharing arrangement where it doesn’t have to pay for the full fleet at all times and consortium can generate revenue using the surge aircraft when they’re not required for their aerial refueling duties. A graphic showing an A330 MRTT configured for the medical evacuation mission, highlighting the multi-purpose nature of the aircraft., Airbus This is a model that could easily appeal to the Navy and Marine Corps, as well, which otherwise have to rely in large part on already heavily taxed Air Force tanker fleets. Those two services have already increasingly employed contractor owned-and-operated tankers to support non-combat activities, such as training and developmental flight testing and operational evaluations . Other companies have already been looking to take advantage of this growing market . Lockheed Martin and Airbus could offer a fully contracted option with private aircrews employing the A330 MRTT, as well. We at The War Zone have discussed in detail the benefits of utilizing privately owned-and-operated tankers for certain mission sets in the past and how doing so would free up KC-10s and KC-135s for actual operational missions down range and would save money. Our own Tyler Rogoway laid out the arguments for the Pentagon embracing contractor tanking on a much grander scale as such: “I have long argued the USAF should move toward obtaining a significant portion of its aerial refueling needs from private contractors who can offer tailored tanking solutions and elastic capacity. Doing so would mean the USAF would not have to invest so heavily up-front in tanker fleets or the infrastructure needed to support them, while contractors can procure fleets of smaller and larger aircraft based on what the market demands. As the KC-46A comes online, it will be a great time for potential commercial tanker services providers to absorb retiring KC-135Rs, or introduce new platforms depending on what their customers want.  Even smaller tankers, like those based on the 737 or G550, can fulfill many missions where large tankers simply are not needed and do so at a far lower cost. Under such a concept, it has been proven that industry, the service and the taxpayer win. On the tanking front, Omega Air has been doing this for some time now for the Navy and international customers, and other countries are following suit . Additionally,  private tanker companies’ adversary air support contractor cousins will increasingly provide aggressor training for the same US Navy and USAF fighter aircraft that private tanker companies of the future could be supporting as well. Doing so will introduce competition into the marketplace and will allow the USAF to invest heavily on higher-end capabilities, like stealth tankers, instead of maintaining a one-size fits all tanker armada. The problem is that without the weight of the USAF in the marketplace, there really won’t be a robust marketplace at all. Offsetting a portion of the USAF’s tanker needs to contractors makes so much sense, but cultural hurdles and fear of mission loss within the USAF will likely continue to block it from happening. It will take the right leadership to come along who can see the big picture over petty service heritage and cultural issues to get it done. Once the service realizes it can have more for less in the tanker department, the private tanking industry in the US will explode to meet the demand. Once again, the same thing is already happening with private adversary support contractors. It is simply too expensive and wasteful to fly an F-35 around as an intercept target for another F-35, the same can be said for putting large formations of enemies up in the air at one time to really challenge a 5th generation fighter pilot. As such, the USAF will follow the Navy’s example and will become more dependent on private adversary support companies for their training needs as their 5th generation fighter fleet continues to grow. Not embracing a similar strategy now for offsetting a portion of the USAF’s tanker needs is wasteful as procurement decisions are being made without factoring what is more of an eventuality than a possibility at this point. If the USAF were to embrace a restructuring of their tanker recapitalization plans and were to widely accept that private contractors can provide a portion of their tanker needs, these savings could be reinvested into a stealth tanker program and to build more KC-46s at a lower unit cost.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=UCpEnEsvJHU As stated, savings by pushing some aerial refueling tasks off to contractors could be used for the development of new, advanced tanker concepts that will be increasingly vital for high-end operations in the future. Interestingly, Lockheed Martin and Airbus make mention of this reality as part of their new partnership, as well. “Airbus is an industry leader in the aerial refueling area, and Lockheed Martin is known for cutting-edge defensive technologies and capabilities,” Michele Evans, the Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics said in the official press release . “This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise – cooperating to develop world-class solutions for critical needs around the world.” The two companies are planning to look into “conceptualizing the tanker of the future ,” which seems to be more than a veiled reference to Lockheed Martin’s existing work on stealthy tankers and other novel aerial refueling concepts, including swarms of refueling drones , for the Air Force, which you can read about in depth here . European and other militaries are also increasingly aware of the potential vulnerability of their tankers in a major conflict against an opponent with a robust, integrated air defense network, too. A Lockheed Martin model of a conceptual stealthy hybrid wing body tanker aircraft., Joseph Trevithick A jointly developed design could be especially attractive to both the United States and NATO members, as it could help ensure interoperability during the alliance’s operations. It would also spread the cost burden of developing such an advanced aircraft while providing lucrative opportunities for industrial cooperation to European defense contractors. In this regard, many firms in Europe have already formed links with Lockheed Martin as part of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. For Lockheed Martin, pairing up with Airbus on tankers also opens up possibilities for greater cooperation between the two companies in other sectors. For the Maryland-headquartered conglomerate, it could pave the way for access to the European consortium’s booming commercial aviation business. Lockheed Martin hasn’t offered a passenger plane since failing to find success with the L-1011 TriStar in the 1970s and 1980s. In December 2017, the firm had announced a separate partnership with aviation startup Aerion, which is hoping to revolutionize supersonic air travel , an agreement that could also give it a path back into the commercial sector. All told, Lockheed Martin and Airbus joining forces to work on future tanker aircraft and “fee-for-service” aerial refueling options for the U.S. military, and potentially other countries, makes good sense and it will be exciting to see what comes out of the partnership in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 10, 2019",Air Force To Test Target Drone Turned Low-Cost Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Research Laboratory has awarded target drone builder Kratos a contract to execute what it calls a Low-Cost Attritable Strike Unmanned Aerial System Demonstration (LCASD). This proof-of-concept initiative is centered on creating a (relatively) cheap unmanned combat aircraft that the USAF can afford to lose in combat, even opting to do so willingly by sending it on a one-way mission if need be. Alternatively, if the vehicle had the range to return to friendly territory, it could be repeatedly recovered and launched again on other missions, even from small bases without runways. The contract’s total value is $40.8 million, but the Air Force is only coughing up around $7 million, with the rest coming out of Kratos’s pocket. A press release from Kratos states that, in exchange for their much larger contribution, they will “retain hard and other assets including aircraft, related support and other equipment, and important intellectual property, software, data, platform, and system rights. Additionally, planning by AFRL includes a desire to further evolve the system via subsequent technology maturation Government funded spirals valued at approximately $100 million.” Here is exactly what the AFRL wants out of this demonstration phase: The LCASD system KUSD will provide a configurable design for multiple variants, anticipated to perform various missions that could require Nap-of-The-Earth (NOE) Flight, Cruising at High Altitudes, Defensive Counter Air (DCA) Maneuvers, Offensive Counter Air (OCA) Maneuvers, the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and the Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD). Additionally, the System will also incorporate performance capability including extreme agility for missile avoidance maneuvers to improve survivability. The Kratos LCASD design will meet, or in certain cases significantly exceed, the following stated Air Force goals for the program: UAS Acquisition Cost: $3 million or less for the first unit up to 99 units, and $2 million or less for 100-or-greater unit quantity purchases. 1,500 nautical mile mission radius with a 500 lb. payload. Capable of Mach 0.9 Dash. Maximum G load limits, maneuver rates, and subsystem environmental suitability. Internal weapons capability; sized to carry and deliver at least two GBU-39 small diameter bombs. Runway Independent Take-off and Landing capability. Emphasis on the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) materials, sub-systems, manufacturing processes, and open mission system architecture concepts. Tactical consideration of the vehicle shape, elimination of gaps and mismatches, and aero-structural inlet integration. If you’re thinking that this is a lot to ask from a program that will be co-funded by the contractor and will cost about one third of a single F-35, you’re not alone. But Kratos will likely be able to evolve one of their target drone designs, like the BQM-167i , to suit these requirements, potentially saving millions in development costs. Kratos rendering of what their cost-conscious UCAV could look like., Kratos These systems are already capable of being launched and recovered without a runway. Although the required mission radius for the LCASD program is exceedingly large, equating to a whopping 3,000-mile range while carrying a 500 lb. payload, it will also have to be able to maneuver hard to avoid threats, so this thing will have to carry a lot of fuel and be rigid enough to handle some decent g-loads. Although the requirements seem to state that this vehicle would be capable of counter-air and SEAD missions, it’s unclear if any of these missions will be demonstrated, especially considering the shallow funding involved. But Kratos has already demonstrated some pretty cool capabilities with its drones, including collaborative teaming and tethered operations with a manned attack aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wfyHqMmnhlI Regardless of how far this concept will evolve within the confines of this contract, for basic-but-still-critical missions, the Low-Cost Attritable Strike Unmanned Aerial System makes a lot of sense. In fact, it makes so much sense it seems like it’s being greatly underserved, dollars-wise. Then again, the concept may not be all that new at all. In its most basic form, what we’re talking about is something akin to a reusable cruise missile. Modern cruise missiles are far smarter than their predecessors, and they can be seen as having some properties we associate with the modern unmanned combat air vehicle concepts. These include the ability to network with other missiles to work cooperatively, to use third party targeting data , and to autonomously select targets on their own. Cruise missiles like Lockheed’s stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM ) can do all of this. But before LRASM was born, stealthy reusable cruise missiles may have been tested under the cover of deep classification. I wrote about the potential existence of this program, possibly dubbed Minion/Minotaur , some time ago, stating: “It turns out that in 2003 Lockheed spilled the beans about a concept called ‘Minion’ which was a very low observable (stealthy) 7,500lb air-launched cruise missile that could be armed with area sub-munitions, four GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs, and advanced jamming system, or even a microwave pulse weapon used for the surgical destruction of enemy electronics or power stations. Minion could be launched by large fighters or bombers and utilized an innovative ‘trap door’ jet inlet design for optimally low signature and storability. What was most interesting about Lockheed’s Minion was that it could actually land like a conventional aircraft back at a friendly base after its mission ended, thus is was totally reusable. Since 2003 not much has been heard regarding the Minion program, although some say that the concept was flight tested out of Area 51 well before any mention of it was ever made public. People have even pointed to the apparent fact that DC-130s, historically America’s drone hauling and cruise missile test platform of choice, operated out of the Nellis Range Complex for extended periods of time during the early 2000s. The DC-130s also were known to have taken part in Operation Iraqi Freedom, launching what was said to have been a handful of disposable Firebee drones, packed with chaff, that confused Iraqi radars while Tomahawk cruise missiles made their way into Baghdad proper during the opening salvos of the now notorious ‘Shock and Awe’ bombing campaign. It would seem that the biggest planned air war of the decade would have been a perfect time to test Minion. Who knows, maybe a handful of pre-production Minions were partially responsible for attacking key electricity relays and jamming radar sites located deep in Iraqi airspace during the early stages of the assault. I have always believed that the F-117 Nighthawks would have gotten a stealthy jamming platform if they already did not have one, especially after the loss of ‘Vega 31’ over Bosnia. Maybe Minion was that jamming platform or at least a piece of the solution, and maybe it was so good at its ‘kinetic’ job that it later helped put the F-117 completely out of business…” I also wrote a piece called Tyler’s 10 Thoughts On The Future Of Drone Warfare , in which the blurring of the lines between unmanned combat air vehicles and cruise missiles would become a very real thing. Thought number eight stated: “Modern air, submarine and sea launched cruise missiles are America’s weapon of choice when it comes to the opening strikes of any serious shooting war. Missiles like the BGM-109 Tomahawk and AGM-158 JASSM offer incredible capabilities at almost no risk to the user, the problem is that they are incredibly expensive and can only be used once. A single top of the line Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) can cost almost $1.5M a pop and the air launched JASSM costs as much as $750k per copy. Even in a relatively small and some would say unnecessary conflict like Operation Odyssey Dawn which aimed at overthrowing Gaddafi in Libya, would see over 150 Tomahawks fired in anger by US forces. These stocks would cost well over $225M to replace, not cheap by any means, but everything is relative in the world of modern military weaponry. Interestingly enough, one of the cheapest components in these cruise missiles is the munitions themselves. So basically a military is paying a million and half dollars to deliver a warhead that costs a few thousand dollars. Then consider that the full combat range of these weapons, around 1,000 miles in the case of the Tomahawk, is rarely fully utilized in real-world combat scenarios. Yet surely using these high-tech cruise missiles are less expensive than losing a $30M stealth drone, or even worse, a $150M manned stealth fighter, especially at the very start of an offensive when missions are usually aimed at dismantling the enemy’s air defense capabilities, right? Well currently yes, but there may be a better way of doing business in the future, and that better way may just come in the form of optionally reusable cruise missiles. In a case like Libya, the nation’s main population centers held the majority of strategic targets and thus major air defense components were located close to the coastline, which is common among many of America’s possible adversaries around the globe. This means that a Tomahawk launched 200 miles off the coast of the country in question would only utilize maybe one-third to one half of its total range by the time it detonates on its target. In theory, these missiles retain enough fuel at the time of their detonation to easily return to allied territory to be recovered and reused again if they were designed to do so. JASSM cruise missile about to detonate., DoD Alternatively, if needed they could continue to fly one way missions to a target located deep in enemy airspace and blow themselves to smithereens as they would not have enough fuel to return to a safe recovery area anyway. In other words, optionally disposable cruise missiles make a tremendous amount of sense compared to the strictly disposable ones we use today. Furthermore, if the missile could utilize sub-munitions instead of destroying itself it would be able to use a variety of weapons loads depending on the target set and could even be able to attack multiple targets on a single mission. This would be especially useful against soft ‘area’ targets like surface-to-air missile sites or motor-pools and other highly defended but unfortified structures and material. Once again, such a system would be modular in nature and would retain the option to be packed with as much explosive material as possible and sent to hit a hardened structure almost 1,000 miles from its launch point if requested. The bottom line is that I believe the definition of drone and of expendable cruise missile is going to begin to blur, especially as more expensive technology is loaded into current single use cruise missile designs and cheaper but more capable technology continues to evolve from current drone research and development. Eventually the two concepts will meet in the middle when it comes to high-risk and first strike weaponry and relatively cheap and optionally reusable missiles will take the place of the Tomahawks and Storm Shadows of today.” So this all seems to be happening, and the reverse is true as well, with expendable cruise missiles becoming smarter and more like autonomous unmanned combat aircraft. Starting with a target drone mindset makes a lot of sense in the case of the LCASD program, as these systems were built with the possibility of loss in mind. In fact, target drones have a long and relatively successful history of being used in combat for unconventional purposes. As mentioned earlier, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, BQM-34 Firebee drones were used to spread radar-confusing chaff over Baghdad. Decades before that they were used in Vietnam in a variety of unconventional roles, including arming them with weapons of their own. DC-130-packing Firebee target drones converted for operational use., Northrop Grumman Also, evolving target drones into widely deployable combat drones makes sense because they already have the ability to launch and recover without the need for a runway. This is an especially relevant capability when it comes to fighting a foe with strong anti-access/area-denial capabilities, and when doing so in a large theatre of operations—like, say, the Pacific. Runways throughout a region are all mapped by potential foes, leaving them vulnerable to attack, especially by ballistic missiles. But launch points for these types of low-end unmanned combat aircraft would be much harder to detect and predict, and could very well be set up far forward of traditional runway-based aircraft and drones. Austere basing of such a potent long-range weapon system would leave the enemy much more vulnerable to attack and would make preempting airstrikes against air power capabilities much tougher proposition. Basically, these things could be deployed anywhere with only a small infrastructure commitment. In doing so, this would complicate the enemy’s war plans drastically. This lower-end unmanned strike option will leverage rapidly-producible composite structures and off-the-shelf components, making replenishment of these drones far easier than replacing manned fighter- or attack aircraft, which can take years from the time of ordering long-lead materials to seeing a finished product roll off a production line. This could help hedge against the USAF’s deep commitment to a finite number of tactical aircraft, which cannot be easily replaced during wartime. Also, because these systems are not meant to last 40 years and fly thousands of hours, they can be built cheaper, upgraded far more easily, and adapted to new roles far more rapidly than their much more elaborate and expensive counterparts. I laid out these oft-unspoken attributes of unmanned combat air vehicles, and many more, in my recent feature The Alarming Case of the USAF’s Mysterious Missing Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles , stating: “You don’t have to build a UCAV to fly 8,000 hours as with manned fighter aircraft, a requirement that adds significantly to an aircraft’s unit and development costs. Instead UCAVs can be designed to last a fraction of that flight time. The reason for this is that these aircraft don’t have to fly anywhere near as much as their manned counterparts. Nobody really has to train to fly them at all. Computer simulations and modelling, a strong centralized test and development effort and intermittent large-scale air combat exercises will be essential in proving new UCAV tactics and to certify the systems as effective, but beyond that these things can largely sit in a hangar and wait for combat. The days of putting hundreds of hours on a tactical jet airframe a year would be over. As a result, a UCAV could be designed to last a couple thousands hours of flight time or even far less. UCAVs can be ordered to fly into the most dangerous airspace in the world without the potential loss of aircrew being a factor, which can have huge political ramifications both abroad and at home. This also means commanders can take greater risks with greater potential rewards during conflicts and can more freely strike at the heart of the enemy’s ability to wage war. For instance, instead of very slowly breaking down the bad guys’ area denial and anti-access capabilities from long-ranges using expensive standoff munitions, massive swarms of UCAVs can execute direct attacks on key anti-air warfare targets. UCAV’s far lower unit cost and simpler manufacturing process, one that can make the most of large composite structures and 3D printing, also means they can be replaced more efficiently than manned aircraft. In other words, UCAVs can speed up an air campaign’s intended results compared to manned systems, while doing so at far lower risk. Since they don’t have to have an 8,000 plus flight hour lifespan that will be spread over many decades, new UCAVs with enhanced design features and better low observable qualities can be bought on a regular basis. Such a concept also has the potential to greatly smooth the USAF’s notoriously disgraceful and unsustainable big-ticket weapons procurement process. Instead of buying an entirely new fighter jet every couple of decades, the service can constantly buy far cheaper UCAV designs in tranches of ever increasing capabilities tailored to match emerging threats in near real-time. This type of procurement concept allows for a far more nimble response to changing tactical challenges, and in doing so it puts America’s potential enemies at a drastically greater disadvantage when it comes to trying to counter our own capabilities.” A BGM-167 drone is pulled form the sea., Krators What is alarming about the Low-Cost Attritable Strike Unmanned Aerial System Demonstration initiative is just how little funding it has, with most of it coming from the manufacturer itself. Sure, some of the basic research and development has been done in the form of advanced target drones, but such a low-cost and flexible capability seems like it would provide the Air Force with at least some type of hedge against its super big-ticket strike programs, in which the F-35 and B-21 are included. So why isn’t the USAF being more aggressive, considering the low risk-high payoff nature of this concept? We’ve likely already answered this question already: Doing so will threaten major strike programs and take dollars away from them in the process, even if in small quantities, which the USAF historically sees as unacceptable. There’s also the possibility of a mature UCAV program hiding in the classified world, although the two concepts are not really comparable. Regardless, the total force, including the F-35, B-21, and a high-end UCAV program, could greatly benefit from something like this. There is little doubt that such a system, with such unpredictable basing , would put potential enemies at greater risk than they are today, and give US commanders the ability to make higher-risk decisions during times of conflict. Will we ever actually see it fielded operationally? Who knows, but at least Kratos is putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to believing in it—and that is a very good sign of the concept’s potential.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",Behold The First Flight Of A B-52 Bomber Carrying The AGM-183A Hypersonic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released pictures of a B-52 bomber carrying a “sensor-only” prototype of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW. The service had announced the first captive-carry test of this new weapon last week . The photographs, seen below, show that a B-52H, with the serial number 60-0036, carried the AGM-183A aloft during the test on June 12, 2019. This bomber is assigned to the 419th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base. USAF USAF USAF This first flight test, which you can read about in a very recent article of ours here , was simply to collect data on the drag and vibrations a B-52 would experience while carrying the weapon. The Air Force plans to continue ground and flight testing of the ARRW over the next three years, according to a statement from Lockheed Martin, which is the prime contractor. At the heart of the AGM-183A is an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , but that will be fully contained inside the nose of the missile until the rocket booster propels it to the appropriate speed and altitude. So, the pictures we have now give us the first look at the external size and shape of the complete weapon, including what appear to be pop-out fins at the rear of the booster. The B-52H is carrying the missile under its wing on what appears to be a modified Improved Common Pylon (ICP). The overall length of the weapon seems to suggest it might be possible for the bomber to carry two AGM-183As under each wing. For this configuration to work, the weapon would have to fall away from the bomber first like a bomb before the rocket ignites. The Air Force has also expressed an interest in a new Heavy Release Capability (HRC) pylon, each of which can carry two 20,000-pound class weapons, which could also be an indication that the service is looking at this to be the full AGM-183A loadout for the B-52. A bomber carrying four ARRW would offer impressive stand-off strike capability. As I wrote when the Air Force first announced the AGM-183A test: “In general, the sheer speed, as well as the level atmospheric flight profile and ability to maneuverable in unpredictable ways, makes hypersonic weapons ideally suited to penetrating past enemy defenses to perform short- or no-notice strikes against time-critical and other strategic targets. Especially compared to traditional ballistic missiles, which follow more predictable flight paths, hypersonic weapons are extremely difficult to spot, let alone intercept , making it very hard, if not impossible, for defenders to either shield themselves or relocate important assets. “This speed and extreme stand-off range also makes hypersonic weapons very applicable to non-stealthy platforms, such as the B-52 , which might otherwise have an increasingly hard time penetrating enemy air defense networks. “ This particular B-52 also underscores the unique capabilities of the aircraft to lift particularly large and outsized payloads, such as the AGM-183A. 60-0036 carries the nickname “ Tagboard Flyer ,” which is a reference to the now-declassified Lockheed D-21 long-range intelligence gathering-drone, the existence of which only began to emerge in the 1980s. You can read more about this unmanned aircraft and discussions about possibly turning it into pilotless “bomber” in this past War Zone feature . A closeup of the “Tagboard Flyer” noseart on B-52H, serial number 60-0036, which currently belongs to the 419th Flight Test Squadron., USAF This test of ARRW is only the first of what will be many flight tests and we will hopefully get to see more of the weapon on the ground and under the wings of B-52s—and maybe even the hypersonic vehicle itself—in the coming months.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 15, 2019",U.S. Releases New Evidence Of Iran’s Involvement In Tanker Attacks (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. works to build an “international consensus” regarding Iran’s involvement in the r ecent tanker attacks in the Gulf Of Oman, the Pentagon has released new higher resolution images from overhead assets that watched an Iranian fast boat remove the undetonated limpet mine from one of the vessel’s hull, as well as other details about the hours leading up to the attack. The full-color images are far clearer than the grainy infrared video we original saw of the supposed Iranian activities. The images also show the damage done to the vessel in detail. Here are the new photos: Below is a remarkably clear overhead image on the Gashti class patrol boat and its occupants that approached the Kokuka Courageous and removed a limpet mine from its hull. The U.S. says the boat was operated by the hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), not the Iranian Navy. DoD Below is the visual spectrum electro-optical footage of the removal of the mine. We saw FLIR imagery of this act late last week. This screencap is from footage shot from an AN/AAS-52 MTS surveillance and targeting sensor turret that is commonly found on the Navy’s MH-60R helicopters. Another variant of it is installed on MQ-9 Reaper drones. DoD Below is a new image showing a base attachment adapter of the limpet mine still attached to the ship after the removal of its body. This was shot from an MH-60R helicopter. DoD The U.S. Navy also got high-resolution images of a base adapter from the mine, measuring roughly three inches in diameter, after the Iranian boat showed up and plucked off its body. Multiple base adapters like this one are used in a ring on the underside of a large limpet mine to attach it to a ship. The others seemed to have fallen off or remained attached to the mine when it was lifted off the ship’s hull. DoD DoD DoD Below is the damage that was done by the mine that did detonate. The small round hole appears to be part of the ship’s mechanical systems. DoD DoD DoD The Pentagon’s official sequence of events now reads as such: CENTCOM Meanwhile, Iran has said that it will begin stockpiling enriched uranium over the limits outlined by the Iran Nuclear Deal that the Trump Administration has already withdrawn from. The U.S. has called this “nuclear blackmail” and says Iran should keep to the terms of the deal despite the fact that the U.S. has tossed it out. We also now have an official statement from U.S. Central Command confirming the reports that an MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down over Yemen last week and that Iran tried to shoot down another near where and shortly before the attacks on the tankers occurred off the coast of Iran in the Gulf of Oman. A U.S. MQ-9 was shot down over Yemen by what we assess to be a Houthi SA-6 surface to air missile on Jun 6, 2019. The altitude of the engagement indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance. On June 13, 2019, according to our assessment, a modified Iranian SA-7 surface-to-air missile attempted to shoot down a U.S. MQ-9 over the Gulf of Oman to disrupt surveillance of the IRGC attack on the M/T Kokuka Courageous. The MQ-9 had arrived minutes earlier at 6:20 a.m. local time at the motor tanker (M/T) Altair and had observed the ship on fire. The SA-7 was ineffective and its closest point of approach to the MQ-9 was approximately one kilometer. Subsequent analysis indicates that this was a likely attempt to shoot down or otherwise disrupt the MQ-9 surveillance of the IRGC attack on the M/T Kokuka Courageous. Lt. Col. Earl Brown, U.S. Central Command Spokesman The fact that Houthi rebels are now equipped with road-mobile, radar-guided SA-6 surface-to-air missile systems is a very concerning development. A modernized version of the SA-6, the SA-11 ‘Buk,’ shot down MH17 over Eastern Ukraine nearly five years ago. Yemen has had the SA-6 since the 1980s (see CIA document here ). So, it’s not clear if Houthi rebels and their Iranian benefactors have gotten older stocks working or if these systems were acquired elsewhere and smuggled into the war-torn country. In addition, the Defense Department now says another 1,000 troops are being sent to the region for “defensive purposes.” Over the weekend the UK said it is sending Royal Marines to protect shipping interests in the region. UPDATE: 5:35pm PDT— Here are the slides the DoD released detailing the timeline and locations surrounding the attacks and the Iranian boat crew’s recovery of the undetonated limpet mine: DoD The account above gives us the impression of a far more dynamic situation as USS Bainbridge arrived on the scene and the use of more substantial Iranian naval assets in the attack. The Hendijan PPG has a missile capability. DoD Note that the U.S. Navy says an Iranian missile boat tried to block their approach to the Kokuka Courageous and that the small boat rendezvous with an Iranian tug after grabbing the mine off the ship. These accounts, if they can be backed up in full, provide a far clearer picture of Iran’s hand in the attack. Also, our awesome comments section pointed out that Iran has a limpet mine that matches the description of the one used: Public Domain We will continue to update this post as more information comes available. Author’s note/correction: We updated the text to reflect the fact that, as our commenters pointed out, the large mine type likely used would have a ring of adapters to attach it to the ship’s hull. So, a ring of smaller mines was likely not used. This also makes the idea that a large mine alone did the severe damage to the ship far more plausible.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkish Aerospace Industries has unveiled a full-size mock-up of the TF-X fighter jet that it is developing for the Turkish Air Force and says that it hopes to have a prototype flying within six years. This news comes amid the increasingly likely prospect that the United States will eject Turkey from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program over its purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems, which could have impacts on the indigenous fighter project, especially when it comes to what engines will power the jets. TAI unveiled the model, which is rumored to have cost the company almost $2.25 million itself, at the 2019 Paris Air Show, which opened its doors on June 17, 2019. The firm’s President and CEO Temel Kotil said that the goal is to have built a prototype by 2023 and achieve a first flight with the aircraft in 2025. The Turkish government first announced the TF-X program , also known as the National Combat Aircraft, which abbreviated MMU in Turkish, in 2010. TAI won the contract to develop the aircraft, in 2015. The Turkish Air Force plans to eventually replace the bulk of its American-made Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Viper fighter jets with this indigenous design and hoping to have the first examples enter service as early as 2028. Since 2015, TAI has proposed at least three different configurations , including two single-engine variants and a twin-engine type. The mock-up is of the twin-engine concept, which is the one the company had settled on previously. The overall design shows some very broad similarities to the Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor and F-35 stealth fighters. The twin-engine design is also reminiscent to some degree of China’s latest FC-31 prototype and South Korea’s KF-X design . Whether TF-X has comparable stealth capabilities to a fighter such as the F-22 or F-35 remains to be seen. For instance, the mockup, as had been the case with previous concept art, continues to show exposed exhaust nozzles for the fighter’s two engines. The model doesn’t give any hints about whether the aircraft will bury the engines deep inside the fuselage behind snaking s-shaped inlets , another important design feature for stealthy aircraft. Internal baffles are another option, but would not be as effective. TAI is, at least for the moment , responsible for the production of Joint Strike Fighter fuselage sections, which Kotil said gives the company important industrial capacity and production experience to support the TF-X program. However, more goes into stealth than just shape. Applying special radar-absorbing coatings, crafting specialized structures, and eliminating seams are among the other factors the Turkish aerospace firm will have to contend with. The TF-X mockup at the 2019 Paris Air Show., TAI With an overall length of 60 feet and a wingspan of 39 feet, the TF-X is smaller dimensionally than an F-22, but slightly larger than the F-35. Previous concept art shows that TAI expects the fighter jets to have both cheek and ventral internal weapons bays like the Raptor. TAI also says the fighters will have supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2, though it’s not clear if this means they will have the ability to fly at that speed for a sustained period, or supercruise, like the F-22. But whatever its final specifications might be, the TF-X program has taken on new emphasis in recent months as the U.S. government works to boot Turkey from the F-35 program over Ankara’s purchase of Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. The United States, in particular, has voiced concerns that this could result in Russia gaining important insight into the Joint Strike Fighter’s capabilities and stealthy signature, issues you can read about in more detail here and here . Turkish representatives already found themselves locked out of the annual F-35 CEO Roundtable on June 12, 2019. Coupled with worsening U.S.-Turkish relations in general , this dispute could easily have second-order impacts on TF-X, especially when it comes to the engines. In October 2018 , TAI selected General Electric’s (GE) F110 family of afterburning turbofans – specifically the F110-GE-129 or F110-GE-132 – to power the future indigenous fighters. The -129 has a maximum thrust rating of 29,500 pounds, while the -132 offers up to 32,000 pounds of thrust, according to GE . This made good sense since Turkey’s TUSAŞ Engine Industries (TEI) already assembles F110s under license and the -100 and -129 variants power Turkey’s Block 30/40 and Block 50 F-16C/Ds, respectively. This could help simplify maintenance and logistics demands, as well as ensure work for domestic industrial enterprises. The problem here is whether this relationship will necessarily be able to continue in the coming years. TEI employees work on an F110 engine., TEI Though the Pentagon has no plans at present to censure the Turkish government outside of the F-35 program, Congress could seek to sanction Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA . This, in turn, could make it difficult for American companies to do defense-related work in Turkey. American lawmakers could also simply seek to block any cooperation between U.S. firms and Turkey over the TF-X program. Legislators already asked the Pentagon to assess the impacts of Turkey’s participation in five other weapon system programs beyond the F-35 in the final version of the annual defense policy bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act. President Donald Trump signed that into law in August 2018. So far, there has been no change in the execution of any of these programs, including Turkey’s local assembly of Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk helicopters , which will be known as T70s . A prototype T70 utility helicopter for Turkey., Lockheed Martin At the same time, cutting off Turkey from the F110 completely would be a huge policy shift that would effectively ground the Turkish Air Force’s F-16s and could potentially have wider-reaching ramifications. Other countries looking to buy American jets or fighters with American engines could be more inclined to look elsewhere, as a result. Congress could seek a more limited and politically palatable approach that preserves cooperation over the F-16, but blocks any new engine-related transfers to Turkey specifically for TF-X. Turkish authorities would have limited alternatives readily available if this were to happen. In March 2019 , it emerged that Rolls-Royce, which lost out to GE to build the engines for Turkey’s fighter jet, had been working to further limit its cooperation in the program. This was linked to disputes between Turkish authorities and Rolls-Royce over the transfer of sensitive technology and intellectual property rights. This has also raised questions about the continued participation of U.K.’s BAE Systems in the TF-X program. In 2017, BAE signed a memorandum of understanding with TAI to provide engineering assistance for TF-X. BAE is leading the development of the U.K.’s own future stealth fighter, known as Tempest . TAI could possibly turn to Russia for jet engines. The Kremlin has already pitched the idea of Turkey joining its Su-57 advanced combat jet effort if find itself excluded from the F-35 program. In 2018, Defense News reported that the Russians had previously offered to provide engines for the TF-X. The most recent models of Russia’s Saturn AL-31 family are in the same general thrust classes of the F110-GE-129 and -132, though there have been questions about their overall reliability in the past. Saturn is in the process of developing an improved “ Product 30 ” engine for the Su-57 specifically. Picking a Russian engine could potentially prompt Turkey’s critics in Congress and elsewhere to call for even more sanctions against the country, too. A briefing slide from Saturn and its partners showing the progression of the AL-31/AL-41F design leading to the Product 30 engine at the far right., NPO Saturn Engine-making TEI says they also have a plan to develop an indigenous engine for TF-X, but as of 2018, the company had laid out a 20-year roadmap for this development, according to Defense News . Even if that schedule proceeded uninterrupted, this would mean that series production would only begin around 2038, nearly a decade after the Turkish Air Force expects to begin taking large deliveries of TF-Xs. The Turkish Air Force is of the opinion that, whatever happens, it will need to begin replacing its F-16C/Ds in the 2030s. At present, Turkey has around 245 Block 30, 40, and 50 Vipers in total. A Turkish Air Force F-16C Viper., Turkish Armed Forces There’s also just the matter of whether Turkey will be able to afford to keep the TF-X program on schedule. As of 2018, the Turkish government had invested more than $1 billion into the development of the fighter jet as part of an incentive-based system. Historically, stealth fighter development programs have taken decades and 10s of billions of dollars to reach fruition. This is to say nothing of the costs associated with actually acquiring significant numbers of the jets or operating and maintaining them . TAI’s first flight timeline for its advanced combat aircraft is extremely ambitious in of itself. Even if the TF-X is a less advanced design than something such as the F-35, developing anything approaching a 5th generation fighter would still be costly and challenging. In the meantime, Turkey is still betting very heavily on the TF-X to succeed, both in order to boost the capability of its Air Force and to help drive continued expansion of its domestic aerospace and defense industries. But it increasingly looks like TAI and the Turkish Air Force will be facing significant and increasing hurdles to turning the domestic fighter jet program into a reality.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing is having a tough time as of late and the KC-46 Pegasus tanker has been one of the many thorns in the company’s side. But there is good news. The militarized 767 derivative is making its inaugural appearance at the biennial and extremely high-profile Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport this week. International sales of the type could help Boeing recoup the billions of dollars in developmental cost overruns it has had to swallow under its fixed price contract with the USAF. So, making a big impression with leaders of foreign air arms and procurement officials is quite important. Boeing appears to have wanted to kick this campaign off early judging by the KC-46’s ‘unique’ arrival to the show. The big gray tanker came swooping in on short final, floating over the runway’s centerline before realigning and plopping down with a thud, wings bouncing a bit from the abrupt arrival. This was followed by a short landing roll. The arrival was impressive, but also a bit peculiar: This is just the first of what will be a crush of exciting aerospace and defense news coming out of Paris this week, as well as some exhilarating flying displays.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 17, 2023",The Combat Information Center In Japan’s New Frigate Is Like A Starship’s Bridge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan’s new 30FFM Multi-Function Frigate will soon be under construction and it is set to become the workhorse of the country’s increasingly capable naval forces. The vessels will pack a number of attractive features, including a stealthy design, high-speed, new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar system, stern-launched small boat capability, the ability to launch and recover unmanned systems, and a Mark 41 vertical launch system. Yet the ship’s combat information center (CIC) may be its most outstanding quality. CICs are a fighting ship’s brain. Whereas the bridge deals with navigation, the CIC focuses on fighting the ship. In the confines of the CIC, sensor, communications, weapons control, and general situational information is fused—via automation and manpower— and tactical decision-making occurs. Here is a basic and modern primer on CICs from the U.S. Navy: https://youtube.com/watch?v=rfnpUU8T9Ok Looking far more like the bridge on a Starfleet vessel than a traditional CIC, the so-called Advanced Integrated CIC (AICIC) aboard a 30FFM is buried deep in the ship for maximum survivability and virtually any remote task can be completed from its confines. Wrapped around the outer edges with large displays, beyond controlling the tactical situation at any given time, the AICIC will allow its sailors to execute steering, engineering, navigation, damage control, fire suppression, communications, and other functions via its multi-functional consoles and open-architecture software. Its circular video wall can also display distributed aperture imagery, basically giving its sailors a synthetic view of the ship’s surroundings during day and night via cameras arrayed around the vessel’s superstructure. Apparently, augmented reality will also be a part of the system, displaying key information, such as target tracks and potential hazards, over external views. This kind of technology is proliferating to new platforms, including ground vehicles and seagoing vessels. You can read more about it in this recent article of ours . According to the always fantastic Naval News , AICIC is made up of an outer rim of 14 multi-function consoles, a center helm station, four more multi-function consoles for command staff and two large table-like displays used for mission planning and navigation. Naval News writes: This new 360° video wall feature by MHI [Mitsubishi Heavy Industries] offers maximum flexibility to the crew of the future frigate, it makes the operation of the frigate more secure and offers interesting options in terms of redundancy and back-up (if the bridge or engine control are damage, the ships may still be operated from inside the CIC). Here’s a better look at the ship in general and its innovative CIC design: Combat Information Centers are morphing from the dark, cramped, bulky, console-packed affairs of yesteryear into far more modern, collaborative, and expansive spaces. The latest baseline update of the Aegis Combat System has prompted a far less ambitious reconfiguration of CICs aboard U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers it is installed on. Yet the U.S. Navy’s new Zumwalt class destroyers feature a CIC that is more akin what you would find in an underground command center or a Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) than on a fighting ship. It also is designed to possess much of the same flexibility as the 30FFM’s AICIC, but it is a far more cavernous arrangement and focuses on strategic, as well as tactical command and control functions. You can read all about it in this past feature of mine . A rendering of Zumwalt’s multi-story combat information center dubbed simply the ‘Ship’s Mission Center’ aboard the destroyers. , Public Domain It will be interesting to see the 30FFM’s AICIC once the first ship is delivered, which should occur around 2022. As for Zumwalt’s huge shipboard command center, we still haven’t seen any photos of it, but it should have been installed recently along with the ship’s other missionized systems and features. Regardless, it seems as if science fiction is finally meeting reality when it comes to the high-tech command centers installed aboard modern warships.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 20, 2019",Lockheed Eyes Giving F-35s More Gas With Drop Tanks And That’s A Very Good Thing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin is looking at what it would take to give the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter , and by extension Israel’s F-35I subvariant , the ability to carry two 600-gallon drop tanks under its wings as part of a larger range-extension study. This would increase their total fuel capacity by approximately 40 percent, though it would negate the jet’s stealth qualities. It is possible that similar provisions could eventually become available across the entire Joint Strike Fighter family. Aviation Week was first to report on the details about the proposed plan on June 13, 2019. Lockheed Martin had originally planned for F-35A to carry 460-gallon underwing drop tanks and the aircraft’s inboard stores hardpoints are still plumbed into the jet’s fuel system. However, this requirement subsequently got dropped and the Maryland-headquartered defense giant has never certified any Joint Strike Fighter variant to carry drop tanks of any kind. The company is also looking at whether an improved version of the stealthy fighter jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine could offer additional range. “We have had early discussions with various F-35 customers regarding extended-range opportunities,” a Lockheed Martin spokesperson told Aviation Week . “While exact ranges depend on mission profiles, our studies show a significant increase in both range and loiter time – or mission persistence.” It’s unclear exactly how much additional range the drop tanks will give the F-35As and F-35Is. At present, the F-35A has a publicly stated unrefueled combat radius of just over 650 nautical miles. All F-35s also have the ability to refuel in flight. US Air Force F-35As fly in formation with a KC-135R tanker., USAF These discussions and engineering studies date to at least Fall of 2018, when The War Zone reached out to Lockheed Martin to inquire about just this issue—whether there were any new plans regarding adding drop tanks to the F-35. In response, they had sent us the following statement: The F-35, as configured today with internal fuel, exceeds the highly capable specified range performance.  In fact, the F-35As range and loiter time are already greater than most existing 4th generation aircraft when flying identical mission profiles and weapons loadouts, even with 4th generation aircraft using maximum external fuel tanks. This range is the result of the F-35’s superior engine fuel efficiency and significantly reduced aerodynamic drag with internal fuel and weapons carriage compared to 4th generation fighters that require external weapons, sensor pods and fuel tanks for the majority of mission sets. That said, we have had discussions with customers regarding extended range opportunities to further enable select mission profiles beyond today’s requirement, which can improve operational flexibility and reduce demand on aerial refueling assets. Lockheed Martin, along with government and industrial partners, have completed engineering studies for options to further extend the F-35’s range, which can be accomplished with external tanks, increased fuel efficiency and other opportunities. As a result of the studies, we have strong options should our customers make a decision to add extended range options to their program requirements in the future. We pushed for more information in subsequent discussions going into the Winter, but there was none available at the time. The fact that the F-35 is as far along in its lifecycle and production run as it is, but still doesn’t have a wing tank option had long seemed like a great missed opportunity to us at The War Zone. Interest from Israel, which flies the F-35I , or Adir, has been a particularly important driver of Lockheed Martin’s new range-extension effort, according to Aviation Week . Israeli companies have already been heavily involved in the development of potential drop tank options for the Joint Strike Fighters, as well as conformal fuel tanks . A pair of Israeli F-35Is., IAF As noted, Lockheed Martin itself conducted a number of drop tank-related studies between 2004 and 2007 . After aerodynamic and stores separation problems with the original 480-gallon design, the company had developed a design for an improved 460-gallon version with a significantly revised shape, which did not ultimately enter service. Since then, as one can see in the statement the company provided to The War Zone , it has touted the F-35’s range capabilities without drop tanks, as well as its overall performance without the added drag and weight they would impose. Renderings of an early 480-gallon drop tank design for the F-35, at left, and the 460-gallon design that Lockheed Martin had originally planned to certify on the Joint Strike Fighter at right., AIAA AIAA It’s true that the F-35 already possesses a combat radius that is well beyond that of many existing tactical fighters. But since Lockheed Martin stopped work on the drop tanks, there have been persistent questions about whether the internal fuel loads on the Joint Strike Fighter variants are truly adequate or optimal to meet emerging demands, such as the need to reposition the aircraft across long distances on short notice, perform long-range combat missions with reduced tanker support, and conduct persistent operations over permissible air combat environments. These concerns have been particularly pronounced for the short and vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35B, which has a smaller internal fuel capacity than the F-35A by roughly 30 percent. This only increases the requirements for tanker support and the need to perform additional mid-air refuelings during already challenging long-distance flights and combat operations. The deployment of 10 U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs from MCAS Yuma in Arizona to MCAS Iwakuni in Japan in January 2017 is a prime example of the issues at play. It took a total of nine tankers and 250 total mid-air refuelings – 25 per F-35B – to complete the trip, which also included six overnight stops along the way. Of course, this was in part out of an abundance of caution. The route was based on worst case scenarios to ensure the F-35s would be within range of divert locations, if necessary, due problems with the Joint Strike Fighters, the tankers, weather, or difficulty actually refueling. But it is still a clear indicator of the potential utility of drop tanks for long-range positioning missions. F-35B refueling from a KC-135’s “Iron Maiden.”, DoD “So when we plan these things we take the worst winds, we take the worst configuration of the airplane, and we say: at the worst time, what would happen?” U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Scott Pleus, then head of the F-35’s integration office, told Aviation Week at the time. “It is very conservative, and the reason why we’re so conservative is because it’s a life or death decision.” It is certainly true that drop tanks would effectively eliminate the F-35’s stealthy characteristics and would have some impact on the aircraft’s speed and maneuverability. Jettisoning the drop tanks and their pylons would help recover some of the jet’s stealthy profile, though it’s not a perfect solution. If precisely engineered, flush-mounted conformal tanks could be another option to extend the fighter’s range without completely sacrificing the jet’s stealth features. Still, for countries, such as Israel, which have relatively smaller tanker fleets , relying on the internal fuel capacity of the Joint Strike Fighter alone can have its own direct impact on operational planning. This is one of the reasons why the Israeli Air Force has made it clear that it plans to operate the F-35I alongside various versions of the F-15 Eagle for the foreseeable future. Israel pioneered the use of F-15s for long-range strike missions, which you can read about more here and here , and continues to employ them in this role to this day. An Israeli Air Force F-15I Ra’am loaded with training bombs., IAF Today, Israel’s most worrisome potential opponent is Iran. For the Israeli Air Force, any strikes against targets in Iran would require lots of range with limited tanker support. The F-35s would be least likely to use standoff weapons during these operations in order to take advantage of their advanced survivability features, which would also force them to fly farther to get closer to their targets. So, it’s not surprising that Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Cyclone, a subsidiary of Israeli firm Elbit Systems, continued work on range-extending tanks for the F-35I after 2007. In April 2019, they completed initial design studies on a conformal tank design, as well as the 600-gallon drop tank, according to Aviation Week . The 600-gallon drop tank is the one Lockheed Martin is now considering working to certify for all F-35As. There is no word on whether the company is or isn’t also interested in the conformal design. Lockheed Martin’s renewed interest in drop tanks for the F-35 also comes as the U.S. Air Force, which is the largest F-35A customer, has asked for funds to purchase a number of Boeing F-15X Advanced Eagles . The added range that these aircraft offer over other fighter jets, including the F-35A, is likely a factor in the service’s decision to purchase them, which you can read about in depth here and here . The Air Force’s F-22 Raptor stealth fighters also have the ability to carry drop tanks for additional range during missions that do not require them to operate in a full stealth mode. An artist’s conception of the F-15X for the US Air Force., USAF The twin-engine F-15E Strike Eagle , from which the F-15X is derived, can carry around 35,500 pounds of fuel in its ferry configuration with three drop tanks and its conformal tanks attached. The F-35A’s internal fuel capacity is almost 18,500 pounds. The two drop tanks would give the Joint Strike Fighters around than 26,650 pounds of fuel in total, roughly 75 percent that of the fully-fueled Strike Eagle. It’s unclear what the exact range difference might be in the end, but the single-engine F-35A could likely squeeze a lot of range out with that extra fuel, regardless of the drag and weight penalty they inflict. Especially when coupled with ever-improving stand-off weapons , including air-launched hypersonic missiles , external fuel tanks could greatly improve the F-35’s ability to strike targets at extended ranges. If a conformal tank that does not heavily impact the jet’s stealthy characteristics becomes viable, this could give the Joint Strike Fighters even more impressive added capability. Two tanks and a minimal defensive weapons load could allow the F-35 to use its amazing sensor suite in a long-loitering, persistent surveillance and netowrking manner in support of other platforms and the overall combined force, too. The reality is that drop tanks may simply become a necessity as time goes on. Aerial refueling demands could stretch tanker fleets to their breaking point during a protracted peer state conflict where basing could be pushed out many hundreds or even thousands of miles from enemy or contested territory. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly apparent that non-stealthy tankers will only find themselves forced further and further away from the battlespace as enemy air defenses and other anti-access technologies continue to improve . Operating from austere fields and remote locales without any tanker support at all is also a potential reality. DoD Giving the F-35 community the option to carry external fuel tanks makes so much sense. It’s not that the aircraft needs them due to some deficiency, but it will make the good range performance the jet already possesses even better under a wide array of circumstances. Considering that so far F-35s fly combat sorties with external stores more often than not, slapping on some tanks is even more logical as stealth isn’t even an issue. Doing so will provide the jets more time over the battlefield for missions such as close air support and reduce their reliance on heavily tasked tankers. Now that the F-35 is here to stay, we need to make the very most out of it. It has to work with reasonable reliability and be as flexible as possible as quickly as possible if it is to soon become the backbone of American and allied tactical airpower. This means investing more money in upgrades and enhancements, not less. Getting external tanks to the fleet should be an important part of this process. With all this in mind, there might come a time in the not-so-distant future where it is not uncommon to see F-35As and F-35Is—and possibly all of the F-35 variants—with external or even conformal fuel tanks and the F-35 program as a whole will better off for it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",Japanese Ship Owner Disputes U.S. Claims About Weapons Used In Tanker Attack,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The president of the shipping company that owns the Kokuka Courageous has said that “a flying object” caused the damage the ship suffered in an attack in the Gulf of Oman yesterday, directly disputing a U.S. government assessment. The U.S. military has released video and pictures that it says point to an Iranian attack using limpet mines. These competing narratives add to a flurry of confusing and contradictory claims that have been swirling around the incident since it occurred. Yutaka Katada, president of shipping firm Kokuka Sangyo, offered his take, citing accounts from the ship’s crew, at a press conference on June 14, 2019 . He also completely dismissed the possibility that torpedos were involved, noting that the damage was too far above the waterline for this to be plausible. Late on June 13, 2019, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) released a video that showed either Iranian military personnel or members of Iran’s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) removing a possible limpet mine from the side of Kokuka Courageous . It also provided photographs that sailors onboard the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Bainbridge had taken showing the object still attached to the ship’s hull during rescue operations hours before. The U.S. military was not directly involved in the recovery of the crew of the Front Altair , the other tanker that had been a victim of attacks in the area around the same time. “Our crew said that the ship was attacked by a flying object,” Katada told reporters. “I do not think there was a time bomb or an object attached to the side of the ship.” This claim is in line with another one that the Financial Times attributed to an unnamed Kokuka Sangyo spokesperson on June 13, 2019. “Kokuka Sangyo said it had received a report that the Kokuka Courage [sic] was hit by two shells, three hours apart,” the spokesperson said. “A company official said: ‘The first shell hit to the rear of the ship on the port side… The second shell then hit port amidships.” It appears that the spokesperson had received at least some incorrect information in the initial aftermath of the attacks. The photos the U.S. Navy released show the damage, along with the unknown object, on the ship’s starboard side. USN USN The rest of Kokuka Sangyo’s statements are in direct conflict with the U.S. government’s position. In its press release on June 13, 2019, CENTCOM said that Coastal Ace , a tug belonging to Dutch shipping company Acta Marine, had rescued the crew of the Kokuka Courageous after they abandoned the tanker specifically because they had spotted the possible unexploded mine on their ship’s hull. While we don’t know for sure why these two very different stories have emerged, there are certainly plausible explanations for how an information disconnect may have occurred. Did the crew hear a second object “hitting” the hull amidships when this was actually the attackers placing another limpet mine? Did attackers employed other weapons, such as rocket-propelled grenades, before, during, or shortly after they placed the mines, which could account for the reports of a “flying object”? US Navy personnel on board the USS Bainbridge render aid to the crew of the Kokuka Courageous after their transfer from the Coastal Ace on June 13, 2019., USN It is also unclear from Kokuka Sangyo timeline whether the Kokuka Courageous made its distress call after the first attack, which reportedly caused an engine room fire, or after the second one that came three hours later. CENTCOM says U.S. forces in the region received the call from that ship at approximately 7:00 AM local time and that the USS Bainbridge was on the scene around four hours afterward. At approximately 11:05 AM local time, the USS Bainbridge met up with the Coastal Ace in order to transfer the crew of the Kokuka Courageous . Some nine hours later, the Iranian Gashti -class fast boat approached the tanker and recovered the object from the hull before sailing away, as seen in the video below. The U.S. government asserts that Iran was attempting to remove evidence of its involvement in the attack. Iran has denied any involvement and denies that its personnel recovered a mine, but has also offered no evidence to support those claims. If it was an unexploded mine, the actions of the Iranians were both brazen and reckless, regardless of the country’s involvement. Iran would have to have been aware of the various U.S. military assets in the area, including ships like Bainbridge and manned and unmanned aircraft, closely monitoring the situation. If the object the personnel pulled from the hull was a mine, then there would also have been some risk that it might have finally detonated as it was being removed. There is no indication from the video that any effort was made to disarm the device before personnel on the boat yanked it off the ship’s hull. But there’s no disputing that Iranian personnel did come back hours after the incident to recover something and that this activity was, by then, entirely unrelated to any rescuing of Kokuka Courageous ‘ crew. By all accounts, Iranian forces initially retreated from the area around the ship after the Bainbridge arrived. A picture of examples of what the U.S. military refers to as the Gashti-class during a ceremony marking their delivery to the IRGC’ Navy in 2016., IRNA Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which operates the Kokuka Courageous on behalf of Kokuka Sangyo, says it’s under tow to the port of Khor Fakkan in the United Arab Emirates. More information may emerge once investigators have had a chance to more thoroughly inspect the ship in port. The Front Altair continues to burn and it is unclear what might happen to that ship in the immediate future. The fate of the crew, who presently in Iran is uncertain, too. Though shipping company Frontline has not expressed any concern about their safety and wellbeing, it is unclear if they are free to leave or have been detained for some reason. There are reports that Iranian forces forcefully demanded the cargo ship Hyundai Dubai , which initially rescued the Front Altair ‘s crew, to transfer the crewmen into their custody. The USS Mason , another Arleigh Burke -class destroyer, has also joined the USS Bainbridge to assist with the ongoing response to the attacks. USNI News has reported that there are no plans yet for American warships to begin escorting tankers in the area. This is something that occurred in 2015 after the IRGC briefly seized the container ship Maersk Tigris pursuant to an legal dispute . During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Iranian attacks on commercial shipping also prompted a major U.S. military response as part of what became known as the Tanker War . But even with a continuing lack of clarity surrounding exactly what happened to the Kokuka Courageous , as well as the Front Altair , the attacks have added another layer to existing tensions in the region, particularly between the United States and Iran. The U.S. government also blames Iran for another set of attacks on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in May 2019, but has not yet provided any definitive evidence to support that claim. At the beginning of that month, President Donald Trump’s Administration also announced that it had intelligence that purportedly showed an increased risk to U.S. forces from Iran and its proxies throughout the Middle East. There have also been a notable spike in attacks and claimed attacks from Iranian-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen, involving missiles and suicide drones , primarily against Saudi Arabia. On June 12, 2019, the Houthis fired what appeared to be an Iranian ground-launched cruise missile at a Saudi airport , injuring 26 people. This was the first time the militants had claimed to have employed this type of weapon in a strike on a Saudi target. If nothing else, the global price of oil has certainly spiked, jumping four percent in the aftermath of the attacks. Insurance firms have also raised rates and one shipping firm has reportedly stopped taking bookings for voyages to or from the Gulf. But its also worth noting that the price of oil had just dropped four percent on June 12, 2019 , meaning that the price now is the same as it was just days ago. The official response from the U.S. government has, so far, been somewhat mixed. “On April 22nd, Iran promised the world that it would interrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said in brief remarks to the press on June 13, 2019. “Our policy remains an economic and diplomatic effort to bring Iran back to the negotiating table at the right time, to encourage a comprehensive deal that addresses the broad range of threats – threats today apparent for all the world to see – to peace and security.” It’s true that Iranian authorities had pledged to do so this if the U.S. government’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions and efforts to isolate the country diplomatically brought their oil exports to a halt entirely. However, this is a long-standing threat that the Iranians haven’t followed through on. The regime in Tehran can only know that this would draw the ire of the entire international community given the global interest in unimpeded maritime trade in the region, as well as block them from using the Strait themselves. The prospect of a bloody war with the U.S. and its Arab allies is also a strong deterrent. Still, the U.S. is pairing hard rhetoric with a softer ‘wait and see’ attitude and even an olive branch of sorts: “We will defend our interests, but a war with Iran is not in our strategic interest, nor in the best interest of the international community,” CENTCOM said in its press release, underscoring this point. “They’ve been told in strong terms,” President Trump said on June 14, 2019 . “We want to get them back to the table if they want to go back. I’m ready when they are. I’m in no rush.” Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the day of the attacks in the Gulf of Oman, had categorically rejected any overtures from Trump. “We do not believe at all that the U.S. is seeking genuine negotiations with Iran; because genuine negotiations would never come from a person like Trump,” a series of Tweets from Khamenei’s official Twitter account read after his meeting with Abe. When it comes to the Kokuka Courageous and the Front Altair , both sides as well as third parties, such as Kokuka Sangyo, may well produce more evidence in the coming days that either supports their respective conclusions or muddies the waters even more. Yet the idea that Iran did not at least have knowledge of the attacks seems to be getting more and more remote by the hour. Regardless, the incident is clearly a worrying escalation of the situation in the region overall. Editor’s Note/Tyler’s Take: Both are probably true. Iranian small boats could have, and likely did, lob projectiles towards the ship and planted mines on it. Even the firing of projectiles could be used as a distraction to mine the hull without being noticed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 20, 2019",Iran Tried To Shoot Down U.S. Reaper Drone Near Tankers Hours Before Attacks: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iranian boats reportedly tried and failed to shoot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone flying, which was monitoring their movement in the Gulf of Oman just hours before attacks on a pair of oil tankers in the same general area two days ago. This comes amid separate reports that Iran has been interfering with the ongoing efforts to recover one of the two tankers , the Front Altair , which had suffered a serious fire in the incident. CNN was first to report the new details, citing an unnamed U.S. government official, on June 14, 2019. The source described the weapon the Iranian’s employed as a “missile,” but did not specify what type. They added that it had missed the drone and fallen into the ocean. They did not say whether or not the unmanned aircraft had subsequently observed the Iranians conducting any actual attacks on the Front Altair or a second tanker, the Kokuka Â Courageous . Given the generally small size of Iran’s various armed speed boats, it seems very likely that the weapon in question was a short-range, heat-seeking, man-portable, shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missile, commonly known as MANPADS, which stands for Man Portable Air Defense System. Iran’s military and quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) both have various types of these weapons in service, including locally produced clones and derivatives of Chinese models . An Iranian Misagh-series MANPADS., Iranian State Media Depending on the exact model of MANPADS, it’s not clear whether it would be been able to hit a Reaper, which can fly above the engagement envelope of these short-range weapons. But the MQ-9 could well have been flying significantly within the threat range of such weapons in order to get a clearer view of what was happening below. The U.S. military flies other drones in the region that are smaller and less complex , too. MQ-9s have certainly proven vulnerable to relatively limited air defenses, though. CNN ‘s source also offered confirmation that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had shot down a Reaper over or near the Red Sea last week.Â Social media accounts linked to the Houthis first began posting pictures of the wreckage of an MQ-9 online on June 7, 2019. At the time of writing, the U.S. government has not publicly acknowledged this loss. In October 2017 , U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) did confirm publicly that the Iranian-supported militants had brought down another Reaper over Yemen. In both of these Yemen shoot downs, it is unclear what type of weapon the Houthis, who have access to a limited number of medium-range surface-to-air missile systems , as well as MANPADS, may have employed. It’s also not the first time Iranian forces have tried to shoot down U.S. drones flying in the region. In 2012 , an Iranian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft tried to bring down a U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator , leading the service to use manned fighter jets to escort them for a period. This harassment also gave added emphasis to efforts to give these unmanned aircraft their own air-to-air self-defense capability. But, if true, this latest altercation is still evidence of a significant escalation in tensions between the United States and Iran, which have been growing steadily since the beginning of May 2019 . It would also be an indication of the additional evidence the U.S. government has to substantiate its claims that Iran was involved in the attacks on Front Altair and Kokuka Â Courageous. CENTCOM has already released pictures of what it says is a likely dud limpet mine attached to the hull of the Kokuka Â Courageous , as well as a video showing Iranian forces returning to the ship to recover it hours after the attack. Japanese shipping company Kokuka Sangyo, which owns this tanker, has disputed these assertions , saying that it heard from the crew that the ship came under attack by “flying objects.” There was already the possibility that the attackers might have employed multiple weapons in the attack, either to cause damage or simply to distract from the placement of the limpet mines. Iranian forces firing a MANPADS at an American drone could also help explain the reports from the crew of the Kokuka Â Courageous. Separately, another unnamed U.S. official told ABC News that Iranian fast boats had been interfering with contract salvage teams attempting to begin work on recovering the Front Altair . The Iranians have reportedly insisted that they cannot move the tanker, which is international waters.Â The Iranians have already taken custody of the Front Altair crew under still suspicious circumstances. Some reports say that Iranian forces threatened the cargo ship Hyundai Dubai , which had rescued sailors initially, if it did not turn them over. Other reports just say that the Hyundai Dubai ‘s captain felt he had no choice but to comply with the Iranian requests to transfer the crew, but do not specifically mention that he was threatened.Â Whatever the case, the sailors are now in Iran and it is unclear if they are free to go. Shipping company Frontline, which owns the Front Altair , has indicated that the Iranians plan to repatriate them , but there is no indication yet of when this might occur and under what conditions.

That ship is already under tow and headed toward a port in the United Arab Emirates. The United States, along with the United Kingdom , has blamed Iran for the attacks on the tankers. The U.S. government says it is focused on sharing the information it has in order to build a “global consensus” about Iran’s culpability.Â Though Iran continues to deny any involvement in the attacks, the amount of contradicting evidence only seems to be growing by the day. If this latest report proves accurate, it would add substantial weight to the case against them. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Q-9 Unmanned"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",New Video Of Area 51 Provides The Most Recent Look Into The Secret Flight Test Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has been nearly two years since we have seen good quality video of Area 51 shot from Tikaboo Peak some 26 miles away. Now a series of new videos have been posted showing zoom and sweeping shots of America’s highly secretive flight test center located in the desolate stretches of south-central Nevada. The videos were posted by Youtuber Adventures With Christian . Christian spends a lot of time curiously exploring the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) and sometimes to an eyebrow-raising degree. This latest video series shows him and his son hiking to the summit of Tikaboo Peak—the closest existing viewpoint into Area 51—as a snow front moved in. It serves as a good reference as to how rough the trail is leading to the summit. Here is a general map of historical viewing point of Groom Lake/Area 51. Freedom Ridge gave a direct ciew down into the base, but was closed off via a federal land grab in 1995. Amazingly, the Sheahan family owned and spent time at Groom Mine up until 2015 when the USAF seized the property. You can read all about this incredible story in these past features of mine linked here , here , and here . , Google Earth It also shows the weather station installed near Tikaboo apex that almost certainly also serves as a remote surveillance node that allows the powers that be to be aware of anyone on the peak at any given time. It has long been theorized that the presence of observers on Tikaboo Peak curtails some clandestine flight test operations out of the base. In the subsequent videos, Christian gets some great shots of the newer and quite massive hangar facility located on the south end of the base, as well as some sporadic activity happening around the installation. This includes the sudden appearance of one of the HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters that provides security and other functions for Area 51 and one of the Janet 737s taking off towards the south. Heat distortion is quite low, offering decently sharp views. One thing I noticed was the tall hangar located across from the revamped A-12 hangars that had its roof partially torn off two years ago still appears to be damaged. In fact, it appears worse now. The rupture occurred between June and July of 2017, according to satellite imagery. One has to wonder what caused the damage and why it hasn’t been fixed. You can see the huge hole ripped in the roop of the tall hangar structure build across from the A-12 hangar row., Youtube Screencap The video also shows some curious activity on the south end of the runway, but it isn’t clear exactly what these vehicles are. The dark vehicle is interesting looking as it appears to have some sort of vertical appendage at its rear making it looks somewhat like an aircraft. Then again it could be something else entirely. Youtube Screencap With the country entering into another period of ‘great power competition’ and expanded defense spending—especially on research and development programs—Area 51 is likely to become busier than it has been in decades. We can only speculate and wonder about all the intriguing flying machines that currently traverse its aprons and have done so secretly in the past.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",U.S. Says Video Shows Iranian Forces Removing Dud Mine From Damaged Tanker (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been following developments in the Gulf of Oman very closely and keeping you updated moment to moment since word of an incident occurring there began spreading nearly a day ago. After Secretary Of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of launching the attacks on two tankers transiting the area, U.S. Central Command has now released impressive video and photographic evidence that appears to show an Iranian Navy or Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps fast boat going back to remove a dud limpet mine from the Kokuka Courageous’s damaged hull. That move alone is incredibly brazen considering the amount of attention and subsequent surveillance on the stricken vessels the attacks prompted. Here is the video: In addition, USS Bainbridge , a U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer on the scene, snapped this photo showing one of the mines undetonated and still attached to the hull: USN According to the Navy, the go-fast boat pulled up to the ship and detached the dud mine some nine hours after the first distress call from the tanker came in. This appears to be a bizarrely brazen move by the Iranians. The small boat, which also packed a ZU-23 23mm autocannon, was likely tracked back to its place of origin after removing the mine. According to our sources, American helicopters, drones, and a P-8 Poseidon was overhead the area throughout the day, and that’s not to mention surface and subsurface assets and those of U.S. allies in the vicinity. Also, the speed boat was relatively packed with people. This is so odd for such a risky mission. Maybe their commander told them they are better off risking grabbing their mistake than leaving it in place and suffering the internal consequences. An official Navy release reads: “Twenty-one mariners from the M/V Kokuka Courageous, who abandoned ship, were rescued and are currently aboard USS Bainbridge. USS Bainbridge remains in close contact with the M/V Kokuka Courageous and is the on-scene U.S. command authority.  No interference with USS Bainbridge, or its mission, will be tolerated. USS Mason (DDG 87) is en route to the scene to provide assistance. The U.S. and our partners in the region will take all necessary measures to defend ourselves and our interests.  Today’s attacks are a clear threat to international freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce.  The U.S. and the international community stand ready to defend our interests, including freedom of navigation. This is a threat to maritime shipping and international commerce. The U.S. and our regional partners are assisting in the response to attacks in the Gulf of Oman.  The U.S. and the international community, stand ready to defend our interests, including freedom of navigation. We have no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East.  We will defend our interests, but a war with Iran is not in our strategic interest, nor in the best interest of the international community.” -30- “U.S. Naval Forces in the region received two separate distress calls at 6:12 a.m. local time and a second one at 7:00 a.m. U.S. Naval Forces Central Command received the calls from the M/V Front Altair and M/V Kokuka Courageous, who were operating in international waters of the Gulf of Oman. USS Bainbridge (DDG 96) was operating in the vicinity and provided immediate assistance to the M/V Kokuka Courageous. Twenty-one mariners from the M/V Kokuka Courageous, who abandoned ship, are currently aboard USS Bainbridge. A Navy P-8 is also providing support.” -30- Now the big question is, if the guys in this boat were indeed connected directly with Iran as they seem to have been, was this ordered and executed through official Iranian military channels? Was it the work of the hardline IRGC and did they do it under traditional order or are we seeing some sort of a fracture here within the Iranian command structure? Looking at Iran’s military as anything near a monolithic entity at this point while trying to gauge motive here is a dubious affair. Until we know more, it is still possible that another explanation is feasible, but that is becoming a far more remote possibility as time goes on and new information emerges. To be frank, trying to evaluate alternatives to Iran having some hand in this is a rabbit hole of epic proportions, although one that isn’t entirely irrelevant considering the power players in the region, the various agendas at play, and the tensions that have been boiling for some time. We will continue to update this post as more information comes available. UPDATE: 7:40pm PDT— The Navy has posted a full timeline of events: U.S. Naval Forces in the region received two separate distress calls at 6:12 a.m. local time from the motor tanker (M/T) Altair and a second one at 7a.m. local time from the M/T Kokuka Courageous. Both vessels were in international waters in the Gulf of Oman approximately 10 nautical miles apart at the time of the distress calls. USS Bainbridge was approximately 40 nautical miles away from the M/T Altair at the time of the attack, and immediately began closing the distance. At 8:09 a.m. local time a U.S. aircraft observed an IRGC Hendijan class patrol boat and multiple IRGC fast attack craft/fast inshore attack craft (FAC/FIAC) in the vicinity of the M/T Altair. At 9:12 a.m. local time a U.S. aircraft observes the FAC/FIAC pull a raft from the M/T Altair from the water. At 9:26 a.m. local time the Iranians requested that the motor vessel Hyundai Dubai, which had rescued the sailors from the M/T Altair, to turn the crew over to the Iranian FIACs. The motor vessel Hyundai Dubai complied with the request and transferred the crew of the M/T Altair to the Iranian FIACs. At 11:05 a.m. local time USS Bainbridge approaches the Dutch tug Coastal Ace, which had rescued the crew of twenty-one sailors from the M/T Kokuka Courageous who had abandoned their ship after discovering a probable unexploded limpet mine on their hull following an initial explosion. While the Hendijan patrol boat appeared to attempt to get to the tug Coastal Ace before USS Bainbridge, the mariners were rescued by USS Bainbridge at the request of the master of the M/T Kokuka Courageous. The rescued sailors are currently aboard USS Bainbridge. At 4:10 p.m. local time an IRGC Gashti Class patrol boat approached the M/T Kokuka Courageous and was observed and recorded removing the unexploded limpet mine from the M/T Kokuka Courageous (video attached). The U.S. and our partners in the region will take all necessary measures to defend ourselves and our interests. Today’s attacks are a clear threat to international freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce. The U.S. and the international community, stand ready to defend our interests, including the freedom of navigation. The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests. U.S. Central Command Statement on June 13 Limpet Mine Attack in the Gulf of Oman, attributable to Capt. Bill Urban, Lead Spokesman for U.S. Central Command. So this basically states the IRGC executed this mission. Once again, are we seeing a fissure in the already convoluted and questionable Iranian military command structure, or was this very nefarious operation ordered by the highest levels of the Iranian government? It will also be very interesting to see how the Iranians try to spin this. Will they claim they have no idea who the people are in the video or that they did this out of concern for the vessel?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",This Is What A Continental Army Soldier Carried During The Revolutionary War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s July 4th, happy birthday America! It’s amazing to think what our patriot forefathers pulled off 242 years ago, gaining independence from British and executing a world-changing experiment in democracy. But all this came at a heavy price. 25,000 American soldiers and militiamen died during the Revolutionary War and another 25,000 were maimed. But going into combat against the British wasn’t just dangerous, it was also very uncomfortable. Mobilizing a standing and well-funded army is challenging even in the highly industrialized world we live in today. So you can imagine how hard it would have been when it had to be thrown together quickly in a land with minimal large-scale production capacity for durable goods. But still, a Continental Army soldier required the basics just to survive. Here’s what they were equipped with: Musket or long rifle, most of which were of European origin and many were commandeered on the battlefield, pilfered from British stocks, or came from private sources. Colonial gunsmiths were ordered to make as many flintlocks as possible once the war began and France provided many arms as the war progressed as well. Cartridge box made of tin or leather that held approximately 25 rounds of ammunition, flint, and a musket tool. Socket bayonet in a leather scabbard attached to a leather or fabric strap. Haversack made of cloth with food rations, utensils, plate, and a cup inside. Wooden canteen to carry water. Knapsack that held a blanket, extra clothes, razor, comb, mirror, flint and steel for fire starting, candle holder, and other personal items such as a pipe and tobacco. Fishing line and hooks were common kit as well so that soldiers could catch fish while encamped near water. Knife. Pistols and swords, as well as other edged weapons, were common only among higher-ranking soldiers, cavalry, and other specialized units. This may seem like a scant affair compared to how even the average grunt is outfitted in America’s Army today, but the gear was far from ergonomic or lightweight. When combined it could weigh nearly 50 pounds. This isn’t much less weight than what soldiers carry on shorter patrols today. Militiamen had a similar kit but it was even less standardized and most of the time components were cobbled together at home. Imagine going to war where most people in your unit had a different of everything. Very little was common or swappable. Just a glance at some of the key items both a Continental Army Soldier and a militiaman would have carried., NPS.GOV As for militiamen’s firearms, they were what you had or could borrow, and some were very old. Hatchets often took the places of knives. It was truly a home-grown affair and made for a tough life on the battlefield. Reenactors pose as Revolutionary War militia. , Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images Uniforms were a whole other story. The Hollywood depiction of spick and span Continental Army soldiers fighting famous battles was far from reality. A standard uniform wasn’t even nailed down until 1779, and even then they were slow coming. Units did what they could to match, with commanders finding ways to raise money for basic uniforms. Often times soldiers would have to buy their own garments. The French delivered some uniforms as war aid, but not nearly enough, and without replenishment, it defeated the point to some degree aside from being fresh clothes. Simply put, standardization was far from a reality Some Revolutionary War reenactors get the reality of the era better than others when it comes to uniforms or the lack thereof., Photo by Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images The condition of soldiers uniforms also varied greatly as resupply was next to non-existent. Some soldiers had fresh outfits while others had what were equivalent to dirty and torn rags. In fact, many lower-ranking soldiers didn’t even have shoes, making life hell for them on marches and in the freezing cold weather. Washington depicted at Valley Forge. , Universal History Archive/Getty Images All this did improve slowly over time, but generally, the guidance of what colors to wear—brown was made the Army’s official color in 1775 but blue and gray were also used—was more of the uniform than actual standardized apparel. A Continental Army soldier would generally wear: Cotton or linen shirt (the iconic hunting shirt was popular). Wool or cotton breeches or overalls. Three-sided hat. Wool coat with contrasting cuffs, collar, and lapels. Leather shoes or boots. Stockings. Scarf to be worn around the neck. Cotton or linen vest. Leather belt. We have a far more cleanly and aesthetically organized image of the Continental Army soldier than what history really proves., JEWEL SAMAD—AFP/Getty Images Hopefully, this little less than glamerous snapshot of history can make us appreciate just how rough the first American soldiers had it and how little many of them had to work with when confronting a daunting and highly equipped foe. It was war, and often times it was cold, sickly, and filthy. Yet their determination and grit shone through and solidified the United States as a sovereign power.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 8, 2021",These Secretive US SpecOps Spy Planes Are Getting New Sensors And Anti-GPS Jamming Gear,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent contracting announcement has confirmed that a U.S. military spy plane that crashed in Iraq two years ago was part of small, secretive fleet supporting American special operators around the world, including elements of the shadowy Joint Special Operations Command , or JSOC. Thanks to those documents and official statements from U.S. Special Operations Command we now have a good understanding of the capabilities these aircraft offer, as well as plans to upgrade them with additional sensors and equipment , including defenses against GPS jamming. The modified Beechcraft King Air 350ER in question, with the U.S. civil registration code N6351V, was one of U.S. Special Operations Command’s Tactical Airborne Multi-Sensor Platforms, or STAMP aircraft, according to a contracting notice the U.S. Army posted on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s main contracting website. In the U.S. military’s latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released in February 2018, the command asked for $5 million to continue supporting these aircraft and pay for a series of upgrades. This was down from nearly $16 million in requested spending for the project in the previous fiscal cycle. In addition to N6351V, the STAMP fleet included two King Air 300-series types, with the registration codes N80BZ and N166BA, which are well known to plane spotters using online flight tracking software. All three are of a distinct configuration from a slew of other U.S. military Beechcraft intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, though they offer many of the same capabilities. In 2017, the special operators added a modified de Havilland Canada Dash-8 , N8200L to the fleet. The final aircraft, another Dash-8, N8200R, will enter service in May 2018, a SOCOM public affairs officer told The War Zone in an Email. Special Operations Command’s two Dash-8s are in a similar configuration to this US Army aircraft., Bill Word The Army technically owns and is responsible for maintaining the planes with contractors performing the actual work. A mix of private contractors and uniformed special operators fly the planes and man the sensors on actual missions. All five planes were previously both contractor owned and operated. They continue to wear a variety of civilian-style paint schemes to help them operate discreetly, especially from civilian airports. While the complete configuration of the twin-engine Beechcraft King Airs remains unclear, we do know that it includes an L-3 WESCAM MX-15-series sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras and a signals intelligence suite known as Nebula. This arrangement has become almost the default standard for planes of this type in U.S. military service, with other U.S. government agencies, and with foreign military forces. SOCOM’s 2019 fiscal year budget request specifically asks for money to replace Nebula with an improved system called Tin Cup with the possibility to add yet another piece of equipment, called Rattler, on top of that setup. Though we don’t know the exact specifications of any this equipment, it is almost certain they allow the aircraft’s crew to locate and monitor hostile communications transmissions. They may also provide the ability to geo-locate certain emissions, especially from cell phones, which the U.S. military and Intelligence Community have increasingly used to track particular individuals of interest. There are also emerging devices that allow aerial platforms to spoof wireless networks, allowing analysts to actually penetrate more deeply into those devices remotely. This could allow operators to extract or insert data and otherwise manipulate software or hardware, including turning on webcams. One system from Leidos is reportedly small enough that an MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone can carry it inside an underwing pod, which would be more than compact enough to fit inside a modified Beechcraft King Air. The final Tin Cup system could have a secondary electronic warfare function to jam enemy transmissions, too. There is at least one reference to a Rattler electronic attack system that could be the piece of equipment SOCOM wants to add to these aircraft. The larger Dash-8s have both MX-15 and newer MX-25 sensor turrets. The latter type offers higher resolution imagery and has improved ability to see through hazy conditions. Based on what we know of similar aircraft entering service with the Army , these planes likely carry their own robust signals intelligence suites with even more capability than those on the smaller Beechcraft. They likely have some form of radar or laser-imaging system and multi-camera wide-area aerial surveillance capabilities. The STAMP fleet as a whole has satellite communications stems and other data links to send imagery and other data back to base or directly to personnel on the ground in near real time. But more interestingly, all of them are set to receive specialized equipment to prevent hostile forces from jamming their GPS navigation systems. It’s not clear what necessarily prompted this requirement, but we at The War Zone have noted on multiple occasions that this satellite-based network is increasingly vulnerable to physical and electronic attacks . We don’t know what the anti-jam equipment consists of, but it seems likely that the upgrades add new antennas or other features that are more resistant to interference. Whatever the case, it is a simple reality that the U.S. military as a whole will increasingly be called upon to operate in areas where GPS functionality might be degraded, if not absent altogether. We know that the issue, or the potential for it to become an issue, was serious enough that the U.S. Air Force included a section on it in at least one routine intelligence summary in 2016. These problems could be even more pronounced for American special operators operating largely detached from larger conventional forces discreetly, or even covertly, in remote areas. Limited operations over austere locations are common for these aircraft. In addition to N6351V, both N80BZ and N166BA were conducting operations over Iraq in 2016 and they have previously appeared in Afghanistan . According to the new contracting documents they are still at an unspecified location outside the contiguous United States identified as Site 1, suggesting they are still in that region. Those same documents state that N8200L is operating from a second Site 2 and, as the War Zone previously reported, it has been flying over Libya from Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete in the Mediterranean since early 2018. When it arrives, N8200R will reportedly join that aircraft, which is almost certainly tracking ISIS and other terrorists in the North African country. Over Iraq, and potentially Syria, the King Airs would be best suited to providing more immediate tactical intelligence. SOCOM’s planes were previously known as the Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (MARSS), which was supposed to “accurately detect, identify, and report threat targets in near real-time,” according to one Army publication . The Dash-8s are undoubtedly better able to gather intelligence across a broader area and with an eye toward developing so-called “ patterns of life .” Data on the STAMP fleet as provided in the contracting documentation., SOCOM The STAMP fleet also offers an organic capability directly to special operators, who might otherwise have to rely on similar intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support from other services or private contractors using their own aircraft. But the exact future of the project isn’t entirely clear. Despite its obvious value, the SOCOM spokesperson told us by Email that there are no plans to add any additional aircraft to this particular program in the next five years. And despite the latest contracting announcement and 2019 budget request mentioning the aircraft, the crash totaled N6351V and it won’t be returning to service. The wreckage of N6351V inside a secured hangar at Erbil airport in 2016 after the crash., US Army Another Army-owned Beechcraft King Airs, with the civil registration N8007U, was co-located with N6351V at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia in 2015, but was also not assigned to any of the Army units at that site. According to the FAA, that aircraft is still registered to the service, but it’s unclear who is operating it at present. SOCOM also hired private, and may still have them under contract, to fly a number of other King Airs as part of a project known as “Java Man” or “Javaman.” We also have very good evidence that there are more secret fleets of aerial surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft dedicated to supporting the Joint Special Operations Command. One of those aircraft, a modified CASA CN-235, appeared over Syria in January 2018 . It’s clear that SOCOM intends to continue flying the STAMP aircraft for the foreseeable future, though. Depending on the demand for these aircraft, the command may decide it needs to change course and add more of these discreet platforms.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 15, 2019",Two Tanker Ships Damaged In Suspected Attacks In The Gulf Of Oman (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The situation remains extremely fluid at this time and details are bound to morph in the coming hours, but it seems clear that some sort of maritime incident has occurred in the Sea Of Oman. Reports indicate that at least one tanker is on fire and the UK Maritime Trade Operations group put out a safety bulletin warning of an incident occurring in the Gulf Of Oman and urging extreme caution to mariners operating in the area.Â The Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Front Altair appears to be the ship on fire, while reports also state that the Panama-flagged tanker Kokuka Courageous has also been involved in some type of an incident. The ships are in an area to the southeast of the Strait Of Hormuz, the same general locale where America’s Lincoln Carrier Strike Group has been operating in recent weeks.Â An oil tanker is reported to be on fire in the Gulf Of #Oman pic.twitter.com/u2qtvzNl1b — Air & Sea Intel (@air_intel) June 13, 2019 Tanker Front Altair is on fire according to Bloomberg. Marine Traffic shows it was sailing between in the Gulf when the incident happened pic.twitter.com/of9WWsk0Sr — Michael A. Horowitz (@michaelh992) June 13, 2019 Whatever happened, it occurred at a time when the entire region is extremely tense following an influx of U.S. forces due to largely unspecified intelligence reports about Iran spinning up operations against U.S. interests in the Middle East. A number of tankers were struck by what appears to be limpet mines shortly after the U.S. said it was speeding the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the region in an act of deterrence. Nobody has claimed responsibilities for those attacks that resulted in less than catastrophic damage to the tankers, although the U.S. and its partners in the region have stated that they think it was the work of irregular Iranian proxy forces.Â Images showing holes blown in tankers by what the U.S. and its gulf state partners claim to have been caused by Limpet Mines attached by divers operating from small boats nearby., UAE Government It’s worth noting that Houthi rebels in Yemenâ€”now one of Iran’s most notorious proxiesâ€” used a cruise missile to strike a Saudi airport for the first time yesterday. It is just another reminder that more advanced weapons and tactics are proliferating to Iranian-backed actors in the region. We will continue to update this post as more information comes available.Â UPDATE: 12:35pm PDTâ€” Bloomberg states that the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet has confirmed that two vessels were damaged in an unspecified incident in the Gulf Of Oman.Â The manager of tanker Kokuka Courageous , which was sailing from Saudi Arabia to Singapore with a cargo of methanol, said the vessel â€œhas been damaged as a result of the suspected attack.â€ â€œThe hull has been breached above the water line on the starboard side,â€ Bernhard Schulte GmbH & Co KG said in a statement on its website. â€œAll crew are reported safe and only one minor injury reported.â€ … Another tanker, Front Altair , sent a distress signal to the U.A.E. port of Fujairah. It had loaded an oil shipment in Abu Dhabi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is owned by Norwayâ€™s Frontline Ltd. and is registered in the Marshall Islands. UPDATE: 12:48am PDTâ€” Here is what Reuters is reporting at this time: One shipping broker said there had been an explosion â€œsuspected from an outside attackâ€ that may have involved a magnetic mine on the Kokuka. â€œAll crew safely abandoned the vessel and was picked up by Vessel Coastal Ace. Kokuka Courageous is adrift without any crew on board,â€ the source said. Another source said the Front Altair reported a fire caused by a â€œsurface attackâ€ and that the crew had been picked up by nearby vessel Hyundai Dubai. Also, just a reminder that there is a ton of ISR capability up in that region and not just belonging to the U.S. but also to the Gulf States as well. This will hopefully help in figuring out who exactly launched these attacks. On the other hand, magnetic mines and other explosive devices can be deployed in port or while a ship is at anchor and detonate long after they are initially placed.Â UPDATE: 1:23am PDTâ€” Some outlets are using the term ‘torpedo attack.’ Take this with a huge grain of salt. It is very early to know definitively the nature of these attacks and a torpedo would drastically narrow down the possible culprits and could even be a pretext for a direct conflict. So, with that being said, let’s wait and see with this one. Apparently, Front Altair was carrying naphtha and Kokuka Courageous was carrying methanol.Â Iran’s state news outlets are saying 44 sailors were rescued by Iranian vessels and taken to the port city of Jask. #Iran rescued 44 sailors in the Sea of #Oman incident and transferred them to port city of Jask in southern province of #Hormozgan — Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) June 13, 2019 UPDATE: 5:00am PDTâ€” Here is video of one of the vessels shot from an Iranian helicopter.

The U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet has finally put out a formal statement. It reads: We are aware of the reported attack on shipping vessels in the Gulf of Oman. U.S. Naval Forces in the region received two separate distress calls at 6:12 a.m. local (Bahrain) time and a second one at 7:00 a.m. The Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge (DDG 96) rendered assistance. Meanwhile, oil is up around 3.5%. UPDATE: 6:40am PDTâ€” Yutaka Katada, President of Kokuka Sangyo, which owns the Kokuka Courageous , told reporters that the ship had been attacked twice in the space of three hours. The ship was carrying 25,000 tons of methanol from Saudi Arabia bound for Singapore . The attacks caused a fire in the engine room and led to the complete evacuation of the ship’s crew. Reports of a possible torpedo attack, which remain unconfirmed, appear to come from a statement from Taiwanese refiner CPC Corp, which had chartered the Front Altair . That is the ship, which had been headed to Taiwan from the UAE carrying 75,000 tons of naphtha , is the one on fire. Shipping company Frontline has also denied reports that the Front Altair has sunk. Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko had said his country was investigating reports that a ship carrying “ Japan-related ” cargo had been involved in the incident, but neither ship had cargo actually bound for Japan. UPDATE: 7:30am PDTâ€” CBS News is reporting that an unnamed U.S. defense official told them that it is “highly likely Iran caused these attacks,” but offered no evidence to support this assertion. The same source also said that it was “patently false” that Iran had rescued 44 crew members from both vessels. Frontline said that there had been 23 individuals onboard the Front Altair and BSM Ship Management, which operates the Kokuka Courageous , said the ship’s crew consisted of 21 individuals. CBS ‘s source said that the USS Bainbridge had recovered the crew of the Kokuka Courageous , which, if true, would directly contradict Iranian claims to have recovered all 44 sailors from both ships and brought them ashore to Jask. Frontline has also said that the Hyundai Dubai , a cargo ship sailing in the same area, had rendered immediate assistance to Front Altair , before transferring the crew to an Iranian naval vessel. However, the shipping company said that they were headed to Bandar Abbas, rather than Jask. UPDATE: 11:00am PDTâ€” U.S. Central Command spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Earl Brown has now issued the following statement, confirming that the crew of the Kokuka Courageous are onboard the USS Bainbridge : “U.S. Naval Forces in the region received two separate distress calls at 6:12 a.m. local time and a second one at 7:00 a.m. “U.S. Naval Forces Central Command received the calls from the M/V Front Altair and M/V Kokuka Courageous , who were operating in international waters of the Gulf of Oman. “USS Bainbridge (DDG 96) was operating in the vicinity and provided immediate assistance to the M/V Kokuka Courageous . “Twenty-one mariners from the M/V Kokuka Courageous , who abandoned ship, are currently aboard USS Bainbridge . A Navy P-8 is also providing support.” There are also now unconfirmed reports that the crew of the Bainbridge spotted an unexploded limpet mine on the side of the ship during the rescue operations. There have been a number of reports that limpet mines were likely responsible for the damage done to the four tankers off the coast of the UAE in May 2019. UPDATE: 11:25am PDTâ€” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has now publicly blamed Iran for the attacks on the two tanker, but offered only limited details about how the U.S. government arrived at this determination. UPDATE: 1:40pm PDTâ€” A commercial ship belonging to Acta Marine in the Netherlands was immediately responsible for rescuing the crew of the Kokuka Courageous , before transferring them the USS Bainbridge , according to the Dutch Broadcast Foundation . Dennis Bras, a spokesperson for Acta Marine, said that the crew of the ship had also seen a “suspicious object” on the other vessel’s hull as it recovered the sailors, though there is still no confirmation that it was a mine or a remnant of any other type of weapon.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 11, 2019",The Mysterious And Potentially Revolutionary Celera 500L Aircraft May Fly Soon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than two years after The War Zone was first to report on a mysterious bullet-shaped aircraft appearing at the Southern California Logistics Airport near Victorville, a refined version of the plane has conducted taxi tests and looks to be getting close to its first flight. Even though much about its design and purpose remain unclear, we do know now that the aircraft, which is called the Otto Aviation Celera 500L , is definitely focused on potentially game-changing high-efficiency flight that has the potential to disrupt the aerospace marketplace. In January 2019, new pictures of the pusher-propeller Celera 500L, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N818WM, emerged showing it in a markedly more mature state than what we had seen in the past. The plane now has winglets at the tips of both wings, but it’s not clear if the wings themselves are entirely new. The aircraft also had a black propeller in place of the earlier white one and an aerodynamic spinner over the propeller hub. There’s also a much better view of the trapeze-like landing gear assemblies, which are of the general style found in patent documents that Otto Aviation has submitted relating to a number of the aircraft’s features . In addition, as compared to earlier images, the aircraft finally has conformal cowlings fitted in place over its rear-mounted engine compartment. Each one features a single large air intake and an exhaust port. SoCal Airshow Review SoCal Airshow Review For comparison, below you can see a picture of the Celera 500L as it existed in June 2017. Ryan Notestine In May of 2019, NASA pilot and photographer Scott Howe also spotted the Celera 500L doing high-speed taxi tests at the Southern California Logistics Airport as he flew by. This further supports the assessment that the aircraft is getting closer to a first flight. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Scott Howe (@sc0ttness) Beyond what we can see, there’s still limited information about the aircraft’s specifications or even its manufacturer, Otto Aviation Group, which has been operating virtually in secret on this project for around a decade. In April 2019 , there was a public notice about the company renewing its lease on space at the Southern California Logistics Airport. Beyond that, the patent documents do lay out a case for disrupting traditional ‘hub-and-spoke’ commercial aviation models and offering improved efficiency in aircraft performance to, in turn, reduce inefficiencies in passenger air travel. “Such a transportation system requires a unique aircraft. It must be capable of operation from any current airfield,” one of the patent documents says in its background section. “Preferably, it would have operating costs well below current costs and competitive with commercial airliners, cruise at higher system speed than current commercial aircraft, have a longer range with full passenger and luggage load than most current business aircraft, provide passenger comfort comparable to commercial aircraft, and be capable of all weather operation. The plane should also provide for ease of maintenance and require only a single pilot.” The patent goes on to describe a notional aircraft that would cruise between 460 and 510 miles per hour at an altitude of up to 65,000 feet, yielding a fuel efficiency rate of between 30 and 42 miles per gallon. To put this in perspective, the Pilatus PC-12 , a popular light, single-engine turboprop aircraft has a service ceiling of 30,000 feet, a cruising speed just under 330 miles per hour, and still burns, on average, 66 gallons of jet fuel per hour , for a fuel economy of roughly five miles to the gallon. Even going to a Learjet 70 , which has similar speed performance to what’s stated in the Celera patent documents, but still nowhere near as high a ceiling, we are talking about roughly three miles per gallon of gas at cruise. So, Otto Aviation is talking about performance that i s at least 10 times more efficient than existing light business jets with similar cruise capabilities. New information in the plane’s public profile on the Federal Aviation Administration website offers clues as to how the Celera 500L expects to offer this revolutionary new capability. Most importantly, FAA says that the aircraft’s airworthiness was approved in February 2019 and that it uses the Raikhlin Aircraft Engine Developments (RED) A03 V12 engine. The RED A03 engine., RED It is unclear from the available information whether the Celera 500L uses one or two A03 engines. The FAA’s profile describes the aircraft as a “single engine,” but patent documents had described two engines driving a single propeller. Of course, they had also said these would be diesel engines with multi-stage turbochargers and intercoolers , the latter of which redirect heat to improve efficiency and keep the entire system cool while the former would theoretically provide enough power even at very high altitudes where super-efficient flight can be realized. The engine type and configuration may not be final, either. Otto Aviation has been working on the aircraft for nearly a decade already and it is clear the company has been considering different engine arrangements in that time. A source has told The War Zone that a single V8 engine from now-defunct TRACE Engines was originally supposed to power the aircraft via a reduction drive . TRACE’s engine was derived from the high-efficiency OE600 design , which another company, Orenda, had first begun work on in the 1990s. RED promotes its A03, a kerosene-powered 500-horsepower water-cooled design, which also uses a multi-stage turbocharger, as offering high fuel efficiency, low fuel consumption, and excellent reliability with limited maintenance as compared to more traditional piston engines with similar horsepower ratings. The German company also says it can configure the engine itself for “optimal” performance in “close cooperation with the airframe manufacture [sic; manufacturer].” Initial flight testing of the engine began in 2012 using a modified Yakovlev Yak-52 aircraft and the A03 received European Aviation Safety Agency approval in 2014. The engine is now set to power the new Yak-152 , which the Russian Air Force plans to purchase as replacements for its Yak-52s. One of Otto Aviation’s patents also says that the intakes and exhausts we mentioned before are supposed to help leverage this engine design to provide even greater efficiency. The exhaust setup is also supposed to include a novel heat exchanger that combines heated cooling air with exhaust gases provide a small additional boost in thrust. It all remains to be seen whether or not the combination of an A03 optimized for the Celera 500L specifically, together with intercoolers and specialized exhausts, will be enough to get the plane anywhere close to the kind of high-altitude performance Otto is clearly aiming for broadly. A diagram from one of Otto Aviation’s patents showing the proposed heat exchanger arrangement that would send air over intercooler tubes and the engine turbochargers themselves, before mixing that then heated air with exhaust gases and forcing it out the tailpipe for a small boost in thrust., USTPO The Celera 500L’s other design features are certainly also meant to help with highly efficient flight, including its teardrop fuselage which offers aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining a large internal volume. Schematics and other details in the patent describe the use of composite materials and a single primary center spar for structural stability, all of which helps keep the aircraft light, too. It’s not clear from the pictures available what the final wing configuration might look like, but those same patents indicate that Otto Aviation has been working on an advanced, multi-part flap arrangement. This could give the Celera 500L acceptable takeoff characteristics from smaller runways—as short as 3,000 feet—while still offering optimal efficiency in other flight regimes, including high-altitude flight. This is something that would be extremely valuable for commercial aviation applications since the aircraft could operate from small airports and still retain the ability to conduct non-stop flights to destinations a significant distance away. A schematic of the multi-part flap arrangement from one of the Otto Aviation patents., USTPO Another schematic showing the system at full extension., USTPO All told, it’s not clear whether Otto Aviation expects the Celera 500L design to actually serve as the basis for a new kind of passenger aircraft design or whether it is more of a technology testbed to prove certain parts of a future aircraft. But the patent drawings do show a similarly sized version with passenger windows and what appears to be a side-mounted emergency exit. It’s still hard to say for sure given the remarkable amount of secrecy surrounding the aircraft. A patent drawing similar to the Celera 500L design as it exists now, but with passenger style windows and emergency exit., USTPO Regardless, by all indications, Otto Aviation is working on what could be a very exciting and potentially revolutionary design. Being able to fly direct to smaller airfields near one’s destination on smaller aircraft at a very low cost could open up private-like air travel to the masses. With taxi tests already underway, and possibly complete, a first flight could be just around the corner. We will definitely be keeping a close eye out for when the bullet-shaped aircraft takes to the skies for the first time, which will hopefully lead to more information about just what it can really do.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 5, 2019",Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Now Striking Saudi Arabia With Cruise Missiles (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for an apparent cruise missile strike on an airport in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The group has released video showing its fighters launching a missile that is visually similar to Iran’s Soumar ground-launched cruise missile. The footage offers additional evidence that the Yemeni militants’ arsenal, which already contains suicide drones and short-range ballistic missiles , has expanded to include another relatively advanced weapon system. Saudi authorities confirmed the strike on Abha International Airport on June 12, 2019, saying that it had injured 26 people, eight of them seriously enough to require they go to a nearby hospital. The remaining individuals only required first aid on the scene. Abha is situated approximately 100 miles from the Yemeni border. “The targeting of Abha airport proves that the Houthis have obtained advanced weapons from Iran,” a statement from the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen said. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cVADHyxA8Ks The Houthis do not appear to have ascribed a name to the weapon in question, but externally it looks like Iran’s Soumar , which itself appears to be a ground-launched derivative of the Soviet-era Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile. Iranian engineers likely reverse engineered Soumar from a number of Kh-55s that the country illegally acquired on the black market from Ukraine in 2001 . The Kh-55 has a range of around 1,500 miles and can carry a 1,000-pound class conventional warhead. A Kh-55 missile on display at the Ukrainian Air Force Museum., George Chernilevsky via Wikimedia In 2015 , Iran publicly unveiled Soumar. In February 2019, Iranian authorities revealed another missile that looked visually identical to Soumar, but called the Hoveizeh , during celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. It is unclear if these two weapons are actually different. Iran has publicly claimed that Hoveizeh has a range of nearly 840 miles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jJIXPdi-ZLQ It is unclear if the Yemeni missile is a locally assembled clone of the Iranian missile or a direct import straight from Iran, whether it has a similar range to the Soumar, how big its warhead is, and what type of guidance system it employs. A relatively simple satellite navigation arrangement would allow the Houthis to strike large, fixed targets, such as Abha International Airport’s arrival hall, using readily available map coordinates. If the Houthis do have Soumars, or missiles with similar performance, it represents a significant increase in the group’s ability to strike targets at long distances, including Saudi Arabia. A reported range of 840 miles would put the Saudi capital Riyadh well within reach. It would also enable the Yemeni rebels to hit anywhere within the United Arab Emirates, the other major party in the Saudi-led coalition. In December 2017, the Houthis said they fired more of their Soumar-like missiles at the Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, a claim the UAE has denied . Though the Yemeni militants released footage of them launching the missiles in that incident, as well, there is no evidence that they hit their targets. A low-flying cruise missile such as Soumar could also pose a particular challenge to air defense networks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Multiple missiles, or combining them with other weapons as part of a larger strike, could overwhelm the defenders. In the new strike on Abha International Airport, Saudi authorities said they had successfully intercepted two suicide drones , which the Houthis have also obtained from Iran . There has been a significant increase in Houthi drone attacks on Saudi Arabia since the beginning of May 2019. The group has also employed short-range ballistic missiles, which are also derived from Iranian designs or imported from Iran itself, against Saudi targets, but this appears to be the first time they used one of their cruise missiles against the country. The Saudi-led coalition has been actively engaged in a brutal and controversial conflict against the Houthis in Yemen since 2015. Iran has been backing the group for at least as long and has aided in the expansion of its arsenal to include these and other relatively advanced weapons. The Saudis claim Iran has also supplied them with Sayyad-2 surface-to-air missiles, a derivative of American-made semi-active radar-homing RIM-66 Standard Missile left over from the regime of the Shah. Iranian support has enabled the Yemeni rebels to launch attacks on military and commercial ships using remote-controlled explosive-laden boats , too. The cruise missiles only underscore the Houthi’s continued ability to acquire the components necessary to locally assemble these types of weapons, or obtain them directly from Iran, despite the Saudi-led coalition’s efforts to blockade the country. The United States and its allies have also worked hard to interdict illicit arms shipments to Yemen. The Houthi cruise missile strike also comes after the U.S. government announced it had received intelligence that purportedly warned of an increased risk of attacks on U.S. forces throughout the Middle East from Iran and its regional proxies . The United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed the Yemeni rebels for attacks on four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman off the coast of the UAE, but no group has so far taken responsibility for that incident. A collage of photographs UAE authorities released showing damage below the waterline to four oil tankers. U.S. and Saudi authorities have blamed the attacks, which occurred in May 2019, on the Houthis., Government of the UAE via Reuters It remains unclear whether or not the increase in Houthi strikes on Saudi Arabia is at all related to information the U.S. government says it has received or is simply a part of the ongoing conflict between the two parties. Since May 2019, both sides have been fighting each other despite an already shaky U.N.-brokered ceasefire that required the Yemeni rebels to vacate a number of strategic port cities. “In light of these terrorist and immoral transgressions by the Houthis, the coalition will take strict measures urgently and carefully to deter them,” Saudi Arabian Colonel Turki Al Maliki, the top spokesman for the coalition in Yemen, said on June 12, 2019 . “The terrorist elements responsible for planning and carrying out this attack will be held accountable.” Whatever the exact reason for the Houthi cruise missile strike on Abha International Airport, it is another clear indication that the group continues to obtain very capable weapons from Iran and presents a real and increasing threat to its regional opponents beyond Yemen’s borders. UPDATE: 6/13/2019— Saudi Arabian authorities organized a tour for journalists to see some of the damage to Abha International Airport. What they got shown looks very minimal, but it’s unclear if the reporters got to see the full extent of the damage. UPDATE: 6:30pm EST— Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya television has released a video clip reportedly showing the moment the Houthi’s cruise missile struck Abha International Airport, which is significantly more dramatic than the video footage showing the apparent aftermath of the strike.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has announced that it has conducted the first captive-carry flight test of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, from a B-52H bomber. This weapon is an air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, one of at least three hypersonic weapons the service plans to integrate onto the B-52 in the coming years. A B-52H carried a “sensor-only” version of the AGM-183A during the test, which occurred at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 12, 2019, according to an official Air Force statement . The missile did not have a live warhead and remained attached to the bomber throughout the course of the flight. “The test gathered data on drag and vibration impacts on the weapon itself and on the external carriage equipment of the aircraft,” the statement added , noting that the captive-carry flight met all of the assigned test points. “This type of data collection is required for all Air Force weapon systems undergoing development.” The Air Force has not yet released any pictures of the AGM-183A, but it is understood to be an evolution of the Defense Advanced Research Project’s Agency’s (DARPA) Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) effort. Lockheed Martin is the lead contractor on both ARRW, pronounced “Arrow,” and TBG. The video below from shows concept art of the TBG vehicle at around the 3:38 mark in the runtime. For an unpowered hypersonic boost glide vehicle, such as ARRW, to work properly, a booster rocket must accelerate it to an appropriate speed and altitude. Once there, it then glides toward its target at extreme speeds. DARPA has said that it expected TBG to hit Mach 20 as it screamed back to earth. It very possible that the final AGM-183A design will have the outward apperance of an air-launched ballistic missile, though it will function a completely different manner. In general, the sheer speed, as well as the level atmospheric flight profile and ability to maneuverable in unpredictable ways, makes hypersonic weapons ideally suited to penetrating past enemy defenses to perform short- or no-notice strikes against time-critical and other strategic targets. Especially compared to traditional ballistic missiles, which follow more predictable flight paths, hypersonic weapons are extremely difficult to spot, let alone intercept , making it very hard, if not impossible, for defenders to either shield themselves or relocate important assets. This speed and extreme stand-off range also makes hypersonic weapons very applicable to non-stealthy platforms, such as the B-52 , which might otherwise have an increasingly hard time penetrating enemy air defense networks. Depending on the exact size of the ARRW, the venerable BUFF may be the only realistic platform to carry it, too. These bombers have a long history carrying over-sized weapons and other payloads on various specialized heavy underwing pylons. A NASA B-52 carries the X-43A hypersonic research vehicle during a test in 2001., NASA In June 2018, the Air Force announced it was looking to purchase new pylons for the B-52 to carry multiple, unspecified 20,000-pound class weapons. Lockheed Martin won the contract to begin ARRW development nearly a year before and had told the Air Force that it had a plan to meet desired production targets within three years . Testing of the AGM-183A is set to continue into 2021, according to a separate Air Force briefing . “We set out an aggressive schedule with ARRW,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, said in a statement about the flight test. “Getting to this flight test on time highlights the amazing work of our acquisition workforce and our partnership with Lockheed Martin and other industry partners.” The U.S. military as a whole is aggressively pursuing hypersonic weapons for various platforms. In addition to ARRW, the Air Force is moving forward with the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon , or HCSW, which is pronounced “hacksaw.” The B-52 is also set to be the launch platform for HCSW. This air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle will share a number of common components with submarine- and ground-launched weapons for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army respectively. Lastly, the Air Force is pushing ahead with an air-breathing hypersonic missile design, the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), which will also go into the B-52’s hypersonic arsenal. Lockheed Martin, which is also the prime contractor on HAWC, has shown concept art of a potential follow-on design that could work with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter or other smaller aircraft. An artist’s conception of a U.S. Navy F-35C employing a variant of the HAWC hypersonic missile., Joseph Trevithick “We’re using the rapid prototyping authorities provided by Congress to quickly bring hypersonic weapon capabilities to the warfighter,” Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Roper said . “This type of speed in our acquisition system is essential – it allows us to field capabilities rapidly to compete against the threats we face.” This first successful captive-carry flight test of the AGM-183A does follow a number of hypersonic weapons developments, especially in Russia, which has fielded its own air-launched hypersonic missile and says it is getting close to deploying a ground-based hypersonic boost-glide vehicle . China is actively pursuing various hypersonic weapons , as well. The hypersonic weapons space as a whole appears to be rapidly expanding. On June 12, 2019, India claimed to have successfully test-fired an air-breathing hypersonic vehicle, which could serve as the basis for a weapon, using a modified Agni-I short-range ballistic missile as the booster. There are conflicting reports about whether or not this launch met all of the required test points . With the ARRW test, the Air Force has moved one step closer to fielding its own air-launched hypersonic weapon on the B-52. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos has been paling around with the President for a couple of days and part of their time together included Trump showing him, and ABC’s cameras in the Oval Office , his long-touted and much preferred new Air Force One paint job. Air Force One flight crews were also in the room for the big moment. The livery could end up on two 747-8is that are currently undergoing conversion into VC-25B presidential aircraft in San Antonio, Texas. The paint job looks to be a navy blue belly with a red stripe and a white upper fuselage, as well as similar seals, flags, and text as the iconic and historic livery currently worn by the two VC-25As that serve as Air Force One. You can read all about the history of the paint job, and my take on why it should absolutely not be changed, in this previous article of mine . The livery actually looks vaguely similar to the one worn on his personal 757-200 and his helicopters . Beyond that, it is reminiscent of those previously used by TWA, U.S. Airways and even British Airways, to name a couple off the top of my head. Some variations of the core design., ABC screencap It’s actually pretty conservative, but I can’t imagine many will be excited or pleased about trading that for the largely beloved look Air Force One aircraft have sported since the Kennedy Administration. That paint job makes Air Force One the most recognizable aircraft on the planet and an easily translatable symbol of American ingenuity and might. Key members of Congress seem to agree. One of America’s greatest designers, Raymond Loewy, was chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy to create a livery for Air Force One. That same paint iconic job that first was applied to VC-137s is now worn by the VC-25As nearly 60 years later., USAF As we stated just two days ago in a piece about the Air Force One replacement aircraft’s dwindling requirements and rising costs : “Recently, members of the House Armed Services Committee inserted language into a draft version of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year, which would block changes to the paint scheme, as well as the interior design, without Congressional approval . It remains to be seen whether these clauses will make it into any final version of the NDAA and if that bill becomes law. At present, the Air Force says that no decision on the paint scheme will occur until 2021, which is notably after the next presidential election. A new president could direct further changes in the program. The service only expects Boeing to delivery the first VC-25B in September 2024 , which would be just four months before Trump would leave office if he wins a second term. The Selected Acquisition Report says that the White House is pushing to move this date up to December 2023, according to Bloomberg .” Trump appears to have put a lot into this and is probably willing to fight with Congress over the future look of the plane.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 11, 2019",F-35 Hit With Cluster Bomb Of Damning Reports As Pentagon Eyes Full Rate Production,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than 48 hours after Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon reached a handshake agreement on the purchase of a whopping 480 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , an absolute cluster bomb of stories has dropped detailing significant technical issues with the jets. The revelations cover ongoing problems for all three F-35 variants, including performance limitations, troubles when operating in very hot or very cold weather, dangerous cockpit pressure incidents, faults in the helmet-mounted display , serious safety concerns in the event of a blown tire , and much more. The new details underscore the Joint Strike Fighter’s ongoing troubles as the Pentagon’s central Joint Program Office, or JPO, seeks to move the aircraft out of its developmental phase for good, as well as highlighting a worrying, but long-standing lack of transparency about the state of the program. Defense News dropped the bundle of stories near-simultaneously on June 12, 2019—all of which are well worth reading in full —based on documents that it had obtained detailing 13 remaining Category 1 deficiencies across the F-35A, B, and C variants as of late 2018. These reviews of the issues were reportedly marked unclassified, but “For Official Use Only.” Not all of the problems in these reports were previously unknown, but a number of them had never become public and the details about the known issues add important additional context. In total, this also represents what is perhaps the first full public accounting of so-called unclassified “CAT 1” problems across the Joint Strike Fighter program at any one point in time. Keep in mind there are also throngs of other deficiencies still in play that are serious, but don’t rise to the CAT-1 level, at least not at this time. “CAT 1-As are loss of life, potential loss of life, loss of material aircraft,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, the current head of the F-35 JPO, said in defense of the program in an interview with Defense News . “Those have to be adjudicated, have to be corrected within hours, days. We have no CAT 1-A deficiencies.” The remaining problems are “CAT 1-B,” which “have a mission impact with a current workaround that’s acceptable to the warfighter with the knowledge that we will be able to correct that deficiency at some future time,” Winter continued. The F-35 program’s top officer said that nine of the 13 deficiencies Defense News reported on are on track to get fixed before the Pentagon makes a decision to proceed with full-rate production of the jets, set to occur later this year, while software fixes down the road are expected to solve two more. From left to right, the F-35C, the F-35B, and the F-35A., Lockheed Martin The F-35 JPO will not worry at all about resolving the remaining two problems, “opting to accept additional risk,” according to Defense News . Winters also revealed that testing since December 2018 has uncovered four additional, unspecified Category 1 issues that also will not get resolved before the production decision. Here are the known issues, as well as the course of action the F-35 JPO and Lockheed Martin are taking to address them: The F-35B and F-35C are difficult to control after performing so-called “high angle of attack” maneuvers, as one might expect to see in a dogfight, resulting in unexpected changes in pitch and “erratic” yawing and rolling motions. Lockheed Martin plans to implement a software fix for the flight control system. The F-35B and F-35C cannot spend any appreciable time flying with their afterburners engaged at speeds above Mach 1.2 without risking damage to their critical stealth coating or horizontal stabilizers. The U.S. military has imposed restrictions on high-speed flight, but Lockheed Martin and the F-35 JPO claim the problem only occurs in extreme cases and will not pursue fixes to completely eliminate the problem. The F-35B may not be able to provide sufficient power during vertical landings in temperatures over 90 degrees, which could result in hard landings or complete loss of the aircraft. Lockheed Martin plans to implement software fixes to ensure optimal performance in hot conditions. F-35As experienced erroneous warnings that a critical battery had failed in extremely cold temperatures . Another software tweak, along with a change to the battery heater control system, will fix this issue. If a tire blows on the F-35A and F-35B, debris could destroy the hydraulic brake lines on the aircraft, making it extremely difficult to bring the aircraft to a stop. Lockheed Martin fixed this issue on the F-35C, but there are no plans to do so on the F-35A and B for unclear reasons. Unexpected surges in cabin pressure have caused F-35 pilots to experience serious ear and sinus pain. Lockheed Martin has developed a modified pressure regulation system to address this issue. The helmet-mounted display continues to show a so-called “ green-glow ” in certain conditions during nighttime operations, which can be especially dangerous for F-35B and F-35C pilots landing on aircraft carriers and amphibious ships. Lockheed Martin says the new Generation III helmet will resolve this issue. The video feed into the helmet from the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System is cluttered with horizontal striations in certain nighttime conditions that dangerously obscure the horizon line. Lockheed Martin says the new Generation III helmet will also fix this problem. The F-35’s AN/APG-81 radar has a limited field of view in sea search mode. The F-35 JPO says a software fix is in development, but may not be ready before 2024. The F-35’s cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) continues to be unreliable in diagnosing problems and in managing spare parts inventories, leading to loss of mission time do to confusing in the maintenance and logistics pipelines. It remains unclear how the F-35 JPO and Lockheed Martin will proceed on this issue and the U.S. Air Force is already working on an alternative system. The F-35’s cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) presents an operational security risk for foreign Joint Strike Fighter operators. A firewall called the ALIS Sovereign Data Management system has been available since earlier this year. One of the most intriguing deficiencies remaining is that the short and vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35B and the aircraft carrier-specific F-35C can be difficult to control following maneuvers involving an angle of attack (AOA) of 20 degrees or more. The deficiency “will cause modal confusion, prevent precise lift vector control, and prevent repeatable air-to-air combat techniques, resulting in mid-air collisions during training, controlled flight into terrain, and aircraft loss during combat engagements with adversary aircraft and missiles,” one document warned in no uncertain terms, according to Defense News . A US Marine Corps F-35B., USMC The limitations on afterburner flight above Mach 1.2 are also highly concerning and the workarounds that are officially in place now seem all but impossible to realistically implement. F-35Bs cannot fly at Mach 1.2 for more than 80 total seconds throughout the course of a mission before needing to slow down for at least three minutes. At Mach 1.3 or above, the B model risks structural damage after just 40 cumulative seconds. The F-35C does not have a restriction at Mach 1.2, but can’t fly for more than 50 cumulative seconds at Mach 1.3 before needing to enter the three-minute cool-down period. Defense News rightly notes how difficult these requirements would be for a pilot to monitor given that they are not simply linear time restrictions. It seems almost impossible that an aviator would be able to keep track of the total seconds of high-speed flight throughout the course of a mission to know if they need to drop speed for three minutes. Needless to say, the requirement to stop short could come at an inopportune time and might easily get ignored during an intense combat situation. But without adhering to these guidelines, there is a danger that areas of the jet’s low observable coating would peel off and structural damage would be inflicted to portions of the rear stabilizer. This area also houses key antennas embedded in beneath the F-35’s skin. So, we are talking about the possibility of low-observable (stealth) degradation, damage to key components of the jet’s sensor system that would keep it from performing key missions, straight up structural damage, and in some circumstances, all three. A pair of US Navy F-35Cs., USN According to the report, nearly any of these issues would require the aircraft return to a depot for deep maintenance. The issue is especially concerning as these two models of Joint Strike Fighters will be flying from ships a significant part of the time, which presents its own maintenance and logistics complexities . But if any of this were to occur, even out of necessity to the survival of the jet and its pilot over the battlefield, the aircraft would likely not fly another mission until the ship returned home and it gets fixed or it is flown back to a depot individually during a cruise. Either way, this would cut the availability of the damaged jet significantly if not totally. Availability is already something that all F-35 variant are struggling with at present . Above all else, these restrictions limit the tactical options for F-35 pilots over the battlefield. The aircraft is not invisible to radar or infrared sensors, especially from the rear. Running away from a threat or threats is often necessary in air combat, including the need to just get out of a very hostile area as soon as possible for survivability’s sake. The F-35 is meant to operate in extremely contested airspace, to begin with. So, limiting the jet’s kinetic performance due to such a defect is far from ideal and could even result in losses during combat. Though it has reportedly only happened once, so far, the F-35B engine power issue is another very serious and concerning revelation, especially considering that the Marine Corps declared Initial Operational Capability with the jets in 2015. Since then, the Marines have deployed their Joint Strike Fighters to the Horn of Africa , the Middle East , and the Western Pacific , all regions where temperatures can easily exceed 90 degrees. The idea that these aircraft may not be able to produce the necessary thrust in vertical landing mode—and in an unpredictable manner—while returning to a ship operating at sea level is a threat to the lives of the pilot and those on the ship, let alone the hardware. “We’re not done yet, and the Marine Corps will tell you we’re not done yet until we see the fix in the fleet, because that’s where we are,” Vice Admiral Winter told Defense News , acknowledging the issue and that revolving it has been a priority. “That is the only way a STOVL [short takeoff and vertical landing] aircraft lands on an L-class [amphibious] ship, so it’s important.” The tire issue might be largely moot if there wasn’t also such an elevated risk of blowouts , although the Defense News reports that the risk of this happening has declined somewhat. Still, the fact that blown tire can mean the instant loss of both hydraulic systems when the aircraft and its pilot absolutely need them most—while taking off and landing—is far from comforting. Why this issue was able to be mitigated in the F-35C and not the B or the A model is also unknown at this time. Other problems seem either less severe or have been very well established before now. The battery failure error is a minor issue that appears to have been relatively easy to fix. Despite its sea search limitations, the APG-81 has fully met the F-35 JPO’s stated requirements. The “green glow” problem first emerged in 2017 and the Generation III helmet is the result of efforts to resolve that problem. The problems with ALIS have been especially well documented over the years and the ultimate solution may simply be to abandon it altogether . “That document looks like growing pains for an aircraft that we tried to do a whole lot to all at once,” an unnamed senior naval aviator told Defense News , downplaying the reports. “You’re going to see that if you dig back at what [F/A-18E/F] Super Hornets looked like for the first few years. Go back in the archives and look at [the F-14] Tomcat.” While it is certainly fair to say that many advanced military aircraft programs experience growing pains over the course of their development, they really don’t compare to the F-35—an aircraft that first flew 16 years ago—and its issues on many levels, as well as the critical nature of the program and its gargantuan investment. On top of that, none of those programs operated from the very beginning under the concept of “ concurrency ,” at least in the extreme sense we know it today. Under this notion, the Pentagon deliberately purchased hundreds of Joint Strike Fighters knowing that it would have to implement fixes and modifications as time went on. Pitched a cost-saving move, by the F-35 JPO’s own admission , this has in fact driven up costs, led to schedule delays, and will require additional spending as time goes on. Many of the early production jets have very low availability rates and will not be able to be called upon for combat operations. On June 10, 2019 , Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon reached a handshake deal to buy nearly 480 more F-35s across three future production blocks for a total of approximately $34 billion. This was hailed as a milestone given that it would see the average unit cost for the F-35A model finally drop below $80 million. But many of these aircraft will arrive immediately in need of additional updates, all of which could lead to an increase in real costs down the line. This is to say nothing of the costs it will take to upgrade the jets the U.S. military, as well as foreign F-35 program partners, already have. On June 3, 2019 , the F-35 JPO announced the delivery of the 400th Joint Strike Fighter, the bulk of which have gone to the U.S. Air Force, Marines, and Navy. This total production, which the Pentagon insists on describing as “low-rate initial production,” equates to more aircraft than are in the total Air Force inventories of nine NATO members — Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, and Slovenia — combined . It also doesn’t take into account the massive unique infrastructure costs incurred by the program which will continue to add up as the aircraft is fielded in greater numbers. Lockheed Martin’s F-35 production line in Texas., Lockheed Martin Earlier this year, the Pentagon informed Congress that the expected total cost of the F-35 program across its entire lifecycle was at least $22 billion more than previously reported due to the ongoing Block 4 upgrade program . Overall, the U.S. military now expects to spend $1.196 trillion just to operate and maintain its Joint Strike Fighters through 2070. In addition, the naval aviator’s comments, along with the defenses Lockheed Martin and the F-35 JPO offered to Defense News , underscore what is perhaps a larger issue. There has and continues to be a worrisome lack of transparency surrounding the long-troubled F-35 program. There is, at best, a tone-deaf effort to spin the details about the Joint Strike Fighter program and, at worst, deliberate attempts to obfuscate serious continuing issues with the aircraft while playing-up a fantasy narrative of sorts. Defense News noted that it appeared to be only after they contacted the F-35 JPO for their stories that the office created the “CAT 1-B” definition, establishing a less severe subcategory in what seemed to be an effort to downplay the severity the situation overall. The reports that the outlet obtained reportedly make no such distinction. An Air Force F-16C Viper, in the background, flies with an F-35A., USAF It has repeatedly emerged that Lockheed Martin’s and the F-35 JPO’s public attitude is almost entirely at odds with their internal candor about the state of the Joint Strike Fighter program and the issues it still faces going forward. The Pentagon’s own Inspector General recently cleared Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, of any unethical behavior in relation to the F-35 in no small part based on the argument that harsh criticism of the management and execution of the Joint Strike Fighter program is pervasive in the halls of the Pentagon. A briefing that the F-35 JPO gave to then-President-Elect Donald Trump in 2016, which The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, only reinforces this view. The slides included comments such as “marked improvement, but not perfect” and “difficult to overcome a troubled past, but program is improving.” This apparently extends to foreign partners, too. Though it was previously known that a number of countries were worried about the security risks that ALIS presented, the documents Defense News obtained say that two unspecified members of the Joint Strike Fighter program outright threatened to drop out over the issue. It is very possible that these countries were Italy and Norway, major participants in the program , who helped pay for the development of the ALIS Sovereign Data Management system. A Norwegian F-35A., USAF None of this is to say that the F-35 program hasn’t made positive strides in recent years, but, as Defense News’ latest reports show, there is a distinct lack of candor about ongoing issues and what is getting done to tackle them. Regardless of the realities of the F-35, there is absolutely no denying that this policy of being reactive rather than proactive has hurt the public perception of the program. This is especially baffling because the F-35 is far beyond the point of cancellation. Even significantly reduced purchases aren’t really a possibility in the near term. The program is literally too big to fail. In other words, the F-35 is here to stay and there are many good things about the aircraft that are abundantly clear . But considering it has a relatively assured future, it is puzzling why the program hasn’t become more open about ongoing issues and has instead kept pushing a somewhat fictional and often anecdotal narrative. By the end of 2019, the Pentagon expects to have decided whether or not to approve full-rate production of the F-35, which could see the annual production of the jets nearly double within four years. Before and after that decision gets made, the American public deserves regular, honest accounting of exactly what they have and will be paying for in the future. The program will only be stronger for it. Contact the authors: joe@thedrive.com and tyler@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway Air F-35 Fighters Stealth"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the Pentagon pushes to correct the readiness pit many of its aircraft communities had fallen into in recent years and show off its might to potential adversaries, so-called ‘elephant walk’ readiness drills have become far more common than they had been in the past . Now Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego and its resident Marine Air Group 16 of the Third Marine Air Wing has buzzed into the fray with a huge elephant walk consisting of a whopping 40 aircraft—26 MV-22 Osprey and 14 CH-53 Super Stallions—sourced from seven resident squadrons. The pictures from this grandiose show of force, which also coincided with the observance of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, are downright awesome. This is an incredible amount of vertical lift capability to pull onto a single runway at one time and take to the air. And neither of the airframes involved have possessed exceptional readiness in recent years, with the CH-53E community, in particular, now emerging from an especially dark period. The Osprey fleet’s combined readiness still hovers around 50 percent . U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Craig LeFlore, commanding officer of MAG-16, stated the following in an official release : “MAG-16 has executed our maximum flight event to demonstrate the combat readiness of our MAG and to tell the MAG-16 story… We want to test ourselves. If there is a crisis somewhere in the world, our job is to be ready to respond to that crisis at a moment’s notice. MAG-16 is a force in readiness. This mass launch is not just for show, the majority of these aircraft will go out and conduct tactical training after their launch. Training that makes your Marines the most ready when our nation is least ready. I can’t think of a better way for the MAG to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day and the accomplishments of those who have gone before us. … This launch not only demonstrated the capability within the MAG, it served as tremendous motivation for the Marines and Sailors who worked so hard to make it possible. I couldn’t be prouder of their accomplishments” One can only imagine the long hours the maintainers of these highly complex and, in the case of the Super Stallions , aging aircraft put in preparing for this event.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2020",Japan Picked An Aegis Ashore Site Based On Miscalculations From Google Earth,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japanese officials have admitted that they miscalculated the angles of elevation of various mountains when deciding on where to base one of its two future Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense systems. This led them to determine the only suitable site in eastern Japan was the Araya Maneuver Area, though nine others may have been viable. Takashi Gomi, in charge of the Japanese Ministry of Defense’s strategy planning division, disclosed the error to reporters during a press conference in the city of Akita on June 10, 2019 . The Japan Ground Self Defense Force’s (JGSDF) Araya Maneuver Area, which already hosts Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, is situated in Akita. In January 2019 , Japan’s Ministry of Defense had announced that it would conduct a review of the planned Aegis Ashore site’s environmental and health impacts, stemming from concerns from local officials and residents about possible negative effects of electromagnetic radiation from the system’s powerful Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) radar. Japan’s Aegis Ashore sites will use the LRDR in place of the original system’s AN/SPY-1 radar. Confusion about scale conversions while using Google Earth’s three-dimensional virtual globe function led to officials misinterpreting the angle of elevation of certain mountains by more than 10 degrees in some cases, according to Gomi. The Japanese Ministry of Defense had laid out a requirement to base the two Aegis Ashore systems at sites where there were no obstacles with angles of elevation of more than 10 degrees within a certain distance. Members of the press watch as trucks associated with Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Patriot surface-to-air missile systems arrive at the Araya Maneuver Area amid a spate of North Korean missile launches in 2009., Kyodo via AP Images The issue here is the need to provide a good line of sight for the LRDR to be able to detect and track targets in order to cue the Aegis Ashore system’s SM-3 interceptors . If the radar does not have a clear view, it could limit the time available between spotting a threat and engaging it. This may become a less significant issue as time goes on. On Dec. 11, 2018, the U.S. military successfully conducted its first ever test of an Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system using the what it calls the “ engage-on-remote ” concept of operations. What this means is that off-board sensors spotted and tracked the target, then provided fire control quality targeting data to the interceptor launch site. Japan could conceivably network the Aegis Ashore sites in the future together with other radars and sensors, on land and at sea, including those on the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Aegis BMD-equipped 27DDG destroyers .

Gomi offered no explanation as to why this was the case, according to Japanese newspaper The Mainichi Shimbun . This might come as a shock to local authorities, who already said they had gotten little information about how Araya got selected in the first place. “After multiple explanations, I was told that, because the Japanese government cannot just use whatever land it wants, negotiations with private landowners weren’t that simple,” Kenta Suzuki, a member the Akita Prefectural Assembly belonging to Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party, which presently control’s the country’s Parliament, had told The Japan Times in December 2018 . “Only national government-owned land, or at least prefectural-owned land, would work, and that’s what I think led to the decision to choose Araya.” Gomi also did not say whether similar errors had occurred in the decision to locate the second Aegis Ashore site in the JGSDF’s Mutsumi Maneuver Area, which occupies areas within the cities of Hagi and Abu in western Japan. The Japanese government approved the Aegis Ashore plan in December 2017 and the U.S. government approved the planned sale of the necessary components, ancillary items, and associated services, valued at approximately $2.15 billion in total, in January 2019 . Japan’s goal is to have both sites operational by 2023 and is no doubt looking to avoid any delays in that schedule. The U.S. military’s Aegis Ashore missile defense test complex in Kauai, Hawaii. Japan’s Aegis Ashore facilities will be similar, but will notably feature a different radar from the one seen here., Kyodo via AP Images It’s certainly true that Japan has pushed ahead very quickly with its Aegis Ashore procurement , primarily due to increasing threats from North Korea. Despite a lengthy pause in North Korean missile launches amid a thaw in relations with South Korea and the United States, the regime in Pyongyang has recently restarted testing of short-range ballistic missiles . North Korea also has a long history of test firing missiles and sending them either flying into the East China Sea that separates the two countries or even across Japan’s home islands into the Pacific Ocean. Aegis Ashore would also give Japan a broader regional ballistic missile defense shield that could help protect outlying areas, including the Senkaku islands, which are at the center of a long-standing and increasingly hostile territorial dispute with China. There is also a possibility that the Aegis Ashore sites could transform into a more offensive ground-based weapon system with the addition of multi-purpose SM-6 missiles or Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles in place of the SM-3s. The U.S. government claims that Aegis Ashore is incapable of accepting the Tomahawk, a decision it took to ensure compliance with the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , with Russia. But Aegis Ashore uses a version of the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System , other variants of which are found on various ships in the U.S. Navy and other navies around the world and can accept these missiles. It remains a matter of contention between U.S. and Russian authorities about how difficult it would be to convert the land-based version to use other missiles beyond the SM-3. A clear offensive capability could also run afoul of Japan’s pacifist constitution, though there has been a growing push in the country to revise Article Nine, which prohibits non-defensive military activities. A US Navy briefing slide showing the general components found on variants of the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System, including the version that Aegis Ashore employs., USN Depending on the exact specifications of the LRDR version Japan will use for its Aegis Ashore sites, the radar may also have a secondary intelligence gathering role. China has previously criticized the U.S. military’s deployment of AN/TPY-2 radars associated with the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system to both Japan and South Korea. Chinese authorities have expressed concern that it could be used to spy on activities within its territory, though it is unclear whether the radar has any such capability. Whatever the case, the Japanese government seems adamant about establishing a land-based ballistic missile defense layer within the next four years. It remains to be seen whether the calculation error that led to selecting the site in Akita will have any significant impact on those plans by giving additional fuel to existing opposition from local officials or the public. But, if nothing else, one imagines that the Japanese Ministry of Defense will make sure to triple check their math when looking at potential locations for any major new military installations in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 5, 2018",Pentagon To Sell-Off Its AH-1W Super Cobra Attack Helicopter Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department of Defense plans on putting its surplus fleet of AH-1W Super Cobras up for sale on the international arms market. The news comes as the USMC continues to outfit its light attack helicopter squadrons with new-build AH-1Z “Viper” derivatives of the Bell design, which traces its roots directly to the iconic UH-1 Iroquois/Huey. A recent business opportunity posting over at Fedbizops.gov describes the need for flight and maintenance training, sustainment, and refitting “Whisky Cobras” with new commercially available off-the-shelf avionics upgrades in preparation for foreign transfers of the type which will begin this year. The idea being that a foreign power can purchase the airframes and have them kitted out as they see fit, and also have available contractor support to make the sale a “turn-key” operation. An industry day is planned for January 24th for any companies that are looking to support the initiative with their services and products. DoD The AH-1W’s cockpit is antiquated by today’s standards, incorporating “steam” gauges, optical targeting scopes, and even a heads up display (HUD) for the pilot that looks like it was ripped out of a light fighter from the 1980s. But even though their system may not be cutting-edge, the aircraft remain brutally effective at their job. A new “glass” cockpit would only substantially increase their lethality. The posting also states that any new cockpit configurations will have to work with the aircraft’s existing weapons fit. The U.S. Army previously liquidated its fleet of less capable single-engine AH-1 models that were pulled from service in the early 2000s, a process that ended in 2010. Originally the AH-1Z program intended to remanufacture all but 58 of the 226 AH-1Zs it was slated to acquire from existing AH-1W airframes, but that changed quickly as the program gained momentum. The price difference between new-build and remanufactured helicopters shrunk dramatically, so it really didn’t make sense to go through all the effort and logistics of reusing older AH-1W airframes that also still held value. In the end only 37 AH-1Ws were reworked into AH-1Zs, and that effort ended in 2014. As such, there is a large fleet of Whisky Cobras that could potentially be sold off as surplus to a foreign buyer, or donated via foreign military aid initiatives. Of course any sale, or gift for that matter, would have to be approved by the U.S. State Department. the AH-1Z “Venom” now reigns supreme as the USMC’s primary attack helicopter. , USN Surplus AH-1Ws hitting the market will join nearly as many OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopters which are also being exported as surplus after the Army controversially retired the type last year—both to the chagrin of attack and scout helicopter manufacturers who see flooding the market with affordable used airframes as detrimental to their business prospects. But the cobras will likely prove even more attractive than the Kiowa Warriors due to their more potent combat capabilities and more powerful twin-engine design. The existence of relatively cheap and upgradable Whisky Cobras could even hurt Bell’s looming export success of the UH-1Y/AH-1Z family of helicopters. Cash-strapped Eastern European militaries who are seeking to add the next generation Huey family to their inventories could move toward acquiring upgraded AH-1W for at least part of their attack helicopter needs. Smaller countries, like the Baltic States, could even acquire these helicopters to dramatically build up their anti-armor defenses against a potential Russian incursion. Where the AH-1Ws will likely get a lot of interest is from countries that are facing increasing internal threats from extremist forces or are experiencing major instability along their borders. Countries like Jordan have already benefitted from second-hand Cobras to help protect its borders from extremist infiltration. The issue is so strategically important that Israel gifted Jordan a number of surplus single engine Cobras in recent years to help satisfy this particular mission set. The type could also come in handy in places like the Philippines, where precision air support in urban areas is becoming a major factor in the country’s ability to beat back ISIS aligned forces. AH-1Ws could even find a place in Africa. Nigeria in particular showed interest in acquiring surplus attack helicopters from the U.S. but was turned down in the past. This could change under the Trump Administration. Tunisia is another possible taker. Tyler Rogoway The AH-1W descends directly from the Sea Cobra, and was originally designed with deploying aboard amphibious assault ships in mind. Considering the boom in helicopter carrier acquisition around the globe in recent years, the AH-1Ws could be a very attractive and cost effective option for outfitting these ships with a hard-hitting, multi-role attack capability. For instance, Thailand could purchase a squadron for its aircraft carrier the HTMS Chakri Naruebet, a ship that lost its Harrier force a decade ago and could use Cobras to help bring back some of its offensive punch. Brazil, which is getting the Royal Navy’s HMS Ocean, could also purchase surplus USMC Cobras to give the ship’s future air wing some serious bite. Doing so would also help to compensate for the fact that country’s only fixed-wing carrier will never sail again . USN The list goes on and on, but clearly we can expect these aircraft to be relatively hot commodities in the coming months. It’s also worth mentioning the possibility that these aircraft could be utilized by Iraq and Afghanistan, the latter of which still depends on Russian-built gunships, although armed Black Hawks are part of the questionable transition plan over to American made rotary-wing assets. USMC The Cobra, even without any upgrades, is well adapted to operating in austere environments and is simple to maintain compared to many of its more complex international counterparts. It can also deploy the TOW missile in combat, which is both economical and well suited for counter-insurgency operations. With all this in mind, the Whisky Cobra could give Afghanistan an injection of precision air support it desperately needs, and without costing the American taxpayer huge sums of money. Who knows, a handful of the aircraft could even find their way into mercenary hands, at least that was the founder of Blackwater International’s plan when he pitched taking over the air war in Afghanistan from the DoD. DoD The old adage “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure” couldn’t be more accurate when it comes to the worldwide arms market, with unwanted American equipment being highly attractive to countries in decent standing with Washington. But these Cobras are an especially relevant opportunity, and considering the Trump Administration’s more laissez-faire approach to arms exports, it will be very interesting to see who grabs for them first. The USMC’s transition from AH-1W to AH-1Z should be complete sometime in 2020.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Here Is The Navy’s Ultra Ambitious New Plan To Get To 355 Ships In Just 15 Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s latest long-term shipbuilding plan lays out an aggressive path to achieving its long-standing goal of having 355 ships by 2034, two decades earlier than its last estimate. But this ambitious plan isn’t just about buying extra ships and the service says that when, and if, it reaches that total force size, it will cost $40 billion just to operate and maintain all of those vessels, more than thirty percent more than it spends on its fleets now. The Navy published the latest edition of what it calls its “Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels,” on Mar. 21, 2019 . It covers existing and planned procurement from Fiscal Year 2020 through Fiscal Year 2049. By the end of the 2020 fiscal cycle, the service expects to have 301 ships. The goal is to get that to the 355-ship target in Fiscal Year 2034, at which time the size of the overall force will hit a plateau. “The timeframe for achieving the overall inventory [of 355 ships] was accelerated by approximately 20 years over last year’s plan,” the report explains. “Continual application of these imperatives, combined with Congressional support, on time funding, and strong industry response could yield additional opportunities for acceleration.” The general track of the Navy’s fleets over the next 30 years as outlined in the latest long-term shipbuilding plan, which starts in Fiscal Year 2020., USN The “principle driver” in this new timeline for getting to 355 ships was the Navy’s decision to extend the planned service life of its early Flight I and II Arleigh Burke -class destroyers from 35 to 45 years. The service has also previously talked about squeezing as many as 50 years out of later Flight IIA variants and the upcoming enhanced Flight III ships . A look at the new features coming on Flight III Arleigh Burkes compared to previous variants., GAO In addition, the Flight IIA ships are now set to receive a major radar upgrade in the coming years in the form of a variant of Raytheon’s AN/SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense (AMDR) radar. This radar is also going on the Flight III vessels and and is a core requirement for final design of the future Large Surface Combatant (LSC). The video below describes how the AN/SPY-6(V)1 AMDR  for the Flight III Arleigh Burke -class ships works and the benefits the new design offers. The Navy plans to continue buying additional Flight III Arleigh Burkes through the 2025 Fiscal Year, after which it will shift to purchases of the forthcoming LSC. The service had planned to begin procuring the LSC, a ship still very much in the conceptual stage of development, in the 2023 fiscal cycle, but it confirmed it was pushing that start date back by two years earlier in March 2019 . The LSC is slated to eventually replace the Navy’s Ticonderoga -class cruisers and at least a portion of its Arleigh Burkes . With this in mind, the service plans to shift funds away from extending the life of the six oldest Ticonderogas , retiring those ships between 2021 and 2022 instead, in favor of other priorities, including the LSC program itself. The service will still modernize at least some of the remaining 16 cruisers, but the full shipbuilding schedule will now include a dip in the kind of capabilities these ships offer, which you can read about more here , due to the delay in the beginning of the LSC procurement. The Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Chancellorsville under maintenance in Japan., USN The latest naval shipbuilding plan also includes major changes in plans for the Navy’s carrier fleets. The service now plans to buy two additional Ford -class carriers in the 2020 Fiscal Year, instead of one. Whether this so-called “block buy” of the pair of flattops is actually a cost-effective measure has been the subject of debate , but the Navy insists it will save approximately $4 billion that can be spent elsewhere in the long term. At the same time, the Navy is looking to cancel the planned major overhaul and refueling of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman , again in order to redirect funding to support a “more lethal balance of high-end, survivable platforms … and complementary capabilities from emerging technologies .” This decision, and the details surrounding it, have been particularly curious, something The War Zone has already examined in major detail. The Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman ., USN When it comes to the Navy’s surface fleets, it’s long-term planning also reflects plans to purchase at least 20 new frigates of yet to be selected design, referred to at present as FFG(X). Earlier in March 2019 , the service issued a draft request for proposals laying out the purchase of an initial block of up to 10 ships beginning in 2020 . This would mean the Navy would take delivery of the first ship by 2026 if everything keeps to that schedule, according to the contracting documents . To further help meet its near-term goals, the Navy decided to defer purchases of two more San Antonio -class landing platform dock amphibious ships to some time after 2024 . The service is also accelerating the retirement of its Avenger -class minesweepers in favor of a new mix of Littoral Combat Ships permanently equipped with a mine countermeasures mission module , additional mine countermeasures kits that can go on any available “vessels of opportunity,” mine-sweeping teams embarked on ships, and unmanned undersea vehicles . The Avenger -class minesweeper USS Dextrous ., USN The long-range shipbuilding plan also makes brief mention of the Navy’s significant push into unmanned surface vessels. However, the Navy has no plans as of yet to include any of these drone ships, even the 10 large displacement unmanned surface vessels it plans to buy in the coming years, which you can read about more here , in its overall ship totals. “The mix of ships will be biased towards DDGs [ Aleigh Burkes ] until reaching individual inventory objectives across all ship types, a timeline principally driven by SSNs [ attack submarines ] and CVNs [carriers],” the new shipbuilding plan notes. “Numerically, SSNs remain the furthest from the inventory objective and options are being explored regarding expanding production.” To help rectify this and keep up the pace for expanding its overall fleet size, the Navy is looking to purchase an extra Virginia -class attack submarine in the 2020 Fiscal Year. On top of that, there are now plans to refuel two Los Angles -class attack submarines to extend their services lives and the Navy has identified five more boats in this class that it could overhaul if desired. The newest Virginia -class submarine, USS South Dakota , which the Navy commissioned in February 2019., USN The Navy does have a plan to develop and acquire an entirely new class of attack submarine, referred to as SSN(X) , but this would contribute to the sustainment of a 355-ship fleet, rather than assisting in reaching that goal in the first place. The service doesn’t plan to receive any such submarines until around 2040. Similarly, the near- and medium-term plans to begin purchasing the Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs, and start replacing Ohio -class SSBNs, as well as ships in that class the Navy converted to guided missile submarines , or SSGNs, remains largely unchanged. The service is looking at possibly purchasing additional Columbias and a new Large Payload Submarine in the future, but again these would arrive after the total number of ships hits 355. A Navy’s path to 355 ships gets rounded out thanks to a number of auxiliaries, one of the most notable of which will be the Common Hull Auxiliary Multi-Mission Platform ( CHAMP ). This program envisions a common, modular hullform that can serve as the basis for a fleet of vessels to take over for aging ships filling five diverse mission sets: sealift , aviation logistics support , hospital , repair tender , and command and control . How to eventually replace the USNS Mercy hospital ship, seen here, and her sister ship USNS Comfort , has been a particularly pointed debate in recent years., USN The Navy expects to begin buying the first CHAMP sealift variant in 2025. The service has also already received authority from congress to begin buying used, foreign-made ships for sealift purposes to help rapidly meet demand. There’s already a looming crisis in the Navy’s Military Sealift Command both about total capacity and concerns about the survivability of its ships in a major, high-end conflict, which you can read about in more detail here . But it remains to be seen whether the Navy can keep to this ambitious schedule. There are already numerous roadblocks that could crop up just in the discussions in Congress about the final defense budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year. An increasingly vocal bloc of lawmakers is already upset about the plans for the Truman ‘s early retirement and is planning to do everything in their power to block that from happening . It looks as if legislators may be increasingly more amenable to retiring the six Ticonderogas , but they have soundly rejected those proposals in the past, too. There are serious concerns about the state of the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford and whether those deficiencies may still filter down to subsequent carriers in that class , despite the Navy’s continued efforts to mitigate the problems . This latest long-term shipbuilding plan could cause a different carrier-related crisis in that there is not even an apparent attempt to meet the legal requirement to have 11 active flattops at any one time beyond Fiscal Year 2025. It’s fair to say that the service hasn’t really met this mandate in years , but there was always a plan going forward to work toward that goal. The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford ., Steve Earley/The Virginian-Pilot via AP Many of the surface ships the Navy expects to buy in the coming years are not yet well defined, either, which makes it hard to assess how realistic the purchase and delivery schedules might be. At the same time, the service’s major push toward acquiring unmanned surface vessels, especially large displacement types that might well qualify as “small surface combatants” for accounting purposes in the future, may help further bolster the Navy’s overall force size. Drone ships of all sizes will have significant impacts on the service’s overall concepts of operation and broad requirements going forward. “The Navy will continue to move quickly to assess the resultant naval power delivered by these systems, moving forward based on demonstrated, evidence-based capability,” the shipbuilding report says. “Navy will continue to push aggressively to deliver these capabilities and evaluate progress, and will work closely with Congress as this develops.” Submarines, which the Navy acknowledges are its biggest challenge in getting to 355 ships, also pose significant risks for the plan. The service has been trying to get shipbuilders to ramp up production, but in doing so has experienced increasing quality control issues. Once a model program for delivering on schedule, the construction of new Virginia -class submarines has become beset by delays . The Virginia -class USS Minnesota under construction in 2012., Newport News Shipbuilding There are fears that this will only get worse when the same yards begin building Columbia -class SSBNs, a class of boats that is both vital to national security, but that is already proving to be hugely expensive . The latest shipbuilding plan “captures the fiscal challenge of sustaining the shipbuilding plan while introducing serial production of the new Columbia -class,” according to the Navy. While true, it leaves little margin for any major potential future cost growth, which could have major impacts on the rest of the service’s long-term shipbuilding goals. Even if the Navy does reach the 355-ship mark in the 2034 Fiscal Year, the service has noted that it will cost around $40 billion dollars just to operate and maintain those ships, a 34-percent increase over how much it spends to sustain its present fleets. That will grow to $55 billion over the next 15 years despite the service not planning to increase the total number of ships it has. The estimated sustainment costs fleet-wide from Fiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2049., USN This doesn’t take into account the increasing difficulties the Navy is having in maintaining the ships and submarines it already has at the funding levels it has now. The day after it made the long-range shipbuilding plan publicly available, the service released its first ever long-range maintenance and modernization report, which highlight many of these ongoing issues, particularly the lack of dry dock capacity, both organically and immediately available in the private sector. The Navy itself has just four shipyards still in operation, all of which are in need of major upgrades and rehabilitation to support both existing ships and those the service expects to purchase in the future. Efforts to shift some of that burden to certified private companies has been ad hoc and has often lengthened the time and cost of the entire process since these shipyards need to go through a contracting process in each case and then go about hiring additional workers and setting up supply chains to support the work. “We must avoid feast and famine cycles that erode both the repair industrial base and the underlying vendor supply base,” the long-term maintenance and modernization report explains. “Consistent funding matched to steady demand for work will enable the repair base, public and private, to grow to meet the needs of the 355-ship Navy.” An overview of the Navy’s own organic Naval Shipyard (NSY) capacity at present. The four yards it has are the Portsmouth Navy Yard (PNS), the Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY), the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS & IMF), and the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY & IMF)., USN A look at critical upgrades necessary at the Navy’s shipyards going forward., USN The Navy credits “stable, on-time funding” on multiple occasions in its new long-term shipbuilding plan for providing this pathway to not only hit 355 ships, but do so two decades ahead of its previous plan. It’s certainly true that the significant increases in defense spending under President Donald Trump’s administration will help sustain the general growth the Navy is seeing now as the result of purchases made under President Barack Obama. By the same token, however, any suggestion that defense budgets might contract or that it might not be possible to sustain major increases in spending in the next decade or two, could force the Navy to once again reassess its future dramatically. Congressional intervention on specific items, such as a push to save the Truman or a decision to add in additional ships that don’t fit within the overall plan, could have cascading impacts that might alter the overall schedule. “The reason @USNavy will hit 300 ships (& 308 in ’21) is bc [sic; because] of ships I built in [the] @BarackObama Admin,” former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus Tweeted out on Mar. 13, 2019. “Takes a long time to build & even longer to rebuild a shrinking fleet. Unless this admin keeps building at my pace, fleet will shrink again.” There is always the possibility for dramatic shifts in defense policy and national interests, as well, that could set the tone going forward or even call into question the goal of a 355-ship Navy. Whether or not President Trump wins another term in 2020, the Navy has at least two more Presidents and many more Congresses to look forward to before it reaches its desired force size. Recruiting and retaining the people necessary to man and support these ships is also in question. The Navy is in the midst of a personnel shortage now , before adding more than 50 new ships to its force structure, and it expects to face recruiting challenges in the future. “The shipbuilding plan realistically supports this dynamic environment and reflects the unwavering imperative to remain fiscally balanced,” the Navy declares in the annual report. “Accordingly, the plan’s most valuable feature is scalability, and by setting the conditions for an enduring industrial base as a top priority the Navy is postured to more aggressively grow the force with additional resources, or to responsibly shrink the force with fewer resources, assuming the steady profiles are sustained.” That last part of the sentence – “assuming the steady profiles are sustained” – is the most important. The Navy has outlined a very ambitious roadmap to get it to the size it says it needs to be in order to confront the challenges and threats it faces now and will in the future. It’s also one that does not necessarily leave a lot of margin for delays, changes in priorities, drops in funding, or any other unforeseen issues. The Navy has certainly charted a course to get to a 355-ship fleet in 15 years. Now, it will be up to the service, the Pentagon, and Congress to keep the ambitious plan moving at the pace it needs to succeed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 29, 2018",Turkish Lawyers Demand Raid On Incirlik Air Base And Arrest Of U.S. Military Personnel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A group of independent Turkish lawyers has petitioned the country’s courts to arrest nearly a dozen U.S. military personnel over alleged links to a coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2016 and a leaked document purports to show that they were directly involved in planning the plot. These latest accusations again call into question whether it still makes sense for the U.S. government to store dozens of nuclear weapons at Incirlik Air Base in the country or even use that facility as a springboard for conventional military operations . The Turkish legal non-governmental organization Association for Social Justice and Aid, which includes prominent backers of Erdoğan’s government and enjoys support from the country’s authorities, filed the charges with the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office on Aug. 3, 2018. The 60-page criminal complaint also calls for Turkish officials to shut down U.S. military flights from Incirlik, a portion of which the U.S. Air Force has sole control over, and execute a search warrant at the facility to look for additional evidence. So far, the Turkish government does not appear to have acted on any of the charges. The charges claimed the Americans were “attempting to destroy the constitutional order [of Turkey], attempting to prevent partially or totally the Turkish government from exercising its authority and endangering the sovereignty of the Turkish state,” according to a translation by the Stockholm Center for Freedom , a group Turkish journalists operating in self-imposed exile in Sweden. As such, authorities needed to “arrest the commanders of the U.S Air Force who are the superiors of the soldiers based at Incirlik and took a role in the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.” The complaint specifically calls for the arrest of 11 individuals, but it’s not clear if any of them are still assigned to Incirlik. The first two are U.S. Air Force Colonels John Walker and Michael Manion, who were, respectively, the commander and vice commander of the 39th Air Base Wing at Incirlik in 2016. US Air Force Colonel John Walker, in the green flight suit, speaks with then-U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken at Incirlik Air Base in 2015., USAF It does look like they might have originally intended to seek the arrest of American personnel at the base now, though. U.S. Air Force Colonel David Eaglen was commander of the 39th Air Base Wing until July 10, 2018 . But other current and former members of the U.S. military that the Association for Social Justice and Aid wants the Turkish government to detain were never there. These include the present U.S. Central Command chief U.S. Army General Joseph Votel and Director of Regional Affairs for the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Rick Boutwell. Now retired U.S. Army General John Campbell, who was last in charge of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan, is named in the group’s complaint, too. On Aug. 7, 2018, the Turkish newspaper Yeni Şafak , which also has strong ties to the president and routinely voices its support for his administration, then released images it says are of a memorandum detailing plans for martial law during the abortive coup with metadata that showed the author’s name was “John.” Turkish officials reportedly found the document while searching through Emails belonging to Hüseyin Ömür, who served as an aide to General Mehmet Partigöç, a military officer implicated in the plot to boot Erdoğan from office. A screenshot showing the meta data for the purported “coup document” that shows the author “John.”, via Yeni Şafak According to the report, Turkish officials are now claiming they plan to investigate anyone named John who was in Turkey at the time. The clear suggestion, however, is that this individual could be Colonel Walker or former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass , though Yeni Şafak offered no additional evidence to substantiate those claims. Yeni Şafak has also accused retired U.S. Army General Campbell of having a hand in the coup attempt , without evidence, in the past. There have also been previous allegations that Ambassador Bass might have a connection to the incident and Incirlik has been at the center of various conspiracy theories given that the Turkish Air Force, which operates its own facilities at the base, was heavily involved in the plot to overthrow  Erdoğan. But tensions between the United States and Turkey have been steadily rising since the coup attempt occurred in general. Erdoğan and his supporters insist that Fethullah Gülen , an Islamic cleric and former political ally of the president who now lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, was the mastermind of the plot . Gülen has been an outspoken critic of Erdoğan’s steadily more dictatorial policies. Former US Ambassador to Turkey John Bass in 2016., US Department of State Turkish authorities have yet to present the necessary evidence to their American counterparts to support an extradition request. Instead, they have reportedly sought alternative means of detaining Gülen, including a reported kidnapping plot involving former National Security Advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn . More recently, Erdoğan has sought to use an American evangelical Christian minister, Andrew Brunson, as a bargaining chip . Brunson got swept up in a wave of arrests following the coup attempt and stands accused of terrorism and seeking to undermine the state, charges his lawyers say are unsubstantiated and purely political . https://youtube.com/watch?v=kGfEC2Ztj9g The legal action from the Association for Social Justice and Aid and Yeni Şafak ’s document leak both came soon after the Trump Administration sanctioned Turkey’s Justice Minister Abdülhamit Gül and Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu over a failure to fully free Brunson from pre-trial detention. In July 2018, Turkish authorities released Brunson from prison , where he had been for more than 20 months, but then put him under house arrest instead. Since April 2018 , Brunson’s detention has become increasingly wrapped up in a separate U.S.-Turkey spat over the latter country’s decision to purchase S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia. There are concerns that those the presence of those systems, and the Russian specialists necessary to training Turkish personnel how to use them, could compromise secrets related to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , an issue you can read about in more depth here and here . U.S. lawmakers have now moved to block the delivery of the jets, and/or support services essential to their operation, unless the Trump Administration can assure them that any risks are sufficiently mitigated and that Brunson is receiving fair treatment. Turkey, not surprisingly, has been highly critical of these moves. American and Turkish authorities have already sparred over the matter of U.S. military support to Kurdish groups in neighboring Syria that Turkey says are linked to domestic terrorists . The United States has expressed its own reservations about its fellow NATO member’s strengthening ties with Russia in the region and more broadly, as well. These complicated and intertwined issues all come together against the backdrop of the fact that the U.S. military continues to rely heavily on Incirlik and other sites in Turkey to support its operations in Syria, as well as broader regional security plans. For example, the U.S. Army operates a powerful AN/TPY-2 radar at a separate Turkish facility as part of the United States’ ballistic missile defense shield. A Turkish para-military police officer during an operation in the immediate aftermath of the coup attempt in 2016., Marius Becker/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images By far, the biggest concern is what impact worsening U.S.-Turkish relations might have on the dozens of B61 nuclear bombs that the U.S. Air Force stores at Incirlik . The United States has nuclear weapon sharing agreements with four other NATO members – Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands – but the bombs in Turkey would be for its use only during a major crisis. Since the coup attempt, we at The War Zone , among others, have called the safety and viability of this plan into question. The latest legal challenge against personnel who worked at Incirlik and the insinuation that Americans at the base and elsewhere were involved in the coup attempt can only further weaken the level of trust between the U.S. military and its ostensible Turkish allies, no matter what American officials might say . In addition, this could only cause both sides to question whether the other is a viable partner in any future conflict, let alone a nuclear one. Turkey has already limited the U.S. military’s ability to use the base for conventional operations, directly or indirectly, due to conflicting political agendas more than once in the past. B61 nuclear bombs., DOD The willingness of Turkish authorities to impose restrictions and of private, but politically connected individuals to accuse American personnel of complicity in crimes without any clear evidence only further raises the question of whether Incirlik serves as a reliable strategic lilypad at all. As of March 2018, the United States had already reduced its use of the facility for combat operations in Syria and was reportedly seeking to make some of those reductions permanent. It’s not clear if those plans extended to other sites in the country. And though the U.S. military is working to reduce tensions with Turkish forces and their partners in Syria, it’s hard to see the Pentagon reversing this course any time soon, given the current political situation. A delegation from Turkey touched down in Washington, D.C. on Aug. 8, 2018 , for talks aimed at resolving the issues surrounding Brunson and the sanctions against Justice Minister Gül and Interior Minister Soylu, as well as the general strains between the two NATO members. It’s far too soon to tell whether this diplomatic engagement will actually produce results. That’s not to say things couldn’t change if Erdoğan were to soften various positions and reverse his most authoritarian policies, but the Turkish president has been consistently defiant and has little apparent interest in acquiescing to the various American demands without significant concessions. A US Army soldier launches a hand-held flare in Syria to alert nearby Turkish forces and prevent an accidental exchange of fire during coordinated, but separate patrols by both countries near the contested city of Manbij., US Army And with all this in mind, the question remains about how long the United States can reasonably hope to keep its B61s stored away at Incirlik. It would seem the situation is becoming increasingly untenable overall. If Turkish authorities were to pursue the complaint from the Association for Social Justice and Aid and if that led to the detention of American military personnel at Incirlik, it could undermine any diplomacy between the two countries in the near term and have even more negative consequences in the long-term. Any actual arrests, in particular, would set a precedent that could leave members of the U.S. Air Force, or individuals from any other branch of the American military serving in Turkey, at risk of becoming political prisoners. If nothing else, this would sap morale and breed more distrust between U.S. personnel and their Turkish counterparts. It’s also just an unreasonable situation for American servicemen and women to find themselves in while deployed to facilities on the territory of a treaty ally. All of this would seem to be pushing the United States toward gutting its presence at Incirlik, at least for the time being, even if only to protect American personnel from politically motivated harassment. But doing so could lead to broader changes in how the U.S. military operates in Turkey and perhaps provide the prompt to finally remove its nuclear weapons from the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 29, 2018",Turkey Releases American Pastor But It Doesn’t Mean They’re Getting Their F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After two years in Turkish custody, American pastor Andrew Brunson is a free man and able to return home. In that time, he became a central figure in a diplomatic dispute with the United States over Turkey’s purchase of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system and deliveries of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to the Turkish Air Force. Unfortunately, relations between the U.S. and Turkey remain strained and Congress has put other obstacles in place to try to prevent the Turkish government from getting the stealth fighters. On Oct. 12, 2018, a Turkish court convicted Brunson of terrorism-related charges, which he and his lawyers maintain are politically motivated, but released him, taking into account time served and good behavior. In 2016, Turkey’s government had arrested the evangelical pastor, who had been in the country for more than two decades, as part of a crackdown following a coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “I am an innocent man. I love Jesus. I love Turkey,” Brunson had said in his last remarks to the court in his defense before the verdict came out. “This is the day our family has been praying for – I am delighted to be on my way home to the United States,” he said in a statement after his release. The latest defense policy bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which President Donald Trump signed into law in August 2018, specifically name-checks Brunson as a reason for telling the Pentagon that it cannot facilitate the delivery of F-35s until various conditions are met. By the end of the year, by law, Secretary of Defense Mattis has to submit a report detailing the potential risks posed by Turkey’s plans to operate the stealth fighters alongside the S-400 surface-to-air missile system, as well as potential threats to other military systems the U.S. supplies to the Turkish government. The review must also include an assessment of what would happen if Turkey, which produces a significant number of components for F-35s, were to get kicked out of the Joint Strike Fighter program. Lastly, Congress wants the Pentagon to draw up a list of alternatives to the S-400 that the United States or other NATO members could offer to the Turkish military, despite repeated failures to pitch a Western system so far. But Brunson’s release is unlikely to change this situation. The U.S. and Turkish governments reportedly reached a deal that would see the pastor released from prison in exchange for the relaxing of various economic sanctions , including those that have sent Turkey’s national currency, the Lira, plummeting in value . Brunson is “just one of many Americans, U.S. State Department employees, and Western nationals that that [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan continues to hold hostage,” Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Oct. 12, 2018 . “There is still work to be done and President Erdoğan has a long way to go before acting like the NATO ally we expect him to be.” It’s not entirely clear who Sasse might be referring to, but the NDAA also specifically mentions Serkan Golge . A scientist who had worked with NASA and who became a U.S. citizen in 2010, Golge also got arrested in the post-coup period in 2016 for links to Islamic cleric and former Turkish political figure Fethullah Gülen . President Erdoğan has declared Gülen, a former political ally who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, to be the mastermind behind the abortive push to unseat him and has sought his extradition . The U.S. government says it has not received enough evidence to support the charges against him. It has long appeared that Brunson and Golge were to be bargaining chips to exchange for Gülen. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan., Ralf Hirschberger/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images U.S.-Turkey ties are still cold over the U.S. government’s support for Kurdish forces in Syria , which the Turkish government sees as a direct threat to its own regional interests. There is also the matter of an entirely unfounded conspiracy theory that says the United States, or at least senior officials, were among those behind the 2016 coup attempt. In August 2018, this prompted a group of activist lawyers tied to Erdoğan to demand the Turkish government arrest various U.S. military personnel and conduct a raid on the American portions of Incirlik Air Base to search for more evidence. So far, there is no indication that any law enforcement organization in the country has responded to those calls for action. None of these political machinations get to the core issue of concerns about whether the Russians could obtain sensitive information about the F-35 via selling the S-400s to Turkey and then having to train Turkish forces in their operation. Other members of NATO have also criticized the plan since the Russian surface-to-air missile systems do not meet the Alliances various standards and requirements for interoperability between member states. A transporter-erector-launcher associated with Russia’s S-400 surface-to-air missile system., Vitaly Kuzmin As already noted, Brunson’s release does not eliminate Congress’ demand for a report from Mattis on the situation within 90 days. The law also does not say that legislators can’t pass additional measures regardless of the Defense Secretary’s conclusions. This could include blocking the Pentagon from facilitating the F-35 deliveries indefinitely or cutting Turkey off from the essential U.S.-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), spare parts, and other sustainment support. Without access to the ALIS network , the Turkish Air Force’s jets wouldn’t have any real combat capability. Turkey began receiving its first F-35s in June 2018, but these aircraft are based in the United States to train the initial cadre of pilots. Mattis, for his part, has noted the increasingly authoritarian attitude of the Turkish government, but has opposed blocking F-35 deliveries or booting Turkey out of the Joint Strike Fighter program entirely, largely for pragmatic reasons. He has publicly stated that the latter course of action would delay the delivery of between 50 and 75 of the jets to the United States and other foreign buyers as it would take between 18 and 24 months to find companies to fill the resulting supply chain gaps. That conclusion is almost certain to make its way into his report to Congress and could set the stage for a tertiary spat between the Pentagon and legislators over the F-35 issue. Turkish officials have issued their own threats to retaliate in some fashion in response to any U.S. government action to block the delivery of the jets, as well. It remains to be seen how the U.S.-Turkish dispute over the F-35s and the S-400s will evolve in the coming months. Though apparently unrelated, the release of pastor Brunson in exchange for the elimination of certain sanctions does suggest Turkey may be increasingly willing to negotiate some sort of compromise. Correction: The original headline said that the Turkish authorities had released pastor Brunson from prison. He had actually been under house arrest prior to his conviction, which could have sent him to prison in Turkey.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 27, 2019",Army Hits Setbacks In Search For Active Protection System To Go On Its Strykers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has still not settled on an active protection system, or APS, for its Stryker wheeled armored vehicles , despite having evaluated four different options in the last two and a half years. The service is now eying additional tests of two of those systems, a medium-weight variant of Israeli firm Rafael’s combat-proven Trophy and the Active Defense System from Germany’s Rheinmetall. Defense News got the update on the hunt for an APS for Strykers from U.S. Army Colonel Glenn Dean, the Army’s Stryker Project Manager, in an interview on June 7, 2019. The service had previously revealed publicly it would need another year to select a system in April 2019 . This came around five months after it had first begun evaluating Trophy-MV and the Active Defense System (ADS). “Unfortunately for Stryker, we have not found a system that is suitable for the platform,” Dean told Defense News . “Both Rheinmetall and the medium-weight Trophy, both have maturity challenges, but the bottom line is that they turned out to not be a suitable fit for Stryker.” Trophy-MV and ADS are what are known as “hard-kill” APS, meaning that they units explosives or kinetic projectiles to physically destroy or deflect incoming threats, including as anti-tank rockets or guided missiles. These types of systems use some combination of sensors, such as infrared cameras or small radars, to spot the hostile projectile and cue the explosives or kinetic interceptors. Trophy uses radars to cue turrets that fire kinetic projectiles, while ADS uses both radars and cameras coupled with strategically placed banks of explosives. You can read more about these systems in detail, respectively, here and here . “We did see some potential in [these] systems,” Dean added. “It is our desire to continue to evaluate them further so we can understand them at a greater level of detail.” The Army can’t be thrilled at the alternative, which would be to identify more potential APS options that would work with the Stryker. In December 2016 , the service began evaluating two other hard-kill systems, Iron Fist , another Israeli product from IMI Systems, and Iron Curtain , which American defense contractor Artis had developed. Iron Fist, like Trophy, used kinetic interceptors, while Iron Curtain involved a ring of explosive charges akin to ADS. Iron Curtain won that head-to-head evaluation, but the Army rejected the system in August 2018 due to difficulties in integrating it into the Stryker platform. The service did separately select Iron Fist as an interim APS for its Bradley Fighting Vehicles . It has also picked the full-size Trophy system to go onto its M1 Abrams tanks . A Stryker equipped with Iron Curtain during a test., US Army “It has proven difficult for us to find a system that is entirely suitable for integration [onto the Stryker],” Dean acknowledged in his interview with Defense News . “It has challenges in its space, weight and power integration.” The Army sees all of these systems as “interim” solutions until its Modular Active Protection Systems (MAPS) program bears fruit. The goal of MAPS is to develop a common, open-architecture control system that will allow the service to combine APS system components into the most optimal configuration for specific vehicles. This could mean doing things like combining the interceptors from the Trophy system with the sensor suite from ADS. MAPS, which you can read about in more detail here , would also enable the rapid substitution or replacement of components as new and advanced options become available. The complete MAPS family of components will also include so-called “soft-kill” options, such as electronic warfare jammers and lasers, which can scramble or confuse sensors and fuzing systems on incoming threats, as well as advanced smoke screening systems . Certain electronic warfare systems may even be able to physically destroy electronic components of a rocket or missile using focused bursts of high-power microwave energy . “Soft-kill may ultimately prove to be particularly well suited for Stryker,” Dean said. The Army has been employing electronic warfare jammers to defeat improvised explosive devices for years now and has begun expanding on those same systems to give them even more potent electronic attack capabilities . It is possible that the service could leverage those developments to turn them into a more robust APS option. But soft-kill systems typically work best as part of a layered defensive suite that also includes hard-kill options. The ability to have a mix of systems could become more important as time goes on and threats evolve to include new and improve countermeasures. The Army officer also noted that even if becomes apparent that no configuration of Trophy-MV and ADS is a practical option for the Stryker, it is possible that these systems could find their way onto other armored vehicles. The service has not picked an APS for its new Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) family. It is also in the early stages of acquiring a Bradley replacement, known as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), and a light tank as part of the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program, both of which have APS requirements. With the growing threat of advanced unguided anti-tank rockets and guided anti-tank missiles , as well as the increasing proliferation of these systems to non-state actors , APS manufacturers are also pitching their various designs as options for light combat vehicles and tactical trucks, too. For example, there are proposals to install Iron Fist, Iron Curtain, and a lightweight version of Trophy on the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), which is now beginning to enter Army and U.S. Marine Corps service. The Marines may eventually have their own APS requirements for their new Amphibious Combat Vehicles , too. A JLTV equipped with Iron Fist., IMI Systems Hopefully, in the coming months, the Army will be able to finally find a suitable defensive system, or suite of systems, for it Strykers to help shield them from rockets and anti-tank missiles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 28, 2019",Navy F/A-18 Pilot Shares New Details About UFO Encounters During Middle East Deployment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of our ongoing and in-depth coverage of the military’s increasingly publicized encounters with UFOs , we want to share with you exclusive correspondence between F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot Ryan Graves and The War Zone . Graves is one of a handful of Navy tactical jet aircrewmen that recently stepped forward regarding a near constant string of encounters with UFOs while training off the southeast coast of the U.S. between 2014 and 2015. In the message, he answers our question regarding statements that the mysterious craft followed his unit while on cruise to the Persian Gulf aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt . There was some discrepancy on this issue, with the New York Times first reporting the encounters stopped shortly after the unit and its air wing left on deployment in early Spring of 2015, while further testimony from Graves teased in short promotional clips for To The Stars Academy’s History Channel show Unidentified implies that they continued while the unit was deployed abroad. Graves has allowed us to share his correspondence with The War Zone in an attempt to better clarify the record. Note that this email was written informally between two people with an understanding of military and air combat topics and jargon, so a bit of decoding is in order. When Graves says “AC” he means aircraft. When he mentions ‘Whiskeys’ he is talking about blocks of restricted military operations airspace or warning areas off the coast of America’s southeastern seaboard. The ‘med’ is shorthand for the Mediterranean Sea. With that said, his letter reads: Hello Tyler, I enjoyed your episode on the War College podcast. You seem to have a strong understanding of many of the systems we have in the jet as well as the bigger picture of how the AC integrates into the carrier strike group as a whole. I wanted to answer a question you seemed to have. During my discussions on the hill and pentagon, I broached the subject regarding whether the UAP’s were limited to the Whiskey’s by VA Beach and our strike group, or whether they followed us in theatre. It is a difficult question to answer. While flying in the med during the transit, or while operating in the gulf, the workload we have is significantly higher and we had less time to explore the phenomena, especially at this point where it was such a daily occurrence we essentially only gave them enough thought as to avoid hitting them. However, to answer your question, in the med I did occasionally see radar signatures that performed in ways that were consistent with our experiences back home, though at a significantly reduced rate. In the gulf, it is more difficult to answer. It is very congested airspace, there is much more air traffic than one would expect, both friendly and otherwise, especially as we go through the straits. There was a handful of times that I had a moment to focus on externals to the mission while transiting inbound and I do distinctly remember seeing radar contacts that were very similar, if not the same, but again, significantly reduced in volume and inconclusive. Regards, Ryan What’s important here is that we can now begin to gauge the magnitude and frequency of the ongoing UFO incidents once Navy Strike Fighter Squadron 11, the Red Rippers, the carrier air wing to which it was assigned, and the Theodore Roosevelt departed on deployment. Detecting some sporadic anomalies on radar that are deemed ‘inconclusive’ by the aviator himself provides critical color for these events that wasn’t conveyed in the clip from the television show. Here is the clip in question from an upcoming episode of Unidentified : As we have thoroughly discussed in this past article , there are very real and peculiar parallels between the events Graves and his squadronmates experienced back in 2014 and 2015 during the leadup to their deployment and the notorious ‘Tic Tac’ incident that occurred with the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group off the Baja coast a decade prior. New and highly promising generations of air defense sensor fusion technology being present during both series of encounters is something we have found especially intriguing and may point to the possibility that these events were tests of highly exotic and secret technology belonging to the U.S. military or even deployed by its adversaries. A Red Ripper F/A-18F about to touch down on the boat. , USN We have to stress that this is just one of a number of possibilities and cocktails of possibilities and does not provide a definitive explanation for these incidents at this time. Graves’ clarifications are very important to this developing story, one that we have only scratched the surface of as of yet.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are very few details so far, but a helicopter has crashed onto the roof of a building in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, just blocks from Times Square and Central Park. City authorities have confirmed the incident occurred and that the pilot died, adding that a subsequent fire has been extinguished. They have not said who the helicopter belongs to or what it was doing in this heavily controlled air space . The crash occurred shortly before 2:00 PM local time in New York on June 10, 2019. The helicopter reportedly came down on top of the AXA Equitable Center at 787 7th Street. Occupants of the building evacuated after the incident and there are no reports yet of any injuries on the ground. “The preliminary information is that there was a helicopter that made a forced landing, an emergency landing or landed on the roof of the building for one reason or another. There was a fire that happened when the helicopter hit the roof. People who were in the building said they felt the building shake. The fire department believes the fire is under control. There may have been casualties involved in people in the helicopter,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters . “We don’t know what caused the helicopter to land on top of the building, but people in the building itself, nobody has been hurt.” The airspace over Manhattan has been very tightly controlled since 9/11, leading to serious restrictions on civilian helicopter activity . They are outright barred from landing on rooftops in the area where this accident occurred and in many cases flying over the area at all. You can read more about these restrictions in detail here . Regardless, the AXA Equitable Center does not have a helipad. The events of 9/11 are still very front and center in the city’s memory. “I hope to god that’s not true,” Governor Cuomo had said upon first hearing the reports of the crash. There is also unconfirmed video purporting to show the helicopter flying erratically before the incident. Authorities say that there is no evidence yet of any criminality. Update: 12:30pm PDT— Visibility was very poor in the area when the crash occurred with ceilings as low as 500 feet with mist present. We are told few if any other helicopters were flying at the time in the area. We have a supposed ID on the helicopter in question, but we are waiting for confirmation. Update: 12:37 PDT— The helicopter in question was an Agusta A109. We are waiting for confirmation on its registration at this time. Air controllers were not in contact with the aircraft which would have been absolutely essential for entering that airspace in a prohibited manner. A hard temporary flight restriction also exists over nearby Trump Tower. We are also hearing from multiple sources that the flight should not have been operating under the conditions present in the airspace at the time. Others are apparently coming to the same conclusion: Update: 3:00 PDT— The New York City Fire Department has released some pictures of the wreckage, showing near complete destruction of the helicopter. The helicopter in question had the U.S. civil registration code N200BK , which is registered to a company named N200BK, Inc. by way of American Continental Properties. The A109E took off from the East 34th Street Heliport approximately 11 minutes before the crash, according to NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2019","New Air Force One Jets To Have 1,200 Nautical Miles Less Range Than Originally Required","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new Pentagon report to Congress reportedly says that the two future Air Force One replacement aircraft, which won’t have a mid-air refueling capability , will have an approximate maximum range that is over 1,000 miles less than originally planned. The pair of modified Boeing 747-8is, which will be designated VC-25Bs, will have a number of other reduced capabilities compared to the original requirements, even as it appears that the program’s costs have grown . These revelations all come as President Donald Trump’s Administration is seeking to speed up delivery of the planes and maybe even change their iconic blue-and-white paint scheme. Bloomberg was first to reveal the new details on June 7, 2019, citing a copy of one of the most recent Selected Acquisition Reports, a U.S. military review of major acquisition programs that it provides to lawmakers on a regular basis. The document, which is reportedly unclassified, but marked “For Official Use Only,” says the original range requirement for the VC-25Bs was approximately 7,100 nautical miles. Now the Air Force expects that planes will only be able to fly 5,900 nautical miles. The jets will also only be able to carry 71 passengers, down from a planned 87, and only have communications equipment to support 70 simultaneous “voice and data connections,” rather than 80, according to Bloomberg . The Air Force says the current Air Force One aircraft, also known as VC-25As, which are based on the Boeing 747-200 design, can also carry 71 passengers, but the exact capabilities of their communications suites are unclear. In 2017, one of the aircraft emerged from a major overhaul with additional communications antennas. You can read more about that particular upgrade and the aircraft’s general communications capabilities here . There is no explanation for why the approximate maximum range of the VC-25B, which will be based on the commercial Boeing 747-8i, is now 5,900 nautical miles. The commercial 747-8i can travel distances up to nearly 7,800 nautical miles, according to Boeing . The new Air Force Ones will require hardening to survive the aftermath of a nuclear blast, including electromagnetic pulses, as well as a bevy of specialized equipment , all of which adds weight, but the dramatic loss of range is curious. One of the two existing VC-25A Air Force One aircraft sporting then-new communications upgrades in 2017., Alex Brandon—AP But if the figure in the Selected Acquisition Report is accurate, the VC-25As will have significantly greater range than their forthcoming replacements, being able to fly a maximum distance of approximately 6,800 nautical miles without refueling, according to official Air Force fact sheet . Even if the exact range of the VC-25B turns out to be closer to the original requirement, this isn’t significantly greater than that of the existing aircraft, which also have the ability to refuel in mid-air. This is another requirement the Air Force had officially nixed sometime prior to the 2016 election as part of an approximately $500 million cost-cutting effort . There has been some talk among members of Congress about forcing the Air Force to reinstate this requirement, but there has been no public announcement about any new change in this regard. The War Zone has already explored how problematic the decision was to remove the aerial refueling requirement in the first place, which inherently limits the aircraft’s flexibility , especially during a major crisis. Air Force One’s ability to keep the President, their closest advisers, and other senior officials airborne for long stretches of time is an essential part of how the plane fits into the U.S. government’s so-called “continuity of government” planning, something you can read about more here . Without mid-air refueling, there would be a danger that the plane might have no choice but to land in less secure locations in order to refuel, putting the President and his entourage at increased risk. During a nuclear attack, landing options at regional airfields could be very severely limited or even non-existent, especially due to the unknown circumstances that would surround such a horrific event. These concerns are only more pronounced given that the VC-25Bs are now supposedly set to have nearly 1,000 miles less range than the existing VC-25As. Some have touted the 747-8i’s increased range over the 747-200 as one mitigating factor for losing aerial refueling capability. If this report is accurate, that argument is now invalid. It also raises questions about whether the President would actually employ these aircraft in a major crisis, rather than fly on board an aerial refueling-capable command post such as the E-4B Night Watch aircraft, or the successor to those planes . It might have to become standard procedure for an E-4B, or a similar plane, to accompany the VC-25Bs on all major trips in case of such an emergency, something that may not always be an option . The entire point of Air Force One to be able to operate as a secure airborne command center is to obviate the immediate need for another aircraft during a contingency, including one where the President may already be airborne at the time. An E-4B Night Watch aircraft refuels in mid-air. The existing VC-25A aircraft have a similar aerial refueling system., USAF On top of all this, it remains unclear how much these changes in the Air Force One replacement plans, among others, such as buying orphaned 747-8is as the basis for the VC-25B conversions, have actually saved taxpayers. Even before taking office in 2017, Trump had personally taken aim at the costs of the Air Force Ones replacements, which you can read about more here . The Selected Aquisition Report did the Trump Administration credit for shaving $1.4 billion off the total program cost, according to Bloomberg , but these claims have repeatedly proven to be questionable at best . As it stands now , the combined price tag of the pair of VC-25Bs is just shy of $4.7 billion, while the total program’s cost, including new hangars and other ancillary items, is around $5.3 billion. These figures that are higher than the Trump Administration’s claim that the total was $3.9 billion almost a year ago, as well as long-standing Air Force estimates that pegged the cost at around $4 billion. There is no guarantee these costs won’t increase, either. In 2018, Trump personally indicated that he would like the see the VC-25Bs in a red, white, and blue paint scheme, replacing the existing livery, which dates to the Kennedy Administration. First Lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis was instrumental in the creation of the current blue-and-white design, as well as interior features in the VC-137C aircraft that were first to carry the new paint job. One of the VC-137Cs, now on display, wearing what has become the iconic blue-and-white Air Force One scheme., USAF The Air Force confirmed to Bloomberg that it, along with the White House, was reviewing new paint scheme options. Recently, members of the House Armed Services Committee inserted language into a draft version of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year, which would block changes to the paint scheme, as well as the interior design, without Congressional approval . It remains to be seen whether these clauses will make it into any final version of the NDAA and if that bill becomes law. At present, the Air Force says that no decision on the paint scheme will occur until 2021, which is notably after the next presidential election. A new president could direct further changes in the program. The service only expects Boeing to delivery the first VC-25B in September 2024 , which would be just four months before Trump would leave office if he wins a second term. The Selected Acquisition Report says that the White House is pushing to move this date up to December 2023, according to Bloomberg . One of the Boeing 747-8is destined to become a VC-25B Air Force One aircraft, in the white, heads to Texas in March 2019 to begin the conversion process., Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films “We have been asked to consider all opportunities to deliver the Air Force One replacement aircraft as soon as possible while providing the safest, suitable, and effective aircraft to meet presidential missions,” the Air Force told Bloomberg in the statement. “We continue to look for every opportunity with Boeing to do this.” But, given what we know now, there can only be significant questions about the final capabilities of the two VC-25Bs, regardless of their final cost and what their paint job looks like in the end.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 30, 2019",Remains Of Japanese F-35 Pilot Found As Search Is Called Off For Crashed Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our ongoing coverage on the deadly crash of an F-35A belonging to the Japan Air Self Defense Force that occurred on April 9th, 2019, the body of Major Akinori Hosomi has been found after two months of searching the waters off northeastern Japan. The condition of the pilot’s remains and other details regarding where the discovery occurred was not disclosed out of consideration for the experienced military aviator’s family. It has also been announced that Japan has officially called off the search and recovery operation for what’s left of the doomed F-35A. The U.S. Navy called off its participation in the search effort a month ago. Large portions of the highly sensitive F-35 remain unaccounted for with just some debris having been recovered after it was spotted floating near where the crash is thought to have occurred and located thousands of feet below the Pacific Ocean’s surface. The aircraft disappeared roughly 85 miles off the coast of the northern portion of Honshu Island after it launched from Misawa Air Base. The jet’s flight data recorder was recovered, but it was either too damaged to glean any data from it or its memory was missing. Now the JASDF is trying to piece together what happened via radar and communications data. Data-link information recorded by other three F-35s in the flight of four is also being used to figure out what happened, as we said would occur shortly after the jet went missing. Kyodo News states : “F-35As are equipped with systems which can share flight data between jets, according to the Defense Ministry. The ASDF determined flights could resume when safety measures, based on the data received by three other jets flying with the crashed one, have been conducted. Defense officials are believed to have now recreated part of the accident scenario based on information from that shared data, and recordings from land-based radar, according to the source.” Japan’s F-35 force of a dozen jets still remains grounded due to the mishap, but that hasn’t stopped Japan from moving forward with their planned expanded purchase of 147 F-35As and Bs. It’s hoped that once the data has been evaluated, safety measures can be put in place and Japan’s fledgling F-35 cadre can be put back into the air. F-35 arriving at Misawa Air Base.  , JASDF The fact that large portions of the lost F-35 remain deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean is very concerning. Even small fragments of its skin and its proprietary components could be a boon for foreign adversaries if they could get their hands on any of them. Now that search has ended, one could imagine that foreign actors could use decreasing activity in the area to mount a clandestine recovery operation. Russia, in particular, has a number of specially configured submarines capable of executing just this type of operation, and certainly, it and China have other capabilities that we don’t know about. According to Japan’s Minister of Defense, Takeshi Iwaya, the area is being monitored by remote underwater cameras “for the purpose of protecting classified military information.” It isn’t clear exactly what this means, but anti-submarine aircraft, navy vessels, and submarines can’t stay on station indefinitely. As such, time may be on the side of foreign powers looking to eventually mount a subsurface search and recovery operation. Hopefully, the debris located thousands of feet down is centralized enough that remote monitoring provides enough security for the jet’s major components that are still on the seafloor. Then again, if that is the case, why weren’t they recovered? Still, a major intelligence coup could be had without even sending a high-value submarine into the area. Just pieces of the jet that have floated far from the crash site could be highly valuable. For instance, one of the aircraft’s tails was plucked from the water by Japanese searchers not long after the crash. Surely smaller fragments of the plane’s radar-evading skin have since floated away on ocean currents. In other words, even keeping an eye out and an ear open for items caught in fishermen’s nets or washed up on shores could result in a substantial gain in technological knowledge regarding some of the F-35’s most sensitive secrets. Regardless, it is bittersweet to hear that the pilot’s remains were recovered. On one hand, it is good that the family has some closure to their terrible loss. On the other, it’s another reminder of how quickly even an experienced hand in the cockpit flying the most advanced fighter in the world can meet their demise. The Major never even sent a mayday call before disappearing into the depths of the Pacific.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",Here’s The Pentagon’s Roadmap For Booting Turkey Out Of The F-35 Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Within a matter of days, the Pentagon will begin “unwinding” Turkey from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program unless it immediately halts plans to acquire the S-400 surface-to-air missile system from Russia. If authorities in Ankara do not change course on that deal, by the end of July 2019, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan says Turkish pilots will be fully gone from the F-35 training program in the United States, the country’s liaisons will be barred from even entering the central Joint Program Office, and efforts will begin to cut Turkish companies out of the international supply chain for the jets for good. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan made the situation clear to his Turkish counterpart Hulusi Akar in a letter dated June 6, 2019, which multiple outlets subsequently obtained . Ellen Lord, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions and Sustainment, offered additional details in a press conference on June 7, 2019. “Turkey still has the option to change course,” Lord explained. “If Turkey does not accept delivery of the S-400, we will enable Turkey to return to normal F-35 program activities.” “While we seek to maintain our valued relationship, Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400,” Shanahan had said bluntly in his letter to Akar. You can read his full letter below: DOD The U.S. government, along with other members of the NATO Alliance, see the purchase as an unacceptable operational security risk that could potentially give Russia a way to obtain critical details about the F-35 and its capabilities, especially its stealthy qualities. The United State and others also underscore that the Russian-made air defense system is not compatible with NATO standards and could impede Turkey’s ability to operate together with the rest of the Alliance in future operations. Shanahan attached a fact sheet of measures the Pentagon is taking against Turkey to his letter. The most immediate impact is that the U.S. government has disinvited Turkish representatives from the annual F-35 CEO Roundtable on June 12, 2019. There will also be no approval for additional Turkish personnel to come to the United States to train on the F-35, because, as the fact sheet notes, if Turkey isn’t getting any Joint Strike Fighters, “there are no longer requirements to gain proficiencies on the systems.” The Pentagon has already blocked the delivery of any further F-35-related materials to Turkey, including two additional jets. An F-35 heads out from Luke Air Force Base in Arizona on a training mission., USAF “We control what is downloaded from our computers, we have shared what’s appropriate,” Lord added during the press conference. “The Turks have no critical documentation that we are concerned about.” All Turkish personnel currently in the United States in relation to the F-35 program must leave the country by July 31, 2019. At that time, the U.S. military will cancel their credentials and they won’t be able to get into either Eglin Air Force Base in Florida or Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where various F-35-related training occurs. Turkish personnel will also be barred from the main Joint Program Office in Washington, D.C. You can read the full fact sheet below: DOD Untangling Turkish companies from the F-35 supply chain will take longer, but Undersecretary of Defense Lord said that this would involve “disciplined and graceful wind down” of all of the existing contracts by early 2020 . Turkey would find itself blocked from receiving any additional F-35-related contracts. Turkey has already invested $1.25 billion in the F-35 program and, in return, had expected to receive billions in industrial offsets over the program’s lifecycle. Turkish companies are responsible for the production of various structural components on the jets, as well as portions of the Pratt and Whitney F135 engine that powers them. Turkish firms are solely responsible for making a total of 400 different parts for the F-35, Lord said. This includes electronics company AYESAŞ is the sole provider of the aircraft’s panoramic cockpit display. Turkish President Recep Erdogan recently said it would be impossible for the F-35 program to continue without Turkish participation. “If we can work to our timelines with the Turks, we would have no major disruptions and very few delays,” Lord made clear during the press conference. All told, Turkey’s potential for continued involvement in the F-35 program looks increasingly bleak. Turkish officials have also repeatedly stressed that the S-400 purchase is a done deal that cannot be undone and that opinion seems unlikely to change. Components of an S-400 system, including three transporter-erector-launchers in the foreground and a mobile radar in the background., Sergei Malgavko—Sergei Malgavko/TASS Separately, on June 7, 2019 , Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, Russia’s main state-run industrial conglomerate, which includes the country’s state-operated arms enterprises, said Turkey had already made down payments on their S-400s. Perhaps more importantly, he added that Ankara had already spent the entirety of a low-interest loan that the Kremlin had included to help finance the deal. Turkish military personnel are now in Russia training on the S-400, too. It’s worth noting that Chemezov has offered to sell Turkey Su-57 advanced combat jets if the F-35 deal collapses. Erdogan and Chemezov both have talked about Turkish cooperation on the S-500 air defense system, as well. A Russian Su-57 fighter jet., Dmitry Terekhov/Wikicommons The fallout from the S-400 deal may not be limited to Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program, either. In his letter, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan noted that the Pentagon’s actions were separate from actions Congress was looking to take, including hitting the Turkish government with sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA . Legislators have previously voiced concerns over a host of other issues, largely linked to Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian domestic policies, which you can read more about here . In addition, the entire debacle can only call into question Turkey’s continued relationship with NATO, even though the Alliance’s senior leadership continues to publicly stress the value of Turkish contributions. “Turkey’s procurement of the S-400 will hinder your nation’s ability to enhance or maintain cooperation with the United States and within NATO, lead to Turkish strategic and economic over-dependence on Russia, and undermine Turkey’s very capable defense industry and ambitious economic development goals,” Shanahan warned. There are already growing calls to remove U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, as well as reduce American presence at that base, as well as others in the country. Turkey is also a partner on a number of other U.S. military weapon system programs , which could become the target of additional Congressional action if it appears that Erdogan is moving deeper into the Kremlin’s sphere of influence. The full extent of American sanctions on Turkey and other restrictions on existing and future partnerships of any kind with the Turkish government remains to be seen. But, if nothing else, the country looks well on its way to getting kicked out of the F-35 program for good.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Chancellorsville and the Russian Navy’s Udaloy -class destroyer Admiral Vinogradov had a near collision in the Philippine Sea earlier today. Pictures and video show the two ships coming dangerously close to hitting each other and the Navy says Chancellorsville had to fully reverse its engines to avoid a serious accident. “#USSChancellorsville was forced to maneuver to avoid collision when #Russian destroyer Udaloy I [ Admiral Vinogradov ] made an unsafe and unprofessional approach in the Phillippine Sea,” a post from the U.S. Navy’s official Twitter account read on June 7, 2019. “While recovering its helicopter #USSChancellorsville was forced to execute all engines back full to avoid collision with #Russian destroyer Udaloy I, which had come from behind and alongside within 50-100 feet in the Phillippine Sea.” BREAKING: #USSChancellorsville was forced to maneuver to avoid collision when #Russian destroyer Udaloy I made an unsafe and unprofessional approach in the Phillippine Sea, June 7th.

(2/2) https://t.co/rIaL3TONo6 — U.S. Navy (@USNavy) June 7, 2019 The Navy has since released two videos and two pictures of the encounter, which confirm how close the ships were until Chancellorsville was able to drop back and out of harm’s way. The pictures appear to be stills from a camera turret, which may have been on a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft that was flying nearby or from the cruiser’s helicopter if the incident had forced it to abort its recovery. Though 50 to 100 feet may sound like a lot, it is a worrying lack of separation between two ships displacing thousands of tons, which are slow to maneuver if something should suddenly happen. For perspective, Chancellorsville , at its greatest width, is 50 feet across and it more than 560 feet long. An actual collision between the two ships, especially if the Admiral Vinogradov had plowed into Chancellorsville ‘s side, would have caused serious damage and might have resulted in fatalities. What appears to be a capture from an aircraft’s camera turret shows Admiral Vinogradov , on the left, approaching USS Chancellorsville ., USN A second capture shows USS Chancellorsville dropping back after Admiral Vinogradov pulled alongside., USN An uncropped version of the photograph that CNN obtained above points the exact location of the incident, approximately 175 miles southwest of the Japanese Island of Okinawa. This is firmly in international waters and hundreds of miles away from any Russian territorial claims. Using the lat long on the P-8As camera capture, we can locate where this happened. The first point on the bottom left is where the P-8A was located, and the top right point is where the image target (the ships) were located. This is just south of Okinawa! pic.twitter.com/cVWv0WgLIG — Aircraft Spots (@AircraftSpots) June 7, 2019 Russia and the United States have already exchanged accusations about who is at fault over the incident. Chancellorsville was maintaining a steady course in order to recover its Sea Hawk helicopter at the time, according to the Navy. The Admiral Vinogradov then approached from the rear and to the starboard side, or right, of the American cruiser. A screen grab of a video the US Navy released of the incident, showing how close the ships were., USN The Russians, who initially claimed the incident occurred in the East China Sea, further to the northwest, said it was the Americans who cut off their destroyer and that they were in violation of the maritime “ rules of the road .” It is true that these internationally-recognized rules do say that when two ships paths appear to cross, the ship to the starboard has the right of way. “The US cruiser Chancellorsville suddenly changed its course and crossed the Admiral Vinogradov destroyer’s course some 50 meters away from the ship,” the Russian Pacific Fleet’s press service said in a statement on June 7, 2019. “In order to prevent a collision, the Admiral Vinogradov ’s crew was forced to conduct an emergency maneuver.” However, the pictures the Navy has released show Chancellorsville ‘s wake as long and steady, directly contradicting the Russian version of events. There also appears to be a change in Admiral Vinogradov course and indications that it was moving at a much higher speed, perhaps to try to get in front of the American warship. The crew on the Russian ship did not appear to be taking any particular precautions for a deliberately hazardous encounter, though, with some individuals apparently sunbathing on the destroyer’s rear flight deck. Regardless, U.S. Navy Commander Clayton Doss, a spokesman for the Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which is forwarded deployed in Japan and includes the Chancellorsville , dismissed the Russian statements as “propaganda,” according to the BBC . Russian sailors on the Admiral Vinogradov ‘s rear flight deck during the incident., USN It is worth noting that Chancellorsville is among the most advanced ships in the Navy and is capable of performing both air and ballistic missile defense missions simultaneously, as well as engaging hostile ships and conducting strikes against land targets. The cruiser has, among other things, the latest iteration of the Aegis combat system, also known as Baseline Nine. This includes improvements to a number of important data fusion and information sharing capabilities as part of the Navy’s Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and associated Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter-Air (NIFC-CA) systems, which you can read about in more detail here . This also isn’t the first time a Navy ship has had a dangerous encounter with another country’s warship, but the last such incident, which occurred in September 2018 , involved a Chinese destroyer. The U.S. and China have long been at odds over the latter country’s sweeping territorial claims in the Pacific region, especially with regards to the South China Sea , and tensions between Washington and Beijing have been growing steadily in recent years over a host of issues, including an increasingly bitter trade war . But it certainly isn’t the first time there have been altercations between Russian and American forces elsewhere. Notably, in June 2016, the Russian Navy also claimed that the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Gravely had cut off its Neustrashimy -class frigate Yaroslav Mudry in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. It subsequently emerged that this was a misrepresentation of the events and that the Russian ship had been trying to interfere with the activities of the Truman Carrier Strike Group. In recent years, Russian aircraft have routinely conducted unsafe maneuvers near American military planes and ships in Europe and the Middle, as well. Just days ago , the Navy said that a Russian Su-35 Flanker fighter jet had repeatedly moved dangerously close to one of its P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes in the Mediterranean. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 11:30am EST— Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan offered some comments to reporters about the incident on the steps of the Pentagon ahead of the arrival of Greek Defense Minister Evangelos Apostolakis. “We’ll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians and of course we’ll démarche them.” @ActingSecDef on #Russia unsafe near-collision w/ . @USNavy warship just now: pic.twitter.com/7F7SSfmdGK — Tara Copp (@TaraCopp) June 7, 2019 Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Navies Russian Navy Sea U.S. Navy"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 28, 2018",These Are The Best Images Yet Of Northrop Grumman’s T-38 Replacement That Could Have Been,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The consortium of Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary, the famed Scaled Composites, along with BAE Systems, was among the most favored teams to win the competition to replace hundreds of T-38 Talon trainers for the USAF under the T-X program . Considering that the Air Force has flown Northrop’s T-38 for the better part of a century, and factoring in Scaled Composites’ pedigree for making game-changing airframes, even speaking of the possibility that Northrop Grumman wouldn’t end up competing for the prize seemed like blasphemy. Sadly, that possibility turned into reality. But now, months after its cancellation, we are seeing the first high resolution pictures of Northrop Grumman’s T-X sleek prototype taken during testing. The Northrop Grumman and their teammates seemed to be progressing well with their T-X entrant, which received the in-house name Model 400. The sleek jet was first spotted at Mojave Air And Space Port, where Scaled Composites calls home, in late August of 2016. The company made no comment on the prototype even as low quality photos of it taxiing hit the web. Not too long after it took to the skies, but still the only indication from Northrop Grumman that it existed was them stating that the Model 400 prototype would be officially unveiled in early 2017. Here’s what we originally said about the Model 400 when it first emerged; “Originally, Northrop Grumman intended to run with an updated version of BAE System’s Hawk T2 trainer, but that idea was axed when it was clear that the 40-plus-year-old design would not meet the USAF’s lofty performance requirements. Following this change in strategy, Northrop Grumman’s design process became especially secretive—although it was widely known that Scaled Composites , a company that dramatically changed aviation under legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan and was acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2007, would be heavily involved. Scaled Composites effectively led the industry into the world of large composite aircraft structures and rapid prototyping, although this technology has become widespread throughout the aerospace industry in the last few decades. Still, the name Scaled Composites carries a lot of cache , and they usually are at least one step ahead of the competition when it comes to aerospace technology. This unique Scaled Composites-Northrop Grumman heritage was clearly evident when the company’s T-X broke cover on Friday. Dubbed the Model 400, the aircraft looks like a modernized, composite hybrid of the T-38 Talon and the F-20 Tigershark . It packs a single F404-GE-102D engine,  a derivative of the same engine used in the F/A-18A/D, the JAS-39A/D (Volvo RM12), the F-117A, and India’s Tejas light fighter—as well as Lockheed’s T-X competitor, the T-50A. The engine/airframe appears to lack an expanding nozzle usually indicative of an afterburning capability, so either Northrop-Grumman’s design is made to perform on dry thrust alone, or it will add afterburning capabilities on a later prototype. That said, it is also possible that a simpler, internal nozzle could be built into the design, which could enhance aerodynamic performance, save weight, and lower costs. It is likely that BAE Systems and its partners (L-3, primarily) will provide much of the aircraft’s avionics systems integration, including its high-end synthetic tactical training suite . Decades of developing this system for the Hawk may pay off huge for the T-X competition, as the system is proven and can save money in more abstract ways than flight hours and sustainability costs alone. Ultimately, this design can potentially be pitched as an entirely new aircraft while still leveraging Northrop’s hugely successful T-38 Talon lineage—a strategy that has proven itself in the past. Take the Super Hornet; it is effectively an all-new design, but was easily pushed through the Pentagon, the White House, and Congress because it could be pitched as a cost-effective “evolution” of an existing (and proven) aircraft. A “composite T-38” could accomplish this as well. If the jet’s price tag is also appealing, it could be very tough for its competitors to beat.” The Model 400’s T-38 lineage is crystal clear in this image. , Scaled Composites. Just at first glance, it looked like Northrop Grumman had a very sound strategy with the new aircraft being as similar to the original T-38 configuration as possible while also likely keeping a very sharp eye on cost. But then, suddenly, just around the time that the company was supposed to officially unveil their exciting new T-X contender, one that had been flying for some time at that, the company canned its participation in the T-X program entirely. The move was startling to say the least, with Northrop Grumman not only giving up the possible opportunity to build at least 350 new tactical jets—an opportunity that is becoming increasingly rare—but also giving up on 50 plus years of pilot training heritage. As we wrote on February 1st, 2017: “Around the same time the company hinted that their prototype would be officially unveiled, Northrop Grumman’s leadership has decided to throw in the towel. A statement by Northrop Grumman reads: “Northrop Grumman and its principal teammate BAE Systems have carefully examined the U.S. Air Force’s T-X Trainer requirements and acquisition strategy as stated in the final request for proposals issued on Dec. 30, 2016. The companies have decided not to submit a proposal for the T-X Trainer program, as it would not be in the best interest of the companies and their shareholders.” NG definately has other pending priorities—namely, the USAF’s massive Long-Range Strike Bomber contract now known as the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . The B-21 represents potential revenue approaching $100 billion, and while the T-X contract isn’t small beans by any means—especially in the world of dwindling tactical aircraft production opportunities—spreading the company’s limited resources too thin is a serious issue at such a critical time. Not just that, but other initiatives, like the E-8 JSTARS replacement program and MQ-25 Stingray/ CBARS unmanned carrier aircraft system , will also take focus and expertise to win, and the company looks to do just that now that these competitions are getting underway. There is also the real possibility that the company’s Model 400 simply was not seen as competitive enough, either on cost or performance grounds, to win the contract now that the official requirements have been put forward by the USAF. In fact, we may never know for sure what the company’s reasoning for ditching the type may have been.” Aviation Week’s James Drew has speculated that maybe the decision was made in order to save company cash in its $7.8B effort to buy Orbital ATK , an initiative that was just recently announced. The thing is such a decision could have been made totally independent of the Model 400’s merits. In other words, this type of a strategic business move could have left an incredibly promising contender out of the T-X race by no fault of its own. And by all indications, the Model 400 could have been a very formidable challenger. The Model 400 test pilots pose in front of their mount. Notice the rear main landing appear to be borrowed from the T-38. , Scaled Composites The T-X program has struggled to move forward to some degree in recent months, with some defense industry analysts thinking it may be put on the back burner due to budgetary uncertainty. The USAF had said it would award the contract to one of the entrants by year’s end, but that could be pushed back considering the Pentagon will likely be operating under a continuing resolution for at least the next few months. If sequestration remains in place beyond that, or if a string of continuing resolutions keep funding the Pentagon, the T-X program could be pushed off indefinitely. With all this in mind, maybe Northrop Grumman executives had inclinations on just how tough it would be for the program to move ahead under the fiscal and political chaos that continues to plague Washington and decided to put their bets on another game entirely. As we stated earlier, focusing its talent on the B-21 program, which is really key to the company’s survival as a prime aircraft manufacturer, was also likely a factor. Additionally, emphasizing business opportunities in the high-end unmanned space would also suck up funding and personnel, and although we know that winning the Navy’s CBARS drone tanker tender will be key for gaining a foothold in the operational naval drone space, we also know the company is very active in unmanned clandestine programs , which could be far larger in scope than just producing aircraft for test and evaluation purposes. Still, it’s sad that we don’t at least know more about the Model 400 and the strategy behind it. But one thing is for certain, the other competitors for the T-X bid , like Boeing-Saab and Lockheed Martin, sure must have been pleased to hear of the Model 400’s early demise.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 25, 2022",Navy Hovercraft Storm Beaches In Oregon And Washington In Preparation For “The Big One”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A few days ago, U.S. Navy Landing Craft Air Cushions , or LCACs, roared onto Sunset Beach in Warrenton, Oregon and across the sand at Oak Harbor, Washington, offloading trucks, construction equipment, and other cargo, as well as Sailors, Marines, and other personnel. But the force wasn’t conducting a mock amphibious assault. It was training to respond to a potential natural disaster that could, and by most predictions would, be on a scale the United States hasn’t seen in modern times—a major Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake event , often referred to as “the big one.” The paired training exercises, which focused on what is officially known as the Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) mission, occurred on June 3, 2019 . Pictures and video show the two hovercraft LCACs leaving the well deck of the San Antonio -class landing platform dock amphibious ship USS Anchorage and bringing ashore various vehicles, including Marine Corps 5-ton Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) trucks, pickups, and front end loaders. Members of the Navy’s Beachmaster Unit One (BMU-1), based at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, were on hand to manage activities on the beach and direct the landing craft to and from their assigned drop off points. “These training evolutions are a great way to showcase the Navy-Marine Corps team’s capability of bringing help to those in need after a natural disaster,” U.S. Navy Captain Dennis Jacko, the commanding officer of the Anchorage , said in a statement . “Exercises and training like this helps prepare our Sailors and local government agencies to work together seemlessly so that in the event of an earthquake or tsunami, we are ready to help in any capacity required. Amphibious ships are a key component of this capability, with tremendous cargo and medical facilities that are flexible enough to provide support anywhere along the coast.” The exercise also involved elements of the Oregon National Guard and Clatsop County Emergency Management. In conjunction with the DSCA exercises on the beaches, the Oregon Air National Guard also conducted an exercise called Cascadia Airlift , involving the movement of vehicles, cargo, and personnel via a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, also as part of a mock disaster relief mission. The C-130 flew low over the Oregon beach as part of a mock airdrop, as well. But when it comes to landing on beaches, the LCACs offer significant benefits over traditional shallow-draft boat-type landing craft , including better speed and “over the beach” mobility. Hovercrafts, in general, can also cross very shallow water and conduct operations on soft ground, such as marshes and swamps, which also helps them get into areas that may be inaccessible to other boats. Most importantly, they can access totally unimproved beaches and rapidly deliver massive loads ashore—something that would be absolutely critical if the big one hit the Pacific Northwest. Oregon National Guard Within minutes of a major movement along the Juan de Fuca and Pacific tectonic plates , a massive tsunami would come roaring ashore across huge stretches of Oregon and Washington coastline. The small beach towns already devastated by the powerful quake that would measure around a nine on the Richter Scale would be slammed with a massive wall of water rising up to 100 feet high. Take this tsunami evacuation map of the popular Seaside and Gearhart vacation communities in Oregon. A major Cascadia Subduction Zone event would inundate basically everything within minutes of the initial quake ending. Evacuation locations are distant and require most of the population to cross bridges that will probably be destroyed by the quake itself. The reality is loss of life and destruction of infrastructure and property along the Oregon coast will be extreme. , Official Document The level of destruction we are talking about here in small communities with limited resources is largely unfathomable. Roads that snake through the coastal mountain ranges will be unpassable for days, weeks, and even months. Bridges and overpasses will be dropped all over the states and especially along and near the coast. Channels will be unpassable and docks will be destroyed. This leaves few options for evacuating citizens and conveying absolutely essential supplies in large quantities to devastated coastal locales. The Navy’s mighty LCACs and the amphibious ships that tote them around are Oregon and Washington’s best potential lifeline during what would be both states’ darkest hour. An LCAC unloads vehicles in Oak Harbor, Washington., USN This is largely what’s behind these exercises. The region is well overdue for this horrible event and predictions keep getting worse as to what it will actually look like when it occurs as well as its protracted aftermath. So, seeing the military getting serious about the reality that this emergency call will come sometime in the future and only it really has the capacity to make large-scale and rapid impacts when it comes to saving lives and beginning a recovery effort that will take place over a huge stretch of territory where infrastructure will be completely obliterated, is very much a good thing. In fact, it’s baffling that the LCACs haven’t arrived on Oregon and Washington shores for this type of training years ago. As for the LCAC itself, the Navy first began using the LCAC in 1986. The service has been slowly putting the hovercrafts through a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) since 2001. As of December 2018 , 64 had gone through the SLEP process, which involves a major structural overhaul, improved corrosion resistance, upgraded engines for more reliable operation in very hot weather, and improved communications, navigation, and other mission systems. Eight more of the hovercrafts still needed the update. A Marine Corps MTVR wrecker truck drives off an LCAC in Oak Harbor, Washington., USN Able to carry up to 75 tons of cargo if necessary and capable of reaching speeds of more than 40 knots, or over 45 miles per hour, LCACs can readily bring vehicles, heavy equipment, and supplies into affected areas even if traditional port facilities are not operational. Depending on the exact terrain, they can also try to bring those cargoes closer to the desired destination , bypassing roads and bridges that may be impassable. The video below offers a good look at the LCAC’s general capabilities. Though LCACs are primarily intended to support amphibious assault missions, these same attributes have repeatedly proven to be valuable in responding to natural disasters in coastal areas over the years. LCACs notably took part in the response to Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast in 2005. An LCAC hits the beach in Biloxi, Mississippi during relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina in 2005., USN To keep these skill sets fresh for LCAC crews and other adjacent units and personnel, such as the Navy’s Beachmasters, as well as to help appraise federal, state, and local officials as to the hovercraft’s capabilities, they routinely take part in DSCA exercises. In 2017, Anchorage actually conducted a similar exercise in the Pacific Northwest, but with boat-type landing craft rather than LCACs, in and around Newport, Oregon and Grays Harbor, Washington. This exercise also involved U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters, which flew to and from the ship. During disaster response missions, helicopters have also shown themselves to be an essential asset for moving equipment, supplies, and personnel ashore, as well as rescuing civilians or otherwise providing an immediate response to medical and other crises. A CH-47F Chinook prepares to land on the USS Anchorage during a DSCA exercise in 2017., USN Amphibious ships with LCACs and other landing craft, as well as helicopters, would be essential when it comes to responding to a disaster like the big one, but just getting all of the necessary assets into position could be extremely time-consuming. That is why training for this specific event is so key. Hopefully doing so will cut down the time it takes to initiative such deployments on a sudden basis and such a large scale. A member of Beachmaster Unit One directs a fire truck as it rolls off an LCAC during a DSCA exercise in Coronado, California in 2014., USN The value of LCACs in a disaster relief scenario isn’t limited to the West Coast, though. There are equal fears that serious disasters might ravage the East Coast. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 exposed a host of issues in preparations to respond to major disasters in the Northeastern United States. Since 2017, Hurricanes Harvey , Maria , and Michael have also underscored the threat to the Gulf Coast region from increasingly extreme weather , which many scientists have linked to global climate change . The U.S. military is already coming to terms with these issues, and their connections to global climate change, but even in the best case scenarios, it may not be possible to stave off an uptick in all sort of severe weather in the near-term, including flooding and tornadoes . The various branches may find it more and more important to be training for disaster relief missions, and with an eye toward the homeland, rather than the more traditional focus of being prepared to respond to humanitarian emergencies overseas . At the same time, the Navy is in the process of replacing its aging LCACs altogether with a new, improved hovercraft, known as the Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC). Unfortunately, this program has suffered a number of delays due to technical problems with the design since development began in 2009. The service now expects to take delivery of the first SSC in July 2019, some two years behind schedule, though it still hopes to declare initial operational capability with the improved hovercrafts in 2020. Until the SSCs reach full operational capability, which is still years away at best, the LCACs will continue to serve as a means of getting troops ashore during amphibious operations and as a tool for responding to natural disasters at home, as well as abroad. If the big one does hit and the large parts of Pacific Northwest coastline lay in ruin, the arrival of these amazing machines will equal local survivors’ most desperate wishes coming true.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",F/A-18 Pilot Gives Virtual Flyers Highly Detailed Explanation Of How To Land On A Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Landing a fighter aboard a pitching and rolling carrier deck is one of the most challenging exercises in all of aviation. Just the idea of bringing a jet safely back to the boat, in potentially terrible conditions , after an already stressing mission has long captured the imagination of the entertainment industry and the public at large. We have even published a first-hand account of how this process occurs in the dark of night and how challenging mastering it can be . But now, thanks to Digital Combat Simulator—better known as DCS—the most realistic realization of this experience ever available to the public can be had for $79 , or about 1/230th the cost of a single Hornet flight hour. And with the help of a former Hornet pilot, you too can learn to master this elite skill—or at least understand its complexities better than ever before. The F/A-18C Hornet module for DCS is a game changer . It quenches the decades-long thirst for a very high-fidelity American naval strike-fighter PC simulator that dates back to the company’s legacy Lock-On: Modern Air Combat series. Now that computer gaming power is economically available (relatively) to drive Eagle Dynamics’—the maker of DCS— ambitious software, and virtual reality headsets can literally put you in the cockpit unlike anything else in the past, a golden age of flight simulation is finally upon us—regardless of flight simulation’s shrunken market size within the gaming world. But acquiring the software and having a computer setup to run it is nothing compared to figuring out how to make the Hornet sting. But before even that happens, executing realistic carrier operations is most virtual fighter pilots’ top priority, and it is more akin to mastering ballet than learning a country western line-dance. Eagle Dynamics and some of the DCS’s most visible players are great about offering how-to videos for long-awaited Hornet module, but nothing, and I mean nothing, compares to the instruction one ex-Hornet driver turned instructor pilot has brought to DCS’s fanatical gaming community. Yet what’s most interesting is that this naval aviator’s marvelously detailed explainer videos are just as fascinating for someone who has no intention of buying DCS Hornet or a gaming rig to play it as those who live and breathe combat flight simulation. The videos, taught in true instructor pilot style, represent the most complete and detailed description of how actual carrier operations work, both in the real world and in the emerging virtual environment, and will give you a whole new appreciation for just how challenging even the most basic of carrier recoveries are for naval aviators. Here is the three-part series: https://youtube.com/watch?v=LvGQS-3AzMc https://youtube.com/watch?v=bN44wvtRsw0 After watching the videos in fascination, I immediately reached out to our instructor pilot, who goes by the handle “Lex Talionis,” to get an interview. I wanted to know his background, how he came to DCS, what sparked his interest in making such informative videos, as well as getting his thoughts on the Hornet simulator and on computer flight simulation in general. Just like his explainer reels, his answers to these questions and more did not disappoint: What is your background in naval aviation? “I was winged in ’04, finished up with the Fleet Replacement Squadron in ’05, was with my fleet squadron from ’07 to ’09, PCSed [Permanant Change of Station] to the training command in ’09, and have been there since. During the time with my fleet squadron, I was fortunate enough to deploy on a WESTPAC and as an individual augment to Iraq (one of my most rewarding experiences). My time in the hornet was short-lived. I can’t say enough good things about the community and the platform. I miss the jet and the friends I had made. My current job is outstanding. I teach naval aviator students in primary flight school as a reserve officer and in advanced flight school as a civilian contractor. As a washed up Hornet driver, I could not have anticipated that flying as an instructor would be an incredible way to end a military flying career. I remember being in the student’s shoes quite vividly and helping to get them from “there” to “here” is an experience that is hard to beat.” Lex gets his wings of gold with his proud parents in attendance. , Courtesy of Lex Talionis What brought you to DCS considering that you have actually done the real thing? “I haven’t been too interested in flight simulators since my job has plenty of ’em. Primarily for nostalgic reasons, however, I always had my eyes open for games like the ones that kept me motivated to become a pilot as a kid. For the most part, I was drawn into DCS by friends who were looking for a good ‘flying game.’ Conversations about military flying, realistic flight models, etc, arose so I decided to dig in a bit and become more knowledgeable specifically about the game. I made a video to help our small group out, got hooked on the game and the rest is history. I would have never guessed there was a community this enthusiastic.” How does DCS Hornet stack up to reality? “It has been a decade since I have sat in the Hornet, but I have to say the game has definitely brought back memories. Flight characteristics quickly spark old habits that invoke real world ‘procedures,’ of which the flight model is accurate to the level at which those procedures work. That is rare. DCS is a great blast from the past whenever I have the itch to rage around in the jet.” Is the existence of DCS common knowledge in the Hornet community? “I don’t know any other jet guys, let alone Hornet drivers, that play the game. You can’t fault them however, it takes an amazing amount of time to stay proficient as a military pilot and it is hard to come home and fire up the computer to do what you do for your day job when all you want is a shower and a beer. I can see DCS with the introduction of the F/A-18 quickly becoming desirable by retired Hornet drivers. Even to those who would otherwise not have an interest in a flight sim, flying a Hornet reminiscent of the real thing, without the responsibility of wielding the real thing, is quite alluring.” Have you tried it in virtual reality? “I have not used VR but I have heard it is quite impressive. Most who have a VR headset have explained that aside from the lack of resolution, the sensation of actually being in the cockpit is hard to beat. For now, I think I will just stick with a multi-monitor set up. If or when the resolution and refresh rates of VR systems improve, it will be hard to pass up.” What are your thoughts on consumer flight simulators in general? There was once a hot gaming market for them, now it is considered a niche. “When I was a kid, games were hard. ‘Perma-death,’ create a ‘character’ and live with the ramification of your decisions good or bad, have only what you brought with you to the battlefield, no endless re-spawning of resources, every rock did not have gold under it. With regards to flight sims, the challenge of learning how to operate and fly an aircraft was as much a part of the game as shooting the bad guys. Now it seems these aspects are considered undesirable. ‘Tedious,’ ‘restrictive,’ or the most amusing to me, the ever anecdotal ‘not fun.’ A good flight sim is ‘hard’ by nature with significant ‘consequences.’ There is a learning curve, if you do not posses the skills bad things happen until you do. Learning to fly is as much an accomplishment as defeating an adversary. Case in point, most questions asked of me are how to more accurately fly around the boat, individuals would then practice for hours without ever engaging a target. Maybe the niche is that these games pull form the same skill set as something tangible in real life. They are exceptionally challenging and once mastered there is a sense of genuine accomplishment. Others may view this as close to a job and want a break from this aspect of reality, anyone’s guess is as good as mine. Personally, a game needs to make sense on some fundamental level. Ultimately that means it must somehow be rooted in reality. I can only tolerate so much make-believe, sci-fi, and pixy-dust before my brain gets tired of pushing the ‘I believe button.’ Flight games need to at least adhere to basic physics and DCS certainly does that. That is my niche.” It’s an intimidating game for the vast majority of prospective computer pilots. Any tips to someone totally new to DCS that want to get started with the Hornet? “The beauty of this game is that the complexity can be modulated by the player. DCS world adheres to an un-circumvented physics engine and set of relatively constant weights and measures. This makes the game scale-able, limitless to what can be added and, that which is encountered by the player is logical and coherent. Keeping in mind the initial learning curve may be steep as piloting is a skill in and of itself, a player can learn to fly in a relatively simple aircraft and move those skills to a more complex platform. If that is still too intimidating, I would reiterate the essence of the previous question’s answer with ‘don’t give up, enjoy the process, everyone starts at the beginning, and ask questions.’ To conclude, I can’t tell you how taken back I am by all of this. Thank you for the questions. Please understand, as far as Hornet drivers go I am by no means an expert, I am simply sharing what I know about a life adventure I am thankful to have experienced. I would like to thank you Tyler for the opportunity to share my thoughts and opinions. I would have never thought them valuable to this audience. Thank you to the community. I am truly humbled by the overwhelming responses to the videos and look forward to answering any future questions you all may have to the best of my ability. And finally, thank you to an online friend, Jarus. None of this would have unfolded the way it did if it wasn’t for him. Please give him a thumbs up on his youtube channel “Citizen Gamer” when you have the chance.” In the hot seat!, Courtesy of Lex Talionis It’s awesome to see a professional with such a talent for calmly and clearly conveying complex concepts to students share their passion and expertise with the world, and especially with those who will consume it bit by bit in an attempt to better their own simulated Hornet flying skills. But the unique window Lex provides into the nitty-gritty of carrier flight operations is what’s most interesting. If anything else, Lex has given us all a new appreciation of what it takes to be a real naval fighter pilot and it’s amazing to think how little room for error there is in such a hideously complex flying environment. With this in mind, even though DCS Hornet is incredibly realistic, if things go bad real fast it just means frustration and a downgrade in one’s ego, not the end of your flying career or even your life. Make sure to follow Lex’s Youtube channel here and he is also very active in the DCS community on Discord . A big thanks to him for taking the time out of his busy flying schedule to share his thoughts with all of us. As for DCS in general, I will be posting a separate piece about my experience with the game in the upcoming weeks, but here’s a hint of what’s to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 22, 2019",The Ultimate Holiday Gift Guide For The Aviation Or Military Geek In Your Life,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s hard to believe that we are just a couple weeks away from granting a fat jolly man with magical flying reindeer access to our homes—the year went by like a Blackbird over Baghdad. I know it’s tough to shop for that special someone in your life that is obsessed with military technology and history or aviation, but you are in luck. My annual gift guide is here with a ton of options, from stocking stuffers to tree-tippers, that will only end in huge grins and big hugs once the wrapping paper starts flying.

The Drive Here is the link to our apparel web store , and thank you for shopping! Oh, and post a pic of you sporting your new TWZ gear when you get it, ok! Superweapon reading trio Jim Goodall’s amazing series on American super weapons is my top pick for books this year. Jim is known for getting special access to hard to access pictures and information, allowing him to convey a weapon system’s unique abilities and quarks like nobody else. Recently, he has put out three absolutely stunning pictorial books about America’s most fascinating and shadowy weapons—the B-2 Spirit, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the Los Angeles class nuclear fast attack submarine. Tyler Rogoway Each book is collector quality in feel and finish and is stuffed with a seemingly endless stream of amazing pictures, many of which I have never seen before, that provide granular yet fascinating detail on each weapon system. The photos and captions work to tell the story of the machine and its intended role. Beyond that, the books’ format is somewhat hard to describe and they interface with the reader like on a much deeper level than a coffee table book, but are visual driven. So they are something of a hybrid and that is what makes them so great. Tyler Rogoway Buying all three will cost you a cool Benjamin. That’s a bargain for what you get and the presentation quality of each book. Together they make a really nice set, but if you were to just choose one, I think The US Navy’s Fast Attack Submarines , Vol.1: Los Angeles Class 688 would be my pick. It offers a very detailed, if not unprecedented, look at the legendary class of nuclear fast attack submarines and it many ways it will surprise you. I actually felt claustrophobic just reading through it! ​ ​​​ My second choice, and it was a very close call, would be Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird: The Illustrated History of America’s Legendary Mach 3 Spy Plane. What a read this is. It is loaded with historical photos and details, so many of which were entirely new to me. If you have a thing for the Skunk Works or for Blackbirds, maybe skip the subs and go for this awesome addition to your bookshelf. ​ ​​​ Last, but certainly not least is A Pictorial History of the B-2A Spirit Stealth Bomber. The book takes you into the guts of the B-2 and the elaborate infrastructure that supports the fleet of just 20 aircraft. The production floor shots alone are worth the price of admission and there are all types of little details about the B-2 and its teething issues that will surely surprise. ​ ​​​ Once again, this trio really works well as a set, but there’s nothing wrong with buying a la carte too. Decision At Sea Another book I recommend for anyone interested in military history is Craig L. Symonds’ Decision At Sea . This is a brilliant read that thoroughly explains moment by moment five key naval battles that shaped American history. The book basically spans 175 years, starting at the Battle of Lake Erie and ending with Operation Praying Mantis. This structure highlights the change in American naval tactics and technology over time, but in other ways, it also illustrates how the many of the basic tenets of naval warfare haven’t changed all that much. It is a heart-pounding evolutionary tale that narrates the small picture while also putting these five decisive naval battles in a much larger perspective via pointed analysis. I also liked it because you don’t have to blast right through it. Instead, you can pick it up after a few days and continue as if you just got up to grab a glass of water. It’s also fairly accessible to the novice reader while still adding new details and thoughtful analysis to battles that have been described many times before to some of us. ​ ​​​ Topgun Days Top Gun 2 is deep in production and the hype couldn’t be any more potent (or pungent depending on your perspective). The thing is, you can’t fully understand Top Gun the movie or Topgun the prestigious fighter pilot schoolhouse it’s based on without reading Topgun Instructor Dave “Bio” Baranek’s absolutely awesome Topgun Days , the biographical account of his real-world experiences at the Navy Fighter Weapons School and of supporting the production of the film back in the mid-1980s. You can read my full review of the book here which includes a great passage from it, but I can’t think of a better time to dive into this wonderful book written by a good friend of The War Zone than now, as we run up to the release of Top Gun: Maverick. ​ ​​​ For the kids If you know someone with infants or toddlers, or with a new child on the way, and who is either in the U.S. military or has an interest therein, we’d recommend checking out the My First Counting Book series written by Cindy Entin and illustrated by Craig Boldman. These are thick-paged “board books,” so little kids can’t accidentally tear them apart, and promote learning to count from one to 10 with little military facts. Joe’s daughter got the U.S. Air Force-themed one as a gift, but there are others featuring the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines, and even police and firefighters. They’re meant for children who can’t themselves read yet, but that’s not to say you won’t learn something yourself, like select cadets at the Air Force Academy have the honor of training falcons – the school’s mascot – each year. If you know a small child that likes “reading” or being read to, these books offer a break from yet another reading of Mother Goose or Dr. Seuss. ​ ​​​ Get your scan on Watching air traffic at your local airport or airbase can be made far more enjoyable and efficient with the help of a good scanner. Once programmed with the various frequencies, your situational awareness will be elevated dramatically and everything will be so much more interesting. If there are emergencies or special traffic of any kind inbound, you will know about it. My friend and commercial pilot extraordinaire, @thenewarea51 , a man who knows radios better than anyone I know, was the first guy I thought of when I needed the bottom line on the best handheld and affordable scanner for your buck. His response was quick and certain, the Uniden Bearcat BC125AT . It’s small, it can be programmed by your computer, and most importantly, it can receive VHF civilian aircraft communications and UHF military aircraft communications. Many lower-priced handheld scanners just have VHF, which means you can hear what the tower is saying to military aircraft operating in the area, but not what the crews are saying. You wouldn’t be able to hear military aircraft to military aircraft communications and those between command posts and aircraft without this capability. So boost your plane spotting prowess and enjoyment by picking up this little bundle of communications joy today. ​ ​​​ Get eyes on! If you have an interest in what is flying above, or just what’s going on in the environment around you on a daily basis, I highly recommend snapping up a Vortex Solo monocular . What you get in terms of image and build quality for around $50 is absolutely outstanding. The view is bright and crisp and compared to a bulky set of binoculars, you can slip this monocular into the center console in your car without taking up much room. It’s also far more discreet when in use. The Solo is especially useful for plane spotting—in conjunction with your new handheld scanner—or even for checking out planes whizzing by up in the flight levels above on a moments notice. It also makes a heck of a little gift for pretty much anyone regardless of their interest in aviation. Basically, if you are into boating, hunting, animal watching, going to the zoo, or pretty much anything where a closer look is a good thing, the Vortex Solo rocks. ​ ​​​ Unlock the photographer inside you without going broke Last year’s gift guide went into my recommendations for camera gear for aspiring aviation photographers. I have tried pretty much everything out there, from $11,000 600mm prime lenses to various full-frame bodies, but I wanted to convey the best all-around, middle-of-the-road, easily portable and versatile setup that I have in my own kit. That was basically a $2,600 investment for just one lens and the camera. I received a ton of emails looking for some guidance on a less expensive setup for starters and for those who just want to shoot planes as part of larger photographic ambitions that will also include a lot of travel photography. There happens to be one setup I tell everyone starting out to go with that offers amazing capabilities in a small and far more affordable package. It starts with the Canon SL2 Rebel . This is an outstanding camera that isn’t just smaller and lighter than semi-pro DSLRs, but it’s also significantly smaller and lighter than any other Rebel. You get a great 24MP sensor found on far more expensive models and a processing engine that can still take bursts of images at between 5 and 3.5 frames per second to capture fast action. Beyond that, the SL2 is feature packed and basically, it gives you everything you will ever need for the vast majority of shooting circumstances. In fact, I would be comfortable running a rebel instead of a pro or semi-pro body at an air show or other aerial events—unless you are slinging a huge prime lens around. In that case, you simply need something with a bigger grip and possibly a more versatile focusing system. Sure, there are brighter and larger viewfinders and better data-transfer and burst rates on more expensive DSLR bodies, but the technology has come so far that the tiny SL2 does what semi-pro models did not long ago, and in some cases much more. As for weather sealing, I can tell you that I have shot with a Rebel in the pouring rain on many occasions and never had a problem. You should have a Storm Jacket in your bag anyway if you plan on shooting in those conditions with any camera. ​ ​​​ Really, the magic happens when you pair the SL2 with the Tamron 18-270mm stabilized zoom lens. This is a remarkable lens for around $350 that covers a huge range without sacrificing massively on image quality. In fact, to start, you could go without having any other lenses at all as it covers the 35mm equivalent of 28.8mm to 432mm, all in one small and relatively light package. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NYVMOq8AJYM No, you won’t be filling your frame with single jets at airshows with this lens, but with 24mp to play with on the SL2, you can easily crop in during post processing while not losing significant amounts of quality. When you stop the lens down just one stop (make the aperture smaller), it becomes astonishingly sharp throughout its focal length, but even wide open it does just fine. But where this package shines is when you are traveling. It gives you amazing capabilities for well under a grand. It is the smallest true DSLR-lens combo that includes image stabilization and good quality and major range. And this awesome portability does matter. It means you will actually use the camera, not stare at it on a shelf. ​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ With this setup, building out your entire kit from this point on is really affordable and easy. You add a 50mm F/1.8 prime , commonly called the ‘nifty fifty,’ for about $125 that allows you to take pictures with an incredibly shallow depth of field and buttery bokeh . You probably think this is impossible at this price point but it’s not. Every hardcore photographer knows of the ‘nifty fifty’ and its amazing abilities. With a 1.8 aperture and the Rebel SL2 sensor’s low-light capabilities, you can take pictures in very dark scenarios that you could never imagine possible. But where the nifty fifty stands out is as a portrait lens, with a 35mm equivalent of 80mm, it is an ideal focal length for taking portraits of friends, family, and pets. When you stop it down to 2.8 it becomes razor sharp while still maintaining a shallow depth of field. It’s also tiny and light, so it doesn’t add much to your overall kit size. A fixed focal length lens like this will expand your composition creativity because you have to use your feet to zoom and the lens’s wide-range of sharpness and depth of field can be used to evoke certain emotions in your photos. It makes you pick the parts of something that matters most to showcase and thus unlocks your creativity even further and expands your idea of what an image can be. So buying a 50mm nifty fifty will actually make you a far better photographer in the long run. Finally, we have the Canon 10-18mm . This is a wide-angle lens with rectilinear properties (low distortion) that allows you to take breathtaking super-wide shots. It’s amazing how far this lens type has come down in price from Canon, it can be had for under $300! I like taking super-wide-angle shots more than pretty much any other type, and you will fall in love with taking them too. ​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ This small, but amazingly versatile setup will allow you to take pretty much any photo you want for a grand total of about  $1,250—roughly half that of my other aviation photographer semi-pro kit that included just one lens and a camera body. But like I said earlier, you can start and build this kit out over time. It takes a lot of practice to master the DSLR—a lot of fun and totally rewarding practice—so it’s not like you need all this on day one. Start with the SL2 and the Tamron zoom lens and go from there. Add in a comfy, but snug camera bag that is perfectly sized for your setup—I suggest anything from Lowepro—and start capturing your adventures and interests in an entirely new way. Photography is like tennis, you can do it pretty much your whole life, so investing a bit now will pay off for decades to come. A note on bags, don’t buy a huge camera bag. Get one just perfectly sized for your setup today, and buy a new one when you significantly expand your kit. That way you can pack around the right size bag for your photographic mission at hand. Unnecessary bulk kills the photography experience! This Lowepro bag below is a cost-effective and very well-built option that would get you started with the SLR2 and zoom lens. ​ ​​​ Once again, this setup is not a shot in the dark based on hearsay and online reviews, it has been selected via years of experience on what performs and what doesn’t and learning the hard way what is the best capability that can be had for the dollar and bulk. You simply can’t go wrong with this setup! Mach 2 for your living or dining room table Want to show off your love of flight with style and also give a room an extra pop that it needs in the process? Of course you do. So shell out for this four-foot long, 31-pound, solid aluminum art deco sculpture of the Concorde! Yeah, it will set you back about $400, but this isn’t some janky model or hollow metal art piece. It’s a striking statement and a conversation starter that will make you smile every time you walk by it. Just like the Concorde, it looks like it’s doing Mach 2 sitting still. The aluminum Concorde is available at Restoration Hardware linked here . Restoration Hardware If you don’t want to spend that much or just don’t have room for a huge supersonic transport sculpture, go for one about a third the size and about a quarter the price! And if you are not into jets, buy the DC-3 , it looks gorgeous too.​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ Now that’s a knife! Everyone should have a good reliable knife. You don’t need to carry it every day , but having a really high-quality blade for daily tasks, like opening boxes, making small household repairs, or for emergency situations, is money well spent. I own one such knife, it is made by Benchmade, a company that is based right in my home state of Oregon and that I have a special connection to. I went to college with the newly minted President of Benchmade, Jon DeAsis. His dad Lester DeAsis built the company from absolutely nothing into the ridiculously well-regarded generational knife making firm it is today. And no, I have never been given anything from Benchmade, but I have seen a family that is obsessed with making the best product possible using the latest technologies and taking care of their people and their customers like family in the process. The result isn’t just good knives, they are utilitarian works of art that you will have forever. I can’t overstate the fact that I am not a ‘knife guy.’ In fact, edged weapons sort of freak me out. But I wanted a single pocket knife for everyday tasks that was great at what it did and felt great in my hand. Since I was only planning on ever buying one, I went with the best available, and it looks just as good as it handles. That knife is the Benchmade Nakamura Axis 484-1 . Nakamura 484-1, Benchmade To call it futuristic is an understatement, and considering how light and sharp it is (scary sharp!), it could very well be from an advanced civilization from lightyears away. I love this knife! ​ ​​​ The thing is, you don’t need to spend huge money to get a great Benchmade knife. They are all pretty much outstanding. There are certainly plenty of other good knife companies out there that make similar looking styles for less, but when it absolutely has to work, why not spend a couple extra bucks to know you are getting the best and that the family who built it will stand behind it for life? Two other models I really liked was the very svelte Bugout 535 and the classic meets the future Crooked River 15080-1 . There is also a knife designed specifically for aircrews, the aptly named the 737 Aileron . Benchmade’s designers gathered various pilots and aviation industry people to find out what they would want in a knife and built it. Crap, now I want a second knife! ​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ Gin that will fly you away Any aviation aficionado that enjoys an adult beverage now and then will love this product and it is also made in my home state of Oregon. Aviator American Gin is some righteous booze regardless of its whimsical golden age of flight branding. It is delicious and is highly regarded as a pioneering product here in Portland, a city that has expanded from a beer Mecca into a spirits Mecca as well as of late. Aviation American Gin Somewhere along the line, actor Ryan Reynolds got involved with the two guys that started Aviator American Gin— he actually bought into the company—so he is doing a lot of promotion for the brand. This may be a huge plus if you are a Deadpool fan, but don’t be confused by the high-profile star endorsement, this gin is the real deal made by real craftsmen who love the art of making killer booze. Just add a bit of tonic and fly away! You can buy Aviator American Gin directly here or use the locator to see where you can pick up a bottle in your neck of the woods. Or Just buy an F-14 Tomcat In last year’s gift guide, I made the case for why it’s time to dive head first into Virtual Reality. There are many cool games to play on Oculus and Vive headsets, but the reason you really need to invest in this is Digital Combat Simulator. You can read my past post on DCS and last year’s gift guide to understand the nuts and bolts as to why, but basically, the dream of VR has come true. You can sit inside the cockpits of your favorite fighters and fly them in a totally immersive and alarmingly accurate way. But if last year’s call to action didn’t work, this probably will: The long-awaited F-14 module for DCS will be released any day now. It’s almost here, and it looks absolutely insane. If that video hasn’t sold you, I don’t know what will. And remember, this isn’t an arcade game, DCS modules feature extreme fidelity flight models and systems that are developed with subject matter experts over long stretches of time, with the goal to capturing every excruciating detail—the good and the bad—inherent to each aircraft. Also, the F-14 module will eventually be cooperative in the sense that you and a friend can work as RIO and pilot flying the same mission at the same time in the same aircraft. Yeah, take a second to break that one down mentally. Yes, the investment can be relatively large—you are talking at least spending a couple grand to get a system that is will get you flying in the VR environment. But the thing that most people don’t realize is that older computers paired with cutting-edge graphics cards can make the experience far more fiscally feasible for many people. For instance, I used DCS and Oculus on my seven-year-old I7 3770k with a new NVIDIA 1080ti graphics card stuck in it along with a USB 3.0 card and it ran fine. Even over the densest areas—like Dubai or Las Vegas—it was still smooth enough to not distract or make me nauseous, achieving about 35-45 frames per second. This took some tuning and learning about how to optimize the VR experience on my system, but it worked just fine. What I am getting at here is that your existing computer may be capable of running DCS in VR with between roughly $750 and $1000 worth of upgrades. https://youtube.com/watch?v=yNWXWOWspYQ If you want to future proof yourself and build an all-new VR gaming rig with the latest technology, you can design a cutting-edge system for about $3k if you buy all the premium parts yourself and have them assembled by a pro. Fry’s Electronics is inexpensive and they do an outstanding job. Then you add Oculus Rift, Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS, rudder pedals, and the software and you are looking at about another grand. So $4k gets you in the cockpit and ready for the next round of headsets that will be emerging soon. But once again, you can build a less ambitious system from scratch that will still kick ass for significantly less, say around $2,000 to $2,500. These new headsets, like PIMAX 5k+ and 8K , not only drastically boost resolution, but they also offer near full field of view capability. In other words, you don’t see the edges. It’s full visual immersion including your peripheral vision. Game changer. I honestly laugh when people tell me they play DCS strictly using track IR and a monitor. It’s not even the same game. And it seems that Eagle Dynamics understands this. They have announced that they are going to be doubling down huge on VR, with an eye on increasingly in-game performance and introducing new tech like haptic feedback—literally where you can use your hands to ‘touch’ the controls in the cockpit. You may say, “well I will wait till VR matures.” Ok, but I it’s already here and mature. The problem with VR is that people don’t know what they are missing until you take the leap of faith, but considering the air combat simulation software we have available for us, that leap is totally worth it. With all this in mind, maybe the best thing would be to get acquainted with VR at way lower cost and have a lot of fun doing it in the process. Oculus Go is stand alone, it requires no computer, and it costs about $200 for endless amounts of fun. To be honest, Oculus Go is actually impressive. It can’t play DCS of course, but Pinball VR is worth the entire price alone. In fact, it’s a great companion to a more serious VR rig as it runs on batteries and you can play around with it pretty much anywhere. So grab one of these for you and your family this Christmas. If you like the basic VR experience, you can then decide to step up to full gaming rig and jump into the cockpit of an F-14 Tomcat. ​ ​​​ Because I got asked repeatedly last time, here is the rig I would make if you want to have longevity, but not go insanely overboard with custom water cooling and that kind of thing: ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ ​ ​​​ The last part for the system build is graphics cards. I would say get an RTX 2080ti but they are really expensive right now. You could also get away with a GTX 1080ti or RTX 2080. But if you want as much future proofing as possible, you have to go with the latest and greatest, and in the process spend about $600 more. Still, you can always sell your 2080 or 1080ti and get a new one once prices drop. ​ ​​​ OR ​ ​​​ OR ​ ​​​ Finally, we have VR headsets. I am an Oculus guy but the Vive Pro does offer better resolution for more money. I would go with Oculus Rift as it is a GREAT deal for the money right now and you can upgrade down the road once Pimax matures or another higher definition, larger field of view headset hits the marketplace. ​ ​​​ On HOTAS controls, once again you can get by with cheaper equipment and still have a great time, but these are the gold standard: ​ ​​​ And a cheaper option: ​ ​​​ Rudder pedals are absolutely key if you don’t have a swiveling control stick for yaw axis control, which the Warthog HOTAS does not, but you don’t have to spend crazy money to get ones that work well. ​ ​​​ As for monitors, it doesn’t matter much because you will be spending your time in the helmet mounted display. Keyboard and mice are also up to you and a cheap, but very nice sounding speaker kit can be had for $35. Please keep in mind that this is an expensive build. You can spend less and still get great performance. Just switching the processor to the still awesome Intel 8700K and going for normal speed ram will save you close to $500. Heck, you can even buy a used gaming PC off Craigslist and slap in a new video card and get great results. But these components are hand-picked to maximize performance while still obtaining a very high value for a higher end build.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s elite Spetsnaz special operations group have a storied past that spans the entirety of the Cold War. Today, they are highly active once again—this time, on the shadowy battlefields that Russia has engaged itself on over the last three years. A recent video montage highlighting some of these elite soldiers’ weapons drills has been released—and although parts of it seem a bit more based in ’80s action movie nostalgia than in reality, it’s still impressive. In recent years, Russia has moved to evolve, modernize and better integrate its special operations capabilities. Some of their gear , structure and tactics have been adapted to more closely mirror those found under America’s Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Spetsnaz units in particular have put this new doctrine to work successfully in Syria, where they have been integral in leveraging Assad’s army, Hezbollah fighters supplied by Iran and Russian airpower into real military victories. Spetsnaz involvement in the ongoing fight in Ukraine is much more nebulous, even by Russia’s own admission , but suffice it to say their presence in that theatre has been openly felt since the first “little green men” descended onto the Crimean Peninsula three years ago. And that’s really how the Kremlin seems to like to keep the perception of their elite special forces—they can be everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",USAF Fighter And Bomber Crews Get Modified M4 Rifles That Fit Under Ejection Seats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in decades, U.S. Air Force fighter jet and bomber pilots are getting a new survival rifle, the Aircrew Self Defense Weapon, a variant of the AR-15/M16 pattern design that breaks in half and fits inside a standard survival kit . These aviators would have previously had to rely on pistols or even knives to defend themselves if they ever had to eject over hostile territory. The Air Force is making the self-defense guns in house by converting standard 5.56x45mm M4 carbines at a rate of 100 per week, according to The Firearm Blog , which was first to report the development. The gunsmiths at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, home of the Air Force Security Forces Center, expect to turn out more than 2,100 of the rifles in total and have already delivered some to combat-coded units. The guns are “designed for all combat-coded ejection aircraft,” U.S. Air Force Major Docleia Gibson, a spokesperson for Air Combat Command, told Air Force Times in a later report. It, along with “four full magazines, 30 rounds [each], must all fit in the ejection seat survival kit,” she added. One of the new Aircrew Self Defense Weapons., USAF via Air Force Times Gibson also said that the Air Force had officially designated the gun as the GAU-5/A, but the service already applied this designation during the Vietnam War-era to a variant of the original M16 rifle. This gun had a 10-inch barrel, which is shorter than present-day M4 with its 14.5-inch long barrel. There was also a GAU-5A/A with an 11.5-inch barrel. The Air Force primarily issued these guns to security personnel guarding planes and facilities on the ground. Starting in the 1990s, the Air Force began converting both of these weapons into an evolving configuration that was increasingly similar to the M4, called the GUU-5/P, a story I have written about in detail in the past. It is possible that the Air Force has decided to refer to the Aircrew Self Defense Weapon as a subvariant of the GAU-5/A, but then its correct designation would be GAU-5B/A. Airmen work on an ejection seat survival kit, which will now contain a break-apart rifle., USAF Regardless of the nomenclature, this rebooted GAU-5/A appears to share very little with its predecessors. The biggest change is the addition of a special locking system from a company called Cry Havoc Tactical that holds the barrel assembly onto the rest of the gun. Cry Havoc Tactical claims that a trained individual can install the front end of a weapon with their system and fire their first round within 60 seconds. The user does not need any special tools to put their gun together, which you can see in the video below. But otherwise, the Aircrew Self Defense Weapon appears to have same basic dimensions of the M4 in its firing configuration. The gun uses the same “ direct impingement ” operating mechanism found on other AR-15/M16 type guns, which means that after the shooter fires a round, some gas propelling the bullet gets filtered off to cycle the action to fire again. The arrangement blows any unburnt gunpowder and other particulate matter straight into the inner workings of the gun, which can build up and cause malfunctions if the user doesn’t clean it regularly. Various elements across the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps , have increasingly switched to derivatives of the AR-15/M16 pattern that use the gas to move a physical piston instead. US Air Force Security Forces personnel with a mix of GAU-5/As, at left, and GUU-5/Ps during Operation Desert Storm in 1991., USAF The gun features folding front and rear “iron sights” rather than an optic of some kind, which is likely a product of the need to fit inside the 16-by-14-by-3.5-inch dimensions of the aircrew survival kit. It is possible that the Air Force could include a small, non-magnifying sighting system of some kind in the future that a pilot could attach after reassembling their gun. However, it could be difficult to ensure that the detachable sight would remain properly aligned with either the gun or the individual shooter. The weapon does have attachment points for optics and various accessories on top and on all side of the handguard. The limited sights, along with the ballistic limitations of the 5.56x45mm round when combined with a shorter barrel, something you can read about in more detail here, could reduce the ability of the gun to accurately hit targets at even moderate ranges or neutralize them if it does. The Air Force would only say the Aircrew Self Defense Weapon is effective against enemies “beyond” 650 feet away, according to Air Force Times . The Air Force has been working on this latest project since at least 2017. But the final product is much different from the concept it showed in a briefing at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Armament Systems Forum & Firing Demonstration that year. A 2017 USAF Air Force briefing slide showing a notional “Aircraft Survival Carbine” conversion kit., USAF This gun featured a much shorter barrel than the standard M4 and an Sig Sauer arm brace rather than a traditional buttstock. This would have allowed the shooter to stabilize the weapon by strapping it to their forearm or use it as a regular stock if necessary. All of this would make sense given the obvious desire to keep the size and the weight of the overall weapon down. It is curious that they decided to go with a longer overall gun, especially when there are a myriad short-barrel AR-15/M16 types and derivatives – such as the Sig Sauer MCX that Jordan’s King Abdullah II is wielding in the video below – readily available both as complete guns and as conversion kits. The final design could have been based on a requirement to be able to engage targets at longer distances, but if this was the case the Air Force could have decided to use a different caliber that’s more effective when combined with a short barrel. The best known is alternative would be .300 Blackout , which Advanced Armament Corporation first created in the late 2000s specifically for use in AR-15/M16 type weapons and derivatives equipped with sound suppressors. The company found that the round also worked particularly well in unsuppressed, short-barreled guns. One test demonstrated that an AR-15 with a 9-inch barrel in .300 Blackout with had the same muzzle energy as a 5.56x45mm M4 carbine with its 14.5-inch barrel. An Air Force Security Forces airman with a standard M4 carbine during a training exercise., USAF AAC originally designed two basic types of the ammunition, one a supersonic 125 grain round and the other a 200 grain subsonic type specifically for firearms with sound suppressors. The former had ballistics similar to the to the Soviet-era 7.62x39mm cartridge . Since then, various companies have begun building their own .300 Blackout cartridges using various bullets and powder charges seeking to create optimal performance in different situations. In addition, 5.56x45mm and .300 Blackout have the same case head size and taper, which means that in AR-15/M16 type guns, switching from one round to the other can be as simple as swapping out the barrel. The two types of ammunition can use the same magazines, as well. With similar requirements in mind, U.S. Special Operations Command recently announced it would conduct field trials with a small number of guns based on the Sig Sauer MCX Rattlers. This is a a seriously compact weapon in .300 Blackout and the SOCOM’s requirements included the need for a conversion kit that could use any existing M4 lower receiver. This combination would seem to fit the ejection seat survival kit size requirements perfectly. It is possible that the Air Force went with a modified M4 as a cost-saving measure and to reduce strains on the logistics system by using as many common parts and ammunition as possible. Another option would have been to abandon the idea of using a rifle caliber weapon entirely in favor of a more purpose-built person defense weapon, such as the FN P90 or Heckler and Koch MP7 . These guns are already in service in the U.S. special operations forces and other government agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service . Heckler and Koch’s MP7 personal defense weapon., Heckler and Koch Pistol-caliber personal defense weapons or compact submachine guns would have been another possibility and one that would’ve allowed the Air Force to maintain ammunition commonality with other existing weapons . In 2015, after ISIS terrorists in Syria brutally murdered a Jordanian fighter pilot who had to eject over that country, the Dutch Air Force began issuing the diminutive 9mm MP9 personal defense weapon to aircrews in the region. The U.S. Army recently announced it was looking to buy a weapon in this category for personal security details , as well. Of course, any new rifles are much more effective than a 9mm pistol , but a downed aviator’s primary objective is to avoid detection until they are either rescued or they can evade and escape to safety. The new self-defense rifle is more multi-purpose than the survival weapons the Army and later the Air Force issued to aircraft crews during World War II and early in the Cold War, which were more suited to hunting small animals for food, but could also be a burden for a downed and possibly injured pilot to carry for protracted periods of time. This isn’t the first time the Air FOrce has tried to come up with a weapon that might be more useful in a combat situation, but that could fit inside a survival kit, either. In the 1960s and 1970s that service experimented with a bizarre looking gun , commonly called the “arm pistol,” that fired standard 5.56x45mm ammunition from an impressively small package. A drawing showing an early prototype of the GUU-4/P “arm pistol.”, USAF The gun, eventually known as the GUU-4/P, proved difficult to aim and shoot and never saw widespread use. Subsequent versions made their way onto the U.S. commercial market, but never saw major sales and are long out of production. If the videos on YouTube are any indication, no one can decide how to hold the guns while firing them, underscoring why they never made it into Air Force service. But while the risks of Air Force jets getting shot down during America’s present conflicts in places such as Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan are limited, that danger is growing . Small nations and even non-state actors are increasingly more capable of challenging opposing air forces . Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen shot down one of the Air Force’s MQ-9 Reaper drones in October 2017. Syrian insurgents brought down a Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft over that country in February 2018. In that case, the pilot ejected, but killed himself and a number of militants with a grenade after an ensuing skirmish on the ground. U.S. military aviation accidents have soared recently , too. Just in June 2018, the Air Force briefly grounded all of its B-1B bombers because of a problem with their ejection seats. This could put pilots in just as much danger if they have trouble over a conflict zone .  The aforementioned incident involving the Jordanian pilot over Syria is a good example. During the U.S.-led intervention in Libya in 2011, an F-15E Strike Eagle crashed in that country due to a technical issue and rescuing forces mistook a crowd of locals eager to help for a violent mob. Civilians stand on the wreck of a US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle that crashed in Libya in 2011, Anja Niedringhaus/AP The United States has also recently renewed its focus on preparing for potential high-end conflicts with a larger, conventional adversary, such as Russia or China . In that scenario, Air Force aviators could find themselves at increase risk of having to eject behind enemy lines and defend themselves for at least some amount of time. The steady proliferation of increasingly capable air defenses could make it difficult for traditional combat search and rescue parties to get to a crash site quickly, if at all. Fifth generation fighter jets and advanced stealthy bombers will, by definition, be flying into areas where existing rescue aircraft and helicopters will be unable to follow. This could be a particularly important driving factor in the Air Force’s decision to rapidly field the Aircrew Self Defense Weapon. But whatever the circumstances Air Force fighter and bomber pilots find themselves in now and in the near future, they’ll have the added peace of mind knowing that they have a little extra firepower under their ejection seats.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 3, 2019",“Laser Apache” Has Successfully Zapped Targets On White Sands Missile Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We reported on the concept and test program over a year ago , and now it has finally happened—a AH-64 Apache equipped with a tactical high-energy laser (HEL) successfully took out targets on the White Sands Missile Range. The test is a major breakthrough in directed energy weapons and rotary-wing air warfare to say the least. Above all else it is a glimpse of what’s to come on the battlefields of the near future. The statement from Raytheon, the primary contractor on the laser test program, reads : “A high energy laser mounted on an Apache AH-64 attack helicopter acquired and hit an unmanned target. The test was conducted by Raytheon and the U.S. Army Apache Program Management Office in collaboration with U.S. Special Operations Command at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. It was the first time a fully integrated laser system successfully shot a target from a rotary-wing aircraft over a wide variety of flight regimes, altitudes and air speeds, proving the feasibility of laser attack from Apache. The system tracked and directed energy on a stationary target at a slant range of 1.4 kilometers. (Slant range is the line-of-sight distance between two points at different levels.) The data collected from the test, including impact of vibration, dust and rotor downwash, will help shape future high-energy laser systems. “Our goal is to pull the future forward,” said Art Morrish, vice president of Advanced Concepts and Technologies for Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems. “This data collection shows we’re on the right track.” For the test, Raytheon coupled a variant of the Multi-Spectral Targeting System, an advanced, electro-optical, infrared sensor, with a laser. The MTS provided targeting information, situational awareness and beam control.” Raytheon It remains unclear exactly how powerful the laser is that is flying on the Apache, but it sounds like it is surprisingly well integrated for an experimental bolt-on device. The system’s size is also impressive. For a totally new exploratory program like this, the entire laser package is only about the size of one of the Apache’s external fuel tanks, which points to the possibility that this system can go from testing to the front lines faster than one may expect. Still, it’s not like American attack helicopters will be plinking tanks with lasers anytime soon, but they already have weapons that do that and tactical high-energy lasers can do things today that no weapons on an Apache or any other attack helicopter can. In my previous piece introducing the “Laser Apache” I wrote: “Modern attack helicopters are all about precision engagement capabilities. Unless you want a fairly large explosion that will obliterate a small building or a few vehicles, the best weapons available to Apache crews are the helicopter’s 30mm cannon and the recent addition of laser-guided rockets . Yet even these surgical weapons, with their highly-localized effects on the battlefield, still use high-explosives to make a big bang; if you want to be extremely precise with almost no chance of collateral damage, lasers are the way to go… If you want a tactical aircraft fighting in a combat zone to destroy a piece of equipment, like a power generator, but without destroying the structure it’s attached to, or to disable a vehicle without killing anyone standing around it, you’re out of luck unless you have a laser. With this in mind, there’s a clear and highly relevant requirement for a weapon that can accomplish such feats, a requirement as yet unfulfilled… Think about the ability to target a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, on a street without hurting other innocent bystanders going about their business just yards away. Being cooked by an invisible laser beam over the span of a few seconds would be a pretty nasty way for even a bad guy to go, but at least those close by would not have to be sacrificed in the process.” In another earlier piece on solid state airborne tactical lasers I wrote: “Precision weaponry has changed the way we fight wars and has helped greatly when it comes to avoiding non-combatant casualties, yet even low-yield warheads inside the smallest of guided bombs and missiles explode and can cause unintended harm. If aircrew could just target a person holding a weapon, or a small group persons holding weapons, and take them out using ‘non-kinetic’ weaponry, than we can save a lot of innocent lives, not to mention money, as even a mass-produced AGM-114 Hellfire missile each cost tens of thousands of dollars per round. Such a capability would be somewhat analogues to a phaser from Star Trek and just the psychological affect on the enemy knowing that they could erupt in flames at any moment while operating in the open could potentially be a game changer. It could also greatly alleviate the risk to human shields as air power may not be able to destroy a large target that has innocents commingled with the enemy inside, but it could shut down that facility’s operations long enough for ground forces to take the building down just by parking a aircraft with a solid-state laser above. If anyone has a weapon outside the facility, or even comes and goes from it, they could be cooked in an instant with almost no chance of unintended injuries or deaths. The same can be said when it comes to eliminating threats emanating from critical infrastructure or buildings with cultural significance. If there is a sniper atop a Mosque, than an aircraft equipped with a laser could disable or kill just that sniper, leaving the Mosque totally intact.” For special operations command in particular, equipping their helicopters with weapons like this, and being able to do everything from silently cutting power lines and melting generators to starting diversion fires and disabling vehicles from on high is clearly an incredibly attractive capability set. If anything, adding a podded laser to combat helicopters in general is among the most sensible application of solid-state tactical lasers today, and far less ambitious when compared to other ongoing aerospace laser development programs, ranging from C-130 mounted lasers , to fighter mounted lasers, to high-flying drone mounted lasers. Even though they are not sci-fi powerful at this time, they are really the lowest collateral damage airborne weapon imaginable today. As solid-state lasers become increasingly compact and higher power, their battlefield applications are becoming more clear and their development is accelerating. With today’s test in mind, their first offensive deployment on the battlefield could come from the rotary wing community, and that is very exciting.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 8, 2018",USAF Wants More Airlift Capacity But With C-17 Out Of Production What Could Provide It?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of a larger push to drastically expand the size of its force, the USAF wants to enhance its ability to move personnel materiel across the globe. The flying force’s vague but grand plan to add 74 combat squadrons to the 312 it already has was first announced by Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson in September. If realized, it would bring the Air Force’s total number of squadrons to 384 sometime around 2030. This had included an additional 14 tanker squadrons and a single extra airlift squadron, but the devil is in the details and part of the USAF’s plan would now see a number of C-130 squadrons be replaced by C-17 squadrons. The problem with that is the C-17 has been out of production for years. Valerie Insinna of Defensenews.com was the first to report on these new details, which emerged from a roundtable with Air Mobility Command (AMC) boss General Maryanne Miller and reporters late last week. She noted that the plan would include cutting two C-130 squadrons and adding three C-17 squadrons. As such, it would not only fit the framework of the 384 squadron initiative, but it would also match with AMC’s needs. But where would those C-17s come from? Apparently, even Miller doesn’t know, simply stating: “Those are the details that we have not looked at.” Restarting the C-17 production line in Long Beach, California is, well, pretty much a non-starter. Doing so would be prohibitively expensive unless Boeing were to invest heavily into such a scheme in hopes of sustained orders from the USAF or America’s allies. At this point, there doesn’t seem to be anywhere near the demand needed to make a business case out of such an endeavor. An updated C-17 was already being eyed when production wound down earlier in the decade, so putting the exact same C-17 configuration back into production seems somewhat wasteful. At the same time, developing a more capable and efficient sub-type just to create a few dozen aircraft also doesn’t make sense. Currently, there are no C-17s at the Pentagon’s boneyard in Tucson, Arizona. There may still have a small number of Globemaster IIIs in backup inventory at any given time, some were put into that status during sequester, but just thrusting those into active service really doesn’t solve the total end-strength airlift issue over the longer term. By rotating the C-17s around from active to guard to reserve units and into backup status, the USAF aimed to extend the life of its fleet of roughly 222 C-17s through the early 2030s. It may be possible to extend the life of some of the C-17s further through additional service life extension programs, but doing so would cost money and may have diminishing returns. Modernization efforts are already underway on the older C-17s as the aircraft had configuration differences as production evolved, but dramatically boosting airframe life beyond 30,000 is another story. USAF The thing is, the C-17 isn’t really the only solution to this problem as many understand it to be. Yes, the jet has great rough and short-field performance while still being able to cruise at higher altitudes and around 737 speeds. It can carry everything up to an M1 Abrams tank, so its outsized load carrying capabilities are impressive and useful. With the C-17, basically, you get tactical airlift capabilities blended with strategic ones. But there are tradeoffs. The C-17 isn’t particularly fast or fuel efficient. Its unrefueled range isn’t spectacular either and when you add in aerial refueling to a mission, the price of said mission skyrockets. The fact is that the USAF does a lot of transport missions that don’t really require the C-17’s unique talents and the performance tradeoffs that go along with them. So maybe investing in a more mundane cargo aircraft instead could help make the C-17 fleet more available for the tasks where its combat attributes are most needed. An M1 Abrams tank being loaded onto a C-17., USAF Two airframes come immediately to mind. The KC-46 and the 747-8F . A C-46A version of the KC-46A Pegasus tanker is really a turnkey airlifter. It would have all the avionics, hardening, internal cargo handling capabilities, and logistics and training infrastructure that would be required to support it from day one. The KC-46 is already capable of a huge variety of airlift missions in addition to its core tanking mission set. It was designed that way. But savings may be had by buying a number of additional airframes in C-46 configuration—without the tanking hardware fitted. It’s possible that provisions could be made for those airframes to be retrofitted as tankers if need be in the future, similar to how late block F/A-18Fs can be configured to accept the EA-18G Growler modification. Above all else, a non-tanker configured Pegasus would be lighter and cheaper. Boeing A C-46A could do everything from hauling personnel, pallets of cargo, and even light vehicles. This includes VIP transport and other unique mission sets that don’t require outsized cargo capabilities. Flying into war zones would be no problem for a notional C-46A either as it is already equipped with high-end defensive countermeasures and situational awareness suite. Its communications capabilities are also advanced and it could serve other roles as well by adding modular roll-on, roll-off networking payloads. It would also be possible to inject C-46 airframes right into existing KC-46 units as they are already proficient in the airlift mission. This would require little infrastructure investment and with small increases in personnel, the USAF could realize a sizeable boost in airlift capability all without impacting the KC-46’s critical tanking mission. Another option that would allow the USAF to move a lot of materiel fast and more efficiently than via a C-17, and with all with the support and reliability of a modern airliner, would be to procure a number of 747-8Fs. The 747-8i is already being introduced into the USAF’s ecosystem via the two VC-25B ‘Air Force One’ aircraft that are slated to be delivered to the 89th Airlift Wing in the early 2020s. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pl7xa4pB32E A massive amount of very expensive developmental work is being done to make these new aircraft possible, much of which would port directly over to a military airlifter variant. With the 747 production line in jeopardy, a small fleet of these aircraft may be had at a very reasonable cost. Having cargo-hauling versions of the 747-8 would also help spread sustainment costs of the VC-25Bs around and assist in training its pilots. 747-8F, Boeing Other options certainly exist, including highly popular freighter versions of the 777, but purchasing a variant of something already in the USAF’s inventory is advantageous for a number of reasons and is more likely to find funding from Congress. There is also the C-5 component of this equation to discuss as well. Nothing in the inventory can move as much stuff as far as the C-5 Galaxy . There are only 54 of these aircraft in the active inventory, the last of which was just delivered . The recapitalized fleet is set to fly into the 2040s. Eight C-5Ms had been stored in reserve—another result of sequester. There had been talk of returning these aircraft to operational service, but it’s not clear how far long that plan has gotten as of yet, but based on the inventory numbers we are seeing today, it looks like at least two of the Galaxies were returned to service. The plan had been to return a pair of the jets each year to active flying, with the last of the eight jets entering service in 2021. A line of C-5Ms., USAF So aside from going to the boneyard and plucking out old A model C-5s and giving them the C-5M treatment—roughly 70 were retired earlier in the decade—there aren’t enough upgraded jets on hand to build multiple squadrons out of. And the eight that were to be returned to service were to bolster existing flying units, not to stand up new squadrons. You see, the problem is that even though the C-5M program has worked marvelously at increasing nearly every aspect of the Galaxy’s globe-trotting performance, availability rates across the C-5M fleet remain dismal . Whereas the C-17 has proven to be a fairly reliable flyer, with a mission capable rate of around 83%, the C-5M has struggled to make good on its promise to raise the Galaxy out of mission capable rate gutter. As of 2017, the C-5M had a mission capable rate of around just 60%. That is nearing the realm of needing two aircraft to a one’s job—not good if you are trying to turbo-charge the USAF’s ability to shuffle gear around the great expanse of the Pacific Ocean. As the next decade gets underway, the Air Force will have to really start looking for a solution for its post-Globemaster III, and even post Galaxy, airlift needs. In the longer-term, the USAF has been eyeing more exotic airlift capabilities, like blended-wing-body designs , but anything like that is going to come at a high cost and will have to compete with far ‘sexier’ high-priority aircraft programs. Even pushing the C-17s out another ten years, to an early 2040s out of service date, doesn’t give the USAF all that much time to stand up and deliver on an entirely new strategic airlifter or family of strategic airlifters, for that matter. In the end, not every airlifter has to land on an unimproved airstrip in the middle of nowhere or carry an Abrams main battle tank. At least building up some organic airlift capacity by acquiring highly reliable and cost-effective cargo haulers that emanate from commercial types, aircraft whose military development has already been paid for, would allow the C-17 community to focus more on the tougher missions that really demand the airframe’s unique capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 7, 2020",We Talk V-280 Valor Versus V-22 Osprey With Bell’s Head Of Tiltrotor Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There seems to be a lot of questions surrounding Bell’s V-280 Valor, including how it differs from the V-22 Osprey and how the company intends on making the case that its second iteration of tiltrotor technology should replace a large number of H-60 Black Hawk variants, along with other helicopters, to satisfy the Pentagon’s ambitious Future Vertical Lift initiative . The V-280’s primary competition exists in the form of Sikorsky’s SB>1 Defiant coaxial rotor, pusher-compound helicopter. The V-280 recently transitioned into cruise mode, with its prop-rotors tilted fully forward, for the first time. The company lauds the fact that its prototype is flying and well into its testing regimen. Meanwhile, Sikorsky’s SB>1 still hasn’t taken to the skies after multiple delays. But a smaller derivative of the same technology, the S-97 Raider , has been flying for three years with a second prototype now on hand. Bell was more than willing to field our inquiries, with Keith Flail, Vice President, Advanced Tiltrotor Systems providing us with the company’s official answers. The exchange provides a clearer view of what the Valor was designed to do and how it differs with its established forebearer, the Osprey, and to some extent, its competition. It also gives us an indication of where the design may migrate beyond the Pentagon’s stated needs. It’s clear that the Future Vertical Lift competition is heating up and the Army says the program cannot be delayed . So without further adieu, here is our exchange with the head honcho of Bell’s tiltrotor division: Without the shipboard requirement and constraints of the V-22, is the V-280 able to feature a more optimized and efficient tiltrotor design? “The V-280 is designed to be a multi-service, multi-mission aircraft capable of meeting shipboard compatibility requirements. Those may differ between services. The Army may or may not have a shipboard requirement. However, the USMC will likely require shipboard compatibility and marinization. The design of the V-280 will lend itself to either requirement. Bell has a proven history of high commonality across multi-mission aircraft with the UH-1Y and AH-1Z. Tiltrotor blade fold, wing stow capability is something we are experienced in as well with the MV, CV, and soon the CMV-22. Folding blades and stowing wings adds to the cost and weight, but may be required for the mission and are features Bell is very experienced with designing and manufacturing.” Bell certainly has the pedigree when it comes to maritime vertical lift capabilities. This image shows the company’s MV-22s, AH-1Ys, and AH-1Zs packing the deck of a San Antonio class Amphibious Transport Dock., Bell How does the V-280’s targeted performance stack against to the MV-22’s performance? “The weight of the V-280 will be less than a V-22. A V-22 is characterized as a medium heavy aircraft with a different mission set than the V-280 in the medium-lift, long-range assault or attack role . The aircraft will have similar speeds and ranges dependent upon the final service requirements. The USMC will likely require the V-280 to have comparable speeds to a V-22 as they field future attack aircraft that will have to provide support to the V-22.” V-280s in the attack configuration, replete with Hellfire missiles and side-ejecting tube-launched weapons. , Bell In what way are the V-280’s fixed nacelles an improvement over the V-22’s pivoting nacelle configuration? “The V-280 fixed engine configuration provides both operational and maintainability features across the spectrum of FVL multi-service mission sets. With over 400,000 flight hours and lesson learned applied into the V-280 clean sheet design, we have been able to capitalize on operational and maintainability opportunities. Our fixed engine configuration allows maintainers the ability to remove an engine, drive shaft or gearbox independent of each other, reducing time required for maintenance procedures, and increasing aircraft availability to the operator. Having a non-rotating nacelle affords troops easy access entering and exiting the side doors and allows the aircraft to deploy self-protection weapons while conducting low-speed flight approaching, departing and in landing zones.” V-280 Valor, Bell What major differences are there between the interior and cabin features of the MV-22 and the V-280 Valor? How were these differences dictated by the V-280’s targeted mission se t? “The V-22 was designed for a medium/heavy assault support, utility mission. The V-280 was designed as a multi-mission platform, easily reconfigurable for attack or MEDEVAC missions. The V-280 was purpose-built for the Army and Marine Corps basic fighting units, the infantry squad. The V-22 is capable of carrying 24 passengers while the V-280 is designed for 12 passengers. This allows expansion to carry squad enablers, medics, interpreters, dog teams, embedded reporter or whatever the mission dictates. The V-22 has a rear cargo ramp while the V-280 is designed with side doors for rapid ingress and egress of the aircraft. Having large side doors adds a great deal of mission flexibility and the volume of the cabin enables it to be reconfigured for a variety of mission sets.” The V-22’s larger troop carrying capacity and rear ramp are major differences between it and the V-280., Bell The MV-22 costs around $70M a copy. A Black Hawk costs a fraction of that price. How will the V-280 be able to replace a large number of H-60s from a fiscal standpoint? Can you share any targeted price projections even if general in nature? “We designed the V-280 to be manufactured at a comparable cost as an AH-64E (roughly $30M per unit) or Special Operations variant of a H-60. The real benefit is the total value proposition of the tiltrotor platform where the advantages of the improved speed, range, and payload mean that you can accomplish the same missions with fewer aircraft and much less support infrastructure. When you look at the big picture, cost to execute and support the mission, the ability to reduce overall force structure and logistics presents very favorable compounding effects.” How different are the two aircraft from a pilot’s and maintainer’s perspective? Are operations similar? “There are several characteristics of the V-280 already mentioned that will increase maintainer efficiency. Additionally, the aircraft was designed, built and is currently being maintained in a digital environment or what we refer to as the digital thread. This allows the maintainer to view the aircraft technical data in three dimensions. They will receive updates much like your mobile phones or computers today. If there are changes to procedures updates can be pushed to the fleet. As maintenance is performed, there is visibility across the supply chain on repair parts demand and trends. We are gathering a significant amount of data during flight testing that will start to inform an integrated vehicle monitoring system as well. This reduces the life cycle cost of the aircraft allowing condition-based maintenance and predictability across the supply from manufacturing to the user. Flying the aircraft will be similar with the exception of improved performance in digital flight controls, reduced disk loading, and improved low-speed agility enabled by an increase in the amount of blade flapping designed into the rotor system.” V-280 Valor, Bell Why would an air arm that doesn’t plan on deploying an aircraft primarily in the shipboard environment buy the V-22 when they can wait and get the Valor? “Being shipboard capable is really not a discriminator in this discussion. The bottom line is the two aircraft are different in terms of size and designed for different missions. The V-22 was originally designed to perform a ship to shore assault mission. The unique capabilities of the aircraft have expanded the mission sets. The V-22 is an extremely capable medium to heavy lift aircraft while the V-280 was purpose-built to support the medium lift and long-range assault mission in demanding environments. The V-280 was designed around the infantry squad. The basic fighting unit of the Army and Marine Corps.” Rendering of a ship-borne V-280 derivative. , Bell Some have questioned the larger footprint of the V-280 compared to traditional helicopters like the Black Hawk and how it could adversely impact certain mission sets. What’s Bell’s view on this? “The V-280 has a slightly larger footprint than the UH-60. However, you get speeds and ranges to fight against near-peer threats with unprecedented operational productivity. You can’t win the fight unless you’re in the fight. As an example, if you put 10 UH-60s on a soccer field for an air assault, you can put 10 V-280s in that same field, but you could execute missions with twice the speed and twice the range.” V-280 Valor with prop-rotors tilted fully forward for cruise. , Bell Why is the V-280’s tilt-rotor tech superior to the compound pusher coaxial helicopter concept that is being fielded by the competition? “We can’t speak to the coaxial pusher prop technology or its capability. For long range and high speeds, wing-borne flight is highly efficient. There are also some distinct advantages for survivability and high-speed maneuverability. Bell tiltrotor technology has proven itself with over 400,000 hours of operational experience and the V-22 being one of the most in demand aircraft for contingency operations around the world. The tiltrotor configuration is mature and this maturity and reliability has allowed the V-280 test team to rapidly enter into flight testing with an advanced air vehicle and actually expand the flight envelope to cruise mode in the five months since first flight. Bell’s innovative engineers and USMC and USAF operations have proven tiltrotor is the solution to performance requirements to meet warfighters’ future vertical lift requirements. Speed, range and agility – we don’t make you choose.” The USAF’s special operations configured CV-22s have been constantly at work in combat zones and rough international neighborhoods around the globe over the last decade. , Bell What military variants does Bell envision for the V-280 concept? “The V-280 is seen as a multi-service aircraft for Army, USMC, and SOCOM capable of fulfilling multiple missions Assault, Utility, Attack, combat search-and-rescue, and MEDEVAC.” V-280 Valor, Bell This aircraft seems like it would have many applications outside of Future Vertical Lift, such as search and rescue and even commercial and private applications. Has there been interest in the design outside of the Pentagon? “There has been a great deal of interest in the commercial applications of tiltrotors. Civil air transport, off-shore energy support and search and rescue. Tiltrotors can solve many of the challenges civil aviation faces today. Decrease in facilities cost and noise, increased efficiency in energy and time. During a Search and Rescue (SAR) event speed is life. In most SAR events if you need speed and range it takes two aircraft to perform the mission. A fast, longer range fixed wing to search and find, followed by a ship/boat or rotorcraft to rescue. With the V-280 you can increase your search area and time by a factor of two and actually recover personnel. Truly a search and rescue rather than search then rescue.” V-280 shown in the MEDEVAC role. , Bell What are the biggest technology challenges facing the V-280 program at this time? “The two biggest goals for the JMR-TD effort were to showcase the revolutionary capabilities of this next generation tiltrotor platform, and to demonstrate life cycle affordability. The team took on challenges in the design and manufacture of the wing, blades, flight controls, and drive system configuration to “bring the proof.” As with any advanced development, you identify issues along the way, adapt, and overcome. These systems have now been tested not only in flight, but in the lab in production representative tests to include static, fatigue, and endurance tests. This gives us a lot of confidence, and data, to back up the value proposition of our next generation tiltrotor. Right now, the team is focused on flight test and continuing to mature and spiral in new capabilities.” Finally, sources often state that the V-280 is stealthy, and it does look futuristic that’s for sure, but were any low-observable elements actually integrated into the design? “The survivability requirements have not been defined by the Services but we are leaning forward in ensuring we design an aircraft that can get to and win the fight. Speed and range are a part of that. Aircraft survivability will be a combination of active and passive countermeasures to prevent detection and engagement. However, if engaged and hit, the critical components are protected and have triple redundancy. Additionally, the aircraft has several design attributes that increase the survivability of the occupants during a hard-crash sequence as compared to helicopters. The aircraft is single engine capable as well.” Conceptual art showing a V-280 during aerial refueling. The aircraft will be able to self-deploy across the globe like the V-22. , Bell A special thanks to Bell’s Michael Reilly for facilitating this article.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The past few days have been pretty intense for certain U.S. military personnel training off the coast of Norway and at Fort Bragg back home in North Carolina. Just days ago, two U.S. Navy amphibious warships had to return to Iceland with injured sailors after suffering damage in harsh weather while sailing in the Norweigan Sea on their way to a major exercise . More recently, a U.S. Army Humvee fell out of the back of a U.S. Air Force C-17 airlifter , with the vehicle parachuting down in between homes in Cameron, North Carolina. USNI News was first to report the incident in the Norweigan Sea, which occurred on the evening of Oct. 22, 2018, and appears to have the potential to be relatively serious. The Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima and the other two ships in her Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), the San Antonio -class landing platform dock USS New York and the Whidbey Island -class landing ship dock USS Gunston Hall , were on their way to join Exercise Trident Juncture , a massive NATO-led drill in and around Norway. “The amphibious dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall (LSD-44) experienced heavy seas…,” the U.S. Navy said in a statement, according to USNI News . “As a result, the ship’s Landing Craft Utilities (LCU) and well deck experienced damage. The Gunston Hall is in port Reykjavik, Iceland for further assessment.” The exact extent of the damage is unclear, but the New York accompanied Gunston Hall back to Iceland as a precaution. An unspecified number of sailors suffered minor injuries, as well, but had all received treatment and were back on duty as of Oct. 24, 2018. From the sounds of it, the seas had sent the ship pitching and rolling violently enough for her 134-foot, 140-ton LCU 1610-class landing craft to slam up against the interior of the Gunston Hall ‘s well deck. Whidbey Island -class landing ships, which are 609 feet long and displace over 16,000 tons, can carry up to two LCU 1610s at a time. A fully loaded LCU 1610-class landing craft during a training exercise in the Pacific Ocean in 2004., USN The seas off the coast of Northern Europe are notoriously unforgiving , often experiencing frigid temperatures and extreme weather. The Iwo Jima and her ARG were supposed to participate in a simulated amphibious landing in Iceland on Oct. 16, 2018, ahead of Trident Juncture’s official start date. Poor weather initially delayed that drill a day and eventually led to its cancellation altogether, USNI News noted . The well deck aboard the 30-year-old ship., USS Gungston Hall’s Facebook page The Navy has stressed that it is rightly exercising an abundance of caution since there is no actual crisis that demands all three ships in the ARG. It remains to be seen just how extensive the damage to the Gunston Hall actually is, though, and whether it will make its way to join the rest of the forces taking part in Trident Juncture eventually. The live-fire portion of the drill runs from Oct. 25 through Nov. 7, 2018, after which the participants will move on to a command post exercise before the entire event wraps up on Nov. 23, 2018. “This is not war, there is not an imperative that I do something right now today,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Brad  Skillman, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 2, which includes the Iwo Jima ‘s ARG, explained to USNI News . “Well, what happens if you have high winds or heavy seas that day? You have to decide whether you want to pick up and move it to another day or you just want to cancel it.” Closer to him, on Oct. 24, 2018, residents of Cameron, North Carolina, some 20 miles northwest of Fort Bragg, had the unusual experience of watching an Army Humvee come sailing down into a wooded area in between a pair of rural homes. An Air Force C-17 from the 437th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Charleston in neighboring South Carolina was on a test mission when it accidentally dropped the vehicle well ahead of reaching the base’s Sicily Drop Zone. Thankfully no one was injured in the air or on the ground and vehicle avoided smashing into private property. As of 4:30 PM, Eastern Standard Time, workers on the ground were still trying to extricate the vehicle from where it had landed. Fort Bragg has long been a major base for airborne and special operations forces units. The flight was in support of the Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, which was evaluating a new airdrop method at the time, according to a Fort Bragg spokesperson . It’s unclear what went wrong, but the incident is already under investigation. This accident has already prompted comparison to an incident at the Hohenfels Training Area in Germany in which three Humvees went smashing into the ground after their parachutes failed to open during an airdrop exercise. In May 2018, the Army convicted then-Sergeant John Skipper, who had been a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Italy, of deliberately cutting the parachute straps. Skipper’s motives remain unclear. There is no evidence as yet to indicate that this latest incident at Fort Bragg was anything but an accident. Again, we’re grateful that no one in North Carolina got hurt and we’re hoping that the damage to the Gunston Hall and her landing craft turns out to be relatively minor. But these incidents are a reminder that there truly is no quiet days in the world’s largest military.

Frying Pan Tower back in its operational heyday. , Frying Pan Tower Facebook page Frying Pan Tower Facebook page The tower, which is really a modified drilling platform, sits on a shoal fifty feet below the waterline. During its active career, it would host continuous rotations of Coasties. Life on a lonely lighthouse platform out in the Atlantic—one that had to stay lit even during major storms—was not for the faint of heart. So creature comforts were factored into the tower’s construction, offering as comfortable of a lifestyle as possible for the era and for such a remote location. 5,000 square feet of living space that make up the lower part of the platform includes seven bedrooms, a recreation area, a kitchen, an office, storage areas and so on. The top of the platform acts as a landing pad but it can also be accessed by boat, although there is no easy way of doing so as the lower portion of a circular staircase was ripped off in a storm. With the stairs gone, the winch and scaling a ladder are the only alternatives. The accommodations aboard the platform are ‘rustic’ to say the least.  But if you are in it for a period-specific experience, why muck it up with modern accoutrements? , Fptower.com Fptower.com Fptower.com The recreation area on Frying Pan Tower. A pool table also sits to the left. , Fptower.com Frying Pan Tower Facebook page After over half a century of being bathed in saltwater, the structure needs some TLC but it has been deemed in overall sound condition by a recent survey. Originally the Coast Guard was going to tear it down, but they ended up auctioning it off in 2009 for half a million dollars to a company named Shipwrecks Inc. that wanted to use the spot for a sport fishing and diving outpost. Supposedly the sea life around the tower is incredible . That plan fell through when Shipwrecks Inc. defaulted on making a down-payment and in 2010 the facility was snapped up for a cool $85,000 by North Carolina native Richard Neal. Neal still owns it today and works with a team of passionate volunteers to restore the tower and execute his adventure hotel vision. We love guys like Neal who spend their most valued time keeping history alive for others to enjoy, and the more far out the project, the better. Just learning about the tower also reminds us of the brave souls who inhabited it continuously for all those years so that mariners could navigate safely. Imagine trying to sleep at night during a massive storm that can produce waves nearly as high as the platform itself and there is always the chance that a ship could collide with it in an age that predated GPS and other automated navigational aids. At this point in time, it looks like the eye of the hurricane could pass directly over the 85-foot tall structure, which would offer a unique viewing experience for throngs of viewers and major news outlets that are glued to the tower’s webcam.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 23, 2021",America’s Top General In Afghanistan Packs An Old School 1911 Pistol,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A week ago, the top American officer in Afghanistan, U.S. Army General Scott Miller, appeared at a meeting with Afghan troops armed with a version of the iconic .45 caliber Colt M1911 pistol , which has served across the U.S. military for more than a century now. For now, this is Miller’s issued sidearm, but the historic handgun is becoming an increasingly rare sight in the hands of American troops. The last major user of M1911 variants, the U.S. Marine Corps , plans to stop issuing them within the next four years. Afghanistan’s TOLONews grabbed the pictures of Miller during a stop in either Uruzgan or Kandahar province on May 28, 2019. Lieutenant General Zia, Afghanistan’s Deputy Minister of Defense, and Brigadier General Koshal Sadat, the country’s Deputy Minister of Interior for Security, accompanied the American officer, who is presently head of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A). “It is standard practice for General Miller and all other soldiers to carry their issued weapon while in combat,” a spokesperson for the Resolute Support Mission told The War Zone in an Email regarding the event. Of course, Miller did not appear to be in combat during the visit. But it’s still not surprising that he was carrying a pistol while making these sorts of stops in Uruzgan and Kandahar, where insurgent activity remains high. In addition, insider attacks continue to be a serious threat to coalition forces in Afghanistan. Miller himself was involved in one such incident in October 2018 , which claimed the life of controversial National Police General Abdul Raziq . The American general reportedly drew his sidearm during that shootout, which also left U.S. Army Brigadier General Jeffery Smiley – head of Train, Advise, Assist and Command – South (TAAC-S) – wounded. The pictures that TOLONews took of him in the field showed he was carrying the single-action pistol “cocked and locked,” indicating the gun is in ‘condition one’ and ready to fire. The pistol’s manual safety is presumably engaged and typical M1911 pattern guns also have a grip safety that the shooter has to depress with the web of their hand in order to fire. Astute observers also noted that none of the Afghan troops shaking hands with Miller were armed themselves. The Resolute Support Mission public affairs office did not say what particular make and model the gun was, but confirmed that it is Miller’s “issued weapon.” We don’t know what unit or other organization issued the gun to him. The all-black pistol does not appear to be one the Marine Corps’ standard issue M45A1s , which are among the most ubiquitous and modern M1911-style pistols still in widespread U.S. military service, but also have a distinctive tan Cerakote ceramic finish. But more on those guns and other specialized examples in a moment. A Marine fires an M45A1., USMC It can be hard to spot specific makes and models of M1911s and derivatives of the general pattern. Often simply called just as the Colt .45s, the design has evolved in many different directions in the decades since Colt first brought it to market and remain very popular on the U.S. commercial market, including versions in other calibers, such as .40 Smith and Wesson, 10mm, and 9x19mm. The gun’s origins trace to the turn of the century as the U.S. Army began a search for what would become its first standard-issue semi-automatic sidearm. The Army’s experiences fighting Moro guerillas during the Philippine-American War between 1899 and 1902, in which troops complained bitterly about the limited stopping power of their .38 caliber Colt M1892 revolvers, informed the service’s requirements for the new handgun. Legendary gun designer John Browning, then working at Colt, crafted what would become the Model of 1911 , or M1911, which used its own then-new ammunition, the .45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP) cartridge. Though adopted in 1911, gun’s first major combat outing was with Army troops along the U.S.-Mexico border during the Punitive Expedition five years later. It then went on to particularly notable service with American forces in Europe during World War I. In the interwar period, Colt began producing the M1911A1, which featured a number of external refinements, but which generally so minor that they are largely unnoticeable at a glance to the untrained eye. Various companies would get U.S. government contracts to make the pistols to meet demand and the design quickly became popular among militaries and on the commercial market around the world. A Remington-made M1911A1., M62 via Wikimedia M1911s and M1911A1s continued to serve alongside each other in World War II and for decades afterward. The guns remained one of the primary standard issue sidearm throughout the U.S. military until 1986, the year after the Army officially adopted the 9mm Beretta M9 and as other branches began to follow suit. It is worth noting that .38 caliber revolvers had also remained in widespread use, especially with the U.S. Air Force , up until that point. The Army felt that a 9mm pistol, such as the Beretta, would offer a number of advantages over the M1911, including a larger magazine. Though there are more modern examples with larger magazine capacities, many 1911s retain the original 7-round magazine design. However, U.S. special operations forces, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, continued to use M1911-style guns afterward, favoring its larger .45 caliber round over 9mm. In the 1990s, Marine armorers at Marine Corps Base Quantico made a number of customized M1911A1 for Force Reconnaissance and other specialized units, which became known as the MEU(SOC) pistol – standing for Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) – or M45. In 2012, the Marines began buying improved M45A1s from Colt, which notably had a small accessory rail on the underside of the frame and the Cerakote finish. The initial versions of the finish proved to be ill-suited to wear and tear in the field and wore off quickly. A closeup of an M45A1 showing wear to the finish., USMC The Army’s top-secret Delta Force was another a particular proponent of the design. Miller, perhaps not surprisingly, is a veteran of Delta Force, having served with it in Somalia , the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq, at least that we know of. The general has also previously been head of the top coalition special operations element in Afghanistan and the commanding officer of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command Delta Force founder U.S. Army Colonel Charlie Beckwith “preferred the .45ACP, mentioning in his memoirs that the round didn’t tend to over penetrate – a vital consideration he felt when shooting pistols around hostages or other non-combatants,” according to Leigh Neville’s Guns of Special Forces, 2001  -2015 . “Delta’s original pistols were apparently match grade M1911A1s with the adjustable rear sight replaced by one designed by a Delta armorer.” Delta Force subsequently transitioned to versions purchased first from Caspian Arms and then STI International . By the 2010s, Delta Force had reportedly largely shifted to Glock pistols in 9mm or .40 Smith and Wesson, which have become increasingly popular with U.S. special operations forces, in general. The Austrian design is both easier to maintain and has a higher magazine capacity. An STI Tactical, an M1911-pattern pistol., STI International There is a possibility that Miller was able to request one of Delta’s specialized M1911 variants after he took up his newest post in Afghanistan, if he hadn’t been carrying one as his personal sidearm the whole time. But there may be increasing pressure in the coming years, even for general officers, to abandon these pistols in favor of designs that are in more widespread use. In May 2019 , the Marine Corps confirmed that they were planning to phase out all of their M45A1s, along with their Beretta M9s and recently purchased Glock M007s , in favor of the new Sig Sauer M18 by 2023. The M18 is the compact variant of the Army’s new Modular Handgun System (MHS) pistol family, which other services are in the process of adopting and that you can read about, in general, more here . As already noted, U.S. special operations forces have also increasingly moved away from the M1911 in recent years, though that’s not to say that .45 caliber pistols have gone away. The U.S. Navy SEALs adopted a particularly large design from Heckler and Koch, known as the Mk 23 Mod 0 , in the 1990s. In 2010, they began issuing a variant of the more manageable Heckler and Koch HK45C , known as the Mk 24 Mod 0. But, if General Miller is any indication, it seems very likely that M1911s and variants of that design will still keep going to war zones with American forces, even if in increasingly more limited capacities, for some time to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 31, 2019",Navy’s F-35C Stealth Fighters Won’t Fly From Troubled New Ford Class Carriers For Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of Congress want to make it illegal for the U.S. Navy to accept delivery its next Ford -class aircraft carrier, the future USS John F. Kennedy , unless it can launch and recover F-35C Joint Strike Fighters . But the proposal highlights something that is perhaps more damning, that the USS Gerald R. Ford cannot deploy those stealthy aircraft in its present configuration. This just adds to the woes for the troubled first-in-class flattop two years after its delivery. The House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces included the provision in a draft of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year, which it released publicly on June 3, 2019. The ship that is due to become officially named the USS John F. Kennedy , and is also known by its hull number CVN-79, is already under construction at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. Just on May 29, 2019, workers lowered the 588-ton island, which stands 72 feet tall, into position on the deck, a major milestone that means the ship is now more than 90 percent structurally complete, though much work remains to do. The Navy expects to commission the new carrier in 2024. “This section would require the Secretary of the Navy to ensure that the aircraft carrier to be designated CVN-79 is capable of deploying with the F-35 prior to accepting delivery,” the draft NDAA text states bluntly . It is important to note that there is no guarantee that it will be in any final version of the bill that goes to a full vote later this year or that it will become law. But the more important thing here is that this is an admission that the Ford herself, which the Navy officially took delivery of in May 2017, cannot, at present, can’t deploy the F-35C at all. The service declared initial operational capability with this carrier-based version of the Joint Strike Fighter in February 2019 and the jets are supposed to make their first operational deployment aboard the Nimitz -class USS Carl Vinson in 2021. The Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee’s language doesn’t say why this is the case, though Congressional staffers blamed it on previously legislated cost-cutting efforts, which legislators are also looking to repeal. In 2016, Congress demanded the Navy deliver reports on how it could try to keep the final bill for Ford , as well as the price tags of the other upcoming ships in the class, under control. The goal was to put a cap of no more than $11 billion on Kennedy ‘s ultimate cost, which it reportedly has already exceeded . But “CVN-79 will not be able to deploy with F-35s when it’s delivered to the Navy as a direct result of that cost cap,” Seapower and Projection Forces committee staffer told reporters, according to USNI News . “So when that cost cap was imposed, the Navy traded that capability off and chose to build that back in on the back end.” The assertion is that these funding shortfalls have delays efforts to fix a host of issues on the Ford . When it comes to the lack of F-35 capability specifically, the most likely culprits are the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). These electrically-powered and electronically-controlled systems are supposed to give the Ford -class more control over the finer aspects of the launch and recovery process. The Navy claims this will improve sortie generation rates, reduce wear and tear on aircraft, and increase reliability and safety across the board. The War Zone has explored on multiple occasions how both systems, in practice, have chronically underperformed . The problems have been so persistent, that the Ford has been unable to meet its performance targets for launching and recovering aircraft even after the Navy lowered the bar with a “ re-baselined reliability growth curve .” These issues are well known at this point and President Donald Trump has now railed against the troubled catapults , in particular, on more than one occasion . During a recent trip to Japan, he claimed that may order the Navy to return to using steam catapults in future carriers. In an Email to The War Zone , Naval Sea Systems Command declined to comment on whether this was true or if it was even exploring alternative options for any future Ford -class ships. Difficulties with EMALS and AAG have also resulted in delays in creating so-called “launch and recovery bulletins” that define the parameters for launching and recovering certain aircraft in certain configurations. As of February 2019 , the Ford could only deploy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or EA-18G Growlers with certain loadouts, though the Navy expected to have this issue resolved by the end of the year. An F-35C, at right, along with an F/A-18E Super Hornet, on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln during tests in 2018., USN It’s not clear when the Navy expects to even start validating the launch and recovery bulletins for the F-35C. In 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, warned that Ford -class carriers might not have the ability to deploy with the Joint Strike Fighters until 2027 at the very earliest. The report also noted that, at the time, the Navy had not included the F-35C is in land-based testing of the AAG at all. In that same report, GAO had expressed concerns about the regular delivery of spare parts for the jets to the carrier, especially replacement engines, to ensure adequate F-35C mission capable rates, something that remains an issue for the jets, in general . The Navy says that its new CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor will be able to sufficiently replace the aging C-2 Greyhound in the Carry Onboard Delivery (COD) role, including carrying the F-35’s engine. Of course, the EMALS, AAG, and its inability to deploy the F-35C are just some of Ford ‘s many woes. Just recently, the Navy admitted that not all of the ship’s advanced weapon elevators, which bring ordnance and other equipment up to the main deck, would be working by the time it returned to the fleet following a scheduled maintenance availability. The maintenance availability had already been extended due to a separate propulsion system issue . Ford is now not expected to return to whatever kind of duty it is capable of until at least October 2019. As it stands now, two years after the Navy received the ship, only a pair of Ford’s 11 AWEs are working. It’s unclear when they all might get certified for regular use. The Navy is now planning to build a land-based test facility for the elevators, but that won’t become operational until sometime in 2020. The elevators are absolutely critical to the ship’s ability to fight. In January 2019, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer had said Trump should fire him if the elevator issue didn’t get resolved by the end of the summer. All of these issues – and there are many more – can only call into question Ford ‘s utility in any capacity, including non-combat training and test missions. Members of Congress are clearly increasingly worried that the next ship in the class will be similarly limited. Just on June 4, 2019, Raytheon announced the completion of the final developmental test of the carrier’s integrated combat management system. These persistent problems also come in the aftermath of a brief, but acrimonious battle between legislators and the Navy, along with the Pentagon and the White House, about the timeline for retiring Nimitz -class carriers . The Trump Administration has now backtracked completely on its still puzzling proposal to retire the USS Harry S. Truman prematurely and Congress is looking to prevent any reversal of that decision, but at a certain point, the existing flattops will begin to age out. The Navy already needs a functional replacement for the now decommissioned one-of-a-kind USS Enterprise . If the Navy can’t start making real progress on the Ford program’s troubles, the service risks real operational shortfalls regardless of whether or not ships can deploy the F-35C.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019","The Army Is Working On A Mini Assault Rifle That Performs Like An M4, But Is Half As Big","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army researchers are working to develop a personal defense weapon that offers the same muzzle velocity as a standard M4 carbine in a package that’s half as long, half the weight, and uses smaller, lighter ammunition. The service’s engineers say that the design features they are working with to achieve these results are readily scalable and could offer a path to lighter weight rifles and machine guns in the future, too. In March 2019, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), situated at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, test-fired an experimental design with a 10 inch-long barrel using ammunition with just a single gram of gunpowder, according to a story from TechLink . The gun demonstrated a muzzle velocity of more than 2,900 feet per second. An M4 firing standard 5.56x45mm M855A1 ammunition , which has around one and a half times as much powder, has an average muzzle velocity of around 2,970 feet per second. “The goal is to get rifle-like velocities out of a very small weapon that is high capacity, that’s either adaptable for room-clearing or confined spaces,” said Zac Wingard, a mechanical engineer at ARL told TechLink . TechLink, part of the Montana State University’s Office of Research and Economic Development, helps the Department of Defense license technology it develops in-house to private firms who can then further develop it into commercially viable, mass-producible products. Much of the technology behind ARL’s prototype miniature assault rifle is rooted in well-established concepts. The biggest issue when designing any gun to fire higher velocity ammunition, is the need to safely contain the pressure when the gunpowder inside the cartridge detonates. If the firearm isn’t strong enough to handle these forces, it could break, potentially so severely as to injure the shooter. The video below gives a detailed overview of the inner workings of an AR-15/M16 pattern gun, which gives a good general sense of the various physical forces at play inside a typical modern rifle. Other designs differ in their exact internal mechanisms, but the basic sequence of operation – chambering a round, firing that round, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case, and resetting the system to fire again – is effectively the same. Historically, the main way of mitigating this has been to reinforce the breech face and chamber, which seal the cartridge in place before it goes off, as well as other components. This, however, adds weight and bulk that does not necessarily lend itself to compact, lightweight firearms. “The powder used now in most ammunitions can be tweaked, so it runs at a higher pressure, but the guns can’t handle it,” Alex Michlin, another ARL engineer, explained to TechLink. “That’s why we designed the new breech, so we can take existing propellant and turn the knob all the way up to 11.” Michlin holds the patent for the new breach design, which screws securely into place as the weapon cycles, helping distribute the force along a greater area and increasing the pressure the gun can handle without adding significant extra weight. It’s not clear, but it does appear that this design would add some extra length since the mechanism needs more distance to lock and unlock during firing than a more traditional system. This might not be a serious issue if designers can use a shorter barrel and still hit the desired performance targets. A bullpup design or a flush, top-loading magazine could also help in reducing the gun’s profile. Drawings from Michlin’s patent showing the screw locking design and how it works., USTPO Another issue is that higher pressures cause metal cartridge cases to expand more, increasing the chance that they could get stuck in the breech and jam the gun, especially during fully automatic firing. Michlin patented a second component that uses tapered wedges that grip the sides of the cartridge cases, reportedly requiring 50 percent less energy to do so in a more traditional system that yanks them out backward by their base. This could actually further improve the reliability of the gun, since it requires less energy overall to properly cycle the action after each shot. A diagram of the tapered wedges that extract the cartridge cases., ARL Lastly, the experimental gun uses a special, tapered barrel that gets narrower right at the end, physically squeezing the projectile into a narrower profile, which gives it an extra boost in velocity as it pushes out the end. This concept, commonly known as a “ squeeze bore ,” dates back to Nazi Germany in the 1930s. The Army, among others, also tested various guns using these types of barrels, ranging from small arms to light cannons, for decades afterward, but never fielded any of the designs. A diagram showing the general barrel configuration ARL has been experimenting with, which features a traditional, rifled section and then a smooth, tapered portion., ARL The end result is a weapon that can remain compact, but keep velocities up closer to a standard carbine or rifle. This would also help ensure the shorter-barrel design has adequate armor penetration capabilities, which is something the Army is becoming increasingly concerned about , in general, as potential opponents, such as Russia and China, field new and improved body armor. If ARL’s design is viable outside the laboratory, it might lead to a revival of the squeeze bore concept and could have a significant impact on personal defense weapon designs. Over the years, various companies have worked on personal defense weapons using highly specialized ammunition to get as close to rifle-like performance as possible at relatively short ranges into extremely compact packages. The 4.7mm Heckler and Koch MP7 –  as seen at the top of this story – and 5.7mm FN P90 are perhaps the best-known examples and are in service with the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team Six and the U.S. Secret Service , respectively, among other users. TechLink noted that the P90 also has a 10-inch barrel, but only has a muzzle velocity of around 2,350 feet per second. ARL’s gun also reportedly has a 50-round magazine capacity like this Belgian personal defense weapon. But without knowing the exact specifics of ARL’s new ammunition or its experimental gun, it’s almost impossible to make a real direct comparison between the two. The Army did recently hire the Defense Ordnance Technology  Consortium, another public-private partnership, to facilitate the development of a new personal defense weapon, according to the Spring 2019 issue of Army AL&T , an official magazine of the Army Acquisition Support Center . However, it is unclear if this is at all related to the experimental ARL program. AL&T included a picture of Sig Sauer’s Rattler , a gun that U.S. Special Operations Command is testing and that you can read about in more detail here , as a representative design. This gun does not use any of the technology that ARL says it is working with for its experimental design. A picture of a Sig Sauer Rattler from Army AL&T magazine., via US Army ARL also told TechLink that the design it was working on is scalable into larger packages that could serve as smaller, lighter substitutes for full-size rifles or machine guns. Another prototype gun with a 24-inch barrel produced muzzle velocities between 4,600 and 5,750 feet per second. A full-size M16 service rifle, which has a 20-inch barrel, has an average muzzle velocity of around 3,150 feet per second with standard 5.56x45mm M855A1 ammunition. If these guns can also use lighter ammunition, it could give troops additional firepower, but with reduced weight and bulk. This would be especially valuable for regular units conducting extended dismounted patrols or special operations forces that might find themselves operating well beyond traditional supply lines for protracted periods. It’s not clear when troops might actually find themselves armed with guns based on ARL’s current research. “This effort is about accelerating technology transition from the laboratory prototype and integrating into other programs,” T’Jae Ellis, an ARL spokesperson, told Task & Purpose , adding that the project was not directly unrelated to the Army’s development of a family of rifles and squad automatic weapons that will use a new 6.8mm cartridge . But, at some point in the future, Army soldiers may find themselves on the battlefield carrying an entirely new suite of compact, lighter weight guns based on the prototypes that ARL is experimenting with now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2018",Here’s What The Army’s First Ever Operational Hypersonic Missile Unit Will Look Like,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has laid out its plans for establishing its first ever unit armed with hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , as well as the transporter erector launchers, or TELs, that will carry the weapons. The service describes this unique artillery battery as primarily as an experimental organization that will help with the development of new concepts of operation around the employment of hypersonic weapons, but insists that it will also have a “residual” operational capability. U.S. Army Lieutenant General Neil Thurgood, head of the service’s recently rebranded Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO), announced the details of the new unit , which does not yet have a designation, at the Association of the U.S. Army’s LANPAC conference in Hawaii in May 2019. Formerly known as the Army Rapid Capabilities Office , RCCTO is overseeing the service’s contributions to the development of a common hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that will also eventually enter service as a submarine- and air-launched weapon with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, respectively. The core of the Army’s ground-based hypersonic weapon battery will be four TELs, each installed on a modified M870 40-ton trailer . At present, the Army uses its standard M870s, which are about 30 feet long, to carry heavy loads, including armored vehicles and construction equipment. M983A4 tractors , members of the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) family, which also tow Patriot surface-to-air missile launchers, will pull the TELs, giving the unit road-mobile and limited off-road capabilities. An M983A4 towing a Patriot missile launcher. The Army’s hypersonic weapon system will use this same tractor to tow a trail-mounted TEL., US Army Each TEL will have two canisterized hypersonic weapons at the ready and the unit will have an unspecified number of additional missiles on hand. The weapon design, which you can read about in more detail here , is unpowered boost-glide type that uses a rocket booster to get it up to the appropriate speed and altitude. The exact capabilities of the conical boost-glide vehicle are classified, but it is derived from work that Sandia National Laboratories did on what was called the Sandia Winged Energetic Reentry Vehicle Experiment (SWERVE) during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This, in turn, informed an early U.S. Army program called the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW). The Army’s requirements for the AHW were a sustained speed of at least Mach 8 and the ability to travel approximately 3,700 miles in 35 minutes. If the new design has similar capabilities, it would give the battery an unprecedented ability to launch short- or no-notice strikes against time-sensitive and other critical targets. What makes hypersonic weapons, including unpowered boost-glide vehicles, especially threatening is their ability to maneuver inside the atmosphere and fly more unpredictable routes to their targets, compared to existing longer-range weapons, such as ballistic missiles. This makes it hard for opponents to spot them in enough time to relocate or otherwise take up a defensive posture. The idea of trying to intercept a hypersonic missile is especially complicated and makes them ideal weapons for striking heavily defended targets. The War Zone has previously examined the game-changing capabilities hypersonic weapons offer in greater depth here . A rendering of the AHW., US Army The hypersonic weapon battery will also have a truck-mounted Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) that will be responsible for processing mission requests and otherwise providing command and control functions. AFATDS has been in service since the 1990s as a centralized fire control network for both Army and Marine Corps artillery units. It has received a number of significant upgrades over the years to improve its overall capabilities and add in improved and increasingly automated functionality. This includes the ability to better match fire support requests to the most appropriate weapon systems. The Army’s plan is to begin standing up the new unit around 2021 and deliver the first TEL to the battery’s soldiers that year. The troops won’t have any live rounds at that time, though, and will be focused on more general training to learn how to operate the complete weapon system. Even without the ability to conduct live fire exercises, the battery will still be able to perform a host of tasks representative of how the unit might function in an actual operational scenario. It will also be able to identify and evaluate various operational requirements that might be unique to the unit, such its air transportability requirements, which could include figuring out how many aircraft and of what type are necessary to airlift the battery. This could be an extremely significant factor in how hypersonic weapon elements are deployed and employed. “The reason we’re going to do that is because we need them to start training,” Lieutenant General Thurgood said at the LANPAC conference . “So when we get to the first (live round) shot a year later, they’ll actually know what it looks like.” U.S. Army Lieutenant General Neil Thurgood speaks at the LANPAC conference., US Army In 2022, the service wants the battery to conduct the first test launch of a hypersonic weapon from the TEL. Additional ground-based test firings will then occur every six months until the battery reaches its initial operational capability in 2023. “That is what we’re fielding,” Thurgood added. “That is the outcome of an experimental prototype unit with residual combat capability.” What will happen to the battery after that is unclear. Thurgood said that it could join the service’s larger Multi-Domain Task Force . This unit has been experimenting with other new weapons and other systems, as well as concepts of operation to go along with them, with a particular eye toward exploring options to counter Chinese and Russian area denial and anti-access capabilities . During the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise last year, this task force employed a mix of ground-based artillery rockets and anti-ship missiles , along with AH-64 Apache gunship helicopters and MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones, to sink a decommissioned landing ship. Other U.S. military services and foreign allies also took part in this sinking exercise, giving the Army unit an opportunity to explore how it might fight in larger scale conflict as part of a broader coalition. It’s also not clear what the Army’s timeline for standing up additional hypersonic weapon batteries might be or how they will be assigned throughout the Army. Thurgood mentioned the possibility of a centralized Strategic Fires Battalion that could include the hypersonic battery, as well as other ground-based longer-range strike systems. With the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , with Russia, the U.S. military is planning to test a ground-launched cruise missile and an intermediate-range ballistic missile as early as this year. Whatever the exact schedule turns out to be for the fielding of additional ground-based hypersonic weapons capabilities, Thurgood is adamant that the Army wants to get the hypersonic capability “out of the lab” and into the hands of troops in the field as quickly as possible. “We’ve been in a full-out sprint since then and I personally just love it,” he said. “We need to get this equipment in the hands of soldiers quickly to learn and then give the Army a decision point,” the lieutenant general continued. The U.S. military has a significant incentive to begin fielding hypersonic weapons as quickly as possible given developments among its potential opponents, especially Russia and China. The Kremlin claims that it is well on its way to fielding its own hypersonic boost-glide vehicle and says that it has already has fielded an air-launched hypersonic missile . China looks to be close behind in similar developments . The answers to the question of how exactly the Army expects establish its own ground-based hypersonic missile capability and integrate it within its existing force structure will become clearer in the coming years as the Army’s first-ever hypersonic weapon battery begins to take shape.
