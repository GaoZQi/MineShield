By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but a wildfire in Washington State’s Spokane County has now spread onto Fairchild Air Force Base. Photos The War Zone has obtained show a large plume of smoke rising from beyond one of the base’s aircraft parking areas. U.S. Air Force Captain Kyle Nelson, a helicopter pilot who also goes by the handle @flyingsharkknives on Instagram, was kind enough to share the pictures with us. The public affairs office at Fairchild confirmed to The War Zone that the fire breached the perimeter and that firefighters were on the scene. They say that there is no danger, at present, to the base’s facilities or aircraft. US Air Force Captain Kyle Nelson / @flyingsharkknives US Air Force Captain Kyle Nelson / @flyingsharkknives The fire in question appears to be one identified earlier in the day as the Bartholomew Fire, which started near the city of Medical Lake. The blaze has since grown to cover at least 40 acres and is threatening homes and other structures outside of Fairchild Air Force Base. This fire is something of a cruel irony for Fairchild, which is home to the 92nd Air Refueling Wing and its KC-135R aerial refueling tankers. Last week, 17 KC-10A Extender tankers from Travis Air Force Base in California touched down at the base after they were forced to evacuate due to raging wildfires in their home state. Hopefully, first responders will be able to get this fire burning on Fairchild Air Force Base and in surrounding areas under control quickly, before it can cause any significant damage. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 7:00pm EST Fairchild Air Force Base’s public affairs office has now released a more detailed statement through their official Facebook page.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 11, 2020",Here’s How The U.S. Could Allay Israeli Concerns Over Selling F-35s To UAE,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The possibility that the United States could sell F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to the United Arab Emirates following its normalization of relations with Israel has been met with fierce opposition from Israeli officials and politicians . As such, it has already led to a political spat between the two now openly friendly Middle Eastern nations. However, the U.S. government has a number of potential mechanisms, including leveraging the heavily interconnected nature of the support systems that come along with the F-35 and the general complexities of operating those jets, that it could use to help assuage Israeli concerns that the prospective sale might challenge its “ qualitative military edge ” in the region. Reports that a sale of F-35s to the UAE was tied to its new deal with Israel had first emerged within days of the two countries announcing that they would normalize their diplomatic relations on Aug. 13, 2020. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu subsequently denied that there were any direct references to arms sales of any kind to the UAE in the agreement. “The U.S. has made it clear that it will always take strict care to maintain Israel’s qualitative edge,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office read. The Prime Minister “was explicit in Israel’s opposition to the sale of F-35s and other advanced weaponry to any country in the Middle East.” Israeli opposition Since those latest reports of a potential sale of F-35s to the UAE first emerged, there has been a steady, vocal backlash to the plan within Israel. The Israeli Air Force is presently the only operator of the type in the Middle East. “It’s not good for Israel that the plane is going around in other places,” Benny Gantz, the head of the Blue and White political coalition, who is serving both as Alternate Prime Minister and Defense Minister as part of the power-sharing agreement that ended an Israeli political crisis earlier this year, told reporters on Aug. 18 . “We need to talk to the Emiratis, to the Americans, and make sure that our security interests are being upheld,” Gantz told reporters in a press conference.” Israeli Air Force F-35Is, also known as the Adir., Israeli Air Force “We oppose the sale of even one screw of one plane of the stealth fighters to any country in the Middle East, if we have peace with them or not,” Tzachi Hanegbi, head of the recently created Settlement Affairs Ministry, as well as a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party and long-time supporter of the Prime Minister, said on Aug. 25 . “That’s our position, and it has been presented in the past and has been clarified in recent weeks.” Still, whatever the U.S.-brokered deal between Israel and the UAE did and didn’t cover, and whatever the Israeli position may be right now, authorities in Abu Dhabi clearly understood that this was all supposed to provide them a path to acquiring F-35s, among other things. Emirati officials reportedly canceled a planned trilateral meeting with American and Israeli representatives earlier this month in protest to Israel’s recent public opposition to the sale. The U.S. government had also given the impression a possible F-35 sale to the UAE was now more firmly on the table. “They have the money and they would like to order quite a few F-35s,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 23 . “It’s the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by stealth, totally stealth .” “They’d like to buy F-35s, we’ll see what happens,” he continued. “It’s under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East.” Export controls This is hardly the first time that the UAE has expressed interest in acquiring Joint Strike Fighters. If it were to get approval to buy them, the country would become the first operator the F-35 in the Middle East outside of Israel and could pave the way for other sales in the region . When it comes to selling the UAE the jets now, the United States is not necessarily bound by Israeli protestations, though as America’s chief ally in the region, they certainly carry significant weight and the U.S. government has a long-standing history of being deferential to many of Israel’s concerns. At the same time, American authorities have similarly extensive experience with placing significant controls on arms sales to politically sensitive customers. One of the best-known examples is how closely the U.S. government monitors the status and use of Pakistan’s F-16 Viper fighter jet fleet . “Each technical security team is made up of four to five U.S. Air Force personnel and some 30 contractors who keep a round-the-clock watch on Pakistan’s advanced F-16s,” according to a recent War On The Rocks article , where one of the authors had actually been part of this program. “The mission of the teams is to ensure that the Pakistan Air Force uses its F-16s as intended, does not modify them or the weapons they carry, and does not share the technology with unauthorized parties.” A Pakistani F-16BM drops two GBU-10/B laser-guided bombs during a training exercise., Asuspine via Wikimedia That last point would be of even greater significance with regards to the F-35, to Israel and the United States. The U.S. government notably ejected Turkey , a NATO ally, form the Joint Strike Fighter program over concerns that Russia might be able to glean sensitive details about the aircraft’s capabilities by way of supporting the Turkish military’s new S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. Other safeguards There have been rumors over the years that Pakistan’s Vipers have tracking devices hidden inside them, or within certain components, as well as additional systems that would allow American officials to remotely disable at least key capabilities on the jets, if necessary. Reportedly , these F-16s also already have certain systems with more limited functionality compared to their American counterparts and the U.S. government has taken additional steps to prevent Pakistani personnel from servicing certain key elements independently. Preventing a customer from servicing all aspects of a fighter jet independently makes them beholden to outside support, which might be more difficult after a political break with the United States. This, in turn, could quickly lead to a deterioration in combat capability if the jets don’t end up being grounded entirely. This actually appears to be what is happening to the Iraqi Air Force’s F-16IQ fleet after Lockheed Martin withdrew contractors due to safety concerns after an unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strike aimed at American personnel in Iraq in January. “The issue is Lockheed withdrew its employees. However, all these planes [F-16s] need to be serviced and supervised,” an Iraqi pilot recently told Fox News . “But because of a lack of parts, the Iraqi defense ministry started making its own parts and things, which is not allowed and effectively voids the warranty on them. In one case, a tool was left inside one of the engines.” An Iraqi F-16IQ fighter jet., USAF “Most planes are now grounded because they [air force personnel] don’t know what they are doing re the upkeeping, which in turn means that the Iraqi pilots can’t do their certification flights every month thus are rendered not combat-ready,” that same source continued. Some countries, such as Venezuela and Iran , have managed to keep American-supplied fourth-generation fighter jets operational after support for those aircraft was severed, but the actual combat utility of those aircraft has long been a matter of debate. Turkey notably began stockpiling spare parts for its F-16s last year, to try to ensure that it could continue more normal operations amid concerns that the U.S. government might enact a blanket arms embargo against the country over the S-400 spat, as well as Ankara’s unilateral intervention into Northern Syria last year. Congress has quietly blocked any new arms sales to Turkey since mid-2018 in response to the Russian surface-to-air missile system purchase and other subsequent issues. The stealthy fifth-generation F-35 would present a much more significant challenge in this regard. Just maintaining the jet’s low observable coatings would be very difficult without the appropriate infrastructure and support, even for a short period of time. The jets are also notably more maintenance intensive , just in general, and require spare parts that need to be sourced through a worldwide integrated logistics chain . The aircraft also have a greater number of proprietary systems, as well as software, compared to their predecessors. The F-35’s heavily networked nature Exerting this kind of control over any future UAE F-35 fleet may actually be even easier to do given the Joint Strike Fighter’s cloud-based support infrastructure, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), and the planned successor to that system, the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN). At present, ALIS, which you can read about more in detail in this past War Zone piece , acts as a conduit through which a wide swath of data passes. This data includes, as its name implies, information about maintenance and logistics issues, including the diagnosing of faults and the ordering of replacement parts, as well as new software upgrades. In addition, however, it is also the loading point for operational mission packages, which include flight route and target information, as well as locations of possible threats and other hazards. At the completion of a mission, sensor data and other details come out the same way to help with debriefing and future mission planning. How deeply integrated ALIS has been into every aspect of F-35 operations has been a source of concern for other U.S. allies in the past, who worried that it could be grabbing sensitive information and putting it on U.S. government or Lockheed Martin servers. A number of Joint Strike Fighter program participants have since developed their own firewalls to prevent the outflow of certain information, but still have to rely on the computerized system for day-to-day operations. Loss of access to ALIS could be severely limiting, if not totally debilitating to an F-35 operator in short order. It’s worth noting that this is why Israel already fought to secure the rights to operate its F-35Is , also known as Adirs, independently of ALIS and add Israeli-specific software to the jets. This makes them unlike any other Joint Strike Fighters in the world, even those that the U.S. Air Force, Marines, and Navy fly. The U.S. military is also now in the process of transition from ALIS, which has been long criticized for not working properly, a saga you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , to ODIN. In addition to hopefully addressing many of the long-standing issues with ALIS, this new system is notably a U.S. government-owned product, rather than proprietary Lockheed Martin one. This raises the possibility that the U.S. government may be able to further develop an export-specific version with reduced capabilities and built-in backdoor safeguards for certain future customers, even beyond the UAE. Aid and other concessions to Israel Beyond export controls and other limits the U.S. could place on any F-35s that might go to the UAE, it could also seek to mitigate any Israeli concerns by approving new arms sales, as well as other military and security assistance, among other things to that country. There are some indications already that Israel may already know that the Emirate Joint Strike Fighters are going to become a reality and is looking to leverage that in this way. “Even if there’s a chance that they won’t accept our position, they’ll find a way to strengthen our advantages, as they’ve done in the past,” Israeli Settlements Affairs Minister Hanegbi had said on Aug. 25. “I assume the Americans are developing means to overcome ‘stealthiness.’” Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a separate interview on the same day. “If they share that with us, it will be good.” The Israel Defense Forces are in the midst of a number of modernization efforts, especially with regards to aircraft and helicopters, that it could also seek to link in some way to its support for a UAE F-35 purchase. This includes the potential acquisition of new advanced F-15 combat jets , orders for KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tankers, and a replacement for its CH-53 Yasur heavy-lift helicopter fleet. With regards to the F-15s, specifically, the jets that Israel is considering could be very similar to the U.S. Air Force’s future F-15EXs , which that service has indicated might be able to carry future hypersonic weapons . That’s a combination that Israel could be very interested in gaining access to, which would give them another tool for conducting long-range strikes against time-sensitive or other high-value targets deep inside a hostile country. Israel was an early pioneer of using the F-15 as a long-strike platform and is set to operate Eagles alongside its F-35s for years to come. An Israeli F-15I., Israeli Air Force Israeli authorities could also seek U.S. government support on other more tangential issues, such as the controversial settlements in occupied Palestinian territories and other territorial claims. President Donald Trump’s Administration has already been very supportive of Israeli efforts in those regards, formally recognizing Israel’s capital as Jerusalem in 2017, as well as move the U.S. Embassy there , and the country’s sovereignty over the contested Golan Heights region last year. Domestic Israeli considerations Though it certainly has legitimate national security concerns, it’s also not clear how much of Israel’s public opposition to the UAE buying F-35s is also being driven by domestic politics. Israeli media reports on the purported “ secret clause ” regarding the jets in the normalization deal also suggested that Netanyahu had negotiated it without consulting Gantz. The Prime Minister, who is on trial over corruption charges, proceedings which are due to resume next year , has been embattled for some time now, had found himself in a 500-day-long political crisis that eventually led to the current Israeli government power-sharing arrangement . Whether or not it’s politically tenable at all for Israeli politicians to express approval of any kind for the UAE’s F-35 aspirations in the near term, no matter what the United States might offer in return, very much remains to be seen. How authorities in Abu Dhabi might respond themselves is unclear. From a practical viewpoint, there is not necessarily an immediate need for the Emirate Air Force to get F-35s, as it has been working in recent years to upgrade its already relatively advanced U.S.-supplied F-16E/F Desert Falcons , as well as its French-made Mirage 2000 combat jets. An Emirati Air Force F-16F Desert Falcon., Lockheed Martin There has also been talk that the UAE might buy newer Russian fighters, such as the Su-35S Flanker-E or the Su-57 . All of these efforts and proposals are byproducts of the UAE being unable to secure approval to buy F-35s on multiple occasions already in the past. The possibility that the Emirati Air Force could seriously consider acquiring aircraft from Russia would likely impact the U.S. government’s own decision-making process, irrespective of Israeli concerns. Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior advisor who has been heavily involved in Middle East diplomatic efforts, had said in an interview on Aug. 23 that the normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE “should increase the probability” of the latter country getting F-35s. “Obviously we’ll look at the QME [qualitative military edge] and we’ll do everything in accordance with the right standards, but it’s something that the State Department and the U.S. military is looking at.” There certainly seems to be growing support within the U.S. government to finally sell F-35s to the UAE and it has many options available to it that could help convince Israel to drop its opposition, ones that Israel may already see as beneficial and is gaming to make them a reality.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Channel 10 News, the ABC affiliate in San Diego, reports that a sailor is under investigation for the fire that burned for days aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard . The blaze has likely destroyed the multi-billion-dollar capital ship. Channel 10 News states: Multiple sources with close ties to Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) told ABC 10News that investigators determined the July 12 fire may have been set intentionally. Investigators identified a sailor as an arson suspect in their probe, sources said. The sources added multiple search warrants were executed at the sailor’s home and property. The sailor’s name and rank were not disclosed. The outlet also stated that the NCIS team dealing with the investigation has “requested help from the National Response Team for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) because the agency provides resources and expertise on complex, large-scale incidents like the massive ship fire.” If indeed a serviceperson caused this, it could represent the most expensive single losses of property due to arson anywhere, let alone from within the Navy. It’s worth noting that a civilian contractor was to blame for what is now the second-worst fire aboard a U.S. Navy vessel in recent memory. In 2012, Casey Fury , a painter and sandblaster, lit the Los Angeles class nuclear fast-attack submarine USS Miami (SSN-755) on fire. The damage was pegged at the better part of $1B and the ship was removed from service as a result. We have to highlight that just because there is a suspect, it doesn’t mean they are guilty or that arson is even the definitive cause of the fire. Still, if this ends up being the case, it will be another gut-punch for the U.S. Navy and will have wide-ranging impacts. We will keep you informed as the investigation continues to unfold.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 16, 2020",China Tests Long-Range Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles As U.S. Spy Plane Watches It All,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force fired a number of ballistic missiles into the northern end of the South China Sea from locations in mainland China, simulating an apparent anti-ship strike as part of exercises in that region that is a clear signal aimed at the United States. A U.S. Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball spy plane, which is designed to collect various kinds of intelligence about ballistic missile launches, was observed on online flight tracking software flying into the area ahead of this particular phase of the Chinese drills. The South China Morning Post reported that Chinese forces fired one DF-26B and one DF-21D on Aug. 26, 2020. An American defense official subsequently told Reuters that the United States had assessed that the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had fired four medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) – defined as ballistic missiles with maximum ranges between 621 miles and 1,864 miles – in total, but that analysis of the available intelligence was ongoing to determine what types were launched. The DF-21D is an MRBM, but the DF-26B is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a category consisting of notably longer-range weapons able to hit targets out to distances between 1,864 miles and 3,417 miles. Both the DF-21D and the DF-26 are both understood to have warheads with enough maneuverability to hit large, relatively slow-moving ships, such as aircraft carriers. Chinese media has specifically dubbed the DF-21D the “ carrier killer .” DF-21D medium-range ballistic missiles., Imaginechina via AP DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles., Imaginechina via AP Chinese forces reportedly fired the DF-26B from a site in Qinghai province in the northwestern portion of the country, while the DF-21D was launched from Zhejiang province on China’s eastern coastline, according to the South China Morning Post . The missiles landed in the South China Sea between the disputed Paracel Islands and China’s Hainan island . This all matches up with information in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) that Chinese authorities had issued on Aug. 25. The two launch areas are within MRBM range of the South China Sea, but this does not necessarily mean that the weapons fired were actually MRBMs, but could explain the U.S. government’s present assessment. This apparent confusion over the total number and types of missiles fired is exactly why the Air Force would have sent the RC-135S to the area to at least observe the warheads crashing down into the South China Sea. The aircraft in question, which carries the serial number 62-4128, is one of just three Cobra Balls that are in service today. The RC-135S flew from Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa into the northeastern portion of the South China Sea, before making a relatively hard u-turn and then heading back to base. This matches up with a known maneuver Cobra Ball crews use to capture imagery, telemetry, and other electronic intelligence on ballistic missile warheads returning to earth. The aircraft is also capable of similarly monitoring ballistic missile launches. No matter how many missiles Chinese forces fired into the South China Sea, or exactly what types, the launches were clearly meant to send a message to the U.S. military. Long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles that the PLARF can fire at ships hundreds, if not thousands of miles away from the relative safety of the Chinese mainland are a significant addition to the country’s already impressive anti-access and area-denial capabilities in the region . These launches, as well as the major naval exercise that they were a part of, following significant American military activity in the region, as well as elsewhere in the Pacific. U.S. allies and partners, such as Australia, Japan , and Taiwan , have also been active in recent months. Notably, in the context of these anti-ship ballistic missiles launches, in July, two U.S. Navy Nimitz class aircraft carriers, the first-in-class USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan , took part in a large exercise in the South China Sea, the first of its kind in years. This is not the first time that the Chinese have conducted an exercise like this, either. Last year, the PLARF also fired DF-26s and DF-21Ds into the South China Sea, but with the impact area, in that case, being much further south, near the contested Spratly Islands. Chinese forces are also conducting other major naval exercises in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Bohai, both of which are much further to the north. Another drill in the East China Sea recently wrapped up. All of this follows a steady stream of drills that the People’s Liberation Army has been conducting across the Pacific in recent months. Especially with regards to the South China Sea and adjacent areas, these Chinese exercises have similarly prompted a noticeable uptick in U.S. military aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, beyond just the RC-135S observing today’s missile launches. Officials in China registered a formal complaint just yesterday after a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane flew over one of the northern exercises areas, where Chinese warships have been conducting live-fire drills, which you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . Satellite imagery from Planet Labs dated Aug. 25 actually managed to catch what appears to a missile launch in the Yellow Sea, either from a surface warship or a submarine. This is indicative of just some of the Chinese activities that the United States is certainly looking to scoop up intelligence on at the moment. All of this comes amid a significant increase in geopolitical friction between Washington and Beijing in regards to the South China Sea, as well as a wide array of other issues ranging from the Chinese government’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong , authorities in Taiwan looking to distance themselves further from the mainland, international trade, and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic . There is a significant amount of overlap between many of these disputes, as well. On Aug. 26, the U.S. government sanctioned 24 Chinese companies specifically over their links to the expansion of the People’s Liberation Army’s presence on various man-made outposts in the South China Sea. This followed a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump’s Administration in July to formally adopt a policy position that China’s broad sweeping claims in the region are unlawful. All told, it’s hardly surprising that the Chinese military is testing some of its most strategic capabilities in the South China Sea, which also demonstrated a clear challenge to its U.S. counterparts in the region.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 19, 2020",American Armored Vehicle Crew Injured After Violent Encounter With Russian Convoy in Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Officials have confirmed that the crew of a U.S. armored vehicle was injured after running into a Russian military convoy in an incident in northeast Syria earlier this week. The episode appears to be related to a series of videos of tense encounters between the two forces that have been uploaded to social media channels. The sequences shown in the videos look more like something out of Mad Max: Fury Road than what you think you would find on a modern battlefield. According to different American media sources , quoting unnamed U.S. officials, the incident occurred when a Russian vehicle apparently deliberately collided with one of its American counterparts, resulting in four U.S. soldiers sustaining “concussion-like injuries.” Other outlets state that “multiple U.S. troops were injured.” The news emerged soon after the appearance of video online showing a Russian helicopter performing a potentially dangerous low-level maneuver over American troops. Politico reports that this shows the same incident, and the footage does include an apparent collision between U.S. and Russian vehicles. The confrontation between American forces and a Russian military patrol seen in the videos also shows a Russian Aerospace Forces Mi-8AMTSh Hip combat helicopter swooping low over a convoy, apparently in an effort to disperse the U.S. elements. The use of a helicopter as a means of dispersing people on the ground is potentially dangerous, especially when there’s a high risk of foreign object debris damage . It is a tactic that was the subject of much discussion after the protests in Washington D.C. earlier this year, as The War Zone examined here . Some of the footage seems to have been taken from a Russian vehicle — perhaps a Tigr all-terrain infantry mobility vehicle — in a field alongside a road and near the front of a stationary convoy, with several other armored trucks waiting behind. The Mi-8AMTSh — armed with pods for 80-millimeter unguided rockets — approaches at low level from the rear before hovering ahead of the column of vehicles, its rotor blades kicking up straw and other debris from the fields below. The Hip then turns away, remaining at very low altitude. A longer video of the same confrontation also seems to show U.S. forces blocking the Russian convoy’s route through the field. It is then that an American MaxxPro mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle appears to be involved in a collision with a Russian Typhoon-K armored truck. This could be the incident in which the American soldiers were injured. Another clip shows an encounter between two U.S. vehicles and an assortment of Russian hardware, including a BTR-80 armored personnel carrier, two Typhoon-Ks, a Ural-4320 truck, and two Tigr vehicles, as well as Mi-8AMTSh and Mi-35M helicopters. In this case, an American MaxxPro MRAP appears to be moving at speed before apparently being brought to a halt between a Russian BTR-80 and a Typhoon-K. It isn’t clear if this video series is related to the incident where the U.S. soldiers were injured or if it occurred beforehand. This isn’t the first confrontation between Russian and American patrols in northeast Syria. Earlier this year, The War Zone reported on another “road rage” incident between U.S. and Russian troops in Syria, when a video emerged online showing a U.S. military M-ATV mine-resistant vehicle running a Russian Tigr armored utility vehicle off the road somewhere in northeastern Syria. Other tense spats involving Russian and U.S. forces have happened, as well. There have also been multiple firefights between American troops and forces aligned with the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Just last week, a U.S. patrol took fire from pro-Assad forces after passing through their checkpoint near Tal Al-Zahab in northeastern Syria. There were no U.S. casualties in the resulting incident in which they returned fire, by Syrian state media claimed that one militiaman had died . The fact that this type of activity between the U.S. and Russia is ongoing in about as convoluted of a war zone as we have ever seen is very concerning, to say the least. We have yet to hear of an official U.S. response beyond the admission that incident occurred, but once we have one, or any new information, we will be sure to update this article. UPDATE: 3:50pm EST U.S. Army General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reportedly spoke to his Russian counterpart, General Valery Gerasimov, today. A readout of that phone call does not say specifically whether the two discussed the altercations in Syria. UPDATE: 4:50pm EST A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council has confirmed to Politico ‘s Laura Seligman that an incident occurred on Aug. 25, 2020, in which a Russian military vehicle struck a U.S. military M-ATV mine-resistant vehicle in Syria, resulting in injuries to American occupants of the latter vehicle. “To de-escalate the situation, the Coalition patrol departed the area,” the spokesperson said. “Unsafe and unprofessional actions like this represent a breach of de-confliction protocols, committed to by the United States and Russia in December 2019.” “The Coalition and the United States do not seek escalation with any national military forces, but U.S. forces always retain the inherent right and obligation to defend themselves from hostile acts,” they continued. “The international Coalition’s mission in northeast Syria is to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.” Contact the author: Thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Armored Vehicles Land MRAP"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 27, 2020",China Freaks Out Over Supposed U-2 Spy Plane Flight Over Its Naval Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China is making a big deal out of a supposed overflight by a U.S. Air Force U-2 spy plane of one of its currently underway People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) exercises. It isn’t clear where exactly the incident is claimed to have taken place as China has four major naval wargames underway in the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, of Sea of Bohai right now. The northeastern reaches of the South China Sea, in particular, has experienced a massive uptick in military activity in recent weeks, with Chinese forces and U.S. forces flooding the area with military capabilities. The U.S. has placed a near-constant stream of surveillance aircraft over the area and Taiwan has raised its alert status due to the activity level of PLAN assets. The latest Chinese drills in that region are slated to run from the 24th to the 29th, but in the case of the supposed U-2 mission in question, the Yellow Sea exercises seem most likely where the high flying spy aircraft crashed the PLAN’s party. U-2s sortie out of Osan Air Base in South Korea , making the trip west to the Yellow Sea local in nature. China also says the incident occurred in an area that was under its Northern Theater Command’s responsibility, pointing to exercises in this area. The U.S. still hasn’t confirmed the mission took place or responded on any level to China’s accusations. According to Reuters , China says its Defense Ministry has lodged ‘stern representations” with the U.S. government over the U-2 “seriously interfering in normal exercise activities” that could have resulted in an “unexpected incident.” They added that the flight was “an act of provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it… China demands the U.S. side immediately stop this kind of provocative behavior and take actual steps to safeguard peace and stability in the region.” While China can issue a notice to airmen (NOTAM) warning of live-fire drills, the vast majority of the exercise would have taken place in international waters. So, the U-2 may have waltzed into or near China’s air defense identification zone, and the airspace it ‘closed’ for the exercise, but that doesn’t mean it broke any territorial boundaries. A U-2 operating out of its forward operating location at Osan Air Base in South Korea. , USAF Still, doing so is undoubtedly a bold move. If China was executing live-fire drills, placing an aircraft in that area ups the risk of a mistake being made. Still, they could see the U-2 coming from far away and the aircraft has one of the world’s most capable electronic warfare self-protection suites. The potential payoffs of pushing one of these spy planes directly over or near a Chinese live-fire naval exercise are also quite high. The aircraft could suck up all of the PLAN’s radar, data-links, and other communications signatures, as well as eavesdrop on its voice communications and monitor its operational procedures. Just how the PLAN would respond to the U-2 being there and what sensors would track it could dramatically increase the fidelity of this intelligence value, as well. In other words, it would both stimulate and surveil the PLAN’s integrated air defense capabilities. It’s also worth noting that China has no fighter aircraft capable of physically intercepting a U-2 and harassing it. That doesn’t mean they don’t have the capability to shoot one down though, but an incident like the one that occurred off of Hainan Island in 2001, which involved a much lower-flying U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane, wouldn’t be a factor when employing a U-2. PLAN flotilla. , Xinhua As it sits now, China looks set to potentially execute a major test of its anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities in the coming hours and days. This would be a relatively large development as these anti-access/area-denial long-range weapons are among the most mysterious yet feared capabilities in China’s arsenal, ones aimed squarely at U.S. carrier strike groups that frequent the region. The People’s Liberation Army reportedly conducted a similar ballistic missile exercise last year, which also involved firing the weapons into the South China Sea from areas deep within the mainland. It will be interesting to see if China responds to this overflight militarily. The Chinese military has its own stable of high-altitude, long-endurance aircraft , unmanned ones, that it could send over U.S. carrier strike groups, but doing so could give away certain vulnerabilities in their sensors and data-links. Still, that would be the closest thing China has to a direct response at this time. Regardless of what comes next as part of China’s big summer rush of naval exercises, if this mission did indeed take place, it would be clear that the U.S. military is upping the invasiveness of its surveillance flights near PLAN operations and also heightening the risk it is willing to take on in the process. It serves as yet another sign of the growing unease between the two superpowers. Beyond that, it’s amazing to think that America’s 65 year-old-spyplane is still drumming up international incidents after so many years .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Ministry of Defense has publicly released imagery from its newest spy satellite, Ofek 16, for the first time. The shots are of ancient ruins in the city of Palmyra in neighboring Syria, including the remains of the Temple of Bel, which ISIS infamously blew up in 2015. The official release of imagery on Aug. 25, 2020, consisted of three shots in total, all which are undated. One has an annotated focus on a Roman-era amphitheater adjacent to the Temple of Bel. The other two were centered on the foundation of the temple itself. All of the images are in black and white and almost certainly have been downgraded and do not reflect Ofek 16’s true capabilities. Israeli MoD Israeli MoD Israeli MoD “Israel knows to act against its enemies from up close and from afar and to defend its citizens anywhere and from anywhere,” Gantz said. “The technologies that we are developing in the Defense Ministry and [defense] industries are an effective and significant tool in preserving the security of Israel.” Israel launched Ofek 16 on July 6, 2020, from Palmachim Air Base in the central portion of the country. At least publicly, it was the country’s first launch of a spy satellite since it put Ofek 11 into orbit in 2016. Ofek 16 has since passed additional testing in space and is now operational, providing imagery to the Israel Defense Forces’ Unit 9900, which is its primary satellite intelligence element. An official photograph of the Ofek 16 satellite prior to its launch., Israeli MoD At the time of the launch, it was made public that the satellite carried a Jupiter Space camera from Elbit Systems. This is a multi-spectral camera capable of capturing images covering a total area up to 15 square kilometers, or just under 5.8 square miles, with a resolution of 50 centimeters at an altitude of 600 kilometers, according to the Israeli defense contractor . The Israeli Ministry of Defense did not name the camera that the satellite used to take the shots of Palmyra, but said it was the product of a previously classified development program involving both its official research and development arm, known by the Hebrew acronym MAFAT, and Elbit. It’s not clear if this is a reference to the Jupiter Space camera or another one on the satellite. Whatever the camera in question is, it “is of a much higher quality, with capability-to-weight ratios that are better than anything on the market,” according to the official press release . Israel has stressed that there is no significance or implied message in the fact that the publicly released images are of sites in Syria. As noted, ISIS terrorists notably captured Palmyra in 2015 and subsequently damaged or destroyed a number of historically significant sites that it saw as running counter to its extreme Islamist ideology. The group caused even more destruction as it withdrew from the city in 2016 in the face of a major offensive by forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, backed by Russian airpower and support on the ground. This stands in contrast to a similar release of imagery from Ofek 11 in 2018, which was of Assad’s presidential palace, as well as a Syrian military base and Damascus International Airport. All of this was seen as an implicit threat to the Syrian regime. Israel has launched airstrikes against Assad’s interests, as well as Iranian forces and their proxies operating in Syria, such as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, repeatedly since 2016.

In 2019, Israel asserted total control over the Golan, an area it captured from Syria during the Six Day War in 1967, which U.S. President Donald Trump’s Administration has subsequently recognized . Beyond that, Ofek 16 certainly provides Israel an additional tool for monitoring other potential threats, chiefly Iran, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly accused of secretly developing atomic weapons, as well as advanced ballistic missiles to deliver them. At least from what is known publicly, intelligence agencies in the West continue to debate whether the regime in Tehran has an active nuclear weapons program, though it is clear that it is making significant strides in the development of more capable ballistic missiles . Concerns have grown in recent years that Iranian authorities may now be at least considering rebooting such as an effort, as Iran has publicly moved to expand its ostensibly civilian-focused nuclear programs as a challenge to increased pressure from the U.S. government. This year, there have been additional reports indicating that the United States and Israel may now be conducting a covert campaign to hamper Iran’s nuclear and missile work, as well as otherwise destabilize the government in Tehran. Earlier this year, Iran suffered a string of mysterious explosions and fires, including a blast at its Natanz nuclear facility. There are reports that at least some of those incidents may be the work of Israeli intelligence agents , possibly with assistance from their American counterparts . Whatever Ofek 16 may be tasked now with monitoring specifically, Israel has now made clear that it is up there, working as intended, peering down at potential opponents.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 21, 2020",Navy Makes Unusual Public Display Of Its Secretive Seawolf Submarine’s Presence Off Norway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released a number of pictures of the first-in-class USS Seawolf surfaced in a fjord near Tromsø, Norway last week. The service is typically very tight-lipped about submarine operations, in general, and even more so about its three highly advanced and secretive Seawolf class boats, which are known to be heavily involved in specialized intelligence activities , among other missions. This very rare public appearance in Scandinavia would seem to be intended, at least in part, to send a message to the Russian government about American underwater capabilities in the region. The Navy first announced that Seawolf had visited Norway and was otherwise operating in that region on Aug. 21, 2020, which was itself an unusual public disclosure. The pictures of the submarine making what was described only as “a brief stop for personnel” appeared online on Aug. 25. It is very uncommon to see official photographs of this submarine, or the others in its class, outside of exercises or its homeport at Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State. Defense journalist Chris Cavas, who follows naval issues closely, noted on Twitter that this also appears to be the first time the Navy has released photos of Seawolf anywhere, in any context in five years. “USS Seawolf ’s deployment from Bangor, Washington, to the U.S. 6th Fleet demonstrates the Submarine Force’s global reach and commitment to provide persistent and clandestine undersea forces worldwide to execute our unique missions with unrivaled readiness,” Navy Vice Admiral Daryl Caudle, the service’s top submarine officer, said in a statement . “Our undersea warriors are the best in the world in submarine warfare and are equipped with unmatched capabilities designed to enhance our Navy and multiply the Joint Force’s effectiveness in competition and conflict.” USS Seawolf on the surface in a fjord near Tromsø, Norway on Aug. 21, 2020., USN USN “The arrival of Seawolf compliments our already robust undersea warfare capabilities and demonstrates our continued commitment to providing maritime security and deterrence throughout the region,” Navy Rear Admiral Anthony Carullo, head of Submarine Group Eight, added. Carullo is also the commander of Task Force 69, U.S. 6th Fleet’s standing undersea warfare task force, to which Seawolf is presently assigned. U.S. 6th Fleet is responsible for overseeing all Navy activities in and around Europe and Africa. USN USN “These submarines are exceptionally quiet, fast, well-armed, and equipped with advanced sensors,” the Navy wrote in its official news story on the Seawolf’s stop in Norway. “Though this class of submarines lacks vertical launch systems, it is armed with eight torpedo tubes and can hold up to 50 weapons in its torpedo room.” Seawolf , as well as her sisters, USS Connecticut and USS Jimmy Carter , were originally conceived primarily as advanced nuclear-powered attack submarines. However, ballooning costs together with drawdowns across the U.S. military following the end of the Cold War led the Navy to abandon plans to acquire a full fleet of 29 of these boats, with production ultimately ending after just these three examples were built. As a result, the boats have since taken on developmental and special mission roles. While submarines, in general, are inherently very capable intelligence-gathering platforms , to begin with, the Seawolfs are understood to have significant extra modifications enabling them to carry out more specialized tasks within this mission set. It is publicly known that Jimmy Carter features a unique 100-foot long extension called the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece , and it is an open secret of sorts that it is primarily focused on espionage missions, such as inspecting, manipulating, and even recovering objects of interest sitting deep on the ocean floor. The Seawolfs , designed originally as purpose-built hunters, are also especially well known for their ability to cruise quietly under the thick ice in the Arctic for extended periods of time, making them ideal for patrolling and otherwise monitoring naval activity there. This region has historically been an ideal place for submarines from various countries to operate discreetly. The Navy’s newer Virginia class boats are also defined as attack submarines, but are very much multi-purpose types that are not as well acclimated to operations in icy waters. The Seawolf class submarine USS Connecticut seen after surfacing through the ice in the Arctic Ocean during the Navy’s most recent Ice Exercise (ICEX) in March 2020., USN As such, that Seawolf is operating off northern Norway is not surprising. As the Barents Observer reported , Tromsø, is in far-northern part of that country near where the Norwegian Sea meets the Barents Sea. The area between Norway’s coastline in that general area and the country’s Bear Island in the Barents Sea much further to the north is known as the Bear Gap and is a common route for Russian submarines heading to and from their bases in northwestern Russia. A map showing Tromsø in northern Norway, as well as Bear Island in the Barents Sea. The area in between is known as the Bear Gap., Google Maps By every indication, the Navy’s very unusual announcement of Seawolf’s presence in this area is meant to communicate a message to the Kremlin, but it is not entirely clear what is going on now specifically that might such a signal. The American submarine’s deployment to the region does follow years of U.S. military officials, as well as those from NATO, warning about significant increases in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent bodies of water. It would make good sense then that Seawolf is there to provide is more specialized capabilities to help track those goings and comings. This could be especially valuable for monitoring Russia’s newer nuclear submarines, such as its Project 955 Borei class ballistic missile boats and its Project 885 Yasen class guided-missile types. In addition, The Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet formally received the first of the improved Project 955A Borei-A subclass, the Knyaz Vladimir , in June and also operates the only Yasen class submarine, the Severodvinsk , presently in service. Both of these types are reportedly very quiet and difficult to detect and track. These developments, among others, have prompted the U.S. Navy to begin looking at developing a new Seawolf -like advanced attack submarine . At the same time, Seawolf ‘s surfacing in Norway also came a day before six nuclear-capable B-52H Stratofortress bombers touched down in the United Kingdom for a short-term deployment that also looked to be a signal aimed squarely at Moscow. Those bombers subsequently trained with Royal Norwegian Air Force fighter jets. Whatever Seawolf is or isn’t doing in the region right now, or how long it has been there already, it is very clear that the Navy wanted to make sure everyone, including the Kremlin, knows that the boat and its advanced capabilities are out there sailing silently under the waves.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 27, 2020",Air Force Wants New Ideas To Help Make It Easier For Female Fighter Pilots To Pee In Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are few truer sayings than “when you gotta go, you gotta go.” When the time comes, though, finding a restroom can often be more difficult. Now imagine you’re strapped into a tactical combat jet on an hours-long mission with limited options, most of them designed with men primarily in mind. That’s the reality many female pilots in the U.S. Air Force face on a regular basis and one that the service is looking to change. On Aug. 4, 2020, the Air Force began accepting proposals for what it has dubbed the Sky High Relief Challenge . AFWERX, a technology incubator the service established in 2017 to help foster innovation and accelerate the development and acquisition of novel technologies, is leading the effort, which is seeking systems to collect urine for disposal in flight that will be comfortable and easy to use for women on missions lasting up to 16 hours in total. “The U.S. Air Force (USAF) needs an improved bladder relief system that allows female aviators to hydrate adequately and relieve themselves during flight without interfering with operations or compromising flight safety. Current mission profiles and air refueling ability up to 16 hours have led to longer flight times for aircrew who need to urinate multiple times during flight without removing restraint systems and flight equipment,” a document detailing the challenge explains. “As a result, many female aircrew resort to ‘tactical dehydration’ to avoid the difficulties and potential dangers of having to relieve themselves inflight.” Air Force Colonel Gina “Torch” Sabric, head of the Air Force Reserve’s 419th Fighter Wing, dons her flight suit at Hill Air Force Base in Utah before a flight in 2018., USAF In short, the Air Force has found that female combat jet pilots are regularly not hydrating properly, and doing so deliberately, to avoid having to pee in flight. Needless to say, dehydration can be extremely dangerous, with symptoms that can include fatigue, dizziness, and confusion. These are problematic enough for someone trying to perform complicated or labor-intensive tasks on the ground, but they could have even more pronounced impacts on a pilot flying a particularly complex aircraft at hundreds of miles an hour, even if they’re not in actual combat. “During flights, dehydration negatively impacts pilots by lowering their G-tolerance by up to 50%,” the Sky High Relief Challenge document further explains. “Dehydration can result in a variety of medical problems, including reduced physical and cognitive performance, decreased situational awareness, intense headaches, altered vision, and possible G-induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC).” The options that have been available for any pilot to get rid of their urine within the confines of a combat jet have generally been limited . Some single and two-seat aircraft do have built-in receptacles that collects it and pipes it out into the airstream. Another common option is a “ piddle pak ,” which consists of what is effectively absorbent material of some kind stuffed into a plastic bag. Many types of larger aircraft do have more traditional airliner-type lavatories, but others still lack those facilities and require members of the aircrew beyond the pilots to rely on similar methods for getting rid of waste during long-duration flights, as well. Two kinds of piddle paks with different kinds of absorbent material., armyproperty.com Without going into too much detail, it’s perhaps not hard to understand how difficult it might be for women to use either of these options without any reliable means of first getting their pee out of their flight suit. Even for men, these options can dangerously draw their attention away from the primary task of flying. At least nine fatal crashes involving F-16 Viper fighter jets and one involving an A-10 Warthog ground attack jet have been blamed directly on male pilots fumbling with piddle paks. The alternatives would be to hold it or simply let it go inside one’s clothing. Both are uncomfortable, distracting, and could lead to potential health issues. “Physiological effects include the development of kidney stones, recurring skin irritations, long-term incontinence, and urinary tract infections,” the AFWEX challenge notice says. “An improved bladder relief system will enhance the overall quality of life for female aviators on and off the job by leading to fewer physical and mental health issues.” AFWERX’s challenge lays out four areas that proposals will need to address: a “comfortable, form-fitting female interface;” “improved flow performance / pump technology,” “management and processing of bodily fluids,” and “pump-less bladder relief system.” The document outlining the challenge offers possible technological solutions in each category, as well as a number of known constraints, including ones that might not immediately come to mind. For instance, of course, the first category demands that what the system is, in the end, be comfortable to wear for female pilots and be easy to put on and take off, as well as be leakproof, sanitary, and easy to maintain. But it also needs to reliably break free in the event of an ejection and be non-flammable and fire-resistant, so as not to become a hazard. The apparatus must be “minimally invasive” with “no in-dwelling / no catheters,” and be able to work in any “airframe, cockpit, or ejection seat” configuration.” USAF The pump technology section has many of the same safety and hygiene requirements. It also needs to have the “ability to adapt to pressure changes within the airframe,” which can be significant. USAF The portion of the system that actually holds the urine, need to “handle volume, up to 3.9 liters, for a maximum of 16 hours” and be easy to dispose of at the end of a mission. AFWERX brings up the possibility of changing the actual state of the urine from a liquid to a gel-like solid or gas, or even possibly finding some way to recycle it, as possible technologies that could help in this area. USAF The final section on the complete pump-less bladder relief system reads very much like a summation of the other three more specific areas of interest. USAF The Sky High Relief Challenge actually isn’t the first time the Air Force, or other U.S. military services have sought to address this particular issue. In 2002, the Air Force first hired Vermont-based Omni Medical Systems to develop what eventually became the Advanced Mission Extender Device, or AMXDmax, which is available male and female versions. The female version has a pad-like receptacle that fits under the flight suit. Both versions then feed urine to a disposal bag strapped to the leg. Omni Medical Systems Omni Medical Systems The U.S. Army and Navy have since acquired these systems for their aviators, as have the U.K. Royal Air Force, Royal Netherlands Air Force, German Luftwaffe, and Belgian Air Component, according to Omni Medical Systems . It’s not clear why AFWERX is necessarily running this challenge new, despite the AMXDmax already being available, but it could indicate that there has been feedback from female aviators regarding desired improvements. It’s also somewhat galling that the U.S. military as a whole hasn’t solved this issue for female aviators broadly. When it comes to women flying combat jets, they’ve been doing that for decades now and it wasn’t until 2002 that the Air Force even began looking to address this problem. The Navy didn’t move to acquire the AMXDmax system until 2008 and the issue of female-specific needs reportedly didn’t even come up until Vice Admiral DeWolfe Miller, the service’s top aviator and a man, raised the issue at a Female Aviator Career Training Symposium in 2018. Unfortunately, it’s not the only instance of similar issues regarding women in uniform going unaddressed even as they have continued to serve in ever greater numbers over the years. The Army is the process of testing female-specific body armor now , five years after it ended its prohibitions on women serving in combat units. Female soldiers, of course, had a very real need for protection designed for their bodies well before then, as well. AFWERX makes it clear that an improved system to help women pilots pee in flight isn’t just about comfort, combat effectiveness, or even safety. “Increased availability of female aircrew” and “improved retention of female aviators,” the latter being a particularly important issue in light of persistent pilot shortages , are also listed as benefits of meeting the goals of the Sky High Relief Challenge. USAF An evaluation team is set to begin looking over submissions on Sept. 21, 2020, and have picked a number of entrants to present their proposals at a showcase event by Oct. 13. The showcase itself, which will be online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will take place between Nov. 4 and 6, after which a winner, or possibly multiple winners, will get to submit a formal plan for turning their idea into an actual prototype. Hopefully, the winners and their concepts will be made public to help give some additional insight into how the Air Force may be looking to address this clearly long-standing and obvious issue in new and novel ways so current and future female pilots can keep “flying sky high.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While increased U.S. Air Force heavy bomber operations in the Pacific region have drawn significant attention in recent months, the service has also been stepping up similar activities in Europe . An impressive group of six B-52H Stratofortress bombers , which are now on a short-term deployment in the United Kingdom, recently flew together with Norwegian F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and F-16AM Viper fighter jets. The arrival of the bombers, all of which appear to be nuclear-capable, looks to have been meant, at least in part, to be a signal aimed at Russia. The Royal Norwegian Air Force, or Luftforsvaret , released pictures and video of the armada of aircraft in flight on Aug. 24, 2020, but did not say when or where the event had actually taken place. None of the imagery showed the F-35s that reportedly took part in the training missions, either. A similarly large exercise involving five B-52Hs and Norwegian F-16AMs last year took place over the Norwegian Sea. “I am happy that our American friends choose to practice and train in our local areas,” Norwegian Army Major General Eirik Kristoffersen, the country’s present Chief of Defense, its top uniformed officer, said in a statement . “It is important that they know Norwegian conditions and can operate with us if necessary.” All six B-52Hs are seen here flying with a pair of Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16s., Luftforsvaret Luftforsvaret Luftforsvaret It’s possible that the pictures and video clips we have so far actually show Norwegian fighters escorting the bombers on their way to RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom on Aug. 21-22. The bombers took a polar route that saw them fly over Canada and Greenland, before they turned south and flew down through the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea. Fairford is a common location for short-duration U.S. bomber deployments in Europe and has alert pads and other facilities able to support the large aircraft. “This deployment is a strong sign of the United States’ enduring commitment to NATO and to European security,” NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu said in a statement after the B-52Hs touched down in the United Kingdom.  “U.S. aircraft will be flying alongside Allied air forces in the coming days, honing our ability to work together in response to any challenge. NATO is a defensive alliance, and for more than seventy years our nations have stood together to deter aggression, prevent conflict, and preserve peace.” While, as noted, Air Force bomber deployments and long-range sorties to Europe are increasingly common, this latest group of B-52Hs also appears to have been meant to send a message aimed primarily at Russia. Experts and observers noted that all six of the bombers in this deployment appear to be nuclear-capable (some of the B-52Hs are not), which is unusual for these types of deployments. The polar flight path could reflect a nuclear strike mission profile against targets in Russia using AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM). All six aircraft, together, would have been capable of carrying 120 AGM-86Bs, Hans Kristensen, who is Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, pointed out on Twitter. It wouldn’t be the first time in recent months that the Air Force has used B-52s, as well as other bombers, to make pointed statements toward the Kremlin. In June, two Stratofortresses flew into the Sea of Okhotsk , a body of water with Russian territory on three sides that lets out in the Pacific Ocean. That month, B-1 bombers, which are only capable of carrying conventional missions, practiced anti-ship operations in the Black Sea in Europe, where the only realistic adversary is Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. This latest deployment of bombers to RAF Fairford also comes at a time when the U.S. and Russian governments are locked in tense negotiations over the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which limits the numbers nuclear warheads and various strategic delivery platforms each country can have deployed and in storage. This deal is due to sunset next year if the two sides cannot agree on the terms for an extension out to 2026. The ongoing discussions have focused in no small part over getting Moscow to agree to make a number of novel nuclear delivery platforms, including a nuclear-powered cruise missile and a nuclear-powered long-range torpedo , subject to the treaty. Washington also has a desire to expand the agreement into a trilateral arrangement that includes China. Beijing has, so far, consistently rebuffed calls to join the deal. If New START doesn’t get extended, it would allow the U.S. Air Force to pursue a much larger strategic bomber fleet. This is something the service has already expressed interested in doing as it moves ever closer to fielding the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber. With all this in mind, it will be very interesting to see what other types of training missions the six B-52Hs now deployed to RAF Fairford will take part in over the course of the rest of their deployment to the region.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2020",Belarus Mi-24 Helicopter Gunship Used To Bring Down Balloons Carrying Pro-Opposition Flags,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video posted to Twitter and reportedly sourced from the Ministry of Defense of Belarus appears to show footage from the front cockpit of a Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunship as it wards off a balloon carrying a red-and-white banner that has become a regular sight at recent demonstrations staged by those opposed to the authoritarian president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. Often called Europe’s last dictator, Lukashenko has become increasingly embattled following a purported landslide re-election earlier this month that has been widely denounced as fraudulent and sparked major protests. The Ministry of Defense of Belarus reportedly scrambled the Mi-24 on the evening of August 23, 2020, to intercept balloons, which it said were carrying what it described as “anti-state symbols.” The flag in question was the country’s official one between 1991 and 1995. The current red-and-green design is based on the flag that Belarus used when it was a Soviet Republic. “Thanks to the crews of Mi-24 helicopters the balloons’ flight was intercepted without recourse to weapons,” the Ministry of Defense added in a statement, claiming that the eight balloons had launched from neighboring Lithuania and were attempting to violate Belarusian airspace. According to a report in the Lithuanian media , one of the eight balloons was carrying a 50-foot red-and-white flag. The reported “provocation” occurred near the village of Volkovshchina in the Ashmyany district, the Ministry of Defense of Belarus claims. This western district borders Lithuania and is only around 25 miles from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. At the same time, the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry says it has summoned the Belarusian ambassador as it protests an alleged violation of its airspace by the Belarusian Mi-24. The day the incident happened, the beleaguered Lukashenko was filmed in military fatigues and carrying an assault rifle as he arrived at the presidential palace by VIP helicopter. You can read more about the bizarre scene here . Different news sources quoted Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevičius, who confirmed the protest against the Belarusian actions had been lodged and that the Hind had been sighted near Medininkai, a Lithuanian town close to the border. “It was seen visually,” he said. “We have all the information from our air traffic controllers [confirming] that there has been a violation,” Linkevičius added. Further details of the incident from the Belarusian side were provided by Colonel Oleg Orlov, Acting Deputy Commander of the Belarusian Air Force and Air Defense Forces, in an interview published by BelTA, the country’s official news agency. “These seemingly harmless balloons pose a threat to flight safety, including to civil aviation,” he explained. “No one knows what the payloads of these balloons are — they could be carrying explosives, toxic substances, and so on.” Colonel Orlov stressed that his pilots had acted in accordance with international law and that they had not crossed the border into Lithuania. A flight of Belarusian Mi-24P helicopter gunships. , MAX BRYANSKY/RUSSIAN AVIAPHOTO TEAM VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The Belarusian Air Force and Air Defense Forces currently operate Soviet-era Mi-24 s from a single location, Machulishchy, near the capital Minsk, which is home to the 50th Mixed Aviation Base. This is situated around 37 miles from the scene of the alleged incident in Volkovshchina. While a range of Mi-24P, Mi-24K, and Mi-24R aircraft are active in Belarus, the video clearly reveals a turret-mounted 12.7mm caliber machine gun, indicating it’s a Mi-24K or Mi-24R, which were originally developed as artillery correction and NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) reconnaissance versions respectively. The country’s older Mi-24V helicopters are thought to be in storage. It’s also noteworthy that the Belarusian Ministry of Defense also just announced a contract for four Mi-35M s — thoroughly modernized versions of the original Hind. On the same date as the reported Mi-24 incident, as many as 50,000 people linked hands in Lithuania to form a human chain from Vilnius to the Belarusian border. The show of solidarity with the Belarus opposition echoed previous human chains that appeared in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia as the Baltic States sought independence from the Soviet Union beginning in 1989. It’s worth noting, too, that Belarus has a previous history of downing balloons in its airspace. In September 1995, around a year after Lukashenko first took office, the Belarusian Air Defense Forces shot down a balloon and killed its two American pilots after they drifted off course during a race and crossed the border from Poland. The gas balloon was downed by a helicopter gunship near the town of Bereza, in the Brest region along the border with Poland. According to the air force commander who gave the order to shoot back in 1995, the balloonists failed to respond to radio calls and warning shots, and the balloon was then determined to be an unmanned reconnaissance balloon. Spy balloons of this type had been regularly intercepted by Soviet air defenses during the Cold War. In 2012, Lukashenko himself called for a harder line to be taken against aerial intruders. “Unlawful violations of state borders must not be allowed,” he explained. “They must be stopped by all force and means, including weapons, regardless of anything.” His words were in response to a flight be a Swedish light aircraft, which had dropped 800 teddy bears near the town of Ivyanets in a pro-democracy stunt after crossing into Belarusian airspace from Lithuania. Episodes like that in 1995 show just how quickly apparently innocent flights can escalate to become international incidents. And with tensions around Belarus showing no signs of abating, the chances of the country’s air defenses assuming a more aggressive posture against any other “intruders” — whether deliberate or otherwise — seems likely.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Embattled President Of Belarus Totes An AK While Flying To His Palace In A Luxurious Mi-8,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The embattled authoritarian president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, often referred to as Europe’s last dictator, has had better days. Gigantic crowds of protestors continue to demand that he relinquish the power he has held for over two and a half decades. Belarus is situated between NATO alliance states and the Russian border in Eastern Europe. This certainly ups the potential for international influence on the uncertain future of the country, which is technically part of a “ Union State ” with Russia, but has seen strained relations with Moscow on and off over the years. While weeks of protests and crackdowns have destabilized Lukashenko’s power, today he made a classical dictatorial show of force by flying to his palace aboard his executive configured Mi-8MTV-1 Hip helicopter, replete with video of him giving phony orders/commentary about the security situation on the ground below. He disembarking the chopper with an AKS-74U compact assault rifle in hand and wearing a full tactical chest rig while surrounded by commandos—there was no magazine in his gun. He then visited some of his troops manning a blockade near his palace, with plenty of applause to go with his arrival there. The footage almost seemed comical in nature, but it is anything but to those in Minsk that are demanding his ouster. This was a classical ‘I am not going anywhere’ propaganda move by Lukashenko that is meant to appeal to the parts of his security apparatus that still supports him and to those who dare to challenge him. We have seen it all too many times before around the globe when dictatorial rulers’ grip on power begins to slip. His presidential helicopter is especially interesting. It looks very similar in terms of its interior design to Vladimir Putin’s customized VVIP Mi-8s . There appears to be at least two of these helicopters in the presidential airlift fleet. They are equipped with special communications, defensive countermeasures, special air conditioning, and auxiliary power, among other alternations beyond their luxurious cabins. Also like Russia, it appears that Belarus has received VVIP configured AW139 as of late. One of Lukashenko highly modified VVIP Mi-8MTV-1 helicopters. , russianhelicopters.aero Apparently Lukashenko’s 15-year-old son, Nikolai, is also acting as his bodyguard, which is interesting and yet another sign that the circle of trust continues to shrink around him. Despite a direct threat from the country’s Ministry of Defense that troops rather than riot police could be used to disperse unauthorized public gatherings, a crowd of over 200,000 – a significant number for a country with a total population of fewer than 10 million – marched in Minsk on Sunday, approaching the Independence Palace, which serves as Lukashenko’s working residence. Security around the palace has become highly militarized in recent weeks. Anti-Lukashenko protests, largely in response to the regime’s arrest of political opponents and its poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, have been occurring since late May. However, the results of the August 9th election, in which the long-ruling leader was stated to have acquired 80 percent of the vote, was declared a farce by many Belarusians who had become fed up with the government’s corruption and Lukashenko’s quasi dictatorial reign. This triggered new protests that only seem to be growing larger as the days go by, even after substantial, violent crackdowns by the Belarusian security apparatus. There are already worrying signs that Russia could deploy either its Syria or Ukraine playbook , or perhaps a hybrid of the two , on the situation in Belarus. The Syria model seems more likely at this point as Lukashenko has already stated that Russia has agreed to help ensure the security of the country, something the Kremlin could potentially do either through the Union State agreement or via the collective security provisions of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CTSO), of which both Russia and Belarus are members. Regardless, assistance from the Kremlin never comes without a cost. Russia getting long-term leases on bases along NATO’s backdoor in Belarus would be one potential concession among many others, especially given Moscow’s multiple failed attempts to secure approval from Lukashenko’s government to establish a permanent air base in the country over the years. Of course, that is assuming Lukashenko holds onto power in the near term. If he doesn’t, some fear that Russia could invade the country or at least back an insurrection with the aim of having its proxy forces control at least large parts of it in the future. There is no telling exactly where all this will lead, but for now, President Lukashenko wants everyone to know that he is in control and is ready to fight to the death to keep it that way.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2020",Air Force’s Mayhem Project Tied To Hypersonic Engines For Planes Such As The SR-72,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s latest hypersonic development program, called Mayhem, looks to be aimed at acquiring expendable testbeds for new advanced jet engines, including turbine-based combined cycle designs. This type of engine, which blends together the capabilities of traditional jet turbines and high-speed ramjets and scramjets , is seen as a holy grail when it comes to developing viable hypersonic aircraft, such as Lockheed Martin’s in-development SR-72 . Aviation Week was first to confirm a direct link between Mayhem and this “multi-cycle” engine work for a story it published on Aug. 20, 2020. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) had first publicly announced the project in a contracting announcement calling for information about a potential “Expendable Hypersonic Multi-Mission Air-Breathing Demonstrator” design on Aug. 12. The Air Force expects the Mayhem demonstrator to be larger than the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) hypersonic missile and be able to carry at least three separate payloads per flight. “Mayhem, in its early planning stages, was described as a ‘Multi-Mission Cruiser’ due to the focus on sustained hypersonic flight capabilities independent of potential payloads,” AFRL told Aviation Week . A reference to the “Multi-Mission Cruiser” had appeared in the Air Force’s most recent budget proposal for the 2021 Fiscal Year, which it released in February. Budget documents say that the Multi-Mission Cruiser effort would involve a “multi-cycle” engine of some kind, though this could refer to a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) arrangement or a dual-mode scramjet. Mayhem is “focused on demonstrating advanced scramjet propulsion technologies,” was all AFRL would tell Aviation Week . Scramjets, as well as ramjets, generally only function properly at high speeds, requiring some kind of separate booster, typically a rocket motor, to accelerate the aircraft or missile to the appropriate velocity first. A dual-mode scramjet is one that is capable of operating efficiently in both subsonic and supersonic regimes, or even hypersonic ones. Hypersonic speeds is generally defined as Mach 5 or above. A TBCC design is one that combines ramjets or scramjets with regular jet turbines to create a similar situation in which the complete system is capable of functioning at lower speeds. A graphical depiction of a notional turbine-based combined cycle engine arrangement., Lockheed Martin It’s hard to overstate just how significant it would be to have viable multi-cycle engine designs, especially TBCC arrangements. An aircraft with this kind of engine setup would be able to take off like any other jet, using existing infrastructure, accelerate to supersonic or hypersonic speeds for the middle portion of its flight, and then decelerate back down to land at the other end, again as normal. Even for an expendable air vehicle, such as a missile, being able to accelerate to supersonic or hypersonic speed without needing a separate rocket booster, could open up new design possibilities. The ability of a military aircraft or missile to throttle between these low and high-speed regimes could also potentially help pave the way for entirely new concepts of operation, such as a low-and-slow flight to the general area followed by a high-speed, high-altitude dash to the objective itself. It’s also not surprising that the Air Force would want a testbed to support flight testing of these kinds of engines, as well as representative mission payloads, which could experience different effects during high and low-speed flight, as well as the transitions from one regime to another. The service is already acquiring the X-60A , a rocket-powered hypersonic testbed, to help stress test materials and payloads at extreme speeds and conduct other related research. The Air Force is already performing advanced ramjet and scramjet work, previously revealing that it achieved what it said was record-breaking performance from a scramjet during ground tests last year. Earlier this month, the service handed what was effectively a $1.5 million research and development grant to the Hermeus Corporation , which has been actively testing its own proprietary combined cycle jet engine design. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has also initiated its own multi-cycle Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program. Hermeus’ combined-cycle design running during a test in February 2020., Hermeus Corporation This is an area of increasing interest around the world, as well. Just today, U.K.-headquartered Rolls-Royce, which manufacturers traditional jets engines, announced it was forming a new partnership with Reaction Engines, another company in the United Kingdom working on combined cycle engines for use on a space-launch mothership , known as a mothership-based two-stage-to-orbit concept, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . It’s not clear whether the Air Force, or any other entity within the U.S. military, has prospective or notional aircraft or missile designs in the works that it could put one of these advanced engines into, at present. Publicly, DARPA’s Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) cruise missile effort is exploring designs that use a more typical scramjet plus booster configuration. It is expected that follow-on projects to that program will do the same. “I’m delighted to say that I was wrong,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, had said in April regarding hypersonic weapons developments. “Scramjet is much more mature and ready to go than I originally thought.” Notably, Lockheed Martin has also said in the past that its prospective SR-72 successor to the iconic SR-71 Blackbird would use a combined cycle engine arrangement that the company had been developing since the mid-2000s in cooperation with Aerojet Rocketdyne. There had also been talk about a fighter jet-sized demonstrator to prove out this technology, with former CEO Marillyn Hewson saying it could have a price tag of less than $1 billion. An artist’s conception of the SR-72., Lockheed Martin The aforementioned Air Force contract with Hermeus is also specifically focused on exploring potential designs for a hypersonic executive passenger jet. Beyond that, it seems very possible, if not probable that there is additional work on high-speed aircraft and other aerospace vehicles that could make use a multi-cycle jet engine being conducted in the classified realm. An artist’s concept of a notional hypersonic executive passenger transport aircraft for the Air Force., Hermeus Corporation Whatever specific projects the Mayhem demonstrators may ultimately support, they look set to be an important part of the Air Force’s work on game-changing jet engine technology that could have wide-ranging applications.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 9, 2020",Check Out These F-35s Dropping Full Loads Of Small Diameter Bombs During A Test Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb is a remarkable weapon. It has greatly extended the magazine depth of fighter aircraft, while also providing them with a voluminous standoff ‘fire and forget’ precision attack capability. The $39,000 glide bombs can reach as far as 60 miles to their targets, depending on their launch height and speed. This combination of precision, compactness, and range is useful in myriad ways, including taking out multiple targets in a single pass that are situated under an enemy’s air defense umbrella. For stealthy aircraft, in particular, this can allow for the targeting of even advanced threat emitters and other air defense nodes outside the distance in which they can successfully engage the launching aircraft. The F-35 and the F-22 both leverage the GBU-39’s unique abilities, as do 4th generation fighters, but for the F-35, which has a larger air-to-ground role than its Raptor stablemate, the SBD really expands the type’s tactical flexibility in critical ways. With all of this in mind, testing to make sure the tactics and procedures that support successful SDB delivery actually work is essential, and this is what is depicted in the photo above. The images come from Ian Knight’s twitter account. Knight is a pilot flying with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. He posted some images and video from the mass SDB drop test mission, which saw a full load of eight SDBs being dropped out of an RNLAF F-35A’s weapons bays and impact a set of targets with great accuracy. Knight mentions that 16 SDBs were launched in the test and a video he posted shows eight being dropped from a USAF Operational Test (OT) tailed F-35A, which was obviously involved, as well. The RNLAF, a partner in the F-35 program, has been deeply involved with the F-35’s flight testing and development with aircraft and personnel operating out of Edwards AFB for years. The GBU-39 has been operational for 14 years, but the next iteration of the weapon will be in widespread use soon, the GBU-57 SDB II Stormbreaker. It will incorporate a tri-mode seeker and a data-link. These additions will allow it to be able to engage moving targets in any weather. This will bring a new level of flexibility and lethality to the SDB concept, including such tasks as close air support against maneuvering ground targets and anti-ship attacks. The original SDB is not capable of engaging moving targets and is far less flexible when it comes to targeting and retargeting overall. You can read all about SDB II and the incredible capabilities it brings to the table in these past pieces of ours . SDB, Boeing SDB II, Raytheon Regardless of the looming introduction of the SDB’s new and improved cousin, you can imagine what a mass launch of 16 SDBs from two F-35s could do. Maybe they take out every aircraft sitting on an enemy flightline from dozens of miles away or strike every air defense node that surrounds a sprawling high-value enemy installation. It’s an amazing capability that has unique relevance for stealth aircraft that have weapons carriage limitations based on the tight confines of their weapons bays. As such, the SDB family will be even more essential to future unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), especially the smaller, lighter , and lower-cost ‘attritable’ ones that will have highly limited internal weapons carrying capabilities. These aircraft are largely being designed around the SDB as their primary weapon, allowing them to make prioritized pinpoint strikes in the most dangerous airspace before manned platforms flood in. Pairing SDB with these assets allows for some standoff capability that will in turn allow the drone’s designers to better balance cost versus low-observability, at least to a greater degree than what would be possible without SDB. The pure flexibility that SDB II provides will give these drones, and any aircraft that employs them, one fully networked weapon that can do many things. Once again, this is a huge force multiplier for stealthy tactical aircraft with very finite weapons carrying capabilities. In the end, whether it’s an F-35 or a loyal wingman drone, if they can’t get by the threat, they can destroy it from many miles away and waltz past its burning carcass while still having weapons left over to do the same again all thanks to the SDB.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 24, 2021","Image Shows Russia Extending Runway At Arctic Base, Could Support Fighter Jets, Bombers","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent satellite imagery that The War Zone has obtained shows that the Russian military is significantly lengthening the runway at Nagurskoye Air Base , its remote northernmost military outpost, situated in the increasingly strategic Arctic region . The facility, which the Kremlin announced is now operating year-round in April, looks to soon be more than capable of supporting regular deployments of heavy airpower assets and even forward-basing contingents of tactical combat aircraft, such as the MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor. The image of the base as of Aug. 13, 2020, which The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, shows that the airstrip, which work is complete, will be a whopping 11,500 feet long, or more than two miles end-to-end, up from its previous length of around 8,200 feet. This expansion would make it capable of supporting any aircraft in the Russian military’s inventory with ease. Other previous images from Planet Labs that we reviewed show that this construction is very recent, with work on the extension still visibly taking place. Beyond the lengthening of the runway itself, it looks like new ramp and support areas have been graded and will soon receive a similar surface treatment. The entire air base sits adjacent to a larger facility known as the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , or Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock, a name it takes from the distinctive three-sided main building.

The work being done represents a major expansion of the strategic airfield, which sits on an island called Alexandra Land in the Franz Josef archipelago, since Russia first announced plans to establish it in 2016. At that time, a separate dirt strip located to the east at the original base, which then became a snow-covered runway in the winter months, measuring just over 5,575 feet long, was the only means of supporting air operations there. An Il-76 Candid carrying Russian President Vladimir Putin comes into land at the older, more rudimentary airfield at Nagurskoye in 2017., Office of the President of Russia Russia began paving the new air base’s runway, as well as an apron, in 2018. In April 2020, a press release from the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet declared that the completed facility was capable of regular operations throughout the year. That announcement was already a major development, regardless of Nagurskoye Air Base’s size. Since around 2014, Russia has embarked on a campaign to steadily expand its physical presence in the Arctic, including the construction of new airfields, as well as the refurbishment of existing sites. As it stands now, there are a number of operating locations in the country’s frigid northern regions. However, a significant number of these sites are little more than seasonal ice runways, which do not allow for year-round operations, and therefore offer much more limited benefits for the Russian military. The risk of extremely poor weather remains a major hazard to aerial activity in the region, in general. In fact, just getting a satellite image of the base is extremely rare, with cloud cover being present consistently throughout the year. The location of Russia’s northernmost base. , Google The increasingly robust air base at Nagurskoye raises the possibility that combat aircraft will actually be permanently, or at least rotationally stationed there sometime in the near term. As far back as 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defense had publicly laid out plans to build special heated hangars there to house MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors or Su-34 Fullback combat jets, as well as Il-78 aerial refueling tankers . There have been continued reports since then that a unit of MiG-31s could eventually take up station at the Arctic air base. A MiG-31 Foxhound., Dmitriy Pichugin Il-76 Candid airlifters already make trips to help bring in supplies, equipment, and personnel to the remote outpost. These flights have supported the continued growth of the Arctic Trefoil, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . Construction of much more expansive facilities in recent years has enabled the base to support larger operations , as well as the construction of a radar site to allow personnel to better monitor nearby air and sea activity. Russia has also indicated that it could establish actual air defenses at the site to further protect it. An aerial view of the Arctic Trefoil’s main building from circa 2017., TASS https://youtube.com/watch?v=C58AdoDqk6A With its much longer runway, as well as any other improved facilities, Nagurskoye may be more capable of acting at least as a forward staging base for larger aerial assets, such as Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack bombers and Tu-142 Bear and Il-38 maritime patrol aircraft . These aircraft have already been conducting more regular flights in the Arctic from bases on mainland Russia, presenting numerous challenges to potential opponents, especially with regards to foreign submarine operations , which have long used the remote, often ice-covered waters to help evade detection while conducting various activities. Personnel work in the snow to prepare a Tu-142 Bear maritime patrol plane for a mission., Russian MoD Russia’s entire Arctic push has been driven in no small part by receding polar ice, a product of global climate change, allowing Russian military forces and commercial interests , as well as those from other countries, to operate more regularly in the region. This has notably included increased commercial shipping activity through Arctic waters during periods of the year when those routes had previously been impassable, or at least required the use of ships with ice-capable hulls or escorting icebreakers . There is also now new potential for the exploitation of various natural resources in the region, ranging from oil to fish. All of this has, in turn, increased the potential for both competition and conflict. The ice-capable tanker Christophe de Margerie , seen here, became the first commercial ship to make a high-speed run across the Arctic without an escorting icebreaker in 2017 thanks to receding ice., DSME Even just using Nagurskoye as a base for interceptors and strike aircraft would mean that Russia has the only tactical air combat capabilities permanently stationed in the entire region. A mix of interceptors and maritime strike fighters, as well as airborne early warning and maritime patrol aircraft, would give Russia the ability to reach out from its most northerly base and control the skies and seas over long distances around it. This, together with any future ground-based defenses , would give the Kremlin an anti-access/area-denial upper-hand in what could very well become one of the most hotly contested areas of the planet, but one that is also incredibly inhospitable and would present significant operational challenges for opponents without a similarly well-established physical presence in the region. All told, whatever the exact force posture at the base turns out to be in the coming months, the newly extended runway at Nagurskoye, as well as the base itself and the nearby Arctic Trefoil, certainly reflects the Kremlin’s extreme interest in the Arctic that has been backed by a growing military presence there.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",AI Claims “Flawless Victory” Going Undefeated In Digital Dogfight With Human Fighter Pilot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A simulated F-16 Viper fighter jet with an artificial intelligence-driven “pilot” went undefeated in five rounds of mock air combat against an actual top Air Force fighter jockey today. The event was the culmination of an effort that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began last year as an adjacent project to the larger Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, which is focused on exploring how artificial intelligence and machine learning may help automate various aspects of air-to-air combat. Heron Systems, a company with just 30 employees, had beaten out Aurora Flight Sciences, EpiSys Science, Georgia Tech Research Institute, Lockheed Martin, Perspecta Labs, PhysicsAI, and SoarTech to claim the top spot in the last of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) AlphaDogfight Trials. This three-day event had started on Aug. 18, 2020. You can watch the full live stream of the third day of the AlphaDogfight Trials below. On the first day, all eight teams had spared against five different types of simulated adversaries that Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) had developed. This included one dubbed a “zombie,” with a flight profile similar to a cruise missile or a large drone, as well as ones that performed like fighter jets, such as the F-16 Viper , or heavy bombers, according to Air Force Magazine . On Aug. 19, the teams ‘flew’ against each other, whittling down the number of competitors to four finalists – Aurora Flight Sciences, Heron Systems, Lockheed Martin, and PhysicsAI – who moved on to the last phase. Those four remaining teams then battled each other in semi-finals earlier today. Lockheed Martin beat Physics AI, while Heron Systems defeated Aurora Flight Sciences. Heron Systems pulled out a major upset over number two ranked Lockheed Martin before going on to face the actual human F-16 pilot, with the callsign “Banger,” from the District of Columbia Air National Guard, who was also a graduate of the Air Force Weapons School’s F-16 Weapons Instructor Course. This tournament was the third and final trial in a series of events that started in November 2019. That initial trial involved teams flying simulated F-15 Eagle fighter jets, while the second one, which took place in January of this year, shifted to using the F-16 as the representative aircraft. The teams taking part in the competition this week again used digital representations of the Viper. It’s not entirely clear how the outcome of this tournament may now impact the larger Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program directly. DARPA has said in the past that it hopes the event will at least “energize and expand a base of AI developers” for ACE. “Even though [dogfights are] probably less likely in the future, the need for an ability to handle that sort of situation won’t go away,” Air Force Colonel Daniel “Animal” Javorsek, who is the program manager for ACE at DARPA, had told Air Force Magazine in an interview about ACE and the AlphaDogfight effort. “We continue to use it as a gateway into these more demanding scenarios like suppression of enemy air defenses or offensive counter-air.” DARPA The first phase of ACE is scheduled to wrap up next year and will include flight tests of experimental AI-driven systems to enable various kinds of autonomous capabilities on subscale propeller-driven and jet-powered unmanned aircraft. DARPA has plans for two subsequent phases, each 16 months long, that would transition those systems onto larger aircraft types. The software and any other systems that come out of ACE, which could help improve the autonomous operation of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as provide new kinds of automated assistance to the crew of manned aircraft, could then migrate to the Air Force around 2024. “As we are kind of pushing the roles and responsibilities of pilots into this battle manager category, then what we’re essentially doing in this program is enabling the autonomy to be even more capable to handle that aircraft maneuver and these rapid, high-tempo decisions in a dynamic environment,” Colonel Javorsek said. AlphaDogfight and ACE could certainly help inform a number of different programs ongoing now within the Air Force that are exploring future autonomous and semi-autonomous unmanned aircraft capabilities, as well as the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the development of ‘ virtual co-pilots ‘ for manned types. The best known of these projects is the Skyborg autonomous drone program, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Autonomy Capability Team 3 (ACT3) is also working on a separate suite of systems that it hopes will be ready to control a drone in a dogfight against a manned fighter jet sometime next year. This program is called R2-D2, a reference to the iconic droid from the Star Wars universe whose primary function is to serve as a robotic navigator and flight engineer. The AlphaDogfight Trials themselves also reflect a broader effort across the U.S. military to explore new, novel ways of engaging with both private companies and academic institutions to help speed up the development of various advanced capabilities . This has included the establishment of multiple technology incubators positioned around the United States, starting with the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) in 2015. No matter what, the digital dogfights today certainly underscores the ever-growing interest in artificial intelligence and autonomous capabilities throughout the U.S. military. It’s certainly notable that Heron Systems’ algorithms were able to go toe-to-toe with an actual Air Force fighter pilot and come out undefeated, but it remains to be seen whether this experience will reflect the outcome of any actual live flight testing in the future. It also may not necessarily represent just how advanced AI-infused autonomous aerial warfare is at present. Regardless, this was a very public display of the future of aerial combat.

The naval air station has a ground-based ski jump that it used during testing of the short and vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35B variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. “Boeing and the U.S. Navy are in the beginning phases of operating an F/A-18 Super Hornet from a ski jump at Naval Air Station Patuxent River to demonstrate it is STOBAR compliant for the Indian Navy,” Justin Gibson, a Boeing spokesperson, told The War Zone . “Boeing completed extensive analysis and more than 150 flight simulations on F/A-18 compatibility with Indian aircraft carriers, and while our assessment has shown the Block III Super Hornet is very capable of launching off a ski jump, this is the next step in demonstrating that capability. More details will be released upon the conclusion of the test demonstration.” A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet about to takeoff from an American supercarrier using a catapult., USN The company had previously announced plans to begin this ski jump flight test program in February. It had first disclosed that it was doing simulation work on the Super Hornet’s ability to operate from a STOBAR carrier in 2017. “We’ve done a lot of simulation work with the Indian Navy to better understand their requirements and we fill comfortable that the Super Hornet can operate from all their carriers, both the ones fielded today and the ones in the future,” Dan Gillian, Vice President of the Super Hornet program, said in an interview with Indian defense news and analysis site LiveFist in 2017. “We think we can move around the deck, be very mission capable with a relevant weapons load-out and fuel load-out to give the Navy what they need… The Super Hornet as built today can operate from Indian carriers.” McDonnell Douglas, which developed the original F/A-18 Hornet and was subsequently acquired by Boeing, had also previously conducted ski jump tests with that aircraft at the tail end of the Cold War. That testing showed that with as little as a nine-degree incline, the total required takeoff roll for the Hornet could be cut in half, though it’s unclear what the jet’s gross weight had to be to achieve this performance. Ski jumps generally increase the takeoff performance of combat jets in the absence of catapults and also provide an added margin of safety. An F/A-18A Hornet takes off from a ground-based ski jump during a test in the late 1980s., Public Domain Since at least 2016, the Indian Navy has been working to acquire a fleet of at least 57 new fighter jets to complement its existing MiG-29K Fulcrums under the Multi-Role Carrier-Borne Fighter (MRCBF) program. There have been numerous reports over the years that the Indians have been disappointed in the performance of their navalized Fulcrums. The Super Hornet is now competing against the MiG-29K, as well as the naval version of the French-made Dassault Rafale and a variant of the Swedish Gripen . The Indian Air Force notably took delivery of the first of its land-based Rafale variants last month. The Indian Navy had also previously rejected plans for a carrier-based version of the domestically designed Tejas, with complaints that the design was overweight, though the development of that aircraft has continued, since then. In January, the prototype landed on and took off from the INS Vikramaditya for the first time . Being able to operate from a STOBAR carrier is a key requirement for the Indian Navy, which presently only has the one carrier, the INS Vikramaditya , which is in the configuration. A second STOBAR-configured flattop, the future INS Vikrant , and indigenous design, is also under construction. The future INS Vikrant in 2015., Indian Navy The Indian government has expressed interest in acquiring a catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) carrier in the past. Last year it emerged that BAE Systems had proposed a design based on the U.K. Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class. The HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship the HMS Prince of Wales are both short-take off and vertical landing (STOVL) types with ski jumps, but no arresting system. It’s not clear whether the ship that BAE pitched to the Indians is STOBAR or CATOBAR derivative. There were CATOBAR variants of the Queen Elizabeth design among the initial proposals to the Royal Navy. What is clear is that the Indians have plans to expand their carrier fleets, which would also require additional carrier-based aircraft. Proving that the Super Hornet, which is already CATOBAR capable, is also able to fly from STOBAR carriers could give it an advantage in the competition as India would not necessarily need to acquire multiple types to operate from different types of carriers in the future. The MiG-29K, for instance, cannot fly from CATOBAR carriers, for instance. The Super Hornet, in its latest advanced Block III configuration, which you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone piece , is also in the running for a separate Indian Air Force fighter jet mega-contract, which is looking to acquire 126 new fighters for that service. A deal with the Indian Navy could further tip the scales toward the F/A-18E/F due to the cost benefits that India could realize from logistics, infrastructure, and supply chain commonality. Whatever happens, it will very exciting to learn more about how the Super Hornet has been faring in these ski jump tests at Patuxent River.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An engineering detachment from the French Armed Forces recently completed work on an unusual star-shaped camp at Labbézanga in northern Mali . It’s not the first of the country’s military construction projects in Africa that owe more to the era of the European renaissance period than the 21st-century. The work was undertaken as part of Operation Barkhane , France’s military effort in the Sahel region, which encompasses Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger , and which began on August 1, 2014. The main hub of the French military operations in Mali is Gao, a city in the middle of the country. This is also home to France’s most important base in the Sahel region of Africa, which separates the Sahara Desert from the true Sub-Saharan portion of the continent. From here, the French Armed Forces are mounting a campaign against terrorist armed groups affiliated with both Al Qaeda and the Northwest African branch of ISIS. According to a French Ministry of Defense press release from August 14, 2020, work on the Labbézanga camp on the River Niger began last June 1. “After six weeks of hard work in demanding climatic conditions, the Labbézanga camp is now complete,” the ministry noted. Work underway at the Labbézanga fort earlier this summer., FRENCH MINISTRY OF DEFENSE “Where only sparse vegetation grew two months ago, there is now a camp whose defense system is based on the proven concept of a star-shaped stronghold,” the press release continued. “Established on a position overlooking Labbézanga and offering views over a long distance, the camp will allow its occupants to hold the position.” Interviewed by the French Ministry of Defense last July, a spokesperson for the Barkhane force commander in Gao, known only as Colonel Michel, explained a little more about the background to the fortifications: “The star fort is a revival of old concepts that are well known to the French Army. But it was the subject of a joint study with the FAMa, benefiting from their knowledge of the enemy and the terrain. As partners, we have shared our experiences to develop this new concept of the fort. This camp demonstrates a common will to put strong and visible structures on the ground, capable of showing to the population and to the terrorists the will of the FAMa to take root in the landscape. It will also be a sign of future settlements since it’s a model that will hopefully be developed throughout [eastern Burkina Faso, southwestern Niger, and southeast central Mali]” The French Ministry of Defense released three accompanying photos showing the fort at Labbézanga under construction, but so far haven’t provided any aerial views of its layout. However, an idea of what it probably looks like has been provided by Twitter user @Marsattaqueblog, who has posted a photo of a similar fort near Ménaka in Mali. The construction of that forward base, which was in use at least as of 2018 , was the work of the 17th Parachute Engineering Regiment — who helpfully “signed” it with the numeral 17 just outside the perimeter. The Ménaka fort has been described as being built in the “Vauban style,” a reference to the star-shaped bastions constructed by the French military engineer, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban , during the reign of King Louis XIV , France’s “Sun King,” who ruled the country from 1638 until his death in 1715. Today, Vauban’s 12 surviving fortifications along France’s borders are on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites . A diagram depicting the “Vauban style” of star-shaped bastion., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS While Vauban’s bastion forts are today some of the best known of their type, it’s worth noting that similar fortifications exist around the world. Taking the star fort as an example, these were employed by Michelangelo for the defensive earthworks around Florence, in renaissance Italy, and their influence spread across Europe and beyond in the three centuries that followed. Surviving examples include those at Elvas in Portugal and Fort Saint Elmo on the Mediterranean island of Malta. There are many more similarly shaped bastions forts still standing in North and South America, Asia, and Africa, as well. The fort at Elvas in Portugal, work on which began in 1763., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS While the design of these more recent polygon-shaped forts in Mali appears anachronistic, it’s clear that the French still recognize the utility of a military construction that dates back to early-modern times. Then, as now, the bastions at the corners of the fort eliminate blind spots and permit defensive fire from protected positions. They are also fairly easy to construct using only limited building materials — primarily simple walls filled in with sand and earth, offering good protection against direct fire. The nature of the threat facing the French and their allies in Mali was made abundantly clear last July 17, when a Malian soldier was killed and two others wounded in an ambush on a convoy moving between Labbézanga and Gao. In response, French combat aircraft and attack helicopters struck terrorists close to Mali’s border with Niger, killing nine. French soldiers and local construction workers build the fort at Labbézanga., FRENCH MINISTRY OF DEFENSE The Malian flag is raised over the Labbézanga fort after its handover in July 2020., FRENCH MINISTRY OF DEFENSE The “bastion” camp at Labbézanga was technically handed over to the Malian Armed Forces (Forces Armées Maliennes, or FAMa in French) on July 23 and the French forces responsible for the project then returned to their base at Gao. The French troops have provided the FAMa with specific training in how to operate the fortification, including maintaining guard posts, and the various entry and exit points. They’ve also been taught how to operate the fort in combat conditions, relief of wounded while under fire, as well as how to optimize motorized and foot patrols around the fort. Florida’s Fort Jefferson., U.S. National Park Service France’s star-shaped bases in Africa might look like throwbacks to a pre-industrial age, but, like their forebears, they have been designed from the outset for ease of defense, their geometric layout still providing the same mutual protection that helped defend soldiers in the era of Louis XIV. And for this reason, we are likely to see them crop up in other places the French military finds itself engaged in the African continent.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2020",Air Force Eyes Adding Nuclear-Armed Hypersonic Boost-Glide Vehicles To Its Future ICBMs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is at least researching what it might take to develop a nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle with a range equivalent to a traditional intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. This vehicle could potentially go on top of the service’s future Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent ICBMs, which are now in development. Publicly, the hypersonic weapons programs now in progress across the U.S. military are all conventionally-armed . Aviation Week was first to report on this potential nuclear hypersonic weapon effort on Aug. 18, 2020, based on information the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center had included in a request for information posted online six days earlier. That document, which was marked “For Official Use Only” and has since been taken offline, outlined seven potential upgrade tracks for an ICBM with a “modular open architecture.” This is understood to refer to the forthcoming Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), because the existing Minuteman III IBCM was not designed with these features in mind. One of those areas of interest is “thermal protection system that can support [a] hypersonic glide to ICBM ranges.” “GBSD does have an open architecture. It gives us an ability to incorporate emerging technologies we need to counter whatever threats we face in the future,” Air Force Lieutenant General Richard Clark, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, said in response to a specific question about a potential nuclear-armed hypersonic payload during a virtual event hosted by the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute on Aug. 19, 2020. “So as we bring the system [GBSD] online, we will ensure that we have the ability to roll different technologies in and incorporate that into GBSD.” In response to a follow-up question from Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , Clark explicitly said that a nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle was not in the minimum “threshold” requirements for the GBSD program. However, as Trimble astutely pointed out, this only raises questions about what the program’s more ambitious “objective” requirements might include. Senior Department of Defense officials had told Trimble for his original story that there is a policy in place now that expressly limits hypersonic weapons developments to the non-nuclear realm. Of course, basic research into the requirements for a future nuclear hypersonic weapon would not necessarily violate that policy. Kingston Reif, the Director for Disarmament and Threat Reduction Policy at the Arms Control Association, a non-partisan organization that works to promote “public understanding of and support for effective arms control policies,” also pointed out on Twitter that President Donald Trump’s Administrations’ 2018 Nuclear Posture Review included passages that could indicate an interest in nuclear-armed hypersonic developments. “DoD will explore prioritization of existing research and development funding for advanced nuclear delivery system technology and prototyping capabilities,” that policy document said. “This will support the U.S. development of hedging options and focus, as necessary, on the rapid development of nuclear delivery systems, alternative basing modes, and capabilities for defeating advanced air and missile defenses.” Air Force personnel maneuver more traditional reentry vehicles of the kind that found on the service’s existing Minuteman III ICBMs., USAF Interest in hypersonic weapons , in general, both within the U.S. military and elsewhere around the world , is heavily driven by a desire to ensure strikes can successfully make it past increasingly advanced integrated air and ballistic missile defense networks. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, a notional design of which is seen at the top of this story, are unpowered and generally use a rocket booster to loft them to an optimal altitude and speed. Once there, they glide back down to their target at hypersonic speed, defined as Mach 5 or above, following a varying trajectory, as well as maneuvering laterally. This is a much less predictable flight path compared to that of reentry vehicles on traditional ballistic missiles. This, together with the vehicle’s high speed, makes it difficult for an opponent to protect against these weapons or otherwise relocate critical assets before it actually hits its target. This could also be, at least in part, a direct response to developments among potential American adversaries. Russia has already fielded some number of silo-launched Avangard missiles , which are tipped with at least one nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. China is known to be working on this type of hypersonic weapon , as well, though it’s not clear if that country’s military envisions a strategic nuclear role for them. The disclosure that the United States may at all be interested in the development of a nuclear hyperosnic weapon with ICBM range also comes amid tense negotiations between U.S. and Russian government officials over extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START. The treaty limits how many nuclear warheads each country can have, as well as the total numbers of certain delivery systems. Russia has declared its Avangard missiles as being covered by the treaty , but has said, at least at present, that other novel nuclear weapons, such as a nuclear-powered cruise missile and a long-range nuclear-powered torpedo, are not within that agreement’s purview . The U.S. government has also, so far unsuccessfully, tried to bring China into these negotiations to craft some sort of trilateral arms control deal. The U.S. military has already fielded submarine-launched ballistic missiles with lower-yield nuclear warheads in direct response to concerns about Russia’s nuclear modernization efforts and doctrine, especially a potential “ escalate-to-deescalate ” strategy that could see the Kremlin employ a limited tactical nuclear strike in an effort to effectively settle a tertiary conflict before the United States or its allies could response. Experts dispute whether this doctrine actually exists . Regardless, Russia has made it clear that it will not be able to tell if an incoming weapon has a lower-yield warhead on top and will treat them the same as any other nuclear strike, triggering a massive retaliatory response. Fielding future GBSDs with nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicles might raise a separate discrimination issue in that opponents will very likely not be able to tell if an incoming hypersonic weapon is nuclear or conventionally armed. However, the conventional hypersonic boost-glide vehicles that the U.S. military has in development now will be fire from road-mobile launchers , submarines , and aircraft , which could make it easier to separate them from the silo-launched GBSDs. At the same time, it remains unclear how far along the U.S. Air Force may be in even considering arming its GBSDs with these hypersonic weapons. The new ICBMs are not set to enter service until the late 2020s or early 2030s. Subsequent upgrades for those missiles, which is how the Air Force framed the possible addition of a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle payload, would likely come sometime after that. Still, it’s notable that the service is exploring the option at all, which would represent a significant new addition to America’s nuclear deterrent arsenal.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 12, 2020",Russia’s New Amphibious Car Looks Like Something Out Of A James Bond Movie,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Russia’s military-industrial complex gears up for the forthcoming ARMY-2020 arms trade fair , to be held outside Moscow from August 23-29, manufacturers are providing sneak previews of some of the new products on offer. And it doesn’t get much more exotic than the Drozd amphibious vehicle that will be presented by the Baltic Machine-Building Company, and which looks like it could have emerged from the workshop of Q — James Bond’s fictional research and development division. An accompanying report from TV Zvezda , the official television network of the Russian Ministry of Defense, says that a prototype of the amphibious car is currently being tested. It quotes the vehicle’s chief designer Sergey Tereshenkov, who’s also head of the Baltic Machine-Building Company (or BMK), based in St Petersburg, and describes the design as the first Russian all-wheel-drive amphibious “planing” vehicle in its class. As a planing design, the Drozd should have the speed required to achieve a hydroplaning effect, lifting itself partly off the surface of the water much like a speedboat does. The Drozd (meaning thrush, a songbird) is “practically unsinkable,” TV Zvezda boldly claims, and it reportedly has a maximum speed of 43 miles per hour on the water and up to 62 miles per hour on land, the power of its 260-horsepower diesel engine being delivered via a three-speed automatic transmission. A “high level of cross-country ability allows the amphibian to be used on public roads, off-road, and in the waters of rivers, lakes and seas,” the report adds. Its range on land is stated as 497 miles, reduced to 186 miles on the water. The Drozd is attributed with a total weight of 4,409 pounds and can carry a payload of up to 3,307 pounds. The amphibian’s lightweight structure is reportedly achieved through the use of composite materials, especially carbon fiber, which is used to create a load-bearing composite hull. The amphibian’s hydrodynamics were the responsibility of Russia’s Kompan Marine Systems, a manufacturer of high-speed vessels for security forces, as well as for sport and leisure use. BMK In the available photos, the front wheels of the car are retracted to a horizontal position, an unusual feature for an amphibious vehicle, but one that is said to increase seaworthiness in conditions up to Sea State 3 (wave height of 1.25 meters). Meanwhile, the rear wheels are raised above the bottom of the hull when on the water. A central tire pressure regulation system — a common feature on Russian wheeled military vehicles — is also included, which seems to add another layer of complexity. The front of the vehicle carries a spare wheel and tire plus a winch for self-recovery. While the accompanying images show a civilian-style all-black paint job — presumably this is the prototype — the production amphibian is clearly planned for military use and will be offered with weapons options including machine guns and various “combat modules” including multiple-launch rocket systems. That said, it seems probable that BMK also foresees a limited civilian market for the amphi-car, both in Russia and elsewhere. EXROADmedia via Wikimedia Other military features reportedly include a hull with undisclosed mine protection measures and the option to add light armor. “The amphibian is capable of landing at high speed and continuing to move on wheels,” adds the TV Zvezda report, suggesting it may be especially relevant for amphibious assault operations, operating in a forward reconnaissance or scouting role. The time required to switch from land-based to waterborne mode is said to be just 12 seconds. Although it’s unclear how the vehicle is propelled in the water, it likely makes use of a water jet. In the interview with Mil.Press Flot , Tereshenkov says that the Drozd’s modular design means it could be adapted for use by the marines, navy, landing forces, and coastal troops. Its missions could include reconnaissance and special operations, logistics support, and medical services. The designer also points out its utility for engineering troops, who could use it for setting up pontoon crossings, for example. Among possible civilian operators are rescue and fire services as well as law enforcement agencies. “In addition, the Drozd can be used in areas with difficult road and climatic conditions and an abundance of water barriers, including the Arctic . The machine is prepared for operations at temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius [-58 degrees Fahrenheit],” Tereshenkov adds. Speaking to Mil.Press Flot , Colonel-General Vladislav Polonsky, formerly responsible for armored vehicles for the Russian Ministry of Defense, said he considered the Drozd particularly relevant for Russia’s Naval Infantry – broadly equivalent to the U.S. Marine Corps. He explained that while their BTR-90 , BMD-3 , and BMP-3 armored vehicles offer a high level of sophistication, they are all hampered by their low speed on the water, averaging around 6-7 miles per hour. In an article on the Mil.Press Flot website, Tereshenkov explains that the impetus for the design of the amphi-car was to “eliminate Russia’s lag in the field of high-speed planing amphibians,” the chief designer noting that the Soviet Union created a similar vehicle back in the 1980s when inventor Dmitry Kudryachkov created the Triton planing amphibian. This is not to be confused with the more recent BORTS Triton , a light vehicle that is both amphibious and capable of flight using a rear-mounted pusher propeller and detachable flexible wing . https://youtube.com/watch?v=AIa7n2v0zE8 A number of other Soviet or Russian amphibious developments remained unbuilt. Before that, the Soviet Union had introduced the GAZ-46 MAV back in the early 1950s, this being an amphibious version of the ubiquitous GAZ-69 jeep, powered by a screw-propeller, but it lacked a planing ability. A GAZ-46 MAV amphibious jeep preserved in a museum., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS There have been numerous amphibious cars and trucks developed in various countries around the world since the turn of the 20th century, as well. This includes the famous U.S. DUKW amphibious trucks, better known as Ducks , which, for a time, were in widespread use in numerous cities in the United States for waterborne tours. The age of these vehicles, as well as high profile accidents , including instances with significant numbers of fatalities , have led these largely being withdrawn from commercial service in recent years. The Mil.Press Flot article specifically points to more recent “similar” developments being undertaken in the West and in China, mentioning unspecified work carried out by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics in the United States, as well as at China’s Research Institute of Vehicles and by Gibbs Amphibians in the United Kingdom. Gibbs offers an entire range of amphibious vehicles, ranging from motorcycle and quad-bike-like types to larger car and truck-sized vehicles, primarily aimed at civilian, commercial, and emergency services markets. “Several of these machines have been created in each country, some of them are already mass-produced,” it adds. However, it notes none of the foreign designs feature “real” all-wheel drive, with cross-axle differentials to ensure power is directly supplied to all wheels. The Drozd is without a doubt an intriguing design and one with no real equivalent in service with any other military. At the same time, it’s unclear whether the vehicle shown in the images released so far is the mentioned prototype or just a mock-up. And, for all the potential military applications of the amphi-car, it remains to be seen whether the Russian military will express any serious interest in it. If it doesn’t, it wouldn’t be the first time that weird and wonderful military design from Russia has disappeared without a trace.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On August 11th, 2020, U.S. Air Force sent a trio of B-2 Spirit stealth bombers halfway around the world from their home at Whiteman AFB in Missouri to the remote island outpost of Diego Garcia located deep in the Indian Ocean. The unannounced deployment is part of the Air Force’s new unpredictable bomber deployment strategy and comes at a time where tensions in Asia vis-à-vis China have peaked . The remote airfield, which was a bustling hive of activity during the first decade of the Global War On Terror, is a far quieter place today. Still, it has seen a small resurgence in heavy bomber use as of late, with B-52s being sent there as a backstop against potential Iranian aggression last Winter. Now Diego Garcia”s huge parking apron has received three of its most prized, but temperamental patrons, ones which have their own special “VIP” climate-controlled clamshell shelters along the edge ramp that sit ready and waiting should the bombers have to use them in a crisis, or in this case, a deployment. Images The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, August 18th, 2020, shows the three bat-winged bombers sitting on the apron at Diego Garcia. The only other aircraft seen at the sprawling airfield is a Gulfstream C-37/GV on the transient ramp to the northwest of the primary dispersal. The ships visible in the photo are part of the Maritime Prepositioning Force squadron that is loaded with gear and supplies and ready to set sail should a crisis come to pass.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The image shows some action around one of the bombers, but it is notable that none of them are seen using their B-2 Shelter System (B2SS) enclosures at the time the photo was taken. Since the bombers arrived at Diego Garcia after flying direct with numerous aerial refuelings, a trip that took over an entire day, they have flown a handful of sorties. On August 18, 2020, two of the three B-2s at Diego Garcia flew out into the Indian Ocean and “conducted joint interoperability tactics training,” according to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). Typically, “joint” activities refer to those where other U.S. military services also take part, while training focused on “interoperability” often involves foreign allies and partners. The Air Force did not say whether any other forces, American or otherwise, joined the bombers for this flight. PACAF did say that the B-2 training mission was conducted simultaneously with a separate long-range training flight involving a pair of B-1 bombers that flew all the way from Dyess Air Force Base to Japan and back. Those bombers never actually touched down in that country, but were joined on the return trip by two more B-1s heading back to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota after a short duration deployment to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. When the trio B-2 bombers arrived at Diego Garcia on August 11, 2020, it marked the first time a Bomber Task Force mission had led to B-2s actually deploying anywhere in the broad Indo-Pacific region since January 2019, when another trio of these aircraft touched down at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. This latest B-2 deployment comes amid a significant increase in U.S. military activity across the Pacific in response to similar moves by Chinese forces and is clearly a part of a larger effort to send a message to Beijing, as well as assure American allies and partners in the region. B-2s arriving at Diego Garcia on August 11th. , USAF “We are excited to return to this important location. [Diego Garcia] puts the ‘INDO’ in INDOPACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command],” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Conant, the Bomber Task Force commander, said after his flight arrived on the Indian Ocean island. “This Bomber Task Force is our National Defense Strategy in action. We are sharpening our lethality while strengthening relationships with key allies, partners, and our sister-service teammates. Despite a global pandemic, the Airmen of Whiteman Air Force Base and Air Force Global Strike Command stand ready to support INDOPACOM and the Department of Defense in achieving our Nation’s strategic objectives.” In addition to their latest Indian Ocean sorties, a lone B-2 from the task force at Diego Garcia had flown to northern Australia and back on August 14. This flight appeared to take the bomber to the Delamere Air Weapons Range, but it is unclear if it dropped any weapons, live or inert. With no disclosed timeline for their deployment, the B-2s could be working out of Diego Garcia for the foreseeable future and considering their global reach and increasingly expeditionary nature , they could show up just about anywhere in the Indo-Pacific in the days to come. Above all else, the use of Diego Garcia by the B-2s is a reminder of just how strategically located and important the installation is to the United States.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s massive Yulin Naval Base on Hainan Island is one of the greatest strategic interests in the region. It is home to China’s nuclear ballistic missile submarine fleet —the backbone of its second-strike deterrent—as well as other submarines. It sits at the northern edge of the highly contentious South China Sea. To its east is the gateway to the open Pacific and Taiwan. The most intriguing feature of this facility is the mysterious submarine cave built into the side of a mountain that dominates the southern end of the installation. Although I have seen satellite images of the roadway barges removed from the opening, we have never seen one with a submarine actually using it, until now. You can read all about Yulin Naval Base, its submarine cave, and the very high level of strategic interest the U.S. and allied regional players put on it in this past article of ours . The image was taken by Planet Labs, but first appeared on Radio Free Asia’s social media channels. We were alerted to it via a post from @DRM_Long . Interestingly enough, not one other submarine is visible in the satellite image. The docks are completely empty. This also seems exceedingly rare based on our monitoring experience.

The type seen is really beside the point, what’s important is that we finally get to see this James Bond-esque feature in action. As for where all the other submarines are, we have no clue. Tensions are exceedingly high in the region and the U.S. has massively upped i ts presence there . Meanwhile, Taiwan has gone on elevated alert as China executes war games nearby .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 19, 2018",Two MQ-9 Reaper Drones Collide Over Syria After Days Of Sightings From Those On The Ground,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones reportedly collided in Syria today, but may also have been engaged by militants on the ground. The incident comes after a number of curiously configured Reapers have been spotted in the skies above the country’s western Idlib province in the past few days and the latest strike in that region involving an AGM-114R9X missile . This secretive version of the Hellfire missile uses an array of six sword-like blades that pop out of its body instead of a traditional high-explosive warhead. Military Times was first to report on the apparent aerial collision on Aug. 18, 2020. “Whether they were shot at afterwards – and whether that caused the crash – is unclear,” that story added. Earlier in the day, reports had emerged that militant groups in Idlib opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad had shot down two drones, possibly belonging to Russia. However, subsequent pictures and videos that appeared on social media suggested that at least one of these downed unmanned aircraft might have been an MQ-9. We have reached out to the U.S. military to try to get further confirmation about the loss of the Reapers. Various factions in Idlib, including those that Turkey actively supports , do have access to shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), and have used them to shoot down manned aircraft and helicopters in the past. It’s not clear why anti-Assad groups would necessarily have targeted drones that might be belonged to the United States, but if this was the case, they may simply have had no way of telling who the operator was and thought they were flown by Russians or other pro-Assad forces. We do know that Reapers have been particularly active over Idlib recently. Radio Fresh FM , an independent radio station in Idlib, which is not presently under the complete control of the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, posted a set of pictures reportedly of three different MQ-9s over Idlib on Aug. 14, which was followed by another group of images showing at least two different Reapers on Aug. 17. This activity followed the death of Abu Yahya al-Uzbeki, a “military trainer,” who had been most recently working for the terrorist group Hurras al-Din, also known as Al Qaeda in Syria, on Aug. 12. He had died when his Hyundai SUV was hit with what appears to have been an AGM-114R9X while he was driving in Idlib. The U.S. military has targeted this group before and employed this shadowy missile, also referred to as the “ninja bomb” and “the flying Ginsu,” against senior members in the past. Al-Uzbeki’s vehicle showed the telltale signs of an AGM-114R9X impact, most notably the characteristic cut marks in the roof. Much of the front and the rear of the vehicle sustained limited damage, underscoring just how precise this weapon is and how little collateral damage it causes. You can read more about what we have been able to glean about this weapon in greater detail in these past War Zone pieces . We don’t know for sure if any of the MQ-9s photographed flying over the region in the aftermath of the strike were related to it in any way. However, they all have distinctly atypical configurations and stores loadouts compared to the Reapers commonly seen in U.S. military images and video. More routine loadouts for these drones consist of a mix of Hellfire missiles, precision-guided bombs, and external fuel tanks on their four underwing pylons. A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper on static display showing a much more common selection of stores. Left to right, there is a twin Hellfire missile launcher with only one missile fitted, a GBU-12/B Paveway laser-guided bomb, a GBU-38/B GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), and another Hellfire. , USAF One of the drones seen on Aug. 17 – the first in the series in the Facebook post below – is carrying four missiles, in two pairs of two. What’s interesting is that these missiles appear to be primarily gray-colored, rather than charcoal-black. The base color of all Hellfires, including the AGM-114R9X, is black. This raises the possibility that this Reaper may be carrying a load of new AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM). These missiles have been seen at least on display with gray-colored bodies and entered low-rate initial production in 2018. A gray-colored AGM-179A JAGM, or a mockup thereof, next to an unknown AGM-114 Hellfire variant under the wing of a U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone circa 2015., Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin’s JAGM is derived from the AGM-114R Hellfire II variant and leverages much of the rear end of that missile, combining it with a new multi-mode guidance section. As such, it is also compatible with any existing Hellfire II launcher, such as those used on MQ-9 Reapers. Most Hellfires are laser-guided, though the AGM-114L Longbow variant uses a millimeter-wave radar guidance system instead. The AGM-179A has both laser and millimeter-wave radar guidance modes, making it much more flexible in poor weather or in the presence of other atmospheric obscurants. It can also be employed using a much wider range of tactics and it doesn’t necessarily require a laser to be placed on the target in order to home in on it. A diagram showing the AGM-179A’s general configuration, including the components it leverages from the existing AGM-114R, also known as the Romeo model., US Army There were unconfirmed reports that JAGMs might have been used in the strike that killed then-commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, Iraq, on Jan. 3, 2020. This was based on a fragment of a munition recovered afterward that had the marking “WT [weight]: 52.0 kg / 115 lb.” With the exception of the AGM-114K variant, the weight of all Hellfire II missiles presently in service, as well as the millimeter-wave radar-guided AGM-114L, is 49 kilograms, or around 108 pounds. The U.S. Army, which manages the Hellfire and JAGM programs, did not respond to The War Zone ‘s inquiries at the time about whether the AGM-179A had been employed in combat. An official US Army infographic showing Hellfire variants, their weights and lengths, as well as other information about their capabilities., US Army That being said, the fragment reportedly recovered in Baghdad was black colored. Pictures of JAGMs from recent U.S. Army tests also show the missile with a paint job more similar to that of the Hellfire. An AGM-179A JAGM loaded on a US Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter for a test in 2019, showing a color scheme closer to that of the Hellfire. The missile’s markings, including those that would show its weight, are notably blurred out., US Army Beyond the missiles, this drone is also carrying a range-extending fuel tank and an unknown pod. The latter store appears to be one of a number of beyond-line-of-sight data link or communications relay pods that have been developed for the MQ-9, as well as the preceding MQ-1 Predator, over the years. These pods are also associated with systems capable of detecting and geo-locating enemy radio, cell phone, and other communication systems. The United States has often used signals from specific cell phones as a key method of locating and targeting specific terrorists and militants. An MQ-9 with a communications relay pod similar in size and shape to the one seen under the wings of some the drones flying over Idlib recently., GS-ASI This particular MQ-9 also has a very large blade antenna mounted on the bottom of the rear fuselage. Blade-type antennas are commonly associated with high-frequency radio communications, but they can also support radio direction finding systems, which would also help the drone’s controllers find their target. Last year, the U.S. Air Force actually released a picture of a Reaper at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait fitted with this antenna, but otherwise with a much more common loadout of two Hellfires and a pair of external fuel tanks. An MQ-9 Reaper with the large ventral antenna at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait in July 2019., USAF Another MQ-9 that Salah Jaar photographed flying over Idlib yesterday has a similar configuration to the first one, but is only carrying two missiles instead of four. It is unclear if this is another drone or if the picture may show the previously seen Reaper after it conducted a strike. The last picture in that series shows a drone with two empty twin missile rails and a fuel tank, as well as a much larger pod with squared-off edges. It also appears to have the large ventral antenna. It’s unclear what the pod’s purpose is, but it could be another type of data-link or a sensor system, such as a small radar with a synthetic aperture imaging capability. An MQ-9 with a podded radar warning receiver., GS-ASI Another possibility is that this could be some sort of self-defense system. It is well known that the Reapers are increasingly vulnerable to both surface-to-air and air-to-air threats and there have been various efforts over the years to develop ways to mitigate those risks, including arming the drones with AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles and adding podded radar warning receivers to the loadout. As noted earlier, there are significant air defense threats in Idlib, including from non-state actors, that have generally made it a no-go zone for non-stealthy manned aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq under most circumstances. Whatever this system might be, images reportedly of wreckage from one of the drones that went down in Idlib include one that shows the remains of a long pod that looks very similar in size and shape. The images captured on Aug. 14, the day after the apparent AGM-114R9X strike on Abu Yahya al-Uzbeki, show two more Reapers with combinations of missiles, fuel tanks, and pods, as well as the large antennas under the rear fuselage. The set also has a picture of a third MQ-9 that looks to be configured as a sensor or data-relay truck with no less than three of the smaller pods, as well as the longer, square-ish pod and a fuel tank. There are no munitions visible at all. Reapers with similarly unusual configurations have been spotted flying over Idlib in the wake of AGM-114R9X strikes in the past, as well. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has previously highlighted how that missile may require a man-in-the-loop guidance system to hit its target with such reliable precision, something that could easily require additional data links, writing: “Most variants of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles use semi-active laser guidance where the seeker on the missile homes in on a laser spot being emitted from an aircraft overhead or by operatives on the ground. It is highly accurate for a weapon that is packed with high explosives. But in the case of the AGM-119R9X, which has no area blast effects at all, it has hit all three targets we have evidence of perfectly in the exact same spot and angle. This begs the question, does this weapon have man-in-the-loop guidance in which a person literally flies the missile into a precise point on the target via command data-link?” “Israel, in particular, has perfected this method of smart weapons delivery and uses it on many disparate weapons in their inventory. On the other hand, maybe new high definition optics and lasers and a very sensitive seeker head are being used to place the weapon more accurately using a traditional laser-guided weapon concept of delivery? Or maybe something else going on here. We just don’t know. But considering the missile, which is roughly three and a half feet wide when its blades are extended, has perfectly nailed its target every time we know of and in the same exact spot, some sort of extremely accurate guidance is definitely being used. “ … “A particular MQ-9 [seen below] has been repeatedly spotted high over Aleppo in recent days, which is not unusual. But what is unusual is its loadout. It appears to carry two data-link pods , four Hellfire derivatives, and an external fuel tank. This would make sense. One pod would link with the missile in-flight for man-in-the-loop control while the other would link with a controller of that missile. Executing a man-in-the-loop weapons engagement via the Reaper’s satellite data-link may be troublesome. As such, the Reaper would act as a surveillance and launch platform, with the missile guidance being carried out by another party. The other pod would handle this data-exchange.” Another unusually configured Reaper with multiple pods seen flying over Idlib in 2019., Rami al Sayed/AFP/Getty Images The Reaper in the picture above, shot in Idlib in 2019, also appears to show a drone with a six-bladed rear propeller that had not been previously seen. It remains unclear if this was a camera aberration or not, but it was visible in all the other photographs taken of this drone that day, which included shots from multiple angles. However, while standard MQ-9s have three-bladed props, some, such as the example seen in Kuwait with the large ventral antenna, are now equipped with four-bladed types that help improve performance and fuel efficiency, as well as make the drone quieter. The latter benefit of a multi-blade propeller would be especially valuable for persistent surveillance and strike missions to reduce the chance of alerting the target. Reapers operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were reportedly among the first to receive the four-bladed units and could now have even more advanced propellers installed. Other secretive organizations, such as the U.S. military’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), could easily have followed suit, as well. An Air Force MQ-9 Reaper with a four-bladed propeller. This drone also has the large ventral antenna fitted., USAF As to who has been flying this small fleet of distinctly configured MQ-9s over Idlib, it is unclear. The AGM-114R9X is, at least at present, understood to be employed exclusively by drones flying in support of JSOC and the CIA . There are also strong indications that there may be some form of overlap in the ownership and operational control of JSOC and CIA drones with regular U.S. Air Force units. Depending on the exact circumstances of the reporter Reaper losses over Idlib today, it remains to be seen whether this may have an impact on future MQ-9 operations in that part of Syria, no matter who specifically is flying these drones. If a hostile act was involved in the downing of these drones, or drone, it could underscore the limitations of operating non-stealthy drones in any sort of contested environment. The targeting of Al-Uzbeki, the Al Qaeda in Syria trainer, already came as senior U.S. officials had highlighted a desire to continue withdrawing from eastern Syria, but had also raised concerns about persistent terrorist activity in the western portion of the country. At present, there are approximately 500 U.S. troops still in Syria, primarily in the northeastern corner of the country, as well as a garrison near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders further south. “Generally, west of the Euphrates River, conditions are much worse [than in the East],” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, the present head of U.S. Central Command, said on Aug. 12 at a virtual event the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) hosted, specifically referring to ISIS. Of course, Al-Uzbeki’s death also underscored how Al Qaeda’s franchise in Syria is also exploiting insecurity in western Syria to further its own aims. “I don’t think we’re going to be in Syria forever,” McKenzie added. “At some point, we do want to get smaller there. I just don’t know when that’s going to be. As long as we remain, we’re going to work very hard to finish off ISIS.” Of course, even if the U.S.-led coalition were to withdraw entirely from Syria, it’s very possible, if not probable that JSOC and the CIA would continue their own activities in the country, including targeted strikes against specific terrorists in Idlib, using Reapers.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 4, 2020",Australia’s Loyal Wingman Drone It’s Developing With Boeing Has Been Photographed In The Wild,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of Boeing’s prototype loyal wingman-type drones for Australia — a unique Australian Ministry of Defense and Boeing Australia project — has been spotted out in the open for the first time. Captured at an undisclosed location in the Australian state of Queensland, the long-lens imagery provides us with a glimpse of the pre-production unmanned teaming aircraft “in the wild.” The work of an anonymous photographer, the two images — taken earlier this month — were published by Australian Defence Magazine . Although distorted by heat haze, they show the drone on an airfield “somewhere in Queensland.” Exactly where the three pre-production unmanned teaming aircraft are being built has not been announced, but it’s known to be in Queensland, a state that’s also home to the headquarters of Boeing Defence Australia, which is located in Brisbane. Queensland is also home to Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Amberley. The RAAF’s F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler combat jet fleets operate from that base, as do heavy transports and tankers. The drone seen in the two photos has a general shape and size that is in line with images and information that Boeing has already released itself. The company previously said that the single-engined loyal wingman unmanned aircraft is 38 feet long, with a wingspan of 24 feet. This makes it around 10 feet shorter than the U.S. Air Force’s T-38 Talon trainer, and its fairly diminutive proportions are emphasized by the small airport tractor pulling it in one of the pictures from Queensland. What appears to be a white antenna, which has not been seen in previous Boeing pictures or concept art, is visible on top of the rear fuselage. This could be associated with some sort of test equipment. The first completed ATS fuselage., BOEING Not only is this loyal wingman program the first time Boeing has created a clean-sheet design outside the United States, but the resulting vehicle is the first new Australian military aircraft to emerge in over half a century. You can read all about the drone in this previous War Zone article , including insight from senior officials involved in its development. With a first flight due to take place before the end of the year, it seems logical that the latest photos show the combat drone undertaking taxi trials — or being made ready to commence them. This could be a prelude to being air-transported to another location for a maiden flight. While it’s not been announced where the Loyal Wingman will actually take to the air, one option is Woomera in South Australia, a secretive and secluded test facility with a long history of unmanned aerial vehicle and missile trials . Currently, the base’s website lists exclusion areas set up in two different areas of the range from Nov. 5 to Dec. 9, 2020, and from Nov. 19 to Dec. 9, 2020. While popularly known as the Loyal Wingman in Australia, the vehicle spotted in Queensland is more properly the Loyal Wingman — Advanced Development Program, the centerpiece of the larger Airpower Teaming System (ATS) project. Once operational, this cutting-edge drone will be expected to take on a range of different functions, including working alongside fighters, tankers, maritime patrol aircraft, and even airborne early warning and control platforms . The cornerstone of the concept is a low-cost unmanned platform to work alongside traditional manned combat aircraft and operate as a force-multiplier, adding “mass” while also undertaking more hazardous tasks and missions when required. It’s a concept that The War Zone has previously discussed in detail here . A key feature of the ATS air vehicle is its modular design, which promises to make it easier to expand and improve its capabilities. For instance, the airframe’s “snap-off” nose section can be rapidly switched between missions to provide the required capabilities. Thanks to an open architecture approach to the system, there is potential for different operators of the aircraft to tailor their own mission payloads that will be carried in the nose. You can read more about these design features in our previous analysis of the ATS. The ATS is being developed in Australia by Boeing’s Autonomous Systems division and the firm’s Phantom Works International. As part of the research and development program, Boeing and the Australian government are building these initial drones as concept demonstrators prior to launching production of the ATS, which will serve the RAAF, as well as be made available for export. Because this is a strictly Australian project, the arrangement circumvents U.S. restrictions on exports of these types of highly sophisticated unmanned systems. In all, 16 Australian firms are taking part in the rapid development effort, including BAE Systems Australia (flight control computers and navigation equipment), RUAG Australia (landing gear system), Ferra Engineering (precision machine components and subassemblies), and AME Systems (wiring looms). The development program has moved along at a notably quick pace since the ATS was first announced in February 2019 . Boeing officially rolled out the first of the three pre-production drones last May. So far, the program has also included Boeing Australia flying sub-scale demonstrators to prove the software and concepts of operation. At the same time, of course, the U.S. Air Force is accelerating its own low-cost loyal wingman initiative, the Skyborg program, which you can read about here . The latest unofficial images of the Australian Loyal Wingman show that the program is continuing to make impressive progress. All of this is building up to a first flight before the end of the year, after which we should learn even more about the capabilities of this enigmatic aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 4, 2021",Air Force One Just Had A Near Miss With A Drone According To Reporter Onboard (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports are emerging describing a potential near miss with an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) while the C-32A that President Trump was flying on was making its final approach into Andrews Air Force base on Sunday evening. POTUS was returning from Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster New Jersey when the reported near miss took place. AFP’s Sebastian Smith reported on the incident shortly after disembarking the highly modified 757-200 , stating: “ @realDonaldTrump just landed at Andrews on AF1. Shortly before, while descending, we flew right over a small object, remarkably close to the president’s plane. Resembled a drone though I’m no expert.” The danger posed by hobby and other commercially available drones to aircraft isn’t anything new . The Air Force themselves have had a number of very close calls with drones in recent years. You can read those reports in this exclusive War Zone piece linked here. The FAA is pushing for new regulations on unmanned aircraft in order to better track and potentially prosecute those who use the craft outside of the rules or for nefarious purposes. Meanwhile, many say such a move won’t do anything to actually stop these incidents from occurring and other measures that are less invasive could do more good. The fact that a drone can come so close to the world’s highest-profile and most heavily monitored and defended variant of a commercial aircraft is troubling for obvious reasons. As we have said for many years , one of the biggest threats posed by lower-end drones is to VVIPs, and especially when they are on the move. We have reached out to the 89th Airlift Wing for more information on the incident, we will update this post if new details come available in the coming hours. Hat tip to @Strikepod and @Rob1855 for the heads up! UPDATE: We are still waiting to get an official statement from the 89th Airlift Wing, but they did give us this update: Regarding your queries about reports of a UAV near an 89th Airlift Wing C-32 aircraft during its landing Sunday, Aug. 16. Currently, we are waiting for an approved statement from the White House. Further details are scheduled to be pushed concurrent with that statement. We do not have an estimate for the statement’s release, but will push to you all ASAP. Thank you for your patience! UPDATE: This is the official statement from the 89th Airlift Wing on the incident. It was developed in cooperation with the White House Military Office. It tells us nothing and doesn’t even characterize the event, but this is what they are stating officially at this point: JOINT BASE ANDREWS. Md., Aug. 17, 2020 – The 89th Airlift Wing is aware of the report.  The matter is under review.  The 89th Airlift Wing’s C-32A aircraft landed safely without incident.  Please direct all queries to the 89th Airlift Wing Public Affairs Office at 89aw.pa@us.af.mil . -30- UPDATE: Stars and Stripes writes: The device, which was yellow and black and shaped like a cross, was off the right side of the plane. It was seen by several passengers on the jet, which occurred shortly before the plane touched down at 5:54 p.m. There are quite a few drones available to anyone that match that description. I wouldn’t be surprised if Special Air Mission aircraft will be flying unpredictable patterns into Andrews AFB for the foreseeable future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 27, 2021",Lightning Rods Protect F-35 Lightnings From Lightning At Exercise Northern Lightning,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what can only be described as the height of irony, personnel at Volk Field in Wisconsin have erected lightning rods to protect F-35A Joint Strike Fighters , also known by their official nickname Lightning II , from, well, lightning. On top of all that, this is taking place during a major joint exercise called Northern Lightning. This year’s iteration of Northern Lightning kicked off on Aug. 10 and is set to run through the end of this week. The F-35As from Vermont’s 158th Fighter Wing’s 134th Fighter Squadron , the first Air National Guard unit to receive the type , are not the only aircraft taking part. Air National Guard F-16C/D Vipers , as well as F-22 Raptors and T-38 Talons from the Air Force’s active component, U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , and L-139E aggressors from private contractor Draken International , are among the main players participating in the exercise. You can read more about Northern Lightning in this past War Zone piece . The stunning image of five F-35s sitting underneath three lightning rods, seen at the top of this story and in full below, was taken on Aug. 11 “after a day of flying training,” according to the caption. The lightning rods appear to be versions of LBA Technology, Inc ‘s portable PLP-38-MOB model, which the Marine Corps also purchased to shield their F-35Bs from lightning strikes at deployed locations in 2018, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Air National Guard The core issue that requires the use of the lightning rods at all is the F-35’s main fuel tank and the rest of the aircraft’s fuel system. Unless the interior of the tank and the associated fuel lines are kept “inert,” there is a well-established risk that residual fuel vapors, as well as oxygen, could build up inside. If the plane is not “inerted” properly, a lightning strike could potentially lead to a major fire or even a catastrophic explosion. There is also a risk that lightning strikes might cause damage to the components of the already much-maligned Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which the Air Force is in the process of phasing out , in the jets. An LBA PLP-38-MOB lightning rod in its deployed configuration., LBA Technology Unlike a metal-skinned aircraft, the F-35’s composite material structure also “does not provide inherent passive lightning protection,” the Marine Corps explained when buying its lighting rods two years ago. “The lightning rods being requested are needed for deploying aircraft to any expeditionary airfield in support of combat operations or training exercises that do not support all lightning protection requirements.” The F-35s do feature Onboard Inert Gas Generation Systems (OBIGGS) that are designed to pump nitrogen-enriched air into the fuel system to prevent the buildup of these other dangerous gases. However, the reliability of this system was recently called into question after the discovery of damage to tubes that connect the OBIGGS to the main fuel tank earlier this year, which Bloomberg was first to report. Lockheed Martin halted deliveries of F-35As to the Air Force for much of June after the issue first appeared, but subsequently determined that “it appears this anomaly is occurring in the field after aircraft delivery,” according to Defense News . The F-35 Joint Program Office subsequently recommended that units institute a flight restriction that prohibited A models from operating within 25 miles of lightning or thunderstorms. It’s unclear if this has been rescinded since then or if it also applied to the short and vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35Bs that the U.S. Marine Corps operates or the carrier-capable F-35Cs that the U.S. Navy flies. We do know that Marine F-35Bs are regularly seen with the rods in place when parked in different locales. Even when it’s working properly, there have been questions in the past about the OBIGGS overall efficacy. “The aircraft does not maintain residual inerting after flight for the required interval of 12 hours, which is a lightning protection requirement,” the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation had warned back in 2015 specifically with regards to the F-35B variant. “If the residual inerting cannot be improved, aircraft maintainers will be required to purge fuel tanks with external nitrogen more frequently or alternative lightning protection strategies (e.g., lightning-protected shelters), will have to be adopted.” Regardless, it’s obvious from the lightning rods at Volk Field is that “alternative lightning protection strategies” are still very much in use to help prevent lightning from blowing up the Lightnings when they’re out on the tarmac.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2021",The Army Has Unveiled Its Plan For Swarms Of Electronic Warfare Enabled Air-Launched Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has released a detailed look at what it wants from a new family of air-launched multi-purpose unmanned aircraft, which will include types capable of operating as scouts, electronic attackers , decoys , and even suicide drones . They will be capable of semi-autonomous operating together with other manned or unmanned planes and helicopters and may be able to work together by themselves as a fully-autonomous, networked swarm . These so-called “Air Launch Effects” are set to be a key component of the arsenal for the Army’s future advanced armed scout and assault transport helicopters , but will also almost certainly find their way onto other existing and future manned and unmanned platforms, including the service’s MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones. The Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) released a request for information for possible drones and associated technologies that could into various types of these Air Launch Effects (ALE) on Aug. 12, 2020. The contracting notice is focused primarily on prospective drones that fit into “large” and “small” size categories and systems to enable them to perform one or more of four different functions, active and passive surveillance types, decoys, and those capable of “disrupting” the enemy via non-kinetic strikes. There is also a mention of an “ALE-Lethal,” a loitering munition type, though the specific desired capabilities for it are not outlined in the document. “The future multi-domain operational environment will present a highly lethal and complex set of traditional and non-traditional targets,” the contracting document says by way of introduction. “These targets will include networked and mobile air defense systems with extended ranges, and long and mid-range fires systems that will deny freedom of maneuver.” As part of a larger “ecosystem” to defeat these threats, there is a need for “a family of small and large unmanned air launched systems that operate as members of a team with other manned and unmanned platforms to detect, identify, locate, report (DILR) and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects against threats,” it continues. A graphic showing how various types of Air Launch Effects fired from various platforms could be employed on a future battlefield., US Army As it stands now, the Army says that the large ALE category will consist of drones weighing no more than 225 pounds, and hopefully less than 175 pounds. The service wants them to, at a minimum, be able to fly at speeds of at least 70 knots with a combat range of up to 350 kilometers and a total flight time of 30 minutes. The goal is to be able to push those performance specifications to up to 650 kilometers and an hour of total time in the air. The small category will include drones under 100 pounds, and possibly no more than 50 pounds, in the end, that can cruise at 30 knots over a distance of 100 kilometers and have a total flying time of at least 30 minutes. The objective performance for these smaller ALEs is a 150-kilometer range and an hour of flight time. The Army also wants both types to have much higher “dash” speeds to allow them to rapidly get to a particular area or relocate from one to another. The service says that the large ones should able to hit at 350 knots for short sprints, and maybe even go as fast as 600 knots, while the smaller ones would need to get up to at least 120 knots, with a goal of a maximum speed of 205 knots. The service says it is willing to explore proposals involving any type of propulsion system, including combustion or jet engines or electric power . The threshold and objective performance requirements that the Army has laid out so far for the large and small ALEs., US Army The plan is for both categories of ALEs to be able to perform at least one of any of the core outlined missions. This includes reconnaissance and targeting missions that the Army is referring to here as “detect, identify, locate, report,” or DILR. DILR ALEs will themselves fall into at least one of two categories, passive. The payloads on the passive types could include electro-optical or infrared imaging camera or sensors to detect and geolocate an opponent’s electromagnetic emissions from their communications systems, radars, or other signal emitters. US Army US Army The active DILR types would be equipped with radar imaging systems capable of producing still images and full-motion video, as well as tracking moving targets. These would also have a ground mapping capability. US Army A network of robust, jam-resistant, low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) datalinks on the ALEs themselves would allow them to send any of that information to other platforms operating the area or to rear command posts for further exploitation or just to give commanders increased situational awareness. This would also include locational information for targeting purposes using stand-off munitions. The contracting notice also says specifically that the camera systems on the passive DILR drones would also be paired with artificial intelligence-driven machine learning algorithms to automatically identify potential targets of interest. The electronic signal-sensing suites would be able to gather a significant amount of information about the emissions they might detect to assist personnel elsewhere in classifying them . The Army’s ALE request for information lumps a wide array of electronic mission sets  in a broad category described as “decoy/disrupt.” This includes systems that would enable the drones to act as decoys to confuse enemy air defenses, as well as launch a variety of electronic warfare , cyber warfare , and navigation warfare attacks. The latter category includes jamming and spoofing signals from space-based systems responsible for navigation, weapon guidance, and other related functions, such as the U.S. GPS satellite constellation or Russia’s GLONASS. US Army A graphic included in the Army’s contracting notice, seen at the top of this piece, which depicts a battlefield full of different types ALEs, makes it clear that the service envisions drones with different payloads working as part of a larger team. The scout and disruption types could easily work together to locate and neutralize threats through non-kinetic attacks. The ALE-Lethals, which could contain a kinetic warhead, could also swoop down to strike those targets. Larger manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as warships and ground-based stand-off weapons , including future hypersonic missiles , could also use the information provided by the ALEs to prosecute strikes against an opponent’s integrated defense and command and control networks. Swarms of ALEs operating autonomous or semi-autonomously could also seek to push into higher-risk areas to find time-sensitive or otherwise high-priority targets. All told, a swarm of these air-launched drones blind and confuse enemy air defenses, scramble communications links, and otherwise upend an enemy’s defensive posture and drawing their attention away from actual friendly forces. It is possible that they could be integrated, at least to some degree, with similar networked assets that are in development elsewhere across the U.S. military. In fact, the decoy and disruption ALEs sound very similar in general concept to what the Navy is working on with its shadowy Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS , program, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece. In addition, while the Army has not yet decided on what drones it might acquire to fulfill any of its ALE requirements, this request for information follows tests involving the air-launching of Area-I’s small Air-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System 600 ( ALTIUS 600 ) drones from the service’s MQ-1C unmanned aircraft and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in the past year or so . A UH-60M Black Hawk launches an ALTIUS 600 drone during a test in 2020., US Army With a maximum overall weight of fewer than 30 pounds, the ALTIUS 600 is smaller than what the Army says it is looking for even for the smaller ALE drone, but fits a broad description of the kind of system the service wants. The ALTIUS can be fired from a Common Launch Tube (CLT) and carry various types of payloads weight between three and seven pounds, including full-motion video cameras, small signals intelligence systems, or even a kinetic warhead. Bell has actually used drones that look very much, if not identical like the ALTIUS 600 in computer-generated videos promoting its Invictus armed scout helicopter . Invictus is now competing with Sikorsky’s Raider X under the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8V1svIM_DFw FARA, intended to supplant the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter in the armed scout role, is part of an overarching effort to develop a family of new rotary-wing aircraft to replace the service’s existing helicopter fleets, known as the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. The ALEs will be a primarily store for the final FARA design, as well as that of the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA), which is set to supplant at least a portion of the service’s Black Hawks. As is indicated by the tests of the ALTIUS 600 and the graphic in the ALE request for information, the Army is also interested in integrating this new family of small drones onto the MQ-1C or other future unmanned designs, as well. Of course, it remains to be seen how the ALE effort, as well as work on FARA, FLRAA, and other possible launch platforms, may continue to evolve as the Army refines its requirements and gets feedback on what potential contractors thing is viable. The service says it plans to hold an industry day gathering on ALE next month to facility exactly those kinds of discussions. Still, the Army clearly sees a future wherein its manned and unmanned aircraft fleets will be able to launch swarms of drones that will begin searching out enemy forces, disrupting their operations, providing targeting information for other friendly units, and launching both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks themselves.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Sep 21, 2020",New Chinese Air-Launched Glide Weapon Designed To Be An Airfield Killer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has unveiled a new “smart” glide dispenser weapon that closely resembles the Raytheon AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW). In a video posted by state-run China Central Television, or CCTV, this weekend, an orange-painted example of the weapon was shown, loaded on a trolley in what was reportedly a People’s Liberation Army Air Force storage facility. A report on the Shanghai-based news website Eastday stated that CCTV’s National Defense Science and Industry program had disclosed details of the domestically-made 1,100lb (500kg)-class air-launched weapon for the first time. CCTV’s reporter provided a guided tour of the glide weapon, including manually extending and retracting its small wings. The weapon shares obvious common design features with the JSOW including an almost identical tail configuration with six small fins. The front end of the Chinese weapon appears less sophisticated in design than its U.S. counterpart, which also includes a sleeker nose profile that was designed for low-observability (stealth). You can read all about the JSOW in this past article of ours , as well as how it is gaining a powered cruise missile capability here . China’s Global Times added more detail , saying the weapon — for which a formal designation remains unknown — “can release hundreds of submunitions,” which it said “can effectively paralyze an airfield in one shot.” A senior engineer at the China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO), which is stated as the weapon’s manufacturer, is quoted as saying that each glide-bomb can carry 240 sub-munitions of six types. These likely include armor-penetrating submunitions and mines that can be dispersed across a large area, such as an airfield or a critical choke point. “According to reports, this advanced aerial bomb has a range of more than 60 km [37 miles],” the report stated. “It not only has high strike accuracy, but can also be loaded with a variety of ammunition,” it added, describing a dispersal area for the sub-munitions as being “more than 6,000 square meters.” It also attributed the weapon with the ability to perform “high-altitude long-range launch, autonomous all-weather attacks, and high-precision hits.” “A typical munitions dispenser like this can disable an airfield for an extended period with only one shot because the sheer number of sub-munitions means the whole runway will be destroyed, and it is also possible that some of the submunitions will be mines, which will make attempts to repair the runway very risky,” said the Global Times , quoting a “Chinese military expert.” The body of the weapon includes a faceted configuration, presumably to reduce its radar signature, plus pop-out wings to increase its glide range. Like the U.S. JSOW, this should allow for a precision strike at long range, without the launch aircraft needing to enter into the heart of high-threat defense zones around a high-value target, such as an airfield. Runway denial weapons using submunitions such as the Hunting JP233 that was carried by British Royal Air Force Tornados carried a mixture of cratering munitions and delayed fuse mines, the latter of which are designed to hamper repair efforts . An F-16C releases an AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW)., Raytheon The new Chinese weapon’s sub-munitions payload suggests it’s closer in concept to the now-retired AGM-154A variant of the JSOW of the 1990s era. This carried 145 small bomblets, however, it was removed from the inventory after President George W. Bush’s administration issued new guidelines on cluster munitions in 2008. The AGM-154A-1, or JSOW-A, featured a BLU-111/B bomb inside and was optimized for use against troops, light vehicles, and surface-to-air missile sites out in the open. As well as these anti-airfield roles, the Chinese weapon could have similar functions as the American JSOW, which is heavily focused on the Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (DEAD) role, which would favor a similar large unitary warhead as an option in the sub-munition package. The CCTV video includes a launch sequence of the new weapon. This involved an unidentified variant of the Shenyang J-8 Finback fighter jet. Later versions of this air superiority fighter, such as the J-8G, adopted a SEAD role, armed with YJ-91/Kh-31P anti-radar missiles. Notably, two test units fly late-model J-8s and it is possible that the video relates to one of these. A capture from the video which appears to show a J-8 Finback releasing the glide weapon., Twitter Screencap The AGM-154C-1, meanwhile, is a bunker-buster which carries a specialized British Royal Augmentation Charge, or BROACH, warhead to defeat reinforced concrete and other hardened targets. The AGM-154C-1 also added an imaging infrared seeker for improved accuracy, allowing it to strike moving targets. The AGM-154 is quoted as having a range in excess of 62 miles and the more recent version features a two-way Strike Common Weapon Datalink from Collins Aerospace, which enables retargeting of the weapon while in flight, the ability to strike moving targets, and abort modes. It isn’t clear what kind of guidance the new Chinese weapon features, but JSOW navigates via a GPS-inertial navigation system and also features a thermal imaging infrared seeker. The stated range suggests the new Chinese weapon isn’t powered, as is the case with the new AGM-154 variant, the JSOW-ER . Even the non-powered version has a range of nearly twice that of this Chinese derivative. U.S. Navy ordnance personnel prepare live AGM-154s aboard an aircraft carrier., U.S. Navy The unveiling of this new glide munition follows a number of sightings of similar weapons in recent years. At the Zhuhai Airshow in 2012, NORINCO showed its TL500 cluster glide bomb, a stealthy weapon that was quoted as having a range of 80 miles and weighing in at 1,500 pounds with a payload of 1,100 pounds. This was again shown in 2014, but now with the designation TL500/GB6. Again, this is a submunition dispenser that has been sighted undergoing carriage trials aboard a Shenyang J-16 and exhibited alongside the JF-17 Thunder and the Xian H-6 bomber . The TL500/GB6 is not only larger than the new weapon, but it also features a different configuration, with a cruciform tail unit (four fins) compared to the new weapon’s six. This new weapon provides more evidence of China’s technological advances, that in this case could be employed to disable airbases via standoff strikes in a region already overflowing with tension. While this initial report focuses on anti-airfield applications, it underlines that the weapon offers multiple payload options and that it is able to perform surgical strikes. It potentially adds a lethal new capability to the dramatically expanding arsenal for its strike fighter and missile-carrying bombers.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Israeli Air Force Jets Touch Down In Germany For Historic Air Combat Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Beginning today, Â Israeli Air Force F-16C/D â€œ Barak â€ fighter jets will be flying alongside their Luftwaffe counterparts in the skies over Germany. It marks the first time that Israeli warplanes have ever taken part in an exercise in that country. A milestone in the modern history between Israel and Germany, the deployment will also include flyovers to honor those murdered in the Holocaust, as well as the 11 members of the Israeli delegation killed in the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft taking part in the joint exercise began to arrive at NÃ¶rvenich Air Base near Cologne in the west of Germany on Aug. 17, 2020. The station is home to the Luftwaffeâ€™s Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 31 ( Tactical Air Wing 31 ) â€œBoelckeâ€ flying the Eurofighter multi-role combat jet. The maneuvers are scheduled to end on Aug. 28. As well as the six â€œBarakâ€ fighter jets â€” three each from the Hatzor-based 101 and 105 Squadrons, known as â€œThe First Fighterâ€ and â€œThe Scorpion,â€ respectively â€” Â the IAF has sent two Boeing 707 â€œReâ€™emâ€ tanker aircraft and two special-missions Gulfstream G550 aircraft to NÃ¶rvenich. One of the G550s is a â€œNachshon-Eitamâ€ equipped with a Conformal Airborne Early Warning ( CAEW ) system â€” comprising conformal phased-array radars on both sides of the forward fuselage â€” while the other is a â€œNachshon-Shavitâ€ outfitted for signals intelligence (SIGINT).

The boss of the squadron is also heading up the IAFâ€™s deployment team. A MAGDAY patch worn by one of the personnel from 105 Squadron, â€œThe Scorpion.â€, IDF Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IAF has dramatically reduced the scope of its exercises in foreign countries and this year will reportedly only be taking part in the two weeks of German maneuvers. These actually involve two different exercises : Blue Wings 2020 during the first week, and MAGDAYS during the second. While Blue Wings 2020 will be an exclusively IAF/Luftwaffe affair, MAG (Multinational Air Group) Days is an international event that takes place four times a year involving several different NATO forces and is held over northern Europe. The previous MAGDAY â€” also led by Germany â€” took place in June and. as well as Luftwaffe Eurofighters and A310 and A400M refueling tankers, it involved F-16s from the Netherlands, F/A-18s from Switzerland , F-16s and KC-135 s from the United States, plus Typhoons and Voyagers from the United Kingdom. Simulated aerial combat plus air-to-air refueling drills took place in training areas above northern Germany as well as over the North Sea off the Netherlands and Denmark. The MAGDAY exercises â€” each of which normally features two practice days and two live-fly days â€” are intended to build towards a Multinational Air Group concept that should reach initial operational capability by 2023, followed by full operational capability in 2026. The aim of the MAG is to field a multinational coalition for combined missions. As well as NATO members, the MAG is intended to involve non-aligned partners such as Switzerland, and now Israel. An IAF KC-130H support aircraft arrives at NÃ¶rvenich., LUFTWAFFE A chance to operate alongside dissimilar aircraft â€” in this case, Luftwaffe Eurofighters â€” at a deployed location is always a benefit for frontline fighter pilots, as they seek to sharpen their skills against a range of opponents and maintain overall readiness. As well as flying tactically in unfamiliar airspace, the IAF contingent will encounter different threats, both in the air and on the ground, to aid in its aerial training. In particular, the busy West European airspace, and topography will provide contrasts with regular training areas in Israel. â€œThis training is very effective and unique, as we train in an unfamiliar environment and territory,â€ explained Lieutenant Colonel A. â€œWe will fly in a different environment than we are used to in Israel, with different flight platforms and flight rules. The flights will be carried out using NATOâ€™s combat doctrine as opposed to ours, which creates a challenge for the pilot and weapons systems operator in the cockpit. The exercise will simulate warfare due to the uncertainty, and the difference from training in Israel.â€ LUFTWAFFE Cooperation between the German and Israeli air arms has intensified in recent years. The Luftwaffe is a long-term operator of Israeli-made unmanned aerial vehicles, operating the Israel Aerospace Industries Heron TP in Afghanistan and Mali, while German crews train on the drone in Israel . In 2017 and 2019, German fighter jets took part in the Blue Flag series of large-scale exercises in Israelâ€™s Negev desert. One big difference at last yearâ€™s Blue Flag was the participation of the IAFâ€™s latest F-35I â€œ Adir â€ fighter jet â€” the new-generation warplane will not be involved in the maneuvers in Germany. Tomorrow, Aug. 18, Israeli and German military aircraft will also together fly over the Dachau concentration camp .

A similar mission was conducted by the IAF over Auschwitz in Poland in 2003. A concentration camp was established at Dachau in 1933, weeks after Adolf Hitler became leader, and initially housed political prisoners. The site became a prototype for all later concentration camps and in its 12 years of existence over 200,000 people from across Europe were imprisoned there, as well as in its satellite camps â€” 41,500 of them were murdered. Survivors were liberated by American troops in April 1945 and the former camp is now home to a Memorial Site.

During a chaotic attempt to free them, nine Israeli athletes and trainers, and a West German police officer died on the tarmac at the air base.

Never forget. Today, Commander of the IAF, Maj. Gen.

There is a close relationship between Germany and Israel, and we are making it stronger through such exercises.â€ While the deployment to Germany has significant tactical value as the IAFâ€™s only international exercise of the year, it also reflects strategic links between Germany and Israel.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Private jets are not intended to be thrown around like aerobatic aircraft, but there have been plenty of stunts performed by brazen pilots over the years. Rolling Learjets is sort of an inside joke within the private jet community. The maneuver has been executed more times than many would like to admit, sometimes with terrible results . In fact, specially modified Learjets have been used in two aviation legends’ air show routines. But doing a roll as part of a carefully orchestrated routine or at many thousands of feet above terra-firma and at a high energy state is a far cry from rolling a jet just before touching down. This is an area of an aircraft’s flight envelope where there is very little forgiveness. According to the crazy video below, some nut at the controls of a Learjet gave it a shot. The clip comes from one of the best aviation feeds on Instagram, @combat_learjet . You will hear the engines spool up and then the roll begins. A lot of altitude was lost in a very short period of time due to the maneuver: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Combat learjet (@combat_learjet) The video appears to be authentic, but we have no way of knowing the circumstances surrounding it or where it was shot. Regardless, it is one of the most dangerous things I have ever seen a business jet do. The aircraft involved looks like a Lear 31A. It’s an older type that went out of production 17 years ago. Lear 31s can be had for around $500k to $1M depending on the age and condition. Learjets are known for their speed and agility, but there is aggressive flying and then there is a death wish. What is depicted in the video is definitely in the latter category.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Portland Air National Guard Base Will Be Home To The First Operational F-15EX Eagle Unit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has officially announced the first major changes for Air National Guard units that currently operate the F-15C/D Eagle as the type marches towards retirement. Most notably, the 123rd Fighter Squadron, the “Redhawks,” of the 142nd Fighter Wing, based in Portland, Oregon, will become the first operational unit to transition to the new F-15EX . This is scheduled to occur in 2023, a year after the Guard’s formal F-15C/D training unit, the 173rd Fighter Wing based at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon, receives the type. As it sits now, the Air Force plans on procuring at least 144 of the advanced Eagles to replace many of the F-15C/Ds that are now well over 40 years old. What is also interesting is that in the formal USAF announcement on the initial F-15EX basing, it is noted that the 125th Fighter Wing, based out of Jacksonville, Florida, will give up its F-15C/Ds for F-35As. This would mark an end to having F-15s stretched relatively evenly along America’s west, east, and southern maritime borders where Eagles sit alert at their home bases. The announcement also states that Massachusettes, Louisana, and California based F-15C/Ds will all transition to a new airframe as well, which could be the F-35A or the F-15EX. It was broadly assumed that all the existing five F-15C/D units tasked with the air sovereignty mission along America’s maritime borders would receive the F-15EX. It also mentions basing some F-35As at Naval Air Station Lemoore. Currently, the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing that flies F-15C/Ds is based in Fresno, not Lemoore. This could indicate that plans may be in the works to move the unit to the sprawling naval strike fighter base in Central California or to forward station some aircraft there for training or alert duties. It just isn’t clear at this time, although consolidating the Guard’s F-35 operations at Lemoore would make some sense as the Navy already hosts the F-35C there. If the 144th Fighter Wing were to receive F-35As, this would could potentially save many tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure costs and ease transition from the Eagle to the Joint Strike Fighter by relocating the wing to the naval air station. F-15EX., Boeing It will be interesting to see exactly how the rest of the F-15EX basing works out, as it isn’t as clear as it seemed to have been exactly where these jets will end up or how many will end up being built, especially beyond the 144 inventory number currently targeted. It also seems that the F-15EX and F-35A are more formally pitted against each another for procurement dollars than was originally anticipated. All this also seems to leave open the possibility non-Guard units could end up with the F-15EX, as well. You can read more about this possibility in this recent feature of ours. As for the F-15EXs heading to Oregon first, this really is no surprise. Oregon is already ‘Eagle country’ as it houses the service’s elite F-15C/D training unit and one of the most renowned fighter units in the world, 142nd Fighter Wing in Portland. Transitioning the core F-15C/D training unit in Southern Oregon and then the 142nd Fighter Wing in Portland right after has a lot of synergies and will only help the Air Force write the book for operating the F-15EX quicker than it could otherwise.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 6, 2021",The Navy Now Has A Submarine Aggressor Squadron,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has stood up an aggressor squadron to train its submariners, as well as anti-submarine forces, about what to expect from their potential opposing counterparts, especially those in Russia and China, and help explore new tactics, techniques, and procedures to counter those threats. One of its focus areas is already on how electronic warfare impacts submarine warfare operations. The unit, abbreviated AGGRON, is part of the Navy’s Undersea Warfighting Development Center (UWDC). It has elements at both the UWDC’s headquarters at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut and at the Point Loma Annex in San Diego, California. The Navy formally established the squadron between the Spring and Summer of 2019, according to issues of Undersea Warfare magazine , the official publication of the Submarine Force. The service had first publicly announced its plans to create AGGRON in 2018 as we reported on at the time. “Its goal is to employ an effective cadre of experts (red team) versed in opposition warfighting philosophy, strategy, and tactics to stress submarine crews in warfighting scenarios. Red team expertise will be available locally or virtually to support training and certification,” Navy Vice Admiral Charles Richard, then Commander, Submarine Forces, wrote in the Spring 2019 issue of Undersea Warfare . “Additionally, we are working on connectivity between attack center locations to allow remote red team engagement, and we are exploring the possibility of employing select SSN(s) [nuclear attack submarines] as a standing red opposition force for live at-sea play.” “All school houses are in receipt of an updated ‘red’ playbook and are working with the Aggressor Squadron to ensure that crews receive the best blue vs. red (vice blue vs. blue) training scenarios,” Richard wrote in the following Summer 2019 edition of the magazine. The Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Asheville sails on the surface of the Philippine Sea in June 2020., USN Aggressor units , also sometimes known as the “ Opposing Force ,” or OPFOR, are typically well-versed in the doctrine and tactics of possible adversaries, or the “red” force. The idea is that these elements provide added realism to training exercises, giving friendly “blue” forces an opportunity to get a feel for how potential opponents might operate and explore how existing and improved concepts of operation might work against them. “Functions as Submarine Force (SUBFOR) lead trainer for opposing force (OPFOR) capabilities and simulation,” reads one Navy job listing for a Supervisor Training Instructor (Intelligence) who would serve as the deputy commander of AGGRON. “Serves as leading authority in DON [Department of the Navy] and DoD [Department of Defense] on adversary submarine warfare and ASW [anti-submarine warfare] tactics.” AGGRON also looks set to serve as tool for evaluating future threats, as well as friendly capabilities. Another internal job listing the Navy issued on Aug. 13, 2020, says that the squadron wants an individual with “cryptologic experience in submarine operations to assist with various Electronic Warfare (EW) projects and act as the UWDC AGGRON EW SME [subject matter expert].” The full job listing for an individual to provide “UWDC Cryptologic Support (EW)” to AGGRON., USN While we don’t know exactly what these projects are, electronic warfare, broadly, is a rapidly growing area of interest across the U.S. military , as a whole, as well as among possible adversaries, especially Russia . Earlier this year, the Russian Navy also announced that it was working to field submarine-launched expendable jammers to defeat enemy sonobuoy arrays. Submarine capabilities are one component of the Navy’s shadowy Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) networked electronic warfare ecosystem, well. You can read more about that potentially game-change networked electronic warfare ecosystem in this past War Zone feature . Submarine-launched drones are a growing capability set and equipping them with electronic warfare payloads is undoubtedly highly attractive. Of course, beyond just electronic warfare, undersea warfare, or submarines fighting submarines, is a particularly complex affair, in general, as the War Zone has explored in detail in the past. Being able to effectively defeat, or at least evade, the threat posed by hostile anti-submarine units on the surface or in the air can be a similarly complicated task. Force-on-force training with other U.S. or allied units is certainly valuable in these contexts, but is not necessarily designed to truly mimic how a real adversary would operate. But while the U.S. military is replete with other aggressor and OPFOR units, especially in the military aviation and ground combat communities , the Navy has lacked a dedicated aggressor unit for its submarine and anti-submarine communities despite the obvious benefits it could provide. AGGRON is not the first time the Navy has explored developing this kind of capability, either. In the mid-2000s, it actually leased Sweden’s first-in-class HSwMS Gotland , an advanced and very quiet diesel-electric submarine equipped with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system as a dedicated aggressor. Gotland gave U.S. Navy nuclear boats and other anti-submarine warfare platforms a real run for their money . The service notably no longer operates any diesel-electric submarines, increasingly advanced types of which remain in widespread use around the world, of any kind. HSwMS Gotland in drydock in San Diego in 2005 right before she began operations under lease to the Navy., USN The Navy’s new aggressor squadron will go a long way to filling this glaring gap. In 2018, Vice Admiral Richard had described the still notional unit as a version of the Navy’s famed Topgun fighter pilot training program, but for submariners. It’s worth noting that Topgun also trains individuals to be able to return to their primary units, including both operational and training squadrons, and act as instructors and pass on what they have learned, a concept that could also be very advantageous for the submarine community. As Richard noted in Undersea Warfare last year, AGGRON is already working to share lessons learned and more with other operational and training elements. The new unit will be able to provide similarly important benefits for U.S. anti-submarine warfare elements – a much broader community that includes surface warships, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters – looking to hone their skills against more representative threats, as well. Unfortunately, a major pitfall remained for AGGRON, at least as of late 2019, in that it did not have any submarines of its own to form a dedicated aggressor force to take part in exercises. Even if, as Richard indicated might happen, the squadron received some number of SSNs, these would not necessarily best reflect the capabilities of an actual adversary. The Project 885 Yasen class nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine Severodvinsk , one of the Russian Navy’s most advanced types presently in service., Russian MoD In addition to advanced nuclear-powered types , Russia and China, among other countries around the world , are both developing advanced AIP-equipped diesel-electric submarines. As noted, the Navy does not operate submarines of this type itself, which have notably different signatures from the nuclear-powered counterparts. It would be hard for AGGRON, or any other elements it might work with, to truly mimic those boats during training using existing SSNs. Beyond that, there’s no guarantee that, given the Navy’s struggles in recent years to meet operational demands for submarines, as well as persistent maintenance backlogs , together with growing concerns about expanding Russian, as well as Chinese , submarine activities, that there will be boats to spare any time soon. The War Zone has highlighted in the past how all this might bolster an argument for acquiring a fleet of new, lower-cost diesel-electric submarines to help support the aggressor mission, among others. AGGRON’s work could certainly inform its planned development of a new class of nuclear attack submarines . The Navy also regularly trains with allied submarines , included AIP-equipped types. As such, another lease agreement, similar to one the Navy had with regards to the Gotland , or simply scheduling more exercises where AGGRON’s personnel can work together with those boats, may be another, more near-term possibility. Regardless, the Navy now has its first dedicated submarine aggressor unit, which can only help improve the service’s ability to respond to existing and emerging underwater and anti-submarine challenges and make sure its submariners are as prepared as they can be to tackle those threats.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 14, 2020",U.S. Navy Wants Aggressor Submarine Unit To Mimic Russian and Chinese Subs In Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid concerns of increasing Russian and Chinese submarine activity, the U.S. Navy wants a larger class of attacks subs that are more focused on countering those potential threats. Now, the service is planning to establish a specialized underwater aggressor squadron to help prepare attack sub crews to go on the hunt, which also might offer yet another argument in favor of buying new, advanced diesel-electric submarines . U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Charles Richard highlighted the plans in remarks at the Naval Submarine League’s annual conference on Nov. 7, 2018 . Richard assumed the tri-hatted role of Commander, Submarine Forces, as well as head of both Submarine Force Atlantic and NATO’s Allied Submarine Command, in August 2018 . “We have restructured and returned the fast attack training period to ensure that we’re ready for that high-end fight, including restructuring what we used to call the Tactical Readiness Evaluation, and it is now a Combat Readiness Evaluation to ensure we’re focused on warfighting,” Richard explained . “I want to produce winners and losers just like we do in battle; it does you no good to be at standards if your opponent is more at standards than you are. You still lose, and in this competition, you may not come home.” The admiral likened the overarching plan for the Submarine Forces to creating an advanced training regimen for attack submarine crews akin to the Navy’s Topgun program for fighter pilots. Topgun puts select pilots through a challenging combination of classroom courses and flight training. The aviators who graduate go back to both operational and dedicated training units to act as instructors themselves. The Seawolf -class attack submarine USS Connecticut . The US Navy has said it wants a new class of attack subs similar in size to the Seawolfs ., USN To go along with that, Richard wants a submarine aggressor squadron composed of active duty and reserve sailors, as well as civilian contractors, for other Navy submariners to train against. Topgun has its own dedicated and highly trained “red air” adversary element to provide mock opponents for its students. “We’re taking a page from naval aviation and we’re establishing an aggressor squadron with a team that will become experts in employing our adversaries’ potential capabilities and then set them up to be able to go head-to-head with our units so that we’re always training against what we think is the highest fidelity simulation I can give them in terms of what they might be able to expect when they go into combat,” Richard said . This is “a cadre that does nothing but emulate red in all of our training and certification exercises.” Aggressors or “ opposing force ” (OPFOR) units, which are themselves trained in the doctrine and tactics of potential opponents, or the “red” force, are a valuable way to improve the realism of training exercises. They are a common feature across the U.S. military, especially when it comes to drills in the air and on the ground . A submarine aggressor force would provide invaluable anti-submarine warfare training opportunities for the Navy’s surface and aviation elements , as well. Unfortunately, there may be significant hurdles in front Vice Admiral Richard when it comes to implementing the plan. At present, there are no plans to give the submarine aggressor squadron its own boats, U.S. Navy Commander Sarah Self-Kyler, a service spokesperson, told USNI News on the sidelines of the Naval Submarine League event. This makes a certain amount of practical sense, since the Navy’s submarine community is already facing difficulties in meeting its operational requirements amid a major maintenance backlog . This has prevented numerous attack submarines from returning to service on schedule. The USS Boise , a Los Angeles -class attack submarine, is the most extreme example and is set to have been out of action for more than two years by the time she goes back to the fleet in 2019 . The USS Boise leaves Duqm, Oman after a port visit in 2014. , USN But this means the aggressor squadron’s personnel will have to wait for submarine crews to find time in their operational and training schedules to accommodate the new “red submarine” mission. This could easily limit how many opportunities the new OPFOR unit has to both maintain its own unique skill sets and integrate those capabilities into larger training exercises. On top of that, there is no indication that the Navy plans to use anything but its existing nuclear-powered attack submarines to perform this mission. Training against a crew that mimics the fighting style of potential opponents is certainly valuable, but the benefits would be limited by the lack of dissimilar performance capabilities and limitations and electromagnetic and acoustic signatures. This is true in any kind of training scenario , but it’s particularly pronounced when it comes to submarines where understanding the specific signatures of potential opponents is especially important for learning how to detect and track them underwater. Both Russia and China are developing advanced, ultra-quiet diesel-electric submarines that use air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems that give them performance and underwater endurance that is ever closer to that of nuclear-powered boats. Russia’s lone Lada -class submarine, an advanced AIP-equipped diesel-electric type., Морозов Л.Н. via Wikimedia “I think Russian submarines today are perhaps some of the most silent and lethal in the world, with the exception of our own,” U.S. Navy Admiral James Foggo, the head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and NATO’s Allied Joint Force Command Naples, said during an episode of his official podcast in October 2018 . “I think we still in the United States Navy hold the edge.” The technology is steadily proliferating around the world in general. It is particularly attractive for cost-conscious countries that have an interest in acquiring an advanced submarine capability, but don’t have the means or the funds to even consider a nuclear-powered option . At the same time, this is a type of submarine the Navy does not operate at all. The service retired the last diesel-electric submarine, a non-AIP type, the USS Blueback , which that had served at time in an aggressor role , in 1990. That boat is now a museum piece. The Navy has already felt the absence of this capability, both from operational and training perspectives, in the past. In the mid-2000s, the service went so far as to lease an AIP submarine, Sweden’s first-in-class HSwMS Gotland , as a dedicated aggressor. The experience was eye-opening and not in entirely positive ways, as our own Tyler Rogoway has explained in detail in the past . The Gotland scored simulated kills against Navy nuclear attack submarines and surface combatants, even sneaking into the middle of carrier strike groups to launch attack runs without detection during exercises. Most notably, it reportedly exposed that the service’s sonars and other sensors were woefully underequipped to spot and track AIP submarines. HSwMS Gotland arrives in San Diego in a floating dry dock ahead of a lease period with the US Navy in 2005. , USN Improvement in sensor technology in the intervening decade doesn’t change the fact that it’s important for the Navy’s submariners to be able to train on how to use those systems against live, representative targets. The service does get some opportunities to do so during certain multi-national exercises , but the Navy’s experiences with Blueback and Gotland raises questions about why it has taken the service so long to more formally make aggressor submarines part of its own training curriculum. In addition, planning to create a dedicated aggressor squadron within the Navy itself seems like a prime opportunity to again raise the question of whether the service might be well served by acquiring its own fleet of advanced diesel-electric submarines. As we at The War Zone have noted multiple times before , these boats would offer operational, as well as training benefits, too, and would not necessarily need to be limited to aggressor duties. They also cost a fraction of what a nuclear fast attack submarine costs and can be forward deployed to for territorial operations. The Navy may eventually find itself forced to consider a high-low mix of submarines to meet its operational demands given the cost to build and operate modernized nuclear-powered boats and defense budget realities . Cheaper AIP types could help perform more regional missions, freeing up more costly nuclear subs for longer duration patrols and high-end missions. Those lower-priority mission sets could include providing more regular and reliable services to the personnel of the submarine aggressor squadron and doing so in a way that doesn’t upset the operational and training schedules for other boats. There is also the possibility that the Navy could hire contractors, or use a hybrid crew that includes actual military personnel, to man some sort of surrogate submersible. None of this is to say that the Navy’s submarine aggressor plans aren’t a significant step toward improving the service’s ability to respond to potential underwater threats. But the service looks to be facing a number of complex decisions in the future in order to truly get the most from this important new training capability.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman’s Stargazer conducted a curious flight from Edwards Air Force Base in California, out past the Channel Islands off the state’s coast and into the Pacific Ocean, and back yesterday. The aircraft, the only Lockheed L-1011 Tristar still flying today, which normally operates from the Mojave Air and Space Port, is best known as the mothership for the Pegasus XL space launch rocket, but has been involved other advanced aerospace testing in the past. Aerospace photographer Jack Beyer was among the first to notice Stargazer’s so-far-unexplained outing, which began at around 5:00 AM local time and wrapped up some two hours later. After clearing the Channel Islands, the aircraft, which carries the civil registration code N140SC, had entered in a long, elliptical race track orbit and had begun to climb, eventually reaching an altitude of around 40,000 feet while facing out into the Pacific. Interesting. Stargazer is now flying a racetrack pattern. pic.twitter.com/IBfD5khrt1 — Jack Beyer (@thejackbeyer) August 12, 2020 A look at Stargazer’s complete route on Aug. 12, 2020. The purple section represents where the aircraft reached 40,000 feet, before descending again., ADS-B Exhange That altitude and direction is notable as is matches the release profile of a Pegasus XL rocket. However, as other observers noted, there were no Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) alerting other aircraft and ships down below of a potential launch, as is typically required. In addition, Pegasus XLs are often mated to Stargazer at Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is where the launches are then usually staged from . A U.S. Navy P-3C Orion maritime patrol plane, with the Bureau Number (BuNo) serial number 162999, was spotted on flight tracking software orbiting nearby where Stargazer was flying and left the area at around the same time, but it is unclear if the two flights were at all related. This P-3C was flying this pattern in the same general area as Stargazer on Aug. 12, 2020., ADS-B Exchange It is possible that this was just a routine training flight so that the Stargazer’s crew could practice a launch operation without actually firing a rocket. However, it’s not clear why Northrop Grumman would have staged such a flight out of Edwards, the U.S. Air Force’s premier flight test facility , which is also home to NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center , rather than the aircraft’s home base at Mojave. This is not the aircraft’s first visit to Edwards recently, either, with it conducting flights overland from the base since at least June, according to online flight tracking data. The part of the Pacific Ocean in which its latest flight took place is in an overwater military range complex commonly used for flight tests and missile launches , too. An Air Force B-52 bomber recently conducted a captive carry test flight of the in-development hypersonic AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) in the same general area. As already noted, Stargazer itself has also served as a platform to conduct testing of other aerospace vehicles, such as the abortive X-34 experimental air-launched space plane, including captive carry tests that do not involve an actual launch. Going through the full flight profile used for a launch could have been a way to see how the payload vehicle might respond to the stresses of those maneuvers. Stargazer, then flying for Orbital Sciences, takes off for a captive carry test of an X-34 prototype in 1999. Orbital Sciences subsequently merged with ATK to form Orbital-ATK, which Northrop Gruman then acquired, a purchase that included this aircraft, rebranding it as the company’s Innovation Systems division., NASA The flight does come amid a surge in the development of hypersonic systems, the testing of which Stargazer could be ideally suited to support. Northrop Grumman and Raytheon have been working together on a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program. Separately, Northrop Grumman has been testing advanced scramjet technology that could inform its work on HAWC and other hypersonic efforts in cooperation with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Of course, Stargazer wouldn’t necessarily need to be supporting a program involving another Northrop Grumman product. The U.S. Air Force, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, is otherwise in the midst of a slew of other hypersonic developments , many of which will need to be test flown . Generation Orbit’s X-60A experimental hypersonic testbed , which AFRL plans to use to conduct other related research and development work, is also air-launched and will need some form of mothership to carry it aloft. These kind of test requirements are only likely to grow in the future. Just today, AFRL released a request for information regarding its own experimental scramjet-powered missile effort referred to as the Expendable Hypresonic Multi-Mission Air Breathing Demonstrator and also known as Mayhem. The new management behind Stratolaunch and its massive Roc mothership aircraft , the largest plane to ever fly to date, said earlier this year that it would refocus on hypersonic testing instead of space launch activities , underscoring the growing demand in this sector. The Roc is designed to perform the same general mission set as Stargazer, but on a much larger scale. At the same time, the Air Force, as well as the nascent Space Force and NASA, are still very interested in ways to rapidly put payloads into space, using expendable launch systems or reusable space planes . Pegasus XL represents an existing proven technology for this purpose and Stargazer could be helping with the testing of improvements to that system or new, more advanced concepts of this type, also referred to as two-stage-to-orbit . There are also almost certainly more hypersonic and space access programs underway in the classified realm , too. The early-morning timing of Stargazer’s recent flight from Edwards suggests that there was a desire to keep any payload the plane might have been carrying, out of the public eye. We have reached out to the Air Force, NASA, and Northrop Grumman to hopefully get more insight into Stargazer’s latest mission. We will be sure to update this story with any new details we receive. Regardless, what is clear is that Stargazer is up to something new with the U.S. Air Force.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 28, 2019",The Tragic Tale Of How NASA’s X-34 Space Planes Ended Up Rotting In Someone’s Backyard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The X-34 program aimed to help break NASA and the Air Force into space far more frequently and inexpensively than ever before. In the end, a pair of rocket plane demonstrators were built, but they never were able to reach their full potential. Still, they were part of a wider family of initiatives that have resulted in the Air Force’s hugely successful X-37B mini-space plane that has remained in orbit near continuously for years. But after the shine on the program quickly faded around the turn of the Millennium, the unique craft found themselves in increasingly dire straits, stuffed in one dilapidated hangar or another, or weathering the harsh desert climate in the open. At times it even seemed like the X-34s would get a second chance at life, being brought back from the dead for some exciting new space launch program, but this never materialized. Today, these historic vehicles don’t sit in museums or as technical trainers for future aerospace engineers. Through a labyrinth of misfortune, they have found themselves rotting in someone’s backyard in Lancaster, California, not far from their long-time home at Edwards Air Force Base. Here is the fascinating, but tragic story of how the X-34s went from potential harbingers of America’s future in space to unwanted backyard junk. NASA kicked off the program that would lead to the unmanned X-34 in 1996 . The Marshall Space Flight Center , situated within the U.S. Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, was responsible for the project. The main goal was to develop a testbed that could help rapidly trial new technologies for a future low-cost reusable space vehicle. In addition, the program would serve as an opportunity for NASA to explore improved management processes for fast-track development and testing of advanced systems. One of the X-34s., NASA A major impetus for the program was the desire to lay the groundwork for a space access platform that would be significantly cheaper than the Space Shuttle. NASA wanted to drop the price per pound of payload sent into orbit from $10,000 to $1,000, according to one official fact sheet . The total cost per flight would be no more than $500,000 . In addition, a decade earlier, a tragic accident resulted in the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger and her entire crew, an event that had already prompted both NASA and the U.S. military to begin exploring alternative means of getting into orbit. After the disaster, NASA only took delivery of one additional Space Shuttle, Endeavour , in 1991, specifically to replace Challenger . Orbital Sciences Corporation subsequently received the contract to build what became known as the X-34. The company rolled out the first vehicle, known as the X-34A-1, on April 30, 1999, and subsequently delivered it to NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center , now called the Armstrong Flight Research Center , situated within Edward Air Force Base in California. A picture of the X-34A-1 rollout ceremony on April 30, 1999., NASA The X-34A-1 vehicle, which NASA described as a suborbital demonstrator, was just over 58 feet long and had a wingspan of almost 28 feet. It featured a lightweight composite airframe and various features intended to enable repeated flights to and from space, including reusable fuel tanks and specialized thermal protection for high-speed flight. This latter shielding was also capable of surviving subsonic flights in poor weather, according to NASA . The vehicle had a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system and an automated system to monitor the status of its avionics and the integrity of the vehicle, as well as its general course and flight performance, throughout its mission. The vehicle had tricycle landing gear and would land like a normal plane on a runway. The X-34A-1 airframe at the time of its delivery to NASA., NASA However, at the beginning of a mission, the X-34 design would rely on a mothership aircraft to get it to the appropriate altitude. Once there, the vehicle would separate from the carrier plane and then its Fastrac rocket motor would ignite, sending it soaring to an altitude of around 264,000 feet and following a pre-programmed flight route. Engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center had developed the Fastrac, also known as the MC-1, in-house separately as part of a program to craft a low-cost rocket engine. NASA subsequently contracted Summa Technology, Inc. to actually build these motors. NASA expected that the pump-fed liquid fuel rocket engine would propel X-34s to hypersonic speeds of around Mach 8. The vehicle would be able to perform at least 25 complete missions. Orbital Science’s Stargazer mothership launcher aircraft, a modified Lockheed L-1011 Tristar , carried the X-34A-1 aloft for the first captive-carry flight on June 29, 1999. Two more captive-carry tests occurred on Sept. 3 and 14, 1999. Stargazer carries the unpowered X-34A-1 during a captive-carry test in 1999., NASA Starting in July 2000 , NASA conducted a series of unpowered ground tests wherein a tractor truck pulled and released the X-34A-1, allowing it to coast at various speeds. On July 20, 2000, the X-34A-1 rolled along at speeds of between five and 10 miles per hour in two separate runs. Four days later, another pair of tests saw the vehicle get up to speeds of 30 miles per hour. At that time, NASA planned to conduct another six weeks of this type of ground testing, getting the X-34A-1 up to 80 miles per hour. It is unclear if that testing regimen proceeded as expected. That same year, the vehicle was supposed to make a total of 27 unpowered and powered test flights at the Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The first X-34 during tow tests in 2000., NASA As NASA was continuing to test of X-34A-1, Orbital Sciences also built a second airframe, known as the X-34A-2 . The plan was to send this example to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where it would receive the Fastrac engine and go through a series of test firings, before moving on for flight testing at Dryden. At Dryden, powered flight tests would see the X-34A-2 reach speeds of around Mach 2 and then up to Mach 5. Additional powered flights would then occur at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA hoped to conduct an average of one flight test every 14 days and demonstrate the ability to have the vehicle turned around and ready for another mission within 24 hours. With the flight test data from the X-34A-1 and A-2, NASA would then evaluate a third airframe, the X-34A-3 across the full planned flight envelope. There were plans for follow-on developments using the basic X-34 design, as well. The original X-34A-1 itself received such extensive modifications that NASA sometimes referred to it as the X-34A-1A. Originally, NASA had expected the X-34 to fall from the carrier plane and fire a Rocketdyne RS-56-OSA sustainer rocket engine, also found in the Atlas II space launch rocket, to fly to a high-suborbital position. From that altitude, it would reportedly have fired an expendable third stage with a Fastrac rocket engine, which would carry the payload into orbit. Technicians at Dryden make improvements to the X-34A-1 in 1999., NASA From the information available, NASA appears to have quickly abandoned this concept of operations for the three X-34As in favor of the simplified suborbital design with the Fastrac only. The eventual X-34 vehicles had no provision for a payload at all. However, there were reportedly plans for a larger, three-stage X-34B , which would have required a Boeing 747 mothership . The X-34B, along with the entire X-34 flight test program, never came to pass. Orbital Sciences never finished the X-34A-3, either. In 2000, NASA and Orbital Sciences, together, conducted a review of the program, its requirements, and testing schedule. The two parties concluded there were significant risks in the test plan for the vehicle’s various internal systems, especially its avionics and automated landing system. The end goal for the X-34 was for the vehicle to be able to land autonomously and do so in the face of crosswinds with gusts of more than 20 miles per hour, according to NASA . These risks held the potential for cost overruns and delays. Orbital Science’s contract with NASA, worth almost $86 million, only covered the design and fabrication of the X-34s. The company had put in $10 million of its own money to modify Stargazer, originally intended to lift the Pegasus series of air-launched rockets, so it could carry the new vehicle. Stargazer carrying a Pegasus XL air-launched space vehicle., NASA The money for testing, another $16 million by the end of 1999, had come through a separate joint effort between NASA and the U.S. military known as the Space Launch Initiative (SLI). SLI was a research and development project aimed at exploring a host of technologies related to reusable space launch systems and methods of enabling rapid access to space . SLI funded research into new rocket engines , reusable rocket boosters , and reusable space launch vehicles, such as the X-34, as well as the larger and significantly more complex single-stage-to-orbit Lockheed Martin X-33 . In 2001, NASA officially canceled the X-34 program, along with the X-33 project, in order to free up SLI funding for other higher priority work. We also don’t know if this decision was in part due to redundancies or competing programs in the classified realm . It does seem likely that the greater success NASA was having with the X-37A and X-40A programs was a contributing factor. Despite their nomenclatures, the NASA began work on the unpowered X-40A first in 1998, with the craft serving as a testbed for the larger X-37A. Boeing derived the basic shape of both of these vehicles from Space Shuttle. From left to right, the X-37A, X-40A, and one of the X-34As., NASA The X-37’s mission profile was also substantially less complicated than that of the X-34 and its mothership. The miniature space shuttle would instead ride into space on top of a commercial space launch rocket. In 2004, NASA transferred the X-37A program to the U.S. military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), after which it became a highly classified project. Two years later, the U.S. Air Force announced the start of development of an improved X-37B vehicle . The service eventually built two X-37Bs and the program has been a major success since then. The pair of OTVs have safely completed four orbital missions, the longest of which, so far, saw the vehicle spend more than 700 days in space. The first X-37B getting loaded into a payload shroud at the encapsulation cell at the Astrotech facility in Titusville, Florida on April 13, 2010, ahead of its first orbital flight., USAF The exact mission sets of the X-37Bs remain murky , but they’re still flying secretive missions today. One of the OTVs is in space right now on a fifth orbital flight that began in September 2017 and has already lasted more than 525 days . The X-34s have not been so lucky. Back in 2002, NASA had put the two completed airframes, along with the unfinished parts of the third vehicle and related equipment, in storage at Edward’s shadowy North Base installation . Though there was some talk of potentially putting one or both them into the base museum, this never occurred. The dilapidated hangar that held the two airframes was open and exposed to the elements, as well as birds and other animals. Our friend and aviation photographer Ashley Wallace managed to grab some pictures of them in this sorry state in 2007, which you can see below. Ashley Wallace Ashley Wallace Ashley Wallace Ashley Wallace Ashley Wallace In 2004, the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) announced that it was looking into whether it could use the X-34s as engine testbeds to support the development of its own Dream Chaser reusable space vehicle, offering the possibility of a new life for largely forgotten vehicles. But despite SNC’s interest, the vehicles remained in storage. It’s unclear why, but Dream Chaser, which is more similar in design to NASA’s HL-20 Personnel Launch System concept, did eventually end up using the landing gear from one of these vehicles. During Dream Chaser’s first free flight in October 2013, a portion of that gear failed. This caused the lifting body to go skidding off the runway during its landing attempt at Edwards, resulting in significant damage to the vehicle. Four years earlier, NASA, still apparently interested in finding some use for the X-34s, had towed the two vehicles out to Edwards’ Precision Impact Range Area (PIRA), where they reportedly served as laser designation practice targets for the Air Force. Out on the range, they were even more exposed to extreme shifts in temperature and poor weather. The spare parts and portions of the third airframe were steadily disposed of as waste and scrap, as well. Early in 2010, NASA attempted to remove them from the PIRA, but the effort ended up waylaid by bad weather, leaving the vehicles sitting on an access road until they eventually being moved to another outdoor site at Dryden in May of that year. Then, in November 2010 , NASA moved the pair of X-34 vehicles from that base to the Mojave Air and Space Port . At that time, Orbital Sciences was reportedly looking to see if the vehicles were still viable test beds. The X-34s on the way to Mojave in 2010., NASA The thought that the X-34s could be returned to flight was exciting to aerospace enthusiasts and the move did make news and was the source of some public intrigue. The vehicles sat on the ramp at civilian test flight Mecca until some time in 2013, when they went back to Dryden. As of 2015, satellite imagery showed that the remains of the X-34s were still at what had become known by then as NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards. They were parked outside among the hulks of other disused test airframes that once operated out of the legendary installation. Around this same time, ownership of the X-34s was transferred from NASA to the Air Force. The two X-34s sit next to Orbital Sciences Stargazer at the Mojave Air and Space Port in 2012., Google Earth The two X-34s, at top, sitting out in the open at the Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2015., Google Earth Fast forward to today and the X-34s no long call Armstrong Flight Test Center home, but that doesn’t mean they are sitting proudly in museums or are being used by a technical school for training. Their current resting place is a residential backyard in rural Lancaster, California, some 25 miles from their previous home at Edwards Air Force Base. The X-34 story took a very bizarre turn in the last couple of years when the Air Force apparently donated the craft to a museum in Florida. The man who was the point of contact for the museum had to take possession of them, but was not anywhere near ready logistically to move them across the country. This would have been a major administrative and operational undertaking as each state would require special permits to move the wide loads through. We can only imagine what the bill would be to ship the rocket planes 2,000 miles east would have been, but it would have been substantial. This is how they ended up in the back yard of the proprietor of Smith’s Quickcrane Inc. With the individual in Florida totally unprepared for the complex and expensive shipping process, he asked the contractor that had moved them off Edwards’ grounds to store them for a very short amount of time while he quickly got his affairs in order. According to the owner of Smith’s, who we talked to on the phone, what was originally supposed to be a couple weeks at the most has turned into many, many months. The Florida man disappeared on them, leaving them with the space vehicles sitting in pieces in their yard. Then, whenever they tried to collect on the contract or dispose of the vehicles, his lawyers would pop up and try to keep it from happening. Then, just as quickly as contact had been made, that same legal counsel would inform them that they no longer represented the purchaser of the X-34s. Back at square one. Clearly, the owners of Smith’s Quickcrane aren’t happy about with the situation and they just want to get paid and have the vehicles removed. But there they sit, a bizarre oddity to gawk at for anyone who drives down their road.

Their overall condition looks as if it has deteriorated substantially and who knows what has been taken off of them by thieves. Still, at the very least, they could be used as props to support the nearby movie making industry and it’s not as if there aren’t places nearby that deal in just those sort of services. It remains unclear who actually holds the title to these craft or if there is even some sort of title to hold. We find it odd that the Air Force hasn’t stepped in to remove the craft or find them a new home. If these craft were donated, the recipient clearly hasn’t held up their end of the bargain. Frankly, it seems strange that no museum in the region wouldn’t have taken them in the first place. We reached out to the Air Force for comment, but at the time of writing, we have not received a response. We will make sure to update this post when we hear back. In the meantime, the X-34s, craft that cost many millions of dollars and were once looked as potentially transformational when it comes to developing quicker, cheaper access to space, now sit rotting in the most unexpected and undignified of places. It’s a sad end to what already was a fairly sad life.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 29, 2021",Marine MV-22 Ospreys Flew In An RQ-21 Drone Unit During An Exercise For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a first for the service, U.S. Marines from Combat Logistics Battalion 3 slung components of an RQ-21 Blackjack unmanned aerial vehicle system under MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors and airlifted them to a forward site as part of an aerial insertion exercise. The maneuvers staged out of Marine Corps Base Hawaii on Aug. 5, 2020, involved an RQ-21 system and crew from Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 3 (VMU-3), the “Phantoms,” and Ospreys belonging to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 268 (VMM-268), the “Red Dragons.” Both units are stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe . The sortie, in which the Blackjack system was airlifted from Kaneohe to nearby Marine Corps Training Area Bellows, was part of a wider demonstration of the composite assault support capabilities of the island’s resident Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24). RQ-21s are also an important part of the Aviation Combat Element of Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU), with a typical one of those task forces having five of these drones as its only organic unmanned assets. An MV-22 Osprey comes in to pick up a catapult used for launching the RQ-21 Blackjack during a recent exercise in Hawaii., USMC Personnel attach a generator, part of the complete RQ-21 system, to an MV-22., USMC USMC An MV-22 with a Humvee belonging to Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 3 (VMU-3) slung beneath it., USMC The Hawaiian exercise demonstrated how the Ospreys might provide ship-to-shore transport for the RQ-21 system to rapidly establish a vital overwatch capability or to perform other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions during an expeditionary campaign. Land-based task forces could also use this technique to quickly move the drones into position at forward sites for the same purposes. The Blackjack, which entered Marine Corps service in 2014 as a replacement for the RQ-7B Shadow, offers a 16-hour endurance and, importantly, can operate from virtually any suitably flat surface, including the decks of amphibious assault ships, via a pneumatic catapult launcher and a Skyhook recovery system. A typical complete system comprises five individual RQ-21 drones, the catapult, the Skyhook, two trailer-mounted generators, and four Humvees carrying other components. All of this is relatively mobile, as the Hawaiian exercise showed. The video below shows the launch and recovery processes for the RQ-21. The RQ-21’s line-of-sight control system restricts its range to around 50 miles, although this can be extended using “hub-and-spoke” tactics with other drones acting as signal relays back to the ground control center. The Blackjack’s basic sensor suite includes electro-optical cameras for daylight full-motion color video and infrared ones for nighttime work, plus a laser rangefinder and an infrared pointer. Currently, it doesn’t carry a laser designator, but this is planned as a future upgrade. The drone’s payload bay can accommodate other appropriately sized systems up to a weight of 25 pounds, according to the Marines . The Corps has already taken advantage of this, introducing the AN/PDY-2 Split Aces synthetic aperture radar, which has a ground moving target indicator capability, and the AN/DSY-4 Spectral Bat signals intelligence (SIGINT) suite as payload options in recent years. You can read more about those systems in this previous War Zone article . Marine Blackjacks are also set to soon receive Logos Technologies ’ Cardcounter wide-area persistent-surveillance system, too. In July 2020 the company was awarded a $6.7-million contract to develop and flight-test the Cardcounter, which is derived from the same firm’s BlackKite sensor . Logos had previously tested its earlier RedKite system on the RQ-21, as well. An RQ-21 with the RedKite sensor package installed., Insitu “In embracing miniaturized wide-area motion imagery systems for tactical UAS, the Department of Defense is taking a technology that has already proven itself on the battlefield with aerostats and providing the tactical commander with guardian angel-like overwatch,” Doug Rombough, Vice President for Business Development at Logos Technologies, said in a press release . Cardcounter, which weighs less than 28 pounds, will be able to image an area of more than 5 square miles, allowing sensor operators to spot and track vehicles, as well as other targets, across a broad area in real-time. The company hopes to deliver two Cardcounter prototypes to the Marines by the end of September 2020. In the past, the Marines had considered employing the RQ-21 in the electronic warfare role, too. However, previous plans to incorporate a version of the Intrepid Tiger electronic warfare pod as an upgrade were apparently dropped in the 2019 Marine Aviation Plan and it’s unclear when or if the service might pursue this capability in the future. Since its introduction six years ago, the Blackjack has already become an important component of Marine combat operations. It was used to provide aerial overwatch for Coalition forces in Afghanistan’s Helmand province in 2014. This was ahead of the declaration of initial operational capability in early 2016, by which time the drone had been enhanced in light of lessons learned from the Afghan experience. The next major theater of action was the Middle East, where RQ-21 units deployed to support Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), the campaign against ISIS in Iraq in Syria, from the summer of 2016. The drone was in such demand over those battlefields that USMC units went over their budgeted flight hours by more than 300 percent . Marines disconnect an RQ-21 from the Skyhook recovery system after a mission., USMC The recent first-of-its-kind expeditionary warfare exercise in Hawaii only underscores the drone’s still growing importance to the Marine Corps. The RQ-21 also made its debut in Australia this month, where the latest rotation of personnel assigned to Marine Rotational Force-Darwin (MRF-D) conducted a first flight in that country at the Bradshaw Field Training Area, Northern Territory, on Aug. 8, 2020. The Marine Corps’ has an expanding interest in unmanned capabilities broadly, from hand-launched systems to support small unit operations to much higher-end, long-endurance systems with beyond-line-of-sight control systems that are larger and more capable than the RQ-21, as well. The service recently began operating a small number of MQ-9 Reapers , which it acquired as a stepping stone to developing its own large unmanned aircraft capability through the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary, or MUX, program. MUX, which initially envisioned a high-end, multipurpose system that could operate from amphibious ships, as well as land-based sites, has been significantly scaled back in the two years since its public announcement. That’s not to say that the Marine Corps’ ambitions in this regard have diminished. The radical new Force Design 2030 concept, which Commandant General David Berger revealed in March, is already cutting very traditional capabilities, including all of the service’s tanks , in favor of an increased focus on unmanned systems and stand-off missiles . You can read more about this new force structure plan in this past War Zone piece . “As a ‘stand-in’ force of the future, the Marine Corps requires a family of UAS [unmanned aerial system] capabilities. We need to transition from our current UAS platforms to capabilities that can operate from ship, from shore, and able to employ both collection and lethal payloads,” Berger wrote in a Force Design 2030 overview document. “These future capabilities must be expeditionary and fully compatible with Navy platforms and command and control networks.” He also said that he felt that “short-range, low endurance unmanned aerial systems (UAS) incapable of employing lethal effects,” which could include the RQ-21, were an area where the Corps was “over-invested.” However, it seems likely that improved versions of the RQ-21, together with new and improved payload options, including the potential to employ small precision-guided munitions , will continue to be part of the Marine Corps unmanned ecosystem for the foreseeable future. It will be situated in an operational space between smaller drones that an individual might deploy and higher-end platforms that require more significant manpower, infrastructure, and other resources to operate. All told, the RQ-21 looks set to become an ever-more useful tool in the Marine Corps armory and is now one that Marines can rapidly relocate to where they might need it using their MV-22 Ospreys.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has released images of the second series-production Su-57 Felon advanced combat jet, which is now under construction. The first production example crashed during a flight test last year. You can see that aircraft while under construction here . Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu had led a delegation to Sukhoi’s Komsomolsk-on-Amur (KnAAZ) aviation plant to inspect the aircraft on Aug. 12, 2020, as part of the commemoration of Russia’s Air Force Day. This aircraft is known to the factory as T-50S-2 and by the serial number 51002. You can read all about the Su-57’s unique feature-set and design philosophy in this previous War Zone f eature . The T-50S-2 aircraft under construction at Komsomolsk-on-Amur., United Aircraft Corporation Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, in the green uniform, takes a closer look at the cockpit of T-50S-2, Russian MoD Russian MoD Russian MoD Interestingly, the images clearly show the Su-57’s 101KS-V infrared search-and-track (IRST) targeting system installed in the nose. Also visible is the aircraft’s offset inflight refueling probe and its unpainted, composite material nose radome. Its large, canard-like, leading-edge maneuvering flaps are also seen in their full downward articulated state. Like the ill-fated first production aircraft, this aircraft wears a pixelated “digital camouflage” scheme. The released imagery shows also modified asymmetrical air inlets at the base of the leading edges of the twin vertical stabilizers. At least one previous aircraft from the original 11-strong test fleet carried this modification. The update could suggest differing cooling requirements exist for the systems supported by the two dorsal fin air scoops atop the wide engine installations. A pre-production Su-57 with the asymmetrical air inlets., Russian MoD capture Pre-production Su-57s with the more common inlet arrangement., United Aircraft Corporation Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , also noted how the manufacturing quality on this latest aircraft appears to be of a higher standard: This second production aircraft is part of an order for 76 examples that Russia announced in May 2019, which called for deliveries to be completed by 2028. It’s not clear how this schedule may have been delayed by the loss of the first production example on Dec. 24, 2019. The pilot ejected safely during that accident, which marked the first total loss of one of the new-generation Russian fighters. “The crash is due to a failure of the Su-57’s [flight] control system,” a Russian defense industry source subsequently told state-run media outlet TASS . “The tail control failed,” another source added. While the Su-57 remains perhaps the most advanced Russian combat aircraft project, the fighter has faced some significant pitfalls since development began in 2002. The initial serial production versions lack the promised new-generation engines . There have been some highlights too, such as a well-publicized “combat evaluation” in Syria , although the details of what was achieved in that deployment remain sketchy. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tSysSai0kWw Despite high hopes, the Russian Ministry of Defense has still only placed firm orders for 76 production aircraft, and the country’s aircraft industry remains engaged in the manufacture of the Su-30, Su-34 , and Su-35 . With the demise of Indian interest in the Su-57 — which was being proposed to New Delhi as the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) — the Kremlin has reportedly been pitching the aircraft to other potential foreign customers, including China and Turkey. Showing that progress is being made on the second initial-production jet could be a way to try and help drum up more foreign interest, especially after last year’s crash. Wherever the next orders might come from, Sukhoi and the Russian Ministry of Defense are clearly making efforts to get the Su-57 back on track and Shoygu’s visit to the KnAAZ facility on Russian Air Force Day shows that they are keen to demonstrate a new impetus in the program.

The U.S. Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Essex recently served as an aviation transport of sorts, bringing a load of World War II-era warbirds to Hawaii. The aircraft, which include examples of the iconic P-51 Mustang fighter and B-25 Mitchell bomber, among others, are set to take part in events commemorating the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II on Friday. Essex arrived at Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor, site of the infamous Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941, which finally brought American fully into the War, with her unusual cargo on Aug. 10, 2020. The United States and the rest of the Allies declared final victory over Japan on Aug. 14, 1945, though Japanese officials would not formally surrender until Sept. 2.

Much more recently, in the late 2000s, the Wasp class Amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard – which recently suffered a devastating fire – transported “red air” aggressor jets to Hawaii for exercises. An L-29 Deflin aggressor jet is seen on the deck of the USS Bonhomme Richard in the late 2000s., USN It’s hardly the first time a Navy ship has hosted warbirds, either. In April 1992, two B-25s notably took off from the Forrestal class aircraft carrier USS Ranger to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the famous Doolittle Raid on Japan in 1942. That operation involved the Yorktown class aircraft carrier USS Hornet launching 16 of the bombers, which then went on to bomb Tokyo and other nearby areas in a direct reprisal for the Pearl Harbor attack. The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson brought another contingent of warbirds to Hawaii for the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in 1995, as well. In this particular instance, Essex also carried a new C-12U Huron utility aircraft, which is a militarized Beechcraft King Air, bound for the Hawaii Army National Guard. https://youtube.com/watch?v=QvP_YZqkOQA These aircraft were in addition to the Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors and MH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters embarked on the Essex as part of its normal aviation contingent.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 3, 2021",B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Is “Starting To Look Like An Airplane”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Randy Walden, the Air Force official responsible for managing the B-21 Raider stealth bomber program, recently offered a brief update on the progress that Northrop Grumman is making on the construction of the first prototype, saying it has begun to “look like an airplane.” The company is currently building that test aircraft at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California and the Air Force hopes that it could be ready for its first flight by the end of next year, though there have been concerns that this could get pushed back . Walden, who is also the head of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), offered his comments about the B-21 program while accompanying Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), on a visit to Northrop Grumman’s offices in Melbourne, Florida. This is where the company has its B-21 design and development headquarters, though the production of the actual prototype is taking place at Plant 42. It’s unclear exactly when that visit took place, but the Air Force publicly announced it last week. “The first test aircraft is being built, and it’s starting to look like an airplane,” Walden said. “Suppliers from across the country are delivering parts that are coming together now. Aircraft programs will always have a few surprises early on, and we won’t be any different, but overall the B-21 Raider is coming along nicely.” “The progress I saw today further adds to my confidence that the B-21 Raider will preserve our long range strike and penetrating bomber capability,” General Ray added. “We’re excited to get the B-21 Raider to bases in the mid-2020s.” Five years after Northrop Grumman received the contract to design and build the stealth bombers, details about the B-21 remain limited. The Air Force only released new concept art of the aircraft in January, complimenting the one graphic depicting the plane that the service had previously handed out in 2015. You can read The War Zone ‘s full analysis of the design features that can be seen in the newer renderings here . One of a series of B-21 renderings that the Air Force released in January 2020. This shows how the aircraft might appear at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, one of three bases set to eventually host operational Raider squadrons. The others are Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota and Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri., USAF The comments from Walden, who has accompanied other top U.S. defense officials to Melbourne for updates on the B-21 in the past , as well as General Ray, are significant given concerns about possible schedule slips for the program. Last year, the Air Force said that it expected to see the first flight test of the Raider prototype in December 2021 , before walking that back and making clear that this was the absolute earliest possible date for that milestone. “There’s a lot of things that have to happen between now and a couple of years, … but in general terms, that’s what we’re shooting for,” Walden had said in October 2019. “Things like large components coming together, integration, ground tests – all the things that lead up to a first flight – have to be accomplished.” At that time, Walden had added that “we do have an airplane in there,” referring to Plant 42, but his comments indicating that “large components coming together” was still something yet to happen had suggested that the construction of the prototype was still in a relatively early phase. It’s worth noting, of course, that the development and production of any advanced stealthy aircraft is a complex affair . We also know that Northrop Grumman built a full-scale, but non-flying “Iron Bird” mockup that has allowed for work to be done on the development and integration of systems that will go into the B-21 without needing an actual prototype. It remains very likely that the company has performed risk reduction work using other platforms or pre-production test articles, as well. Whenever the prototype is completed, it is set to head to Edwards Air Force Base, where there has been significant construction already ahead of its arrival . The 420th Flight Test Squadron, which the Air Force reactivated at Edwards last year and has designated the B-21 Combined Test Force, will lead the testing of the aircraft. The insignia of the 420th Flight Test Squadron, which is now designated as the B-21 Combined Test Force., USAF Whatever happens, “we can’t just say we’re going to sneak it out and get a first flight in,” Walden had said last year. At least according to the Air Force, the first B-21 prototype is now beginning to take shape towards that end. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 10, 2022",Chinese Z-10A Attack Helicopter Shows Off New Missile During Live-Fire Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged from China showing Z-10A attack helicopters from the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force launching what’s reportedly a new type of missile during a live-fire exercise. The footage appeared online after screengrabs showing the new air-to-surface weapon were posted on social media last week. These first images originated from the state-owned China Central Television 13 (CCTV 13) channel and showed crews loading the missiles onto four-round racks on the Z-10A’s outboard stub-wing hardpoints before they were launched at an undisclosed location. The missiles engaged a variety of armored vehicle targets, including tanks. The range at which these were knocked out is likely indicative of a fire-and-forget weapon and the use of Z-10As in combination with at least one Z-19A suggests that the latter type may have provided targeting data using its mast-mounted millimeter-wave (MMW) radar, forming a hunter-killer team.

The anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) bears some resemblance to the China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) Blue Arrow 21 (BA-21), a weapon that’s thought to have a range of around 11 miles and guidance based on a dual-mode millimeter-wave radar/semi-active laser seeker. Offered for export at Airshow China at Zhuhai in 2018, the helicopter-launched BA-21 is reportedly an enhanced derivative of the AKD-10 missile that is used by the PLAGF’s Z-10 and Z-19 attack rotorcraft and that is broadly equivalent to the U.S. AGM-114 Hellfire . The Chinese missile has a reported range of around 4.3 miles. While the initial AKD-10 employed semi-active laser guidance, later iterations of the weapon reportedly incorporate an MMW seeker. Previously, a drone-launched BA-21 version was displayed at Zhuhai in 2016, intended as part of the armory of the Wing Loong II unmanned combat air vehicle, among others.

The function of this store is unclear, but it has some similarities with training pods used by other helicopters to simulate targets for engagement as well as hits to the aircraft itself. Another possibility is that these pods contain data-link equipment, which would potentially allow targeting data to be handed from the Z-19A and then passed on to the missile once launched by the Z-10A. This would allow a single radar-equipped helicopter to provide targeting coordinates for multiple Z-10As. Still, such a system would not offer the same ‘fire-and-forget’ capability that the Apache Longbow system provides. The launching helicopter would have to maintain line-of-sight for a period of time after launch. Finally, it could be some kind of independent radar illuminator for self-targeting the radio-frequency-guided missiles, but it would probably have to be tied to the helicopter’s electro-optical system, which would seem to defeat the point to some degree. In addition to employing a new missile, the PLAGF’s Z-10 has recently been active in the maritime domain, with deck trials on board a Type 072A landing ship of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), reportedly conducted in the Taiwan Strait. The Changhe Aircraft Industries Group Z-10 — locally named Pi Li Huo, or Thunderbolt — is the PLAGF’s first modern attack helicopter, first flown in April 2003 and entering service in pre-production form in late 2010. Before the emergence of this new missile, its main weapons were understood to be eight AKD-9 or AKD-10 ATGMs, plus a 23mm cannon and various rocket pods. It can also be armed with PL-90 air-to-air missiles. Primary sensors are a WXG1006 package in the nose that contains a forward-looking infrared, TV camera, laser rangefinder, and laser designator. The definitive production version for the PLAGF is the Z-10A that incorporates some detailed changes in terms of the targeting system and, perhaps, features uprated engines. The Chinese Z-19 has a millimeter-wave radar. They have been copying American designs, such as AH-64D and RAH-66, but the Chinese’s radar is small and ugly. This radar is at least tested on the Z-9 helicopter. . pic.twitter.com/6ZDfDT62OE — Caesar (@Ninja998998) August 1, 2020 The Z-19, meanwhile, which was seen in the video working alongside the Z-10, was developed by the Harbin Aircraft Industry Group as a light scout/attack helicopter. First flown in May 2010, it reportedly entered service in 2012 and is named Hei Xuan Feng, or Black Cyclone. As well as KD-9 or KD-10 ATGMs and PL-90 AAMs, it can be armed with gun pods and rockets. The definitive Z-19A version is fitted with a mast-mounted MMW phased-array radar , making it an ideal complement to the Z-10 for armed reconnaissance and target designation. It can use this system to locate, classify, prioritize, and engage targets in any weather, day or night. In this case, it may now be able to data-link those targets to a nearby Z-10. Rupprecht identifies the Z-10As and Z-19As in the video as belonging to the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force’s (PLAGF) 161st Air Assault Brigade, which is assigned to the 83rd Group Army. The brigade is headquartered at Xinxiang, in Henan province and is part of the Central Theater Command. While we await more details about the Z-10A’s new missile, it’s clear that the People’s Liberation Army is continuing to make serious efforts to improve the capabilities of its attack helicopter fleet — and at the same time, it seems to be refining its concept of operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 10, 2021",South Korea Officially Unveils Plan For F-35B Light Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The South Korean government has revealed that its next amphibious assault ships will be aviation-centric platforms with a heavy focus on operations involving the country’s future short and vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . The vessels will not have a well-deck to launch and receive landing craft or amphibious vehicles and will be in a configuration more akin to the U.S. Navy’s first-in-class USS America . The new details about the LPX-II program , previously referred to as LPH-II , were included in a larger South Korean defense spending plan for the 2021 to 2025 timeframe that authorities in Seoul released on Aug. 10, 2020. The South Korean Ministry of Defense also released a new rendering of the ship’s design, as it exists now, which is seen at the top of this story and below. South Korean Ministry of Defense South Korea’s plan to acquire new big-deck amphibious assault ships that could support F-35Bs first emerged publicly last year and was the product of deliberations that also considered plans to buy larger dedicated aircraft carriers . Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) won the contract to design the LPX-II in October 2019. At the same time, there were reports about South Korea moving ahead with the acquisition of the short and vertical takeoff and landing variant fo the F-35, which was subsequently confirmed. South Korean authorities had been eying the purchase of F-35Bs as early as 2017 . The LPX-II design will reportedly be derived from the South Korean Navy’s Dokdo class amphibious assault ship hullform, which was originally designed by another shipbuilder, Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction (HHIC). The Dokdos , the second of which has its own notable, but less substantial differences from the original design, are classified as landing platform helicopters (LPH), but the first ship was referred to as the LPX during development. Previous reports have said the new ships would displace around 30,000 tons, around 12,000 tons more than the Dokdos , and also be longer overall. The first-in-class Dokdo ., USN The new rendering from the South Korean Ministry of Defense shows some broad overall similarities to the existing Dokdo class ships, including the superstructure with twin exhaust funnel clusters. However, the LPX-II’s expanded superstructure has two new large octagonal masts and there are at least two large fixed radar arrays on the front of the forward one. The front of the LPX-II’s enlarged flight deck is also squared off compared to the Dokdos and has two elevators at the stern to bring aircraft and other equipment up from the lower decks. The South Korean Navy’s existing LPHs have one stern elevator and another in the center of the forward flight deck, which would be difficult, if not impossible to use during routine operations with short-takeoff fixed-wing jets, such as the F-35B, which would need this area clear. The new concept art shows eight F-35Bs parked on the ship’s deck, as well as another either landing or taking off, and two helicopters, which could represent the South Korean Navy’s UH-60P Black Hawks or the South Korean Marine Corps’ MUH-1 Surions . It’s interesting to note that the newly released concept art is substantially different from an earlier rendering from the South Korean Ministry of Defense, which had a very different superstructure design and had the second aircraft elevator more amidships on the port side. It also showed tilt-rotor aircraft similar to the V-22 Osprey on the deck. An earlier and much lower quality rendering of the notional LPX-II design that the South Korean Ministry of Defense released last year., South Korean Ministry of Defense via Naval News It is also a much less radical departure from the original Dokdo design than was seen in concept art that HHI showed at the International Maritime Defense Industry Exhibition, or MADEX, last year in South Korea, as seen in the video below. That ship design had a smaller superstructure with a single exhaust funnel arrangement, two aircraft elevators on the starboard side, and, most notably, a ski jump on the forward deck. This feature would offer short-takeoff aircraft, such as the F-35B, increased performance while launching from the ship, as well as enhanced safety. It’s not clear why the ski jump has disappeared or whether it might make its way back into the final LPX-II. It’s also unclear how the new aviation focus will impact the ship’s amphibious warfare capabilities. As recently as last year , the vessel was expected to carry 3,000 troops and 20 armored vehicles, in addition to aircraft and helicopters. It would be impossible to deploy heavy armor from the ship without a well-deck and even medium armor from the flight deck without a heavy-lift helicopter, something the South Korean Navy and Marine Corps also lack. A total compliment of 3,000 Marines seems optimistic, to begin with, given the capacity of similar ships, such as the U.S. Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ships, which are larger and carry fewer Marines. It is possible that this reflected the absolute maximum capacity for short-term contingency missions with a reduced air wing or was a figure that also included the ship’s crew and the personnel assigned to the air component. HHI had previously said it expected to finalize the design by the end of this year. The South Korean Navy hopes to commission the first example sometime in the early 2030s. It’s not clear how many of these vessels the South Koreans intend to acquire in total. No matter what the ship’s final configuration might be, it stands to offer the South Korean Navy, and the country’s military as a whole, an important new capability in face of a variety of regional threats. Being able to launch F-35Bs from a ship at sea would be invaluable during any conflict with North Korea, when established bases on land would be subjected to heavy attacks. The B model Joint Strike Fighters could also use their vertical takeoff and landing capabilities to operate from fortified roads or simple concrete pads on shore, as well, something The War Zone has explored in greater detail in the past. A light carrier-esque amphibious assault ship capable of supporting fixed-wing combat jet operations, especially with higher-end aircraft like the F-35B, would give the South Korean military a more significant tool for projecting power elsewhere, as well. This is something the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps have already been experimenting with in the Pacific Region, including in the contested South China Sea, as part the “ Lighting Carrier ” concept, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . South Korea is notably party to a number of its own maritime disputes with Russia and China , as well as Japan. All told, it remains to be seen exactly what South Korea’s new LPX-II will actually look like in the end, but the focus has clearly shifted more toward naval airpower and away from more traditional amphibious operations.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Aug 19, 2020",Trio Of B-2 Stealth Bombers Deploy To The Remote Island Outpost Of Diego Garcia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three U.S. Air Force B-2A Spirit stealth bombers launched from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, in the early hours of Aug. 11, 2020, heading for the remote island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean . The three bombers flew west from their home base and out over the Pacific Ocean, passing Hawaii and then onwards for a planned run across northern Australia before continuing west to the secluded island air base. The launch of this B-2 mission, which saw the aircraft using the callsigns Reaper 11, Reaper 12, and Reaper 13, follows the deployment of six USAF B-52Hs earlier this year to the remote base. That deployment was a response to a spike in tensions with Iran, details of which you can find here in this previous War Zone feature . Deploying B-2 stealth bombers to Diego Garcia means the U.S. Air Force has assets more readily available to be dynamically employed in the region if required. In particular, regional commanders can make use of the B-2’s stealthy capabilities to undertake long-range penetrating missions into heavily defended areas. USAF B-2As REAPR11 flight of 3 departed Whiteman AFB, Missouri for Diego Garcia Air Base (Indian Ocean) via the Pacific Ocean and overflight of northern Australia. Multiple USAF tankers will support the bombers throughout the flight. pic.twitter.com/YWaJBvzF4N — Aircraft Spots (@AircraftSpots) August 11, 2020 You can hear audio from the B-2’s flight to Diego Garcia here . The deployment through the Pacific comes at a time of real tension in the South China Sea. Next week, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is expected to stage a series of exercises that are likely intended to simulate the storming of Taiwanese islands in the region, as detailed here . There has been a significant increase in military activity in the Indo-Pacific region recently, with more U.S.-led trilateral exercises planned in the region over the coming months. The USAF last deployed B-2s to Diego Garcia in March 2016 amid heightened security concerns in the South China Sea. “Recent events demonstrate the continued need to provide consistent and credible air power throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific region,” Air Force General Lori Robinson, the then Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) commander, told Air Force Times at the time. Diego Garcia is one of just a handful of locations that are equipped to accommodate B-2s and it features four climate-controlled clamshell hangars known as B-2 Shelter Systems (BS22s) for the stealth bombers. Historically, the base has been used as a hub from which to mount long-range bomber missions into the Middle East and Central Asia. Yet its location means bomber crews must fly extremely long-endurance missions to reach these areas, well over 10 hours to reach Afghanistan, for example. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is far closer to the Middle East operational theaters and it had become a favored operating location for Air Force Global Strike Command’s B-1s and B-52s in recent years. However, it is vulnerable, falling well within reach of Iran’s ballistic missiles . It is also markedly farther away from hotspots in the Pacific. A B-2A at Diego Garcia during the March 2016 deployment., USAF/SrA Joel Pfiester When Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) sent six B-52Hs to Diego Garcia earlier this year to be ready to respond to any potential Iranian aggression , they did so specifically to also keep them safely out of the range of Tehran’s missile threat. It is unclear if this new B-2 deployment is designed as a show of force in the Pacific region, or whether the bombers are responding to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) requirements , which was a primary driver for the last bomber deployment there. Beyond just supporting bomber missions, Diego Garcia provides the U.S. military with a secluded strategic operations base and staging post, which is ideally located for supporting long missions into a range of potential hotspots, including East Africa and the Pacific regions, as well as to the Middle East. In addition to the airfield, the island’s lagoon is used to host one of two Military Sealift Command’s Prepositioning Ship Squadrons. Its ships are loaded with munitions and equipment, ready to respond to a crisis on short notice. This deployment to Diego Garcia also comes after the USAF ended its 16-year Continuous Bomber Presence at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam in April 2020, as it sought to change the predictability of the Bomber Task Force’s rotating series of deployments. This was in line with the National Defense Strategy’s objectives of strategic predictability and operational unpredictability . The USAF is looking not just at dynamic mission employment, but also dynamic basing for the B-2s. Stealth bombers were notably dispatched to Wake Island in the Pacific in 2018 and to Iceland last year as part of its vision for rapid, expeditionary, and distributed deployment concepts. The Air Force says it now focuses on sending smaller and less predictable bomber deployments to the region as part of its new dynamic force employment model. “We can come and go anytime they need us, we don’t need to be there physically,” said AFGSC chief General Timothy Ray of the new strategy, which means bombers can operate around the globe, even without being permanently deployed to bases abroad. USAF/SrA Joel Pfiester A series of snap global missions by B-1s , B-2s, and B-52s have been undertaken since the end of the Continuous Bomber Presence in a clear effort to highlight the ability to employ these assets with greater versatility and combine their effects with other combat aircraft. The launch of the B-2s this morning coincided with another strategic mission, flown by a pair of B-1B Lancers, that launched from their deployment location at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam and flew north towards the Sea of Japan. While long-range, global B-2 missions from their home base are fairly routine, sending a deployment of three aircraft for a sustained period overseas is a significant event for Whiteman AFB’s 509th Bomb Wing. Moving three of the stealth bombers to Diego Garcia is a huge logistical undertaking, both in terms of tanker and cargo support. However, positioning these bombers here opens up a range of various possibilities for the U.S. military. It’s possible that a B-2 deployment to the Indian Ocean is designed to fit into the large-scale U.S. exercises that lay ahead, including the Rim Of The Pacific, or RIMPAC, exercises that are due to commence on August 17. The Indian-led Malabar exercise is also scheduled to be held by the end of this year, and it could include Australian, as well as U.S. assets. China has expanded its naval operations into the Indian Ocean and it’s possible the B-2s could make their first appearance in this exercise. On the other hand, the deployment could also be at least partially aimed at Iran and even deterring China on a grander level. And that is precisely why Diego Garcia offers such a unique strategic staging opportunity for long-range combat aviation assets. It provides flexible and secure forward-basing, unlike any other locale. We will bring you more details as and when the exact nature of this long-range B-2 mission becomes clearer.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 6, 2020",Watch Chinese Frogmen Fire Their Special Underwater Guns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video released by China’s state-affiliated People’s Daily shows a training exercise by naval special warfare operators from the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Jiaolong Commandos. With a name that translates as “Sea Dragon,” this elite unit is tasked with various underwater operations — and it’s equipped with specialist equipment for the task, including some unusual weaponry. According to state-run media outlet CGTN , the Jiaolong Commandos are based in Sanya , the southernmost city on Hainan Island, in the South China Sea . The same source identifies some of the unit’s apparently broad areas of expertise as coastal infiltration, jungle patrol, and urban counter-terrorism. While personal combat below the waves has always been part of the military frogman’s repertoire, only a few armed forces have adopted specialist firearms for anti-diver purposes or diver self-defense. Weapons of this type are, by their nature, a niche capability . And this video does a good job of showing why: the commandos have to approach very close to their targets to compensate for their firearms’ strictly limited range. Among the weapons in question are QBS-06 underwater assault rifles, broadly speaking a Chinese equivalent of the APS rifles employed by Russian naval commandos. The APS dates back to the Soviet Union, where it was apparently tailored to combat American frogman assaults. The APS — a Russian acronym standing for “Special Underwater Assault Rifle” — adopted the same size and configuration as the tried-and-tested AK-47 assault rifle, with a huge banana-style magazine containing 26 rocket-like 5.66mm x 120mm dart cartridges. The original APS was followed in the 1990s by the APS-DM, which differed in that it could be used both underwater and above the surface, providing the combatant with much greater utility. Its twin magazines accommodated both 26 5.4mm darts, which have a maximum effective range under water of fewer than 100 feet, and standard 5.45 x 39 cartridges. A yet more modern Russian proposition is the ADS, which has a bullpup layout and is again capable of use above or below the surface of the water; its major innovation is the use of 5.45 x 39 ammunition for both domains, making the overall design simpler and more compact. According to Western accounts , the QBS-06 seen in the hands of the Jiaolong Commandos fires special 5.8mm DBS-06 ammunition, each round carrying a long, needle-like projectile. These are loaded in detachable plastic magazines each with a 25-round capacity. Its cyclic rate of fire is reportedly around 600 rounds per minute. Also making an appearance in the video is the QSS-05 underwater pistol. This weapon — chambered for 8mm ammunition — is apparently inspired by the Soviet-era breach-loading SPP-1 4.5mm underwater pistol, which also features dart-type ammunition and. While the Soviet firearm has a quad-barrel arrangement, the QSS-05 has three barrels. It’s worth noting that these elite Chinese commandos appear to be using what looks to be commercial scuba gear, not more specialized breathing devices that combat divers around the world use, including rebreather designs. A rebreather improves the efficiency of the system and recycles breathing gas, allowing the diver to remain submerged longer. The closed-circuit arrangement also doesn’t release any bubbles, which could give away the diver’s position. As tensions skyrocket in the South China Sea and Beijing builds up its naval capabilities at a breathtaking pace, Chinese frogmen will clearly be an increasingly critical part of amphibious warfare in the future. Will this include undersea diver-versus-diver combat? That is a tough question to answer, but at least we know that the Jiaolong Commandos are well-armed for such an eventuality.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",British A400M Transport Gets Tasked With Low-Level Patrols To Track Migrant Boats From France,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Royal Air Force Airbus A400M transport aircraft, also known to the service as an Atlas C1, has been drafted in to help support the U.K. Border Force cope with a recent surge of migrants aboard small vessels heading across the English Channel towards British shores from France. The aircraft was noted flying low over the sea this morning and imagery from commercially available flight-tracking software showed it flying a complex patrol pattern over the English Channel between Dover, and Calais, France. The U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) said the use of the large transport aircraft had been sanctioned by the Defense Secretary Ben Wallace to help assist the U.K. Home Office. The A400M flew a roughly eight-hour mission from its home base at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, on Aug. 10, 2020, as more small vessels attempted to cross the English Channel heading for the Kent coast. The aircraft was joined by another unspecified civilian aircraft supporting Her Majesty’s Coastguard, which also provided surveillance to assist the UK Border Force. The Airbus was described in a MOD tweet as a “surveillance aircraft,” but while some of its crews are trained in maritime surface search, and while the aircraft’s radar features a ground mapping mode, the A400M is designed primarily as a large transport. Still, while the A400M may not be a purpose-built maritime patrol aircraft, it does have some applicable mission equipment. The type assumed the U.K. Falkland Islands’ deployed transport role from the C-130J Hercules in 2018. This resulted in the big Airbus gaining the ability to conduct air-sea rescue operations. This capability involves the A400M deploying Air-Sea Rescue Apparatus (ASRA) from its rear cargo ramp. This is designed to enable the aircraft to come to the aid of downed aircrews or mariners in trouble at sea and involves dropping a large Beaufort Mk 20 liferaft. The video below shows the flight clearance activities for this capability. While the A400M seems an unlikely fit for this mission, there are some sensible arguments for its use in this case. The aircraft’s ability to deploy liferafts in the event of the often overloaded small immigrant vessels getting into trouble is clearly an important consideration. This coupled with the crew’s ability to use the aircraft as a platform to conduct relatively rudimentary surveillance by simply looking out of the windows. A Royal Air Force A400M., Crown Copyright The issue of boats crossing the English Channel has been in the public spotlight recently. “The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high,” Home Secretary Priti Patel said recently on Twitter : “The figures are shameful.” This harder line on illegal people trafficking across the English Channel has recently been underscored by the appointment of a “Clandestine Channel Threat Commander” — a new role leading the U.K.’s response to tackle illegal attempts to reach the country. “He will collaborate closely with the French to build on the joint work already underway, urgently exploring tougher action in France, including stronger enforcement measures and adopting interceptions at sea and the direct return of boats,” a media release from the U.K. Home Office said . Inside the cockpit of a RAF A400M., Crown Copyright The A400M is less well suited to short-range coastal surveillance that could theoretically be undertaken by a more specialist platform at a fraction of the cost. It’s unclear why the A400M was chosen for this latest operation, but available capacity from other agencies is a likely factor. Like the U.K. Border Force, the Royal Navy is overstretched and lacks the spare assets in order to counter this irregular migration, although the U.K. Government is said to have requested its support for the current situation. The need to draft in an A400M also points to a shortfall in suitable air assets. In 2016, the U.K. government terminated an aerial surveillance contract with Cobham that was designed to help support efforts tackling illegal boat crossings from the continent. In February this year, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) awarded Elbit a contract to undertake maritime demonstration flights in the U.K. using Hermes 900 unmanned aerial vehicles. This is part of an effort to establish 24-hour maritime search and rescue around the U.K. U.K. company 2Excel is now supporting the Maritime and Coastguard Agency., 2Excel The area of the Channel that sees most of this activity has been regularly patrolled by a small Tekever AR5 unmanned aerial vehicle that operates from Lydd Airport in Kent and monitors a temporary danger area. The company 2Excel also recently began supporting the MCA with specially configured twin-engine Kings Airs and a Piper Navajo. These types of small patrol aircraft, fitted with suitable sensor fits including compact maritime surveillance radars and electro-optic/infrared sensors, are common solutions for this kind of inshore waters mission. The RAF’s new Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is now entering service and might also appear to be a more obvious asset to keep watch on the waterways between the U.K. and the European continent. But with only two aircraft delivered to they are already deeply engaged in more pressing missions, such as shadowing foreign warships and anti-submarine patrols. The military response from an A400M is also likely required to help plug gaps in available cover at this busy time of year. The U.K. Coastguard’s resources are typically stretched during the peak of the summer holiday season . All told, the need for the MOD to divert an in-demand transport asset such as an A400M to cover a maritime patrol role may be seen as a sign of a lack of resources afforded to the U.K. Border Force. It might also be a useful means to show a hard line against illegal activities taking place around the southern U.K. coastline.

Jamie Hunter and Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 11, 2020",Israel Now Has Two Combat Ready F-35 Squadrons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has declared its second squadron of F-35I “Adir” Joint Strike Fighters combat-ready. The 116 Squadron, the “Lions of the South,” has become fully operational after a six-month period of intensive workups. It clears the way for the unit to join frontline operations alongside sister unit, 140 Squadron , or the “Golden Eagle Squadron,” at Nevatim Air Base. “The operational fitness inspection provides an official seal of approval for the operational capability of the 116th Squadron to carry out all the missions of the ‘Adir’ division,” explained a senior IAF airman , identified by the service only as Major Edi. “The squadron’s tasks include its management during routine [operations] and periods of war, as well as maintaining functional continuity.” “The inspection simulated the operational arena and the current regional tensions. Several scenarios led to a simulated war on all fronts, and aircrew members took off for missions in all of Israel’s regions,” another IAF member identified as Major G, a member of 116 Squadron who was in charge of the inspection, added. “Various personnel from different departments in the IAF’s HQ came to the squadron to examine us. The next significant milestone will be our first operational mission. We are still a small squadron, and will continue to recruit new people and aircraft in the coming months.” The news closely followed the arrival of four more F-35Is in Israel on August 4, including one bespoke aircraft for the domestic Flight Test Center at Tel Nof Air Base. The unique aircraft (AS-15) is the first dedicated test F-35 aircraft outside the U.S. and the Israeli Air Force (IAF) says it will be used for trials with “emphasis on munitions, advanced operating systems, and more.” It adds: “The aircraft was designed with signal- and information-collection capabilities with specific equipment. It is a significant milestone for the IAF and provides a new ability to conduct unique test flights with the ‘Adir’ in the present and future.” You can read more about this aircraft here in this previous War Zone feature . A 116 Squadron F-35I with live GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions in the foreground., Israeli Air Force/Amit Agronov The IAF first inaugurated its second squadron of F-35s — the local name “Adir” means “Mighty One” in Hebrew — on Jan. 16, 2020. At the same time, the unit gave up its previous “Defenders of the South” name and received the revised title “Lions of the South,” together with appropriate new tail art. Founded in 1956, 116 Squadron initially flew P-51D Mustangs at Tel Nof and was originally known as the “Flying Wing” Squadron. The veteran Mustangs had already seen service with other IAF units, but were thrown into action in the Sinai Campaign the same year. When fighting commenced on October 29 of that year, the Mustangs were first to cross the border into Egypt, tasked with cutting telephone wires between Sinai and Cairo. This unique mission was undertaken using a weighted steel cable dangling from the P-51’s tail. Once the Mustangs’ cables became severed, the pilots resorted to using propellers and wings to finish the job. The Mustang soldiered on with the unit – the IAF’s last piston-engine fighter operator — until early 1961 when it switched to the jet-powered Mystère IV . While a monumental advance over the Mustang, these French-built fighters were also hand-me-downs from other units. The squadron was heavily involved in the June 1967 Six-Day War, its 269 operational sorties including 49 attacks on Arab air bases. Official IAF combat records confirm one Jordanian Hawker Hunter shot down by the unit and the loss of five Mystère IVs — three to ground fire, the other two possibly to enemy fighters. An Israeli Air Force P-51 Mustang, a type previously flown by 116 Squadron., Israeli Air Force The “Flying Wing” Squadron was the IAF’s last Mystère IV operator and took the type into combat again during the War of Attrition from 1967 to 1970. The jets flew 1,320 operational sorties — mainly attacking Egyptian ground targets — for the loss of three aircraft. By July 1971 the last Mystères had been withdrawn, being replaced by A-4E Skyhawks . When the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973, the squadron was in the process of converting from the A-4E to the more capable A-4N. Both variants flew 823 operational sorties during the campaign, most of them hazardous raids against Egyptian air defense sites. Five Skyhawks were lost in the process. The 1982 Lebanon War saw 116 Squadron fly yet more air-to-ground missions, this time without loss. Soon after, the unit became the first active squadron at Nevatim Air Base, where it arrived in 1983 before taking responsibility for the Operational Training Course two years later. The Skyhawks remained active in their training role until 2002 and in March 2003 the squadron received F-16A/B fighters, which were used in the same role as well as flying operational sorties in Gaza and Lebanon. Later known as “The Defenders of the South” Squadron, the F-16 unit was disbanded in 2015 before being reactivated as the second “Adir” formation. Israel plans to induct at least 50 F-35I models, broadly equivalent to the F-35A, but incorporating an increasing proportion of Israeli-made technology and weapons. On Dec. 12, 2016, Israel became the third country to receive its own F-35s on home soil — beaten by Italy by a few hours — as the first pair of fighters arrived at Nevatim. In early 2017 the IAF undertook its first night missions followed by in-flight refuelings with IAF Boeing 707 “Re’em” tankers and dropped munitions in training sorties as well as forward deploying to other IAF bases. During the first week of December 2017, and following a significant inspection, IAF commander General Amikam Norkin declared the initial operational capability for the “Adir”, making Israel the first F-35 export nation to do so. Israeli Air Force/Amit Agronov Significantly, during the first week of May 2018, IAF head General Norkin confirmed that “Adirs” had in fact deployed weapons twice in combat operations . With a second squadron of F-35Is now ready for battle, it’s likely only a matter of time before these aircraft, too, are committed to action in one of Israel’s military operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Iran Touts Buried “Missile Farms” Like Ones The United States Explored During The Cold War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s fake aircraft carrier – which appears to have sunk and could now a major shipping hazard – certainly captured the most interest during the country’s recent major exercises in and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz . However, the drills also featured what were apparently buried launchers for short-range ballistic missiles, which one top Iranian official referred to as “missile farm.” In principle, this concept could help reduce the vulnerability of these weapons to pre-emptive strikes while still keeping them in place and ready to launch. It is something the U.S. military actually explored during the end of the Cold War as a way to protect its then state-of-the-art LGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), but abandoned the idea for a host of reasons. Videos from the exercises, dubbed Great Prophet 14, which took place at the end of July 2020, show the launch of at least two separate missiles from buried launchers. Experts and observers noted that one of these appears to be a variant of the Fateh-110, one of Iran’s most prolific short-range ballistic missile families, which reportedly includes variants with radar-seeking anti-radiation seekers and anti-ship capabilities . Iranian officials say the latest missiles in this series have a maximum range of around 186 miles. The other could be a previously unknown type with a similar overall size, but the video quality is low and it could just be another Fateh-110 version. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dytSOhfg1UM There was also footage of a tubular containerized launcher firing a missile, possibly one of Iran’s more capable Dezful or Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles, from an above-ground position. This system could be intended to be used operationally after being buried, as well. Zulfiqar can reportedly hit targets out to almost 435 miles, while Dezful, a derivative of the former missile, is said to be able to reach targets up to just over 620 miles away. The footage Iran released of the tubular launcher is seen in the video below in a particular segment that starts at around 1:27 in the runtime. https://youtube.com/watch?v=JtRlelCKPKY “Underground ballistic missiles during Great Prophet-14 maneuvers,” Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard’s (IRGC) Aerospace Force, reportedly wrote in a Tweet on July 29, which seems to have been deleted. “The name and description of the missile is a secret. #missile-farm.” It’s worth noting that “missile farm” has been applied in the past, at least by outside observers , to Iran’s James Bond-esque underground facilities for the construction, maintenance, and launch of larger medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Also sometimes referred to as “missile cities,” these built into mountains and have apertures through which personnel can fire the missiles from safely within. You can read more about these facilities in this previous War Zone story . In principle, burying launchers in flatter terrain makes sense in many ways. For one, it helps protect the missiles in these areas, where there is much less natural above-ground cover. It also means that shorter-range weapons can be pre-positioned without having to move them to forward locations, and potentially expose them to attack or at the very least giving adversaries an early warning, during a crisis. The Great Prophet 14 exercises also featured short-range ballistic missiles on traditional truck-mounted launchers that would be more vulnerable to detection and then enemy strikes during an actual conflict, as well. Fateh-110 series short-range ballistic missiles on truck-mounted launchers., Government of Iran capture It would only take a relatively limited number of personnel to oversee large sections of any such “missile farm,” with command bunkers being located some distance away from the launch sites. At the same time, this would further increase the number of targets an opponent would have to locate and then engage to neutralize the threat. This concept would offer a much lower-cost method of achieving all this compared to traditional hardened silos, as well. The U.S. military actively considered and actually experimented with doing just this during the development of the MX ICBM, which eventually became the LGM-118A Peacekeeper , during the 1970s and 1980s. Multiple types of buried trenches, including concepts where manned or unmanned launch vehicles would move regularly through them to make it even harder for an opponent to target the missiles, were among the different MX basing options that the U.S. military considered. A graphical depiction and details of a trench basing concept for MX/LGM-118A that the U.S. military explored., Center for Defense Information Another trench-based concept., Center for Defense Information If the order ever came, the launchers would break through the top of the trenches to fire their missiles. The video below shows a test using a static launcher to gather data on how such a system would burst up from the ground. The U.S. military considered a number of other novel basing options for MX. In the end, the U.S. Air Force fielded the LGM-118As in traditional silos starting in 1986. Due to a variety of factors, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , the service retired those missiles completely in 2005. Many of the negative factors that led the U.S. military to decide against the trench options, as well as certain other alternative silo concepts, for Peacekeeper still apply for Iran 30 years later. Burying the launchers could make inspecting the weapons and servicing them difficult, raising the possibility that they might not function properly when they are needed. The launchers also still need to be close enough to the surface to be able to effectively fire the missiles, which might limit the amount of actual protection they offer. This was one of the reasons why the U.S. proposals involved mobile launchers in long inter-connected trenches to make it hard for an opponent to ever know for sure where the actual weapon was at any one time – much more significant infrastructure that could have easily been prohibitively expensive. Even in the 1980s, there were also concerns that sensor technology, or the seekers on incoming weapons themselves, would improve to the point where the buried missiles would still be vulnerable. Commercial space-based imaging satellites are known to be capable of detecting large buried objects and one would imagine that the U.S. government’s capabilities in this regard are even more advanced . It’s hard to see how Iran could bury a large number of missile launchers without that construction activity being visible to American spy satellites, as well. Depending on where Iran might position its “missile farms,” they could be within range of the ever-improving imaging capabilities of manned and unmanned aircraft , as well. The distributed nature of these fields of buried missiles could still present a complex targeting situation for an opponent who might struggle to neutralize multiple missile farms quickly in the opening phases of a conflict. At the same time, once any missiles are fired, the underground launch sites are fully exposed and there’s no possibility of rapidly relocating the launchers themselves, unlike mobile transporter-erector-launchers. They would certainly not be anywhere near as able to withstand counterstrikes the way the more robust mountain-side missile lairs can. All told, it remains to be seen how far Iran decides to pursue this concept or whether they ultimately decide to abandon the idea just like the U.S. military did when deciding how it would field the LGM-118A Peacekeeper.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China sent formations of Chengdu J-10 and Shenyang J-11 fighters into the Taiwan Strait earlier today. The aircraft crossed the median line that separates the highly sensitive channel for a brief period of time, according to local reports . The line acts as an unofficial airspace boundary between the mainland and the island. The flights came after the arrival of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in Taiwan on Sunday at the start of a nearly unprecedented high-level visit . The show of strength from Beijing occurred shortly before Azar met with Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the U.S. diplomat pledged “strong support and friendship” from Washington. The activity by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) fighters drew the following statement from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense. “PLAAF jets’ deliberate intrusion and destruction of the current situation in the Taiwan Strait have seriously undermined regional security and stability.” The J-10 and J-11 fighters briefly flew on Taiwan’s side of the narrow strait at approximately 9.00 am local time (01.00 GMT). The Chinese fighters were also tracked by Taiwan’s land-based anti-aircraft missiles, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said , before being “driven out” by Taiwan’s Air Force. We have yet to hear Beijing’s version of these events. A Chinese J-11B., Chinese Internet Azar’s arrival marks the highest-level U.S. official visit to Taiwan in four decades, and it comes amid deteriorating American relations with China. Beijing condemned the visit which comes as part of a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Taiwan under the Trump Administration. China also promised some sort of unspecified retaliation to Azar’s diplomatic mission. This incursion is the latest in a series of military displays from both Taipei and Beijing. Earlier this week, Taiwan launched F-16s armed with live AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles on patrols ahead of expected Chinese exercise drills in the South China Sea. The U.S. has also been engaged in high-tempo surveillance missions and exercises in the area, including operating alongside Australia and Japan, the details you can read more about here . The People’s Republic of China views Taiwan as a rogue province and both political and military tensions have increased significantly between the island and the mainland in recent years. The Trump administration’s trade war with China, its willingness to arm Taipei with advanced weaponry , among a number of other disputes, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in an even deeper chill in U.S.-China-Taiwan relations. This highly-significant diplomatic visit to Taiwan by a senior U.S. official has predictably raised Beijing’s ire even further and authorities on the island have mobilized their forces in kind. Taiwan’s Air Force no doubt remains on high alert to react to any hostile activities, especially throughout the duration of this high profile U.S.-Taiwan diplomatic engagement. We will update this post as more information comes available. Author’s note: Hat tip to Alert5.com for the early warning on this story.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 4, 2020",Night Stalker MH-47 Emerges With Mystery Modifications During Training In Colorado,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (160th SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers , have been sporadically executing some high-altitude training out of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (KBJC) over the last couple of months. These flights have mainly involved the unit’s highly modified MH-47 Chinooks , a type that is renowned for its high-altitude capabilities . Now, some of the aircraft used for these operations have emerged with a mystery alteration made up of arrays and boxes that line the upper mid-sections of their fuselages. Aviation Photographer Memphis Larson, who goes by the handle @121.700 on Instagram , has been watching the Chinooks come and go from the area in recent weeks and immediately noticed this new modification when it appeared on August 6th. Larson tells The War Zone: The three MH-47Gs from the 160th SOAR showed up first at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (KBJC) on June 11th, 2020, and then popped in and out for the next few weeks, once hauling a wooden crate. On August 3rd, they arrived once again along with two CH-47Fs from the 2nd Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, and they flew routine flights for a couple of days. On August 6th, they pulled one of the CH-47s (08177) off of the main ramp back into the hangars, and when seen taxiing out it had the black boxes attached to the sides. After a quick flight, they went back into the shelter of the hangars. The next day, one MH-47 took off and returned as they towed another MH-47 (03728) back next to 08177. Finally, on August 8th, all five took off again, and the modified Chinooks taxied out of the hangars onto a runway and left mixed with the three “normal” Chinooks. Memphis Larson It isn’t clear if the famed special operations unit is working with 2nd Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment or if they are borrowing some of the unit’s CH-47F helicopters for these operations. The 160th has borrowed helicopters for operations in the past, including in warzones overseas . These aircraft don’t feature most of the MH-47’s extensive self-protection , sensor, communications, and infrared suppression modifications, but a Chinook is a Chinook and the “Foxtrot” model is the newest variant available. It’s also worth noting that the MH-47s being used by the 160th SOAR for these drills do not have their big refueling probes mounted. Each mystery modification includes a dozen panel-like square arrays wired together with a rectangular box-like structure mounted at an angle at its center. Two of these installations are seen on the side of two Chinooks, one an MH-47 and the other a CH-47. They are mounted through the cabin on cross-beams, using the aircraft’s removable windows as an aperture. We have never seen a system like this on a Chinook and it isn’t clear if it is infrared countermeasures, navigation, communications, or electronic warfare related. Our best guess would be the latter, but clearly it is made to be installed on any Chinook with its modular format. This kind of electronic warfare system concept is not unheard of on special operations helicopters. Memphis Larson The 160th SOAR is known to frequent Colorado for training due to its high elevation that is similar to what crews could face overseas. Density altitude impacts helicopters significantly, especially those laden with commandos and their gear that have to make hard maneuvers into tight landing zones. So, the unit’s presence at KBJC isn’t a surprise, but what appears to be the testing of a new external modification is. https://www.instagram.com/p/CDkZOCbhwDt https://www.instagram.com/p/CBrtiqtB9YG https://www.instagram.com/p/CBWL6imBFx2 https://www.instagram.com/p/CBT8VibBGnU As for the tests or use of this previously unknown equipment, it isn’t like the Night Stalkers, which are notoriously shy, are trying to hide anything. They are flying with it in broad daylight at a public airport that they have been frequenting for weeks. We will update this post with new information as we get it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 5, 2021",Check Out This B-52 Stratofortress Carrying Two AGM-183 Hypersonic Test Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The age of hypersonic combat is fast approaching . Case in point, an Edwards Air Force Base test B-52H Stratofortress just carried out its last captive carry test flight for the service’s new AGM-183 Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). The next phase will be actual test launches of the extreme-speed, air defenses-busting , tactical boost-glide hypersonic missile system. The B-52 involved in the tests, 60-0050 “Dragon’s Inferno,” has been seen with increasingly elaborate modifications associated with the ARRW test program. These include a number of apertures for filming test launches, which are painted in customary day-glow orange that is a staple of the Air force’s flight test community. The aircraft has flown with a captive carry AGM-183 airframe on numerous occasions , but this is the first time we have seen the B-52 outfitted with a pair of the missiles, one of which appears to be more advanced than the previously seen test missile airframe and has a gray overall scheme. Air Force photo by Giancarlo Casem Air Force photo by Giancarlo Casem Air Force photo by Matt Williams Air Force photo by Matt Williams The mission saw the B-52 do laps with a chase F-16 over the barren desert north of Edwards AFB before breaking off and heading out over the vast range complexes off the Southern California Coast. Other captive carry test missions of new hypersonic missiles have not gone as smoothly in the past. During a similar mission for the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) , an air-breathing missile concept which has been shrouded in more secrecy than the boost-glide AGM-183, the missile fell off the B-52. Thankfully, nobody was hurt in the mishap, but it is a reminder that things can go seriously wrong even on a non-launch test mission of a new advanced missile capability. Regardless, during the ARRW’s final captive carry mission, which a number of aircraft trackers, including our photo contributor Matt Hartman , were watching closely via publically available aircraft tracking apps, the Air Force tested the missile’s ability to communicate telemetry and GPS data to ground stations on the sprawling Point Mugu Sea Range. It served as a dry run of sorts for a test of ARRW’s booster later this year. 60-0050’s track during the test flight., Matt Hartman Lt. Col. Michael Jungquist, 419th Flight Test Squadron Commander and Global Power Bomber Combined Test Force Director stated the following in an Air Force release : “The event this week demonstrated the ability to communicate with the prototype weapon; the entire team is excited to take the next step and begin energetic flight test of our first air-launched hypersonic weapons… These weapons will enable application of conventional firepower anywhere in the world at eye-watering speed.” Air Force photo by Giancarlo Casem Air Force photo by Giancarlo Casem Air Force photo by Giancarlo Casem The idea behind ARRW is to push an air-launched hypersonic weapon capability from concept to reality as fast as possible in order to keep up with what has become an all-out hypersonic weapons race primarily between the U.S., China , and Russia . The Air Force is set to initially buy eight AGM-183s , four for testing and four for spares, some of which are likely to turn into the force’s very first operational hypersonic weapons if they all are not needed for the test effort. It remains unclear what the range of ARRW will be or its top speed, but seeing as the system will benefit from being launched tens of thousands of feet in the air, with its ballistic missile-like booster getting it up to very high speed before releasing its glide vehicle payload, ranges well in excess of 1,000 miles have been discussed as have speeds that go far beyond the Mach 5 hypersonic threshold. Rendering of the AGM-183A as it is about to deploy its glide vehicle. , USAF While the ARRW program is moving ahead, costs have soared by nearly 40 percent. Still, the Air Force seems to see the AGM-183 as a must succeed initiative so that it can add a hypersonic weapon into its quiver as quickly as possible. Doing so would not only offer a breakthrough capability, but it would give other more advanced hypersonic weapon concepts time to mature. As it sits now, the Air Force could declare the AGM-183 operational by sometime in 2022 if everything goes as planned, and that is a very big if. Flight tests will prove just how mature this technology actually is. So, for better or worse, the Air Force and testers at Edwards AFB will learn relatively soon just how realistic their near-term hypersonic weapon dreams actually are.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 22, 2021",This Is The Most Stunning Photo Of A B-1B Bomber Night Launch We’ve Ever Seen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that the B-1B is quite an aesthetically pleasing flying machine, but it’s not until its quartet of F101-GE-102 turbofan engines, which pump out roughly 124,000 pounds of combined thrust, throttle up that the “Bone’s” true character becomes evident. Simply put, witnessing a night departure of a laden B-1B is an absolutely awe-inspiring experience. So much so, in fact, that I wrote an entire post about its trademark “Millenium Falcon” night departures in which its glowing engines remain in full reheat for miles downrange as the big swing-wing jet slowly builds speed and altitude. Seeing this spectacle in person, or even watching it in a video is one thing, capturing it in a still image is an entirely different proposition altogether. Aviation photographers from all over the world definitely try, but shooting white-hot afterburner plumes attached to something going at least a couple hundred miles an hour against a dark sky is photography hell. In other words, blurry, grainy images are the norm, not the exception. That wasn’t the case for one well-known aviation photographer, Kedar Karmarkar, someone I have known for well over a decade. He has captured what may be the ultimate Bone burner shot during his recent trip to Nellis Air Force Base to shoot the Red Flag 20-3 exercise that is underway now—you can read all about this iteration of the storied aerial wargames in this recent War Zone article. Amazingly, Kedar was able to stop the jet crisply as it roared overhead into the black night sky, its afterburners licking the air around its glowing tail. The image is an absolute showcase of photographic execution of the highest order. Above all else, it captures a “Millenium Falcon departure” unlike any video or even eyeball can. It is both elegant and ferocious at the same time—which is probably a good description of the B-1B, as well. Your instinct is to cover your ears while staring at the big bomber’s blue afterburner plumes frozen in time in the image. Kedar, who has an absolute passion for military aviation, shared a bit about how he got the killer photo with The War Zone: I had seen and ogled at all the pictures of the Bone with the burner from so many other photographers in recent years that I wanted a shot as well – I had gone for just a day during Red Flag 2020-01 that featured Bones from Ellsworth and since it was Friday there were no night ops so that means there was not a chance to get the picture at that time. Then I heard Bones are around for Red Flag 2020-03 and decided to head down there for a couple of days. I went out on Wednesday night thinking I might get a shot of the Bone with the burners and I was really thinking the dunes [a desolate expanse located north of Nellis Air Force Base] since the previous shot were from there – but then because of the gusty winds they changed the runway and it was a south flow. I camped at Cheyenne Avenue that evening and all the heavies went and then the fighters went and no sign of the Bone. I was disappointed. To add to the disappointment, I heard the next day that the Bones are broken and will not fly in the night launch. So I had absolutely no expectations when I went down there Thursday departures were still a south flow because of the winds. One by one the heavies departed and then a bunch of fighters departed lighting the night sky with their burners. Cheyanne Avenue is a rough part of Vegas, but it is a dream for aviation photographers when the winds are blowing from the south., Google Earth It was almost around 2130-ish and I decided to pack it in as things were getting slower but just decided to hang around for a few more minutes. Then suddenly I saw lights on runway 21R, which is not where the heavies take off, the heavies taking off from 21L, so again I had no clue what the lights were attached to. Then the lights started rolling and I could not make out what it was in the darkness. Then I heard the guy beside me watching through binoculars say ‘Oh its the B-1.” I was like “Holy shit it’s the B-1! I better not screw this up!” I saw the shape lift skywards, I could clearly see the four flamethrowers working overtime in the back of the Bone. Those were the most beautiful burner cans I have ever seen in my life. I was watching the Bone takeoff with burners at night for the first time ever, and what a sight and sound it was—WICKED!!! You could see the afterburners even quite a distance as the Bone had them on for quite some time. I was ecstatic. I returned back to the hotel and just transferred the image from the camera to the iPhone using SnapBridge and then using PsX went for a quick and dirty edit. And that is why my mantra is ‘be lucky than good.” I mean, of course, you need a certain level of proficiency in using the gear and what you do, but the rest is up to luck most of the time! The image was shot with a Nikon D850 with a 500mm f/4 lens. My settings were Auto ISO with an aperture of f/4. Bravo Kedar, you captured the firebreathing B-1B in all its glory as few have before. We have found a video of the exact departure Kedar photographed! The B-1B comes out of burner a little early, likely due to the noise abatement procedures for Nellis’ southern departure corridor.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Royal Air Force P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane conducted its first operational sortie earlier this week. The aircraft flew together with Typhoon fighter jets to shadow the Russia Navy’s missile-armed Project 22160 patrol ship Vasily Bykov as it sailed in the North Sea to the northwest of the United Kingdom. The mission occurred on Aug. 3, 2020, but was only publicly announced on Aug. 7. The P-8A in question was assigned to the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) No. 120 Squadron, the service’s lone Poseidon unit, which is presently operating out of the British Army’s Kinloss Barracks, a former RAF base in Scotland, while runway work is being done at their home base of RAF Lossiemouth. The RAF presently has two P-8As, also known by the British designation Poseidon MRA1, and another seven on order. “In an increasingly unstable world of persistent challenge and competition, it is important that the U.K. Armed Forces possess cutting edge technology to meet threats wherever they emerge,” Annabel Goldie, the U.K. Minister of State for Defense, said in a statement. ‘The sight of our new Poseidon aircraft, working in concert with the Royal Navy has showcased the UK’s readiness to defend its waters from any incursion.” “The RAF continues to evolve and develop as the Next Generation RAF becomes a reality. The Poseidon aircraft is a key part of that development and evidence of the hard work performed by all those involved,” RAF Air Vice Marshal Ian Duguid, head of No. 11 Group, added. “This mission by the Poseidon, to monitor Russian naval activity, shows how the RAF will now be able to contribute to Maritime Security alongside the Royal Navy and our NATO allies, to secure the seas and skies.” Crown Copyright Crown Copyright A closer look at the Project 22160 patrol ship Vasily Bykov as seen by the shadowing RAF aircraft., Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Between 2010 and 2011, the RAF retired all of its Hawker Siddeley Nimrods , including maritime patrol and intelligence gathering variants, without a direct replacement as part of budget cuts following a regular Strategic Defence and Security Review by the country’s Ministry of Defense. This also resulted in the retirement of the iconic Harrier Jump Jet from both RAF and Royal Navy service, something you can read about more in this recent War Zone feature . An RAF Nimrod MR2 maritime patrol plane., Dale Coleman via Wikimedia Since then, RAF Typhoons have been regularly employed to monitor foreign naval activity near the United Kingdom, as well as potential threats to the country’s airspace. The limitations of these aircraft in this role were clearly visible during this mission as they had break off to refuel, linking with RAF’s VIP-configured Voyager aircraft, which can still perform its duties as tanker-transport. Voyager is the RAF’s designation for the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). You can read more about this particular aircraft, seen below during the operation over the North Sea earlier this week, which was the source of some controversy recently over its new, high-visibility paint job, in this War Zone piece . Crown Copyright The introduction of the Poseidons, which the U.K. Ministry of Defense first ordered in 2016, means that once again the RAF has a more robust, dedicated maritime patrol capability. These aircraft can provide far more persistent surveillance then fast-moving, fuel-hungry fighters. The P-8A is also an anti-submarine warfare platform. The start of RAF Poseidon operations comes at a time when many of its fellow NATO members, especially the United States , have been warning about the potential dangers posed by a notable increase in Russian submarine activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Arctic region in recent years. Last month, NATO concluded its latest iteration of Exercise Dynamic Mongoose , an annual anti-submarine warfare drill in the North Atlantic. The U.K. armed forces participated, but the RAF did not send any P-8As. Two U.S. Navy Poseidons did take part in the exercise. In addition, the P-8A has significant intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities that the RAF will now be able to take advantage of operationally. It’s very possible, if not probable, that the service will be able to leverage at least some of the work the U.S. Navy is now doing to expand the aircraft’s arsenal , presently limited to air-dropped torpedoes and AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and other capabilities . Regardless, the P-8A already provides the RAF with a hugely capable maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare asset and is allowing the service to return to performing these mission sets regularly with a dedicated platform nearly a decade after the retirement of the Nimrods.

Joseph Trevithick and Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021","Stealth Is Put To The Test In Huge Exercise Teaming RQ-170s, F-35s, B-2s With Other Jets","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has revealed a major recent exercise involving a wide variety of different stealthy aircraft, including F-35A Joint Strike Fighters , F-22 Raptors , and a B-2A Spirit stealth bomber . Most notably, at least one RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone from the service’s top-secret 44th Reconnaissance Squadron, which The War Zone was first to report on in detail , also took part in the event. The exercise focused on stealthy penetration into denied areas, suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, and electronic attack tactics. The 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, part of the 53rd Wing at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, led the so-called Large Force Test Event (LFTE), which cost approximately $1.4 million to put on. The exercise ran from Aug. 4 to Aug. 6, 2020 and was part of efforts to develop solutions to a number of “Tactics Improvement Proposals,” or TIPs that the Air Force has identified as priority concerns. In addition to the stealthy platforms, Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets and U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft participated in the LFTE. The 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron, part of the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, provided the F-35As, F-22s, and F-15Es, while the B-2A came from the Group’s 72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron. The Navy’s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9) supplied the EA-18Gs. The Air Force’s 605th Test and Evaluation Squadron and the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC) were also involved. In addition, the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron sent at least one RQ-170, which is especially notable given that this appears to be the first official confirmation that this unit flies these flying-wing unmanned aircraft. The War Zone previously published a deep investigation into this unit, about which little is still known, which you can find here . An RQ-170 Sentinel at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam., USAF via FOIA This mix of aircraft offered a “unique combination of joint platforms maximized the development and evaluation of combat-relevant capabilities,” according to the Air Force’s official press release. “As a result of the LFTE, the Air Force was able to explore [a] unique integration of tactics, techniques, and procedures that have never been tested together in select capabilities.” According to the Air Force, the exercise was centered around exploring tactics, techniques, and procedures to address four main areas of interest, which are as follows: The use of fifth-generation stealth aircraft to conduct suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) in support of B-2A operations. Advanced low observable ingress tactics. Air Force non-stealthy fourth-generation aircraft working together with fifth-generation platforms for SEAD missions, including with other services and potentially with coalition partners. Effectiveness of electronic attack tactics, techniques, and procedures between fourth and fifth-generation aircraft. “This exercise is primarily focused on demonstrating LO [low observable; stealthy] platform effectiveness against advanced threats,” Air Force Major Theodore Ellis, Chief of 53rd Wing Weapons, said in a statement. “We do this by utilizing emerging technology and tactics to minimize weaknesses and capitalize on joint capabilities.” “Through events like these, we continue to improve our joint 4th and 5th generation tactics, which enhances our abilities in an advanced threat environment,” Major Ellis continued. The video below shows Air Force F-35As flying with Navy EA-18G Growlers during a past exercise. These were two of the types of aircraft involved in this recent LFTE at Nellis Air Force Base. It will only be increasingly important for the Air Force, as well as Navy and Marines, to train and train together on how to defeat or otherwise mitigate the threats from ever-improving adversary air defense systems and the sensor networks that support them . There are real risks even to high-end stealth platforms that require a layered approach, including kinetic and non-kinetic attacks , as well as other tactics to safely infiltrate an enemy’s air defense bubble. Simulations and limited experiments can help evaluate certain components of this overall ecosystem, but large-scale exercises are still invaluable to get a true sense of how all the pieces do or do not fit together and what adjustments and new developments might be necessary. “The investment and trust in our team allowed the 53 Wing to evaluate the interoperability of leading-edge capabilities and develop TTPs that will ultimately strengthen our nation’s air dominance,” Air Force Colonel Bill Creeden, the head of the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, said in a statement. It’s also worth noting that we don’t know exactly what role the RQ-170 was playing in this particular exercise. While there have been experiments in the past involving the drones conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions in direct support of other stealthy aircraft , there is the possibility that the unmanned aircraft, in this case, may have been flying a different role. A patch associated with the 732nd Operations Group, Detachment 1 , the immediate predecessor to the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron, features a lightning bolt, which is typically representative of electronic warfare, as well as three drops of blood, which could be a reference to a kinetic attack mission. It also featured the phrase “forging the sword,” which might reflect a mission to help develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures, some of which may be related to the employment of stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles . This would largely fit with the publicly stated objectives of this particular exercise. Flightlineinsignia.com We will hopefully begin to learn more about the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron and its activities, as well as the other extremely important work that the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group is conducting into bleeding-edge aerial combat tactics, techniques, and procedures that center of making the most of America’s leading-edge stealth and electronic warfare capabilities, and more.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2020",Air Force Eyes Hypersonic VIP Passenger Aircraft In New Deal With Aviation Startup,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has awarded the Hermeus Corporation a contract to support its work on a hypersonic aircraft powered by an advanced combined-cycle jet engine . The service says that the deal could be a stepping stone to fielding a high-speed plane for VIP transport and other missions in the future. Hermeus announced that it had secured the contract on Aug. 6, 2020, through AFWERX , a technology incubator the U.S. Air Force stood up in 2017. The deal is worth approximately $1.5 million and will focus on exploring design concepts for a business jet-sized hypersonic executive transport aircraft capable of seating between nine and 19 passengers, Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and friend of The War Zone , added in a Tweet. “Early integration of unique Air Force requirements for high-speed mobility and evaluation of interfaces between high-speed aircraft and existing communications, airport, and air traffic control infrastructure lays the groundwork for a seamless transition to service,” Hermeus’ press release said.  “Additionally, Hermeus will prepare test plans to reduce technical risk associated with these modifications to support Air Force requirements.” The Atlanta-based aviation startup will be working on this with the Air Force’s Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate , which is part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. This office is most notably responsible for managing the fleet of two Boeing 747-based VC-25A Air Force One aircraft and supporting the acquisition of two newer replacement VC-25B jets , which are also modified Jumbo Jets. It also oversees the 757-based C-32A Air Force Two fleet, as well as the service’s 737-based C-40 Clippers and various other business jet and turboprop passenger transport types. The Air Force seems interested in exploring a hypersonic analog to the executive business jets it operates, such as the Gulfstream V-based C-37A seen here, in its new contract with Hermeus., USAF “Leaps in capability are vital as we work to complicate the calculus of our adversaries,” Air Force Brigadier General Ryan Britton, the Program Executive Officer for Presidential and Executive Airlift, said in a statement. “By leveraging commercial investment to drive new technologies into the Air Force, we are able to maximize our payback on Department of Defense investments.” Hermeus, which was founded in 2018 , has been focused on the development of a hypersonic passenger jet primarily for the commercial market. At the core of its design is a combined-cycle jet engine, which it first tested in February. Combined cycle engines blend together the capabilities of traditional jet turbines and ramjets or scramjets, the latter of which can only reliably function at high speeds. Typically, ramjet or scramjet-powered hypersonic vehicles have used rocket boosters to get to them to the desired speed initially. “Using our pre-cooler technology, we’ve taken an off-the-shelf gas turbine engine and operated it at flight speed conditions faster than the famed SR-71 ,” Glenn Case, Hermeus’ Chief Technology Officer, said in a statement. “In addition, we’ve pushed the ramjet mode to Mach 4-5 conditions, demonstrating full-range hypersonic air-breathing propulsion capability.” Hermeus’ combined-cycle jet engine prototype., Hermeus The engine running during a test in February 2020., Hermeus In principle, a combined cycle engine would allow an aircraft to take off like any other jet using existing runways, then accelerate to hypersonic speed during the middle portion of its flight, and then land on the other end, again without the need for any specialized infrastructure. For slower portions of flight, it would use its standard jet engines before switching over to a ramjet system. This is the same concept behind Lockheed’s ‘SR-72’ Blackbird successor that is currently in development. Being able to operate hypersonic aircraft from existing airports would have immense benefits for commercial airlines and charters services. A design capable of lower-speed operation could also help assuage concerns about disruptions to civilian communities along flight routes, which have historically impeded the growth of supersonic commercial air travel. “At Mach 5 – over 3000 miles per hour – flight times from New York to London will be 90 minutes rather than 7 hours,” Hermeus’ press release on its Air Force contract declared. “High-speed aircraft offer disruptive differentiation where the main metric is speed, rather than plush seats, which has historically resulted in economic expansion. Mach 5 aircraft have the potential to create an additional two trillion dollars of global economic growth per year, unlocking significant resources that can be utilized to solve the world’s great problems.” Earlier art that Hermeus released of its hypersonic aircraft concept., Hermeus All of this also applies to military applications, something The War Zone has explored broadly in the past. VIP airlift has long been one obvious role for a high-speed business jet-sized aircraft, which would enable senior officials to crisscross the globe faster and more efficiently, as well as travel longer distances on shorter notice. A hypersonic aircraft in this size class, or even just supersonic one, could be valuable for performing other mission sets, including tactical ones , such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare , and even long-range strike. A combined-cycle engine could enable a version of Hermeus’ design configured for aerial refueling to link with existing tankers, further extending its range capabilities for whatever jobs it might be tasked with. Of course, the Air Force is still very early on in its work with Hermeus and it’s not clear when that cooperation might yield an actual aircraft of any kind, if it does at all. A contract for less than $2 million is extremely small when it comes to advanced aircraft development. Still, the service has made clear that it hopes to at least leverage the technology the company is working on for future high-speed designs, including for the VIP transport role. “The Presidential and Executive Airlift Directorate is proud to support Hermeus in making this game-changing capability a reality as we look to recapitalize the fleet in the future,” Air Force Brigadier General Britton said in his statement about the new contract. It will certainly be interesting and exciting to see what Hermeus develops now as part of its new deal with the Air Force.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 17, 2020",Stripped F-117 Nighthawk Arrives At Hill Aerospace Museum Direct From Tonopah,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the U.S. Air Force still has some F-117A Nighthawks actively involved in flying operations , others are being removed from storage and transported for display at a select number of museums. This stripped-down F-117A was delivered to the Hill Aerospace Museum at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, yesterday. The fuselage of the aircraft arrived by truck, direct from Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) in Nevada. Staff from Hill AFB, which is adjacent to the museum, assisted in moving it from the truck and into the museum. The aircraft arrived having been stripped of its trademark black Radar Absorbent Material (RAM). The demilitarization process for the Nighthawk is extremely complex, and it is detailed in this previous War Zone feature . The USAF has established a special facility to assist in the demilitarization of the F-117s at Tonopah. Although the F-117s were officially retired over a decade ago, some remain flying under intriguing circumstances . The War Zone has exclusively detailed how the USAF’s plans to slowly dispose of the roughly 50 remaining aircraft at a rate of around four per year. Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum The museum staff at Hill AFB will now re-attach aircraft 82-0799’s wings, rear stabilizers, and other parts of the aircraft before it is repainted and put on display at the museum’s Lindquist Stewart Gallery. Some of these parts will be totally fabricated to look like the real thing as their structures are still highly classified and they cannot be kept within reach of the public. This particular aircraft flew some 21 missions during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. The airframe appeared to have been delivered without its wings or tails and in an uncovered state, which is different than how we have seen F-117s transported in the past. This aircraft could be the same one the Department of Defense listed on its internal surplus exchange last March. Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Hill Aerospace Museum Another F-117 is shortly due to go on display at the Palm Springs Air Museum for its new Houston Pavilion, along with The Air Zoo Aerospace and Science Museum, in Michigan, which says it will be the first non-government museum to exhibit the aircraft. The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, in Dayton Ohio, is due to receive an F-117A to complement YF-117A serial 79-10781 that is currently on display. F-117A serial 82-0803 is now loaned to the Reagan Presidential Foundation and on display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California. This particular Nighthawk was actually demilitarized at the Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, California, rather than at Tonopah. The preparation of the aircraft for display can be seen here . The USAF has earmarked a dozen F-117s for loan to museums for public display. With the exception of the remains of Vega 31 in Serbia , the few other Nighthawks currently on display are pre-production YF-117s. All told, the USAF looks to be moving fast to place the 12 F-117s set aside for display around the country, while a handful of others remain active flying missions from TTR. The rest of the airframes still being stored at the remote airbase are set to slowly be destroyed over the coming decade.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",New Intel Indicates Russia May Have Sent S-300 Or S-400 Surface To Air Missiles To Libya,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Imagery appearing on social media channels seems to show the deployment of a Russian-made surface-to-air missile system — from either the S-300 or S-400 family — deployed near Ras Lanuf on the Libyan coast. The oil port is controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar . Should the presence of these weapons be confirmed, it would mark a new significant escalation in Libya’s civil war and in the involvement of foreign powers backing either side in the conflict. Unconfirmed media reports last month suggested the LNA had deployed the S-300 along the eastern border with Egypt. The veracity of these reports is unclear as Ras Lanuf is nowhere near the border with Egypt. However, the reported appearance of the air defense system in Libya does follow a flight by a Russian Aerospace Forces An-124 strategic airlifter into Libya’s Al Khadim Air Base on Aug. 3. The transport flew in from Mozdok Air Base in Russia’s Caucasus region, making what is thought to be the type’s first appearance in Libya since Moscow’s stepped up its involvement in the ongoing civil war in support of Haftar’s LNA forces. Before its stopover at Mozdok, the An-124 had departed from Vnukovo in Moscow. The An-124 is typically used to transport bulky equipment, which could include S-300 and S-400 systems and their supporting elements. Il-76 transports — operated both by the Russian military and by contractors — that have been making regular runs to Libya aren’t big enough to handle the larger components of either of the S-300 or S-400. It’s notable that when Turkey received its initial S-400s, Russia delivered components in both An-124s and Il-76s, as The War Zone described here . Components from the S-400 system are unloaded from an An-124 at Murted Air Base in Turkey, July 2019., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE Haftar’s LNA — based in the eastern city of Tobruk — has received support from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, among others. The U.S. government also assesses that Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group are operating in Libya on behalf of Haftar’s forces. Wagner has connections with Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, also known by the Russian acronym GRU. The LNA’s chief opponent is the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli, the country’s internationally recognized capital. Its primary international backer is presently Turkey. While the photos of the purported SAM site reveal little in the way of detail, it’s been suggested they depict a truck-mounted 96L6 or 96L6E target acquisition radar, which NATO refers to as Cheese Board, together with a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) associated with an S-300 or S-400-series SAM system. The S-400 seems a less likely proposition since it’s probable that Moscow would be less willing to commit such an advanced system to the Libyan theater. If the equipment at Ras Lanuf is as it seems, it marks another significant development in the conflict. Presuming the site is indeed an S-300 or S-400 battery, and if it was provided by Russia, it would demonstrate Moscow’s expanding efforts to enhance the LNA’s air power and air defenses, following the previous deployment of MiG-29 and Su-24 warplanes, as reported by The War Zone. Beginning in May, Russia supplied Libya with at least 14 combat jets and both sides in the conflict have been expanding their air and air defense capabilities. However, the precise capabilities of the alleged air defense system depend heavily on which sub-variant of S-300 or S-400 is involved, and the various missile subtypes, as well as to what degree the battery is integrated within a unified air defense network. The operational utility would also be determined by the level of situational awareness that’s available to their operators. The LNA’s Pantsir-S1 short-range air defense system — Russian-made, and supplied by the U.A.E. — has proven notably vulnerable to Turkish attack, especially by armed Bayraktar TB2 drones, although the precise reasons for this have been subjected to ongoing debate . Transporter-erector-launchers associated with the S-300 in their deployed configuration., ULIANA SOLOVYOVA/SPUTNIK VIA AP While the S-300 — and even the more capable S-400 — might seem like overkill against the GNA’s limited aerial capabilities, even the TB2s, they could potentially serve as a deterrent to a wider Turkish intervention. A similar tactic was pursued by Russia in Syria, where an initial deployment of Russian-operated SAMs was followed by transfer of S-300s to the Assad regime. Those defenses, plus the introduction of Russian airpower , have played a fairly important role in maintaining Assad’s grip on power. In this previous feature, we examined how a similar approach might play out in Libya. According to the assessment of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), Russia is continuing to position military equipment in Libya capable of conducting “kinetic operations” in the country. “Russia continues to play an unhelpful role in Libya by delivering supplies and equipment to the Wagner Group,” said U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Bradford Gering, AFRICOM director of operations. “Imagery continues to unmask their consistent denials.” The War Zone will continue to update this story as we wait for more substantial imagery to appear. In the meantime, it remains clear that Russia is continuing to establish a strategic foothold in Libya and that it’s also willing to commit increasingly capable systems to this conflict.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Sep 22, 2020",Taiwanese F-16s Begin Flying Patrols With Live Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles To Deter China,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two Taiwanese F-16A Vipers have flown air patrol missions armed with live AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles . Taiwan’s Liberty Times said the missions were launched amid fears of imminent Chinese military exercises that are expected to be designed to simulate capture of the Taiwan-administered Dongsha Islands, in the northern area of the South China Sea. The Taiwanese Air Force, also known as the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF), launched two F-16s from the 5th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) based at Hualien Air Force Base, both of which carried a pair of the anti-ship missiles. Aviation reporter Roy Choo, who goes by the Twitter handle of @RXRoy, posted the Viper photos and provided brief details of the mission. “The 5th TFW F-16s at Hualien are usually tasked with anti-shipping missions with the Harpoons while the F-16s from the 4th TFW at Chiayi Air Force Base are usually seen employing AGM-65 Maverick missiles for anti-surface roles,” Choo told The War Zone . The pairing of F-16 and AGM-84 Harpoon is a key element in Taiwan’s ability to defend important strategic waterways and territorial claims against a maritime opponent. The ROCAF operates a mix of older Harpoons plus the newer Block II AGM-84L s. You can read more about Taiwan’s AGM-84s here and about the missile in general in this past War Zone piece . Here are the photos of the F-16s carrying the missiles on patrol: The Hualien unit is also tasked with reconnaissance patrols when Chinese vessels transit the Taiwan Strait. RF-16s assigned to the 12th Tactical Reconnaissance Group are equipped with the Phoenix Eye photo-reconnaissance pod, which is based on the AN/VDS-5 pod . The ROCAF is seeking to upgrade its F-16 reconnaissance capabilities through the procurement of UTC Aerospace Systems MS-110 long-range oblique photography pods. Until recently, Taiwanese F-16s carrying live AGM-84s had been a very rare occurrence. Aside from live-fire drills, ROCAF Vipers have only been observed flying with live Harpoons when the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) aircraft carrier Liaoning transited the Taiwan Strait in 2016/2017. It is thought that the forthcoming Chinese exercises could include both PLAN aircraft carriers . During road-runway flying training exercises in recent years, ROCAF F-16s have been seen armed with inert AGM-84 training rounds. On July 29, 2019, drills in the Taiwan Strait also included a pair of F-16s armed with live Harpoons simulating an attack on a high-value maritime target off Taiwan’s southeast coast. The Liberty Times said that two decommissioned ships were used as targets. Two F-16s simultaneously launched Harpoon missiles. This was reported as being the first time since 2001 that the ROCAF had live-fire tested aerial-launched AGM-84 Harpoon missiles. This most recent instance of Taiwanese Vipers flying with live Harpoons can be seen as a clear sign of the determination of the island’s government to defend its territory. The U.S. Marine Corps recently flew similar missions with live Harpoons that also appeared to be a signal to Beijing, the details of which you can read in this previous report by The War Zone . As far back as May, there have been reports that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was preparing for landing drills near Hainan Island in August to simulate the capture of Pratas Island, which is located in the Dongsha Islands group. Primary concerns hinge upon China’s strategic ambitions to seize territory in this strategically important location as this archipelago is located close to routes from Chinese naval bases on Hainan Island to the open Pacific. In addition, Taiwan’s F-16A/B Block 20 aircraft are currently undergoing a long-awaited $5.3-billion upgrade. Taiwan’s Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) has partnered with Lockheed Martin’s for the work at its new facility in Taichung. Taiwan was the launch customer for the F-16V upgrade, known locally as the Phoenix Rising program. A total of 140 F-16A/Bs are being modernized locally under serial upgrades between 2018 and 2022 , with initial deliveries being made to the 4th TFW at Chiayi. The upgraded aircraft feature the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and a host of other improvements . Taiwan has also purchased 66 additional Block 70 F-16s after protracted plans were finally approved by the Trump administration in August last year. The new F-16s will replace the Taiwanese Air Force’s F-5E/Fs currently stationed at Chihhang AFB in Taitung. A live AGM-84D Harpoon being loaded onto an F/A-18., USMC/Sgt Akeel Austin Taiwan has stated that it also wants to procure land-based Harpoons to counter China’s growing naval might, the details of which you can read here . It is not clear which versions of AGM-84 Taiwan is looking to procure to boost it’s coastal defenses, however, reports suggest Taiwan may be looing to procure the Block II version of the missile , though this is not confirmed. Taiwan has requested to buy Lockheed Martin F-35s , with no guarantee this will be sanctioned by Washington at any time soon. The stealth fighter would open up a whole new set of capabilities for the ROCAF. In the meantime, it’s the Harpoon-toting F-16s that form a key component of Taiwan’s ability to fend-off potential Chinese territorial advances. If a war between the two countries were to break out, these weapons would be absolutely essential in providing Taiwan with any hope of slowing an all-out advance by the People’s Liberation Army Navy. As such, the patrol of F-16s armed with live Harpoons isn’t just a show of force, it will likely increasingly become an increasing necessity deterrent as tensions between Taipei and Beijing continue to increase.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 16, 2020",Russian MiG-29 And Su-24 Combat Jets Caught In-Flight At Libyan Base In New Satellite Images,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New imagery has caught MiG-29 Fulcrums and Su-24 Fencers in the air at Al Jufrah Air Base in Libya. This, along with other details seen in the images, highlight the increasing activity at the base since Russia sent at least 14 combat jets, in total, to the North African country last month to support Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar. It also underscores that the jets themselves are now actively flying . U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) released two new images of Al Jufrah, which it said were taken on June 18, 2020, one of which showed an Su-24 Fencer taking off from the base. The other one showed a MiG-29 parked in front of a hardened aircraft shelter, as well as P-18 Spoon Rest radar. The P-18 is a long-range surveillance radar that can be used for early warning and to provide general increased situational awareness and air traffic control. AFRICOM AFRICOM “Russia’s sustained involvement in Libya increases the violence and delays a political solution,” U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General Bradford Gering, the director of operations at AFRICOM, said in a press release accompanying the images. “Russia continues to push for a strategic foothold on NATO’s southern flank and this is at the expense of innocent Libyan lives.” On June 17, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, released its own analysis of activities at Al Jufrah based on satellite imagery it had obtained from Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies. This includes one shot from Maxar, dated June 8, showing a MiG-29 in flight over the base. An Su-24 taxing at the base is also seen in that imagery, as well as the arrival of additional personnel in recent weeks. Images dated May 28 also appear to show the presence of a portion of a battery of 130mm howitzers and Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile systems. None of these weapons seemed to be in a deployed state to protect the base, however. Pictures and videos that appeared on social media earlier in May reportedly showed forces aligned with Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), including private military contractors (PMC) with strong ties, if not direct links , to Russia’s intelligence services, fleeing northwestern Libya toward the broader Al Jufrah region. The convoys seen in those photos and video clips contained at least one United Arab Emirates-supplied Pantsir-S1. LNA forces have lost significant ground in recent months to groups aligned with the United Nations-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), which is now receiving extensive support from Turkey. Turkish Bayraktar TB2 armed drones have been a particularly important factor in the GNA’s recent routs of the LNA. The LNA has its own foreign backers, including Russia, the UAE, and Egypt. The GNA is now primarily focused on re-capturing the strategic central coastal city of Sirte from the LNA. Pictures emerged on social media purportedly showing one of the Russian MiG-29s flying near there last week. “A MiG-29 was also photographed operating in the vicinity of the city of Sirte, Libya,” AFRICOM’s statement noted, indicating that these images were indeed legitimate. “There is concern these Russian aircraft are being flown by inexperienced, non-state PMC mercenaries who will not adhere to international law; namely, they are not bound by the traditional laws of armed conflict,” Brigadier General Gering also said in the press release. “If this is true and bombing occurs, innocent Libyan lives are at risk.” Both sides in Libya’s civil war have employed mercenaries, especially to operate more advanced systems, including combat aircraft. LNA forces captured an American Air Force veteran after the Mirage F-1 fighter jet he was flying on behalf of the GNA crashed last year. Regardless of the skill of the pilots flying the Russian jets, there is clearly a concern that the increased use of these combat aircraft in Libya’s civil war could trigger further escalations. On June 11, 17 Turkish military aircraft, including F-16 Viper fighter jets , KC-135R tankers , Peace Eagle airborne early warning and control planes, and other types, together with eight Turkish Navy frigates , conducted a major air-and-sea exercise in the Mediterranean Sea, including off the coast of Libya. This was seen as a demonstration of the Turkish government’s willingness to intervene more directly in the Libyan conflict. On June 15, Reuters reported that Turkey was considering establishing formal bases in the North African country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan signed a deal last year with GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj last year that included, among other things, provisions for sending Turkish forces to Libya. So far, at least publicly, conventional Turkish military deployments have been largely limited to advisory and other support tasks, such as explosive ordnance disposal work, as seen below. Turkey is also conducting special operations type activities and providing assistance in the operation of the TB2 drones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EhDStqKsXPA The GNA has indicated that it could halt its advances after retaking Sirte, but also appears to have a goal of recapturing more territory in southern Libya, as well. Russia clearly sent the MiG-29s and Su-24s to Libya to reinforce Haftar and now they look set to be an important addition to prevent the LNA from losing any more ground. However, as these combat jets see more use, the risk of Turkey further increasing its own involvement in the conflict will only grow. Any large conventional Turkish military intervention could completely change the character of Libya’s civil war. All told, it very much remains to be seen how extensively the LNA will employ the Russian aircraft in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery and other aerial footage of the Port of Beirut, as well as other areas of the Lebanese capital, are steadily emerging showing devastating damage from an explosion there yesterday. Authorities have said that the significantly larger second blast was the result of the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of pelletized ammonium nitrate in a warehouse on one of the docks, which was triggered by other explosive material at the site, possibly including fireworks. The incident, the exact timeline and cause of which remains under investigation, occurred on Aug. 4, 2020. Video from the incident shows a fire at the warehouse in question that leads to a smaller initial explosion. Something, which might be fireworks, is seen cooking off afterward, shortly before the absolutely massive secondary explosion that also created a gigantic shockwave and towering red cloud. Lebanese authorities say that at least 135 people died and 5,000 more were injured in the disaster. You can see more dramatic footage of explosions and otherwise get up to speed on this incident in The War Zone ‘s initial coverage here . Satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs shows that detonation left a crater in the dock where the warehouse once stood that is nearly 500 feet wide and is now full of water. The explosions also occurred right next to a set of grain elevators that held approximately 85 percent of the country’s grain stockpile. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The grain elevators sustained heavy damage and the remaining grain is now inedible, with reports that Lebanon may have only around six weeks worth left in other stocks elsewhere in the country based on average demand. The country is already seeing significant food shortages as a result of a protracted economic crisis that has been exacerbated by political upheaval and the COVID-19 pandemic. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wG6820aJy10 The cruise ship Orient Queen , which was moored on a dock opposite from where that building was at the time of the explosion, is now seen sunk in the shallow water. Two crew members reportedly died in the incident. Other ships in the port, including one belonging to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), were damaged and their crews injured. https://youtube.com/watch?v=v3KZTae-OPc The Port of Beirut is effectively out of commission following the blasts and commercial ships are already being rerouted to the port in the city of Tripoli to the north. However, its unclear how readily those facilities will be able to accommodate the increased traffic. Severe damage to structures on land is readily visible in the satellite imagery more than a mile in all directions from the epicenter of the blasts. Various levels of damage extend well beyond that with reports that the secondary, which drew comparisons to the Halifax disaster in Canada in 1917 and other large industrial accidents, rattled windows on the island of Cyprus 100 miles west in the Mediterranean Sea. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pyYcOQVlJaY At least two hospitals were hit , as was Lebanon’s presidential palace and the country’s parliament building, among many others. There have been widespread power outages and some 300,000 people are now reportedly homeless. There is never a good time for a disaster of this magnitude, but it has the potential to especially severe first and second-order impacts on Lebanon, which some, including senior government officials , have already warned is on the verge of becoming a failed state. In addition to the immediate rescue and recovery efforts, the aforementioned looming grain shortage and the loss of the country’s main port facility could be devastating in their own right. An airbridge is already forming with various countries sending aid and emergency personnel, or are planning to do so. This could become vital in the weeks and months ahead. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Hassan Diab has already declared today to be a day or mourning and promised to hold anyone responsible for the explosions to account. The massive amount of ammonium nitrate in the warehouse has been seen as some of a metaphor for the dysfunction of the Lebanese government. The highly explosive material sat there unsecured for more than six years after being seized by customs officials from a ship in late 2013. A member of that vessel’s crew had reportedly described it as a “ floating bomb .” Beirut Customs chief Badri Daher has said he alone made six separate requests over the years to move it to safer storage somewhere else. An official document reportedly warned just six months ago that if something wasn’t done soon there was a risk that it could “ blow up all of Beirut .” For a country with a sad history of terrorism, as well as being embroiled in internal and external conflicts , it’s certainly hard to understand how this dangerous material could have been left to rot for so long. Lebanese authorities say they have placed a number of officials who worked at the Port of Beirut since 2014 under house arrest as part of the ongoing investigation. In the meantime, work continues to clear the debris and search for survivors. We will continue to update this post as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 5, 2020",Gigantic Explosion And Shockwave Rip Through Beirut’s Port (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but a gigantic explosion has rocked the area in the vicinity of the Port of Beirut, which is very close to the center of the city. Initial reports indicate that a ship carrying fireworks caught fire and exploded. Videos and pictures on social media from the scene show an initial explosion, with a big ball of smoke, which is then followed by a much larger secondary explosion resulting in a huge fireball and shockwave. Video footage and images available show significant damage, even well away from ground zero, with windows and glass doors shattered in various areas of the city. Injuries have already been reported. Other videos of the secondary explosion show a building right next to the epicenter that appears to suffer a direct hit from the blast. One video definitely shows what could be fireworks cooking off. Lebanon is currently in the grips of major political and economic crises, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country is also home to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group, which may have been involved in a recently thwarted terrorist attack in the disputed Golan Height region between Israel and Syria. Even though there is never a good time for a disaster like this, now is particularly bad. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 12:40 PM EST— Video and pictures are now emerging of the aftermath of the explosion, which looks to have been absolutely devastating. Some sort of conflagration in a warehouse on the dock itself may also have been the epicenter of at least one of the blasts. There are reports now of hundreds of casualties and that the Lebanese military is assisting in the response efforts. Power outages are also being reported as a result of the explosions. Update: 1:20 PM EST— There are now reports that a burning container of fireworks then set off the huge secondary explosion at the nearby warehouse, which contained nitrate. It’s unclear whether the fireworks-filled container was actually on a ship or was on the dock. The head of Lebanon’s Beirut Governorate, which includes the capital city of the same name, has also described the incident as a “national disaster akin to Hiroshima,” referring to the U.S. nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. Update: 1:40 PM EST— Major General Abbas Ibrahim, head of Lebanon’s General Directorate of General Security, reportedly said in a televised interview that the container that was the source of the initial fire and explosion contained confiscated “high explosive materials” and that it would be “naive to describe such an explosion as due to fireworks.” Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab has also declared that tomorrow will be a national day of mourning in the country. The total number of casualties remains unknown, but there are reports that at least 10 firefighters are missing. Imagery of the aftermath continues to emerge showing the shocking damage. Update: 2:30 PM EST— There are reports that the blast in Beirut was so strong that people on the island of Cyprus, some 240 kilometers (nearly 150 miles) northwest in the Mediterranean Sea, felt it. Update: 3:00 PM EST— Lebanese authorities have begun to release casualties figures from this tragic incident, with a reported 30 people dead and some 2,500 more wounded. Offers of support are beginning to flow in from around the world, with Israel and Iran, among others, already pledging assistance. Update: 4:30 PM EST— Videos continue to emerge on social media showing the aftermath of this incident, which is truly catastrophic. The numbers of those killed and wounded have also increased, with these explosion now having left at least 50 people dead and around 3,000 injured. Update: 7:05 PM EST— Lebanon’s Prime Minister Hassan Diab has now said that 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, which was confiscated six years ago and had been left in an unsecured warehouse ever since was responsible for the secondary explosion that has caused untold destruction. He has vowed to punish whoever is responsible for creating this situation, which was clearly a massive accident waiting to happen. There are also reports that the smoke from the explosion and associated fires is toxic and the U.S. Embassy in Beirut has advised any American citizens in who are in that part of the city to “stay indoors and wear masks if available .” You can follow our continuing coverage of this incident here .

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 11, 2020",China’s Big New Amphibious Assault Ship Just Went To Sea For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first of China’s big-deck amphibious assault ships has begun sea trials. Photos and video of the lead vessel in the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 075 class emerged earlier today when the still-unnamed warship departed the pier at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai. The ship’s first sailing follows a period of remarkably rapid construction and a serious fire that occurred in port in April. At the time, it was unclear how much damage had resulted from the blaze, which seemed to have emanated from, or at least involved, the well deck of the big-deck amphibious assault ship, also referred to as a landing helicopter dock (LHD). Whatever damage was sustained now seems to have been fixed, although smoke stains were still visible as the warship went to sea today. Furthermore, some photos purportedly showing the trials suggest the flight deck is still incomplete. “The presumed maiden voyage will likely test the amphibious assault ship’s main systems, including propulsion, navigation and communication,” local media reported . Quoting unnamed military analysts, The Global Times added that it expected the first Type 075 to be commissioned into PLAN service within “a year or two.” The speed with which the vessel was completed was already impressive. Development began in 2011 and images began to emerge online of the first ship’s keel under construction between April and May 2019, though it is unclear when the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) formally began work on it. The first of the Type 075 class was then launched on Sept. 25, 2019, and left drydock within 24 hours of the launch ceremony. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation launched a second example of the Type 075 in April , and a third has been ordered. The rapid construction of China’s first LHD makes an interesting contrast with the U.S. Navy’s second America- class amphibious assault ship USS Tripoli , which was launched three years after its keel was laid. It’s unclear exactly how big the Chinese LHD is. While early reports suggested it would displace “more than” 30,000 tons, this has since been revised to a figure between 35,000 and 40,000 tons. Whatever the case, the Type 075 is significantly larger than both the Australian Canberra class (27,500 tons) and the South Korea Dokdo class (18,800 tons). Such a figure puts it closer to the size of the U.S. Navy’s Wasp -class amphibious assault ships. As a platform for maritime rotary lift, the Type 075’s hangar deck is expected to accommodate between 28 and 30 helicopters. Currently, the Z-8 family and the smaller Z-9 are the primary PLAN rotorcraft, but they are likely to be joined by the derivatives of the Z-20 in the future. Beyond manned aircraft, it seems China may also have plans to operate a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from the Type 075. An apparent mockup of just such an aircraft appeared on the deck of the first Type 075 in July, alongside a model of a Z-8J helicopter , indicating some kind of warship compatibility trials. Analysis has suggested the VTOL drone is around 30 feet long, making it slightly smaller than a Z-9 helicopter. Exactly how such a UAV may fit into PLAN amphibious warfare doctrine is unclear, but it will most likely operate in a similar manner as the U.S. Navy’s MQ-8C Fire Scout helicopter drone. Previously, The War Zone took a look at how the Type 075 fits into the PLAN’s wider modernization and expansion , as well as across the PLA as a whole — you can read about that here . Beyond the Type 075, it is rumored that China has ambitions to field an even more capable amphibious assault ship. Last month it was reported that a so-called Type 076 was in planning as a follow-on design of around 40,000 tons. This is allegedly a “mini aircraft carrier” with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system , implying a fixed-wing capability from the outset. While China doesn’t currently possess a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) type, this is a doctrine that’s apparently now under study, but it is more likely that this catapult would support lighter drones. The new notional vessel — which has yet to been officially approved by Beijing — would also operate up to 30 helicopters plus UAVs. In the meantime, the Type 075 looks set to radically overhaul the PLAN’s expanding amphibious capabilities. The new warships could potentially project Chinese power throughout the Asia-Pacific region, a capability that has particular relevance to the region’s disputed areas, including the South China Sea . Whichever way you look at it, the Type 075 that has now begun sea trials is yet another impressive accomplishment for China’s rapidly growing naval force.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2020",Army Shows First-Ever Footage Of New Hypersonic Missile In Flight And Impacting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has released new video footage of a hypersonic missile test it carried out in cooperation with the U.S. Navy earlier this year, including clips of it in flight and impacting the designated target area. That launch, dubbed Flight Experiment 2, was in support of the development of a common hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that is set to eventually go on top of ground and submarine-launched missiles . Army Lieutenant General L. Neil Thurgood , the Director for Hypersonics, Directed Energy, Space and Rapid Acquisition within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, showed the video as part of a virtual briefing on Aug. 4, 2020. The presentation was part of the annual Space and Missile Defense (SMD) Symposium, which is being held online this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The brief video starts with footage of the test missile sitting on the pad at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii, on the day of the launch, Mar. 19, 2020. It then cuts to the missile blasting off. The clip of the launch itself was previously released . At the time, the Army and Navy said that this “test builds on the success we had with Flight Experiment 1 in October 2017,” which involved firing a prototype from an unspecified Ohio class submarine . “It gets off the pad pretty quick,” Lieutenant General Thurgood said, narrating the footage, but without giving any specifics about its exact speed. “It gets pretty high pretty fast.” Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , including the Army and Navy’s Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), are unpowered and typically use rocket boosters to propel them to optimal speed and altitude. After that, they glide down toward their target at hypersonic speeds within the atmosphere along a varying trajectory. They are capable of maneuvering laterally, as well. This gives hypersonic boost-glide vehicles an unpredictable flight profile compared to reentry vehicles on traditional ballistic missiles, even maneuverable designs. This, combined with their extreme speed, in turn, makes it very hard for an opponent to defend against these weapons or reposition or otherwise take cover before they hit. You can read more about the development of the C-HGB and the general principles behind hypersonic weapons in these past War Zone pieces . A model of the C-HGB., US Army The video then moves on to showing a portion of the actual flight of the C-HGB. It was “not a very long flight,” Lieutenant General Thurgood noted. The Army has still not said how fast the C-HGB flew during Flight Experiment 2 or how far it traveled. The Pentagon has previously said that this weapon would allow the Army and Navy to “strike targets hundreds and even thousands of miles away” and that it will get up to a speed of Mach 17. Thurgood’s video montage ends with a clip of the boost-glide vehicle actually hitting its mark. “That is the explosion at the other end,” the Lieutenant General said. It’s not clear whether this shows the detonation of an actual explosive warhead or simply the kinetic effects of the vehicle slamming into the target area at hypersonic speed. The Army officer said he could not go into the “classified pieces of this,” but added that the weapon was “very accurate…over the distance that we were asked to go.” Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone Steve Trimble noted that President Trump, in talking about the Army-Navy weapon in June during his commencement speech at West Point, said it could hit “ within 14 inches from center point” of the intended target. Trump has also referred to this weapon as a “ super duper missile .” It’s not clear when the next flight test of the C-HGB might take place. The Army is hoping to conduct a test of its full ground-based system in 2022 and have the first unit equipped with it reach initial operational capability the following year. The Navy plans to field its version first on its Block V Virginia class submarines , the first of which is not due to enter service until later in the 2020s. The Air Force had previously also been part of the C-HGB program, which would have been fitted to a large air-launched missile, but the service announced plans to shelve that effort indefinitely in its latest budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year. Instead, it will focus on the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), another hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece and could enter service on the B-52 bomber as early as 2021. No matter what, the Army and Navy are certainly continuing to make progress in the development of what are slated to be their first operational hypersonic weapons.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",Apparently The Captain Of The Navy’s 6th Fleet Flagship Pulls Security Duty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An image shot onboard one of just two of the U.S. Navy’s hulking Blue Ridge class amphibious command ships, USS Mount Whitney , shows the ship’s skipper, Captain David “Crusty” Pollard, M4 rifle in hand while standing security watch. It was a bit jarring seeing this photo as this is usually a job left to sailors under his command. Barring a canned photo op, which would be incredibly cheesy, it seems like Captain Pollard is a seriously hands-on leader, and we applaud him for that. The photo was taken while Mount Whitney was in dry dock in San Giorgio Del Porto in Genoa, Italy. The ship is homeported there as the flagship of the U.S. 6th Fleet. You can read all about these old, but increasingly capable 620 foot-long ships in these past War Zone features . Having the C.O. of such a high-profile and large ship standing security watch while in port seems quite outside the norm. Defense News ‘ David Larter , who is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and writes daily about all aspects of naval matters, told The War Zone the following: “In my experience, it’s rare for COs to stand security watch. In rare cases, such as holidays, a CO might choose to do so to give one of his sailors a break as a morale booster. But that’s rare and COs generally have more important things to do than in-port security.” Captain Pollard standing watch aboard USS Mount Whitney. , U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Scott Barnes Another view of the Mount Whitney in dry dock at San Giorgio Del Porto in Genoa, Italy, with another member of the crew pulling security on the bow., USN Pollard just took command of USS Mount Whitney on June 15, 2020, while it was sailing the Baltic Sea. The ship was taking part in the huge annual U.S. Navy-led Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) naval wargames that involve many regional players. His prior assignment was Executive Officer of the supercarrier USS Ronald Reagan that is forward based in Japan. “It is an honor to join the Mount Whitney team… I am proud to serve alongside such tough, resilient patriots . I want to thank Capt. Norman for his selfless service and dedication to this ship and its amazing crew as the commanding officer. You certainly have set an example for me to emulate.” USS Mount Whitney., USN Here is a bit more from the Navy about the Captain’s impressive background up to his time aboard the Ronald Reagan: Captain Dave “Crusty” Pollard is a native of Texas, and a 1996 graduate of the United States Naval Academy with a BS in Systems Engineering.  He also attended Regent University, and in May 2012, was named the Regent University School of Global Leadership and Entrepreneurship 2012 Outstanding Masters of Arts in Organizational Leadership Graduate. A Navy pilot, Captain Pollard deployed with both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, flying the F/A-18C Hornet with Strike Fighter Squadron THREE FOUR (VFA-34), the “Blue Blasters;” Strike Fighter Squadron ONE THREE SIX (VFA-136), the “Knighthawks;” and Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE TWO (VFA-192), the “World Famous Golden Dragons.” Flying the F/A-18E Super Hornet, he served as the Executive Officer and then Commanding Officer of Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE (VFA-195), the “Dambusters.” Ashore, Captain Pollard served as a Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor at Strike Fighter Weapons School, Atlantic, a project lead for both the U.S. Joint Forces Command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Naval Financial Analyst/Programmer for Tactical Aviation for the President’s budget in the Chief of Naval Operations office. Captain Pollard completed the Aviation Nuclear Power Training Program to become the Executive Officer of USS RONALD REAGAN (CVN 76), the only forward deployed aircraft carrier, stationed in Yokosuka, Japan. It would seem that the new captain is working extra hard to earn the trust and loyalty of his crew by doing some of the grunt work that isn’t traditionally assigned to an officer of his stature. It’s the old ‘lead from the front’ strategy that is pretty damn bulletproof. Well done Captain, well done.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jul 23, 2020",Red Flag Is Back In Business As Two Of The Big Air Combat Exercises Kick Off Simultaneously,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is back in the Large Force Exercise business after two of its renowned Red Flag exercises kicked off on Monday. Red Flag is acknowledged as the world’s premier air combat exercise and is considered to be a vital means to prepare aircrews for high-end aerial warfare. Red Flag at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Red Flag-Alaska at Eielson Air Force Base , Alaska, both started on Aug. 3, 2020, albeit with a smaller than usual numbers of participating aircraft. It marks the first of these major training events since the huge Red Flag 20-2 was halted early in March after a visiting NATO airman was diagnosed with COVID-19. Red Flag-Alaska 20-1, which was planned for April-May this year, and the 20-2 event that was scheduled for June , were also canceled. Both of these traditionally huge events have a reduced footprint this time around due to measures that are designed to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer units help to reduce personal interaction in confined workspaces, in locations such as the famous Red Flag operations building at Nellis, where the virus might more easily spread. A media release from Nellis underscored the importance placed on the kind of high-end integration training that Red Flag affords: “To keep the force tactically and technically sound, intense training is a must — even in the midst of a pandemic.” Red Flag 20-3 was spun up by the Nellis-resident 414th Combat Training Squadron (CTS) on fairly short notice, according to local officials. It will run at the Nevada base for just two weeks, from Aug. 3 to 14. Red Flag has typically lasted for at least three weeks in recent years to allow a deeper level of concerted training for the participating units. It also represents a greater return on investment when factoring the huge logistical effort that is needed to bring units out to these types of events. The current exercise in Nevada includes USAF F-15E Strike Eagles from the 335th Fighter Squadron at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, and from the 391st Fighter Squadron at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. Four B-1B Lancers from the 9th Bomb Squadron at Dyess AFB, Texas, are also present along with a host of tankers and electronic support aircraft, plus aggressor support from the 64th Aggressor Squadron. The U.S. Navy is present with two squadrons of EA-18G Growers from Electronic Attack Squadrons (VAQs) 132 and 135, while U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211 are also at Nellis. VMFA-211 is present at Nellis AFB for the latest Red Flag., Jamie Hunter This is one of the smallest Red Flags in many years in terms of overall numbers, and the Nellis set-up features an unusual composition of participants, with no dedicated air superiority squadron for offensive and defensive counter-air, one of the core missions in high-end training like this . Instead, the Nellis team brings a clear air-to-ground focus, although all of the fighters offer multi-role capabilities. Notably, the F-35Bs are flying in a Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) role, with B-1Bs and F-15Es working together in a strike/escort role over the adjacent Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) . It’s not clear why this team of squadrons has been assembled, however, it could be linked to urgent pre-deployment training, which is usually conducted as part of Green Flag, both at Nellis and at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. “Our team built a great plan to keep our service members safe without compromising the rigorous training Red Flag is known for,” said Col William Reese, 414th Combat Training Squadron commander. He added: “We know our enemies won’t call a ‘time-out’ for this pandemic, so we’ve focused on warfighting integration and strengthened our partnership with our professional aggressor forces to ensure we are ready to defeat any threat.” An aggressor F-16D gets airborne at Eielson AFB during the latest Red Flag-Alaska exercise in August., USAF/A1C Aaron Larue Guerrisky Meanwhile, Red Flag-Alaska 20-3, a Pacific Air Forces-sponsored exercise out of Eielson AFB utilizing the massive Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex (JPARC), is scheduled to run over the same period as Red Flag 20-3. It is being used to provide a series of challenging training events for the newly re-formed 356th Fighter Squadron, which is Eielson’s first F-35A unit, the details of which you can read about in this recent War Zone feature . “I’ve participated in a couple of large-force exercises with a lot of jets in one area and I’m interested in seeing what challenges and abilities this exercise will bring,” said 1st Lt Billy Mullis, one of the squadron’s young F-35 pilots. Most of the participating aircraft for Red Flag-Alaska are from Eielson and nearby Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, however, this exercise will also include operations originating from other bases further afield. “This is the first large-force exercise since this pandemic began,” said Lt Col Randy Kinsey, the 18th Aggressor Squadron commander. “We have to start somewhere, so why not here on a little bit [of a] smaller scale.” While the Nellis event this time around features Marine F-35Bs operating in a SEAD role, the Alaskan iteration pairs F-35As from the 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson and from the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill AFB, Utah. They face opposition from Eielson’s resident 18th Aggressor Squadron. It will be the first chance to bring together the unprecedented number of stealthy 5th generation fighters that are being amassed by the Pacific Air Forces in Alaska and will see two new squadrons of F-35s combining with the F-22A Raptors from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. An F-35A on the runway at Eielson AFB during Red Flag-Alaska., USAF/A1C Aaron Larue Guerrisky Getting back into the swing of large-scale exercises is vital to the pairing of Lightning and Raptor in Alaska, but it also sends a message that the U.S. military is maintaining its high-end warfighting training in turbulent times.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 27, 2019",Now Russia Wants Its First Okhotnik Combat Drone In Service By 2024,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The General Director of Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation, Yury Slyusar, has said that the company will begin deliveries of the S-70 Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle to the Russian military in 2024. The move follows calls from the defense ministry to accelerate work on the heavy combat drone program — the first of its kind in Russia. The Kremlin first revealed this new delivery timeline on Aug. 3, 2020. Previously, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov had said the S-70 would begin tests in an armed configuration between 2023 and 2024, before the launch of series production in 2025. Slyusar described the Okhotnik , meaning Hunter in Russian, as an “attack heavy drone [sic] with unprecedented capabilities, having the largest combat flight range, the widest range of weapons [and] the broadest range of equipment.” The flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) is being developed under the Udarno-Razvedyvatelnyi Bespilotnyi Kompleks (URBK), or Strike-Reconnaissance Unmanned Complex, program with Sukhoi as the project lead. The Russian Defense Ministry reportedly ordered the design bureau to begin the development and construction of the Okhotnik prototype in October 2011. The jet-powered UCAV first broke cover in January last year, when the first photos were posted to social media. Prior to this, an unnamed Russian ministry source told state-run news outlet TASS that the prototype had completed initial ground tests at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association’s plant — the first photos were apparently taken during this phase. The Russian Ministry of Defense then officially announced the S-70’s maiden flight in August last year, stating that the UCAV had flown for more than 20 minutes, cruising at an altitude of around 1,970 feet. The location of the Aug. 3, 2019, flight test was not announced, but it’s thought to have taken place at the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center in Russia’s southwestern Astrakhan region. Once in service, it’s expected that the Okhotnik will be capable of operating in a manned-unmanned teaming set-up, with the UCAVs acting as “loyal wingmen” to Su-57s and potentially other aircraft. And, as The War Zone has previously explored, the drone might help overcome known deficiencies in the Su-57 design, which you can read more about here . One of the first images of the Okhotnik from early 2019., Russian Social Media The Okhotnik was first seen flying together with a Su-57 last September, when the Russian Defense Ministry released video footage apparently taken at the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center. In a related statement, the defense ministry said the S-70 will “broaden the fighter’s radar coverage and provide target acquisition for employing air-launched weapons.” This suggests that Russia intends to use the Okhotnik to cue very long-range weapons against air and ground targets on behalf of the Su-57, keeping the manned fighter further away from enemy air defenses and hostile fighters. Moscow’s plans to put a UCAV, especially one that may have some stealthy characteristics, into frontline service by 2024 are certainly ambitious. To put it in context, the next-generation Su-57 was first flown in prototype T-50 form in January 2010 and is still yet to enter frontline service. To date, the Kremlin has only ordered 76 production-standard Su-57s . Russia also has first-hand experience of the difficulties inherent in bringing a complex drone into service. On Nov. 16, 2019, it lost an Orion medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV in a crash near Ryazan . A first production Orion had been scheduled for delivery to a frontline military unit at the end of the same year. Finally, manufacturer Kronshtadt officially handed over the first three examples in April this year. At the same time, however, the defense ministry confirmed that it required further upgrades to the system before it would be formally accepted for service. It may well also be the case that the Okhotnik requires more refinements before it’s a truly combat-capable platform. As The War Zone pointed out in its earlier analysis of the drone, which you can find here and here , there remain questions about the UCAV’s stealth features, at least in its initial configuration. In August 2019, at the biennial MAKS airshow outside Moscow, Sukhoi displayed a model of an S-70 with a significantly revised and far stealthier engine and exhaust configuration as compared to the flying prototype. You can read The War Zone ’s full analysis of this proposed updated design here . Whatever the future holds for the Okhotnik, it’s clear that, for the time being at least, Russian defense planners are keen to get it into service as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Test Of Minuteman III ICBM With Three Reentry Vehicles Sure Seems Like A Warning To Russia (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has conducted a scheduled test launch of an LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile with a very unusual load of three unarmed reentry vehicles . All operational Minuteman IIIs are presently armed with only one warhead in a single reentry vehicle as part of the United States’ obligations on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, making this a unique, but timely test considering the geopolitical landscape. Air Force and Navy personnel onboard an E-6B Mercury airborne command post aircraft actually fired the missile in this particular case using a specialized launch control system . The joint crew of the E-6B launched the Minuteman III from a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California using the aircraft’s Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) at approximately 12:21 AM local time on Aug. 4, 2020. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees America’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, as well as the service’s heavy bomber fleets, both nuclear-capable and conventional, said that the launch was otherwise routine and had been planned between six months to a year prior. “The flight test program demonstrates one part of the operational capability of the ICBM weapon system,” Air Force Colonel Omar Colbert, head of the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg, said in a statement. “This visible message of national security serves to assure our allies and dissuade potential aggressors.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=xS8hqKb6REk At the core of the concept of nuclear deterrence is ensuring that no opponent feels confident that they can launch a nuclear attack and escape retaliation. As such, regular testing, at least of delivery platforms, is generally required to both make sure that everything is working properly and to demonstrate this clearly to potential adversaries. The ALCS onboard the E-6B is an important component of this deterrent capability, providing an alternative means of launching the missiles remotely if other command and control nodes get destroyed. You can read more about this particular system and the rest of the command and control apparatus that supports the ICBM force in this past War Zone piece . An E-6B Mercury., USAF But if the test was entirely routine, the detail that the missile was carrying three unarmed reentry vehicles, in this particular instance, was not. Under the New START treaty , both the U.S. and Russian governments agreed to limit how many warheads they had deployed at any one time, among other things. While the agreement does not prohibit the deployment of ICBMs with Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles (MIRV), the United States has decided to field some 400 Minuteman IIIs, at least publicly, with just one warhead each inside a lone reentry vehicle. This keeps the overall warhead total down, but the number of missiles up. This makes sense considering the U.S. strategy of using its ICBM force as a ‘nuclear sponge’ that would absorb Russian warheads on purpose should the apocalypse come. You can read more about this bizarre arrangement in this past piece of ours. The Air Force first developed the Single Reentry Vehicle (SRV) modification for the LGM-30G as part of preparations for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II) treaty, which banned MIRVs. Minuteman III, which first entered service in 1970, was America’s first MIRV-equipped ICBM. Though signed in 1993, START II never truly entered force , with Russia completely withdrawing in 2002 in protest to the United States’ pulling out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The subsequent Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) and New START agreements do not have specific provisions for MIRVs. The Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles do have MIRVed warheads. Workers maintenance and Minuteman III in its silo. , USAF It’s not clear when the last time the Air Force tested a MIRVed Minuteman III was, but typically these types of tests involve only a single unarmed reentry vehicle, as would be the case in an actual operational launch. It is not entirely unheard of for these launches to involve more than one reentry vehicle. Another official press release says that the LGM-30G test launch on Feb. 8, 2017, also involved “test reentry vehicles,” plural, but did not say exactly how many. It’s unclear why this latest launch featured three reentry vehicles. It is possible that it could be part of a research and development effort and it was simply easier to collect certain data by launching three re-entry vehicles at once, rather than over the course of three separate missile tests. Still, this wouldn’t be reflective of the actual deployed configuration, with puts this possibility into question. In October 2019, the Air Force awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin to continue the development of the Mk 21A re-entry vehicle , an improved version of the Mk 21 that sits atop some Minuteman IIIs now. Each Mk 21 holds a W87 thermonuclear warhead, a combination that was originally developed for the now-retired LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM and that you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece . Other Minuteman IIIs are armed with one W78 thermonuclear warhead in a different reentry vehicle. The Mk 21A, which will hold an improved W87-1 warhead, is set to be the primary armament of the Air Force’s future Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) ICBMs, which are in development now to replace the existing LGM-30Gs. The Air Force expects to begin fielding the GBSD sometime in the late 2020s or early 2030s. Unarmed Mk 21 reentry vehicles on a payload bus from a now-retired LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force., USAF The Air Force could have also tested the MIRVed LGM-30G to highlight that it retains the capability to arm missiles in this way should the need or desire arise, which would be in line with both the uncommon payload and the service’s decision to highlight it very specifically in the official press release. This test does notably come at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is in negotiations with their Russian counterparts about extending New START with amended terms. The treaty is set to expire next year unless both parties agree to extend it out to 2026. After that, it will be necessary to negotiate an entirely new deal. The Trump Administration has been focused on getting Russia to agree to limits on various novel strategic systems , including nuclear-armed hypersonic missiles , as well as nuclear- powered and nuclear-armed cruise missiles and long-range torpedoes , as part of discussions about extending the agreement. The U.S. government also wants China to join this strategic arms control regime, which authorities in Beijing have repeatedly expressed little desire to do . If New START were to collapse without a replacement treaty in place, the United States would have a free hand to re-MIRV all of its Minuteman III missiles, as well as develop that capability for the new GBSD. There could be a perceived incentive to do so given Russia’s own deployment of various MIRVed ICBMs, which could expand in the absence of any armed control agreement. Adding two more reentry vehicles to each deployed LGM-30G would increase the total number of deployed warheads across the ICBM force from 400 to 1,200 with minimum effort. As such, it’s very possible that this could have acted as both a test of the weapon’s latent MIRV capabilities and as a message to Russia that without New START, America’s ground-based nuclear deterrent could become exponentially more destructive. We have already reached out to the Air Force for more information about this particular test and will be sure to update this story with any new information we receive. Update: 2:25 PM EST— A spokesperson for Air Force Global Strike Command has now confirmed to The War Zone that a test launch of a Minuteman III ICBM with three reentry vehicles is not common and that that the last time one occurred was on Apr. 25, 2018. AFGSC conducts between four and five LGM-30G test launches each year to support various requirements.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While we’re used to seeing dramatic displays involving Russian fighter aircraft and attack helicopters , this time it’s the turn of the country’s air transport fleet to take center stage with a dazzling spectacle. Eye-catching imagery and video of the three Ilyushin Il-76MD Candid airlifters was released to mark the 90th anniversary of Russia’s Airborne Troops, also known as the Vozdushno-Desantnye Voyska, or VDV, yesterday. The four-engine transports, flying from Migalovo Air Base in the Tver region, around 100 miles from Moscow, performed a fly-over of top brass and troops at a local training range on Aug. 2, 2020, dispensing hundreds of infrared decoy flares in spectacular style . As well as popping flares, the Il-76MDs commemorated the anniversary by dropping special forces paratroopers. The aircraft can accommodate up to 126 paratroopers that are delivered via the rear ramp in four rows, as well as from side doors on both sides of the fuselage. These jets routinely drop VDV armored vehicles and artillery under parachutes — from either high altitude, or at low level from just a dozen or so feet above the ground. For the celebrations in Tver, the Il-76MD — a variant of the military transport that entered service with the Soviet Union back in 1981 — made use of its countermeasures dispensers, which comprise a 96-round 50mm APP-50R launcher on each undercarriage fairing and/or on each side of the fuselage. These can be loaded with infrared flares or chaff cartridges , as required.

In a throwback to the Cold War, military Il-76MDs are also fitted with a 9A-503 defensive gun turret in the tail that includes two twin-barrel GSh-23 cannons. In addition, the Candid has a latent aerial bombing capability, which was also shown off during maneuvers that took place at Migalovo earlier this year .

Previously, it was provided with its own air assets, but by 2011 all had been transferred to the Russian Aerospace Forces. Back in November 2018 , the VDV’s deputy commander Lt Gen Alexander Vyaznikov announced that the branch would in future add units from Army Aviation — most likely assault rotorcraft — but this has not yet happened. Seeing these transport workhorses spewing out flares shows it’s not just Russian jets that can put on eye-popping displays.

The War Zone staff,"Updated on Dec 10, 2021",Australian Attack Helicopters Come To The Rescue Of Castaways On Deserted Pacific Island,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Airbus Helicopters ARH Tiger might not have gotten much love from the Australian Army of late, but the attack helicopter was a very welcome sight at the weekend for a group of sailors marooned on a tiny Micronesian island for nearly three days. In a scene worthy of Hollywood, an SOS message spelled out on the beach was sighted by both Australian and U.S. aircrews, before a helicopter flying from an Australian warship came to the rescue. Four ARH Tigers and a single Airbus Helicopters MRH90 Taipan transport helicopter were on board the Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) amphibious assault ship HMAS Canberra and they swung into action to help find the three sailors. After setting off in their 23-foot skiff on July 30, 2020, the sailors veered off course then ran out of fuel. They were posted missing on Aug. 1 and were located the following day on Pikelot Island, almost 120 miles from their starting point at Pulawat, Micronesia. Their planned destination was reportedly the Pulap atolls, a journey of 23 nautical miles. Heading to the search area, Canberra teamed up with U.S. aircraft to locate the sailors. An embarked ARH Tiger from the Australian Army’s 1st Aviation Regiment then delivered food and water directly to the beach , before performing health checks on the castaways. The three castaways on the beach, along with their boat and SOS., Australian Defence Force Canberra has recently been active in the region as part of Task Group 635.3 conducting a Regional Presence Deployment, which you can read more about here in this previous War Zone report . When the assault ship was called upon to assist in the search and rescue it was actually on its way back to Australia, while other vessels in the task group were preparing to participate in Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) off Hawaii. “The ship’s company responded to the call and had the ship quickly prepared to support the search and rescue,” Captain Terry Morrison, Canberra’s Commanding Officer, said. “In particular, our embarked MRH90 helicopter from No. 808 Squadron and the four armed reconnaissance helicopters from 1st Aviation Regiment were instrumental in the morning search that helped locate the men and deliver supplies and confirm their welfare.” “I am proud of the response and professionalism of all on board as we fulfill our obligation to contribute to the safety of life at sea wherever we are in the world,” he continued. The sailors were due to be picked up by a Micronesian patrol vessel, FSS Independence , a Pacific Patrol Boat delivered and supported by the Australian government. While the ARH Tiger and MRH90 both played their parts in this dramatic rescue, it’s fair to say that the two types have had mixed fortunes in Australian service. Australia ordered 47 MRH90 Taipan MRHs to replace Australian Army Black Hawk and RAN Sea King Mk 50A/B helicopters. The army and navy maintain the MRH90s as a common pool, but six aircraft are assigned to the RAN’s No. 808 Squadron based at Nowra, New South Wales. Technical and reliability issues saw the Taipan added to the Australian government’s ‘Projects of Concern’ list . Australia chose the Tiger to fulfill its Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter requirement back in 2001, acquiring 22 examples. While the first two were handed over in December 2004, final operational capability (FOC) was only achieved in April 2016. The Australian Tiger took part in an overseas deployment for the first time last year , when four examples were airlifted to Subang in Malaysia on a Royal Australian Air Force C-17A, before embarking for training exercises aboard Canberra . Australian Army Tigers aboard the HMAS Canberra ., Australian Defence Force/POIS Tom Gibson Last year the Australian Department of Defence issued a request for information (RFI) for an ARH Tiger replacement under the Land 4503 program. This calls for initial operational capability (IOC) in 2026 with 12 airframes and full operational capability two years later with 29 helicopters. Leading candidates for Land 4503 are the Bell AH-1Z Viper , Boeing AH-64E Apache and the upgraded Airbus Helicopters Tiger Mk III . In the meantime, we’ll likely see the ARH Tiger continue to operate from the Canberra -class assault ships in their traditional attack role – plus other missions, when required. Australian Tigers also landed on the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan during recent exercises, which you can read more about here . The latest episode in Micronesia was not the first time attack helicopters have supported rescue operations in non-traditional ways . In June this year, video emerged of a French Army Tigre that was used to evacuate two soldiers seriously injured when their Gazelle helicopter was shot down by insurgents on June 14 last year, close to the border between Mali and Niger. While the Tiger has failed to make its name as a success story within the Australian military, it has undoubtedly become a favorite for three particular sailors, whose emotions can only be imagined as the attack choppers thundered into view.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Nov 9, 2020",Video Of Chinese Fighters Over South China Sea Gives Insight Into Long-Range Missions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged online showing a long-range fighter patrol over the South China Sea being conducted by Chinese Su-30MKK Flankers. The video shows edited excerpts of a full mission, starting with aircrews running to their awaiting jets at Suixi-Nanning Air Base in Southern China, to aerial refueling,to a pass over the Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands, followed by the return to base. The video offers a powerful illustration of the regional capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) amid a torrent of U.S. and allied maneuvers in the region. The formation of at least six Russian-made Su-30MKK Flankers appears to be assigned to the 6th Air Brigade, which is based at Suixi, in Guangdong. The airbase is located close to the Chinese coast and the northern end of the South China Sea. At least some of the fighter-bombers are loaded with Russian R-27R and R-77 air-to-air missiles. Subi Reef is one of a number of atolls in the hotly disputed Spratly Islands that China began artificially expanding in 2014, and has since transformed into outposts capable of sustaining various ground, air, and naval forces. It doesn’t appear that the fighters landed here, according to the video. What was described as a 10-hour mission was supported by what appears to be Il-78 Midas tanker aircraft, although these assets have been obscured in the video. The full version of the video can be seen here, but unfortunately, it doesn’t feature sound. The PLAAF ordered 76 Su-30MKKs in two batches from 1999. This version of the Russian fighter lacks the canards and thrust-vectoring engines that are featured on more advanced versions of the Su-30. The Chinese versions include an N001VE fire-control radar to provide air-to-air and air-to-ground sensor capabilities. China’s Su-30MKK can carry TV- and laser-guided air-to-surface missiles in addition to its Russian air-to-air weapons. In recent years, imagery has also depicted the Su-30MKKs carrying the indigenous KG700 electronic countermeasures pod and Chinese weapons , such as the LS-500J laser-guided bomb, and the YJ-91 anti-radiation missile. This is linked to an upgrade that introduced a revised cockpit that includes domestic multifunction displays (MFDs) and updated avionics. A Su-30MKK carrying the KG700 electronic countermeasures pod and YJ-91 anti-radiation missiles., Chinese Internet It’s commonplace for the Su-30MKKs to operate as long-range escorts for bomber missions over the South China Sea. In-flight refueling can extend their range to over 3,000 miles, which makes these Flankers an important asset for the PLAAF in this turbulent region. The opening sequence of crews dashing to the Flankers gives the impression of a scramble, which would underscore the importance the PLAAF places on the ability to get these fighters over the area at short notice to potentially intercept any unwanted visitors. The Su-30MKKs are regularly called upon to intercept U.S. patrol aircraft in the region, you can read more about one specific incident with a U.S. Air Force WC-135 here . Even though the large runway facilities at three of China’s remote island outposts deep in the South China Sea have been operational for a number of years now, China has not disclosed fighter deployments to them. They have plenty of facilities to support and even to conceal them, but as of now, the airfields only openly host maritime patrol, airborne early warning, and other non-fighter assets on a routine basis. Woody Island, at the north end of the South China Sea, does regularly support fighter operations. One of the Su-30MKK weapon systems officers shows off his pre-packed food,, YouTube Screecap Interestingly, none of the aircrews in the video are wearing life jackets, which seems unusual for a long over-water flight. It could be that they are equipped with some sort of floatation device that isn’t obvious in the clips in the video. They do, however, appear to be carrying a range of pre-packed drinks and snacks. This film offers similar interesting insights into Chinese fighter missions as was afforded in this recent Chinese dogfight video , as was reported by The War Zone . This time around its a carefully coordinated mission by Chinese fighters and tanker aircraft that sends a clear statement of capability in one of the world’s hottest potential flashpoints.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 29, 2020","The Pentagon To Beef Up Its Posture In Poland, Add 1,000 Troops","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has officially signed a cooperation agreement with Poland that includes plans to add another 1,000 personnel to the total number of U.S. troops in that country at any one time. This comes less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump’s Administration announced it would be withdrawing thousands of American troops from Germany and sending a portion of them to locations elsewhere in Europe, which you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced that negotiations regarding the new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with Poland, which is a NATO member, were complete on Aug. 3, 2020. Breaking Defense was among the first to report that the deal was getting close to being done following a statement from Polish Minister of National Defense Mariusz Blaszczak to this effect on July 31. Last year, President Trump and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, had signed joint declarations calling for increased defense cooperation. There has also been talk of the possible permanent basing of a significantly increased number of U.S. troops in the eastern European country. Breaking Defense also reported that the new EDCA would include new substantial permanent forward-deployed forces, but Esper’s statement does not mention any such developments, specifically. “The EDCA will enable an increased enduring U.S. rotational presence of about 1,000 personnel, to include the forward elements of the U.S. Army’s V Corps headquarters and a Division headquarters, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and the infrastructure to support an armored brigade combat team and combat aviation brigade,” Esper said. “This is in addition to the 4,500 U.S. personnel already on rotation in Poland.” A member of the US Army riding in a Stryker wheeled armored vehicle shows a Polish flag patch whilein the country for an exercise in 2015., US Army In February, the Army announced it would reestablish the V Corps headquarters element at Fort Knox, Kentucky, which would then deploy approximately 200 personnel on routine, rotating deployments to an unspecified location in Europe where they would run an “operational command post.” The service had shuttered V Corps, which was previously situated in Germany and had been there since the 1950s, in 2013, as part of earlier force reductions in the region. For years now, the Army has also rotated armored brigade combat teams (ABCT) through temporary deployments to Poland. When those units arrive there, they presently take up residence at Polish military facilities in cities and towns in the western portion of the country near the German border. Army logistics and combat aviation elements rotate through deployments to facilities in Powidz, which is situated more in the center of the country. A larger command and control element has been situated at Poznan and this is now set to be replaced by the new rotating deployments of a full division-level headquarters. The U.S. military does have actual forward-deployed units, including personnel working in Redzikowo, where the United States is establishing an Aegis Ashore missile defense site. The Air Force’s 52nd Fighter Wing has also established detachments at the Polish Air Force’s bases at Lask and Miroslawiec. The disposition of US forces, as well as NATO elements, in Poland circa 2018. “DET-1” is the 52nd Fighter Wing’s Detachment 1 at Lask. Detachment 2 at Miroslawiec had not yet been established when this map was created., NATO Contractor-owned and operated MQ-9 Reapers conduct operations from Miroslawiec, while the service’s presence at Lask serves more as a logistics node and site where the Air Force could rapidly deploy additional aircraft, including combat jets, in a crisis. It’s unclear whether the additional “intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR] capabilities” Secretary Esper referred to will simply be an expansion of the existing operation or will involve the deployment of a significant number of additional assets, including manned aircraft, as well. The United States has also been in the process of building new infrastructure to support rotational forces in Poland, including the aforementioned Army and Air Force elements, as well as special operations forces. In 2016, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) revealed that it had established a regular, rotating task force to support various activities, including psychological warfare missions intended to counter disinformation emanating from Russia , in Eastern Europe. American special operators have a strong relationship with Poland’s special operations forces and regularly train with them, as well as elements from the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania , all of whom are also NATO members. The completion of negotiations with Poland relating to this new EDCA comes hot on the heel the Pentagon formally announcing that it would be moving thousands of troops out of Germany on July 29. Of the 11,900 personnel set to be withdrawn, 6,400 will go back to the United States, but many will then return to Europe on rotational deployments. The units to which the remaining 5,400 individuals are assigned, including U.S. European Command’s headquarters, will move to other countries in the region. “Alongside the recently announced European strategic force posture changes, the EDCA [with Poland] will enhance deterrence against Russia, strengthen NATO, reassure our Allies, and our forward presence in Poland on NATO’s eastern flank will improve our strategic and operational flexibility,” Secretary Esper said in his statement. “We congratulate the negotiators on this important milestone for U.S.-Polish relations and our collective transatlantic security.” There has already been significant criticism of the Germany withdrawal plans, which first emerged unexpectedly in June, which opponents say can only weaken the U.S. military’s posture in Europe and undermine America’s relationship with Germany, as well as NATO as a whole. Despite the Pentagon’s assertions, President Trump has repeatedly said that he is pulling troops out because authorities in Berlin have failed to meet the alliance’s annual defense spending target – at least two percent of a country’s gross domestic product – despite it not being a hard requirement and many of the countries that U.S. forces are set to relocate to not meeting that goal either. Poland is one of the few that does spend more than two percent on defense every year. The Trump Administration, and Trump personally, has also had an often acrimonious relationship , in general, with the German government over the past three and a half years or so. It’s hard not to interpret the removal of U.S. troops, something Trump reportedly announced without any prior discussion or coordination with officials in Germany or NATO leaders, as being possibly linked to these political disputes. By comparison, Trump has cultivated a much closer relationship with Poland’s Duda. The Polish President, in advocating for a new permanent U.S. military presence in his country last year, proposed establishing an American base in his country, which he referred to as “ Fort Trump .” How long it might take for any these new U.S. military force structure plans to come to fruition, if they do at all, remains to be seen.

tyler rogoway and jamie hunter,"Posted on Dec 11, 2020",Let’s Talk About The Air Force Potentially Replacing The F-15E With The F-15EX,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force could expand its current F-15EX procurement plans in order to replace its F-15E Strike Eagles , according to official documentation. The service currently aims to recapitalize its aging F-15C/D air superiority fighters with the new F-15EX as a priority, but it has also left the door open to replacing its Strike Eagles with the type. Such an initiative wouldn’t come without controversy though, especially in terms of threatening the Air Force’s long-held, but often questioned F-35A procurement number goal of 1,763 airframes. A Justification and Approval (J&A) document lays out the USAF’s case for buying the F-15EX. It says: “The objective of this program is to rapidly develop, integrate, and field the F-15EX weapon system to refresh/replace aging F-15C/D aircraft. A decision to also refresh F-15E aircraft has not yet been made, but remains an option.” The report sets out the Air Force’s reasoning for the sole-source contract being awarded to Boeing for F-15EX, and it was signed off by USAF acquisition chief Dr. William Roper in August 2019. It carefully lays out the urgent plans to replace an F-15C fleet that it is running out of airframe hours. It adds: “The F-15 fleet is in dire need of a refresh, in particular the F-15C/D fleet, which without an expensive service life extension, will run out of airframe flying hours in [redacted}.” In keeping with major recapitalization projects, the timing would suggest that, when it comes, the need to replace the Strike Eagle will be just as urgent as it is currently for the F-15C/D. You can check out the document for yourself here: 190818_FA8634-20-D-2704_F-15EX Development and Procurement_J+A_Redacted.pdfDownload The first production-standard F-15E Strike Eagle made its maiden flight on Dec. 11, 1986, from McDonnell Douglas’ St Louis, Missouri, plant. The first of 236 production Strike Eagles was handed over to the 461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron “Deadly Jesters” on Apr. 12, 1988. The first operational unit — the 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS) “Rocketeers” —started to receive Strike Eagles at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, in December 1988. The type was famously thrust into combat for Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Prior to the first true F-15E’s first flight, a TF-15A (F-15B) was used to prove the Strike Eagle concept, acting as a prototype and capabilities demonstrator., National Museum of the United States Air Force Strike Eagle serial 89-0487 from Seymour Johnson became the first example to reach 12,000 flight hours on August 16, 2016. The F-15E was beefed-up in comparison to the F-15C in order to carry a heavy weapons loads, however, like the Eagle, the youngest of which is 35 years old, the Strike Eagles are aging airframes. The small 219-strong Strike Eagle fleet remains in high demand with an enduring commitment in the U.S. Central Command region that leverages many impressive niche capabilities . With just six front line Strike Eagle squadrons, at least one is always deployed. The F-15E is also capable of delivering nuclear weapons and is the first jet certified to employ the newest variant of the B61 tactical nuclear bomb. The current F-15E fleet features two different engine classes. The oldest jets feature the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E with roughly 23,500lbs of thrust. The younger models feature the P100-PW-229 engines with around 29,000lbs of thrust, making them the most capable of the lot by a serious margin. They are also the most numerous. The initial F-15EXs are set to receive the F110-GE-129 engine that also has 29,000lbs of thrust. USAF Buying more F-15EXs to replace the current F-15E would be hugely significant. USAF Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein has made regular assertions that the F-15EX will not impact the F-35 Lightning II program, but switching later F-35 procurement targeted at replacing the F-15E to the F-15EX could impact the overall F-35A projected inventory requirement. Moreover, the Boeing fighter has been used as a means to pile competitive pressure on Lockheed Martin to reduce F-35 procurement and through-life costs. The J&A report underscores the reasoning behind purchasing the F-15EX in terms of ease of transition: “Refreshing the existing F-15 fleet (versus transitioning to a new advanced fighter aircraft) with F-15EX will dramatically reduce disruption to the logistics and sustainment infrastructure, as well as operational training and Mission Ready status of current F-15 units, by taking advantage of inherent familiarity with the existing aircraft, which will allow focus on the new and improved systems.” F-15EX., Boeing The case for the urgent replacement of the F-15C/D includes reasons regarding safety. “The schedule impact if there is no refresh is exacerbated by the fact that the average age of the F-15C/D fleet is 35 years. The fleet’s structural integrity is rapidly degrading due to the high-g flight profile used during training and operations. One wing commander imposed a G restriction due to a loss of confidence in the safety of the fleet.” The USAF examined a service life extension for the F-15C, but this was ruled out as not being cost-effective. The speed with which Boeing can build the F-15EX is cited as another key differentiator. Based on the foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian F-15SA and Qatari F-15QA projects, the USAF’s F-15EX will share “90-95 percent commonality” with the Qatari jets, but it will receive some USAF-specific additions such as Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS). USAF The report adds that buying the F-15EX “will save the USAF $3 billion over the Future Years Defense Program compared to replacing that fleet with F-35s by avoiding significant transition costs required for a new aircraft.” It adds: “The USAF estimates that it will take six months or less to transition from the F-15C/D to the F-15EX given the significant commonality between the F-15C/D and F-15EX aircraft components and ground support equipment, while the transition time from F-15s to the F-35 (or any other airframe) will take approximately 18 months for an Active Duty squadron and 36 months for an Air National Guard squadron. Accordingly, from both an economic and readiness perspective, no other aircraft will satisfy the USAF requirement to refresh the F-15C/D fleet.” In addition, the document makes it clear that the premium once placed on an all stealth tactical fighter fleet has eroded: “The USAF has determined that a mix of 4th generation capacity and 5th generation capability is necessary in balancing near and mid-term readiness with future needs.” These were all reasons we discussed as per the justification for the ‘F-15X’ when The War Zone broke the story of its existence two years ago. F-15E., USAF There are no official plans to replace the F-15E when it is retired from service, and officially it could remain in service through life-extension programs. Yet, based on the situation facing the F-15C/D, it could be up for replacement as early as the end of the decade. Previously, the War Zone was told that the F-15EX “is intended to directly replace the USAF’s entire F-15C/D fleet. It would have no impact on the existing F-15E Strike Eagle fleet or its planned upgrade pathway that is underway now.” The F-15E shares similar cutting-edge technology as is being fielded in the F-15EX. It has been upgraded with the Raytheon AN/APG-82(V)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, the new Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II, and it too is receiving the new EPAWSS self-protection system. The current F-15EX procurement plan as set out earlier this month could be worth up to $22.9 billion over 10 years. This cost ceiling is based on a March 2019 F-15 SPO Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the maximum quantity of 200 aircraft. However, the report says procurement quantities will be established at a Most Probably Quantity (MPQ) of 144 aircraft. Still, this is seen as the minimum fleet size and it is likely to reach near or at the 200 level just in regards to replacing the F-15C/D fully. The youngest F-15C/D in the USAF’s fleet is 35 years old. , USAF The current F-15C/D fleet of approximately 245 aircraft would be replaced on what would be close to a one-for-one basis if all options are exercised. While the report doesn’t discuss actual numbers, it would suggest the similarly sized F-15E fleet could be recapitalized under a very similar model, which would take F-15EX procurement out to roughly 400 aircraft. A USAF spokesman told Air Force Magazine “That decision has not been made,” regarding the F-15E. A common F-15EX fleet in a merged Eagle community would have its benefits both logistically and operationally. There is also bound to be some tension between the F-15C/D units, the vast majority of which are Air National Guard, and the active-duty F-15E community under the current procurement plan for the F-15EX. As the plan sits, the F-15EX would equip squadrons whose only missions have been air-to-air combat and air sovereignty with the most advanced and reliable multi-role F-15s in the entire force. In other words, the F-15E community, which is tasked with some of the most complex combat operations abroad, would be flying aging, partially upgraded jets while the Guard has brand new F-15EX with excess capabilities. This has raised the question of why doesn’t the F-15E get replaced with the F-15EX and the current F-15C/D community receive surplus F-15Es? F-35As and F-15Es in formation., USAF With over 50 years of production, the F-15 is entering into uncharted territory for fighter aircraft manufacturing. Boeing has cleverly retained credibility through reinventing the F-15 via foreign investment . With at least 144 new F-15s entering the Air Force’s fleet in the near term, some 16 years after its last new Eagle was delivered, the prospects for follow-on orders are certainly there. This doesn’t mean that recapitalizing the Strike Eagle fleet with F-15EX is anywhere near a done deal, but the door is open and it might just prove to be another case of the swiftest, cheapest, and most sensible way to keep some of the Air Force’s most important fighter squadrons in business. Regardless, with the F-15EX’s stated service life of a whopping 20,000 hours, the Eagle will be gracing American fighter wing ramps well into the second half the century.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 17, 2020",Boeing Shows Super Hornets Bristling With 14 Missiles In Formal Sales Pitch To Canada,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has formally submitted its Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornet to the Royal Canadian Air Force’s competition to select its next fighter jet. The company also released concept art of the configuration it is pitching to the Canadians, which shows aircraft equipped with conformal fuel tanks , carrying a podded infrared search and track sensor , and armed with an impressive 12 AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles and a pair of shorter-range AIM-9X Sidewinders . Lockheed Martin is also competing with its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Saab has submitted its Gripen E . The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) is hoping to receive 88 new fighter jets to replace its existing CF-18A/B+ Hornets under what is officially known as the Future Fighter Capability Project (FFCP). Canada’s Public Services and Procurement department announced that it had received all three formal proposals on July 31, 2020. The final contract could be worth between 15 and 19 Billion Canadian dollars, or between around $11.2 billion and nearly $14.2 billion in U.S. dollars at the present rate of conversion. Today marks an important milestone in the Future Fighter Capability Project. Canada received bids from all 3 eligible suppliers. Good news for our @RCAF_ARC Link to Fighter Web: https://t.co/3zQJPvJmFB — Public Services and Procurement Canada (@PSPC_SPAC) July 31, 2020 “We have a partnership with Canada that spans more than 100 years,” Jim Barnes, the Director of Canada Fighter Sales at Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement regarding his company’s submission. “The Super Hornet is the most cost-effective and capable option for the FFCP, and a Super Hornet selection will help the RCAF meet their mission needs.” The Boeing press release doesn’t highlight any specific features of the Super Hornets that it is offering to the RCAF, but, as noted, the concept art shows jets with conformal fuel tanks (CFT). The CFTs are a key component of the Block III Super Hornet, which the Chicago-headquartered plane maker first developed for the U.S. Navy and that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Boeing The firm has highlighted in the past how the CFTs would fit well with Canada’s requirements for its fighter jet fleets, which includes major air defense mission sets as part of the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and NATO’s air policing operations in Europe. The extra fuel gives the jets extra range and allows them to stay on station longer without the burden of drop tanks that also take up underwing hardpoints that could be used for weapons or other stores. One of the aircraft in Boeing’s concept art is also carrying a buddy refueling store , which would allow RCAF Super Hornets to refuel each other in flight. This could help further extend the ability of aircraft on patrol to stay aloft. The podded infrared search and track sensor (IRST), which is built into a modified drop tank that the aircraft can carry on its centerline station, is another upgrade for the Super Hornet that the U.S. Navy has been working on for years now and that you can read about in much more detail in this recent War Zone feature . The IRST system offers an invaluable additional tool for spotting and tracking targets, including stealthy aircraft, at extended ranges that is also immune to electronic warfare jamming. Concept art Boeing released in announcing its subission of a rpoposal for the FFCP competition. The aircraft in the foreground is carrying a podded infrared search and track sensor in a modified drop tank., Boeing The Super Hornets would also come with an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar that would also offer improved target detection and target capabilities, especially compared to the RCAF’s existing Hornets. Last month, the U.S. government actually approved the potential sale of an upgrade package for the CF-18A/B+s that would notably include refitting them with AN/APG-79(V)4 AESA radars . That prospective deal also included a batch of AIM-9Xs, which are not presently in Canada’s inventory, but is another item that Boeing has highlighted in announcing its Super Hornet offer for the RCAF. These Sidewinders are still receiving upgrades that are increasingly making them a longer-range, multi-purpose weapon rather than just a dogfighting missile, as you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . Overall, Boeing’s concept art shows a serious air-to-air loadout overall, including five AIM-120s under each wing and another two on the aircraft’s fuselage stations on the sides of the engine air intakes, representing around between $12 and $13 million in weapons alone. The Canadians had previously expressed an interest in buying AIM-120D missiles , the most advanced version of the AMRAAM to date, which would be a good fit for these new aircraft. Boeing, which for a time looked like it might get shut out of the Canadian fighter jet competition over a tangential trade dispute , could actually have a leg up in the competition because of its long history working with the RCAF and its CF-18A/B+ fleet.  The company’s offer is “leveraging existing infrastructure to drive down the long-term sustainment cost of the aircraft,” Barnes, the Director of Canada Fighter Sales, added in his statement. This is true in that there is an extensive commonality between the legacy Hornet and Super Hornet that goes far beyond hardware. Training and sustainment, in particular, enjoys substantial continuity between the two types. RCAF CF-18A+ Hornets., Canadian Forces Still, the Super Hornet offer is likely to face significant competition for the final contract, especially from Lockheed Martin’s F-35. Canada is already a member of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, which has created unusual, but serious complications for the FFCP. Canadian authorities had planned to buy 65 of those jets before the Liberal Party government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau scrapped that deal after coming to power in 2015. The Canadian Department of National Defense subsequently agreed to buy 25 ex-Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A/B Hornets as an interim option , after a proposed purchase of 18 new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets from Boeing collapsed in 2017. “We are extremely proud of our longstanding partnership with Canada, which has played a key role in the F-35’s development,” Greg Ulmer, F-35 Program Executive Vice President at Lockheed Martin, said in a statement . “The 5th Generation F-35 would transform the Royal Canadian Air Force fleet and deliver the capabilities necessary to safeguard Canadian skies. The F-35’s unique mix of stealth and sensor technology will enable the Royal Canadian Air Force to modernize their contribution to NORAD operations, ensure Arctic sovereignty and meet increasingly sophisticated global threats.” The concept art that Lockheed Martin released along with its proposal notably shows F-35A variants with an optional drag chute installed on top of the rear fuselage. Lockheed Martin developed this feature first for Norway’s F-35As, which is intended to help with landings on runways covered in snow or ice. The RCAF similarly operates from bases in areas where these weather conditions, as well as extremely low ambient temperatures, are common. Curiously, however, Canadian authorities have previously said that they will not conduct cold-weather testing on any of the entrants in the FFCP and instead rely on data already gathered as part of evaluations by other countries. Concept art that Lockheed Martin released accompanying its announcement about entering the competition to supply the RCAF’s next fighter jet that shows three F-35As equipped with optional drag chutes., Lockheed Martin Saab’s Gripen E is certainly more of a dark horse contender. The Swedish aviation company has been promoting significant potential industrial cooperation as a key component of Gripen offers to Canada and other prospective buyers, as well. “The system [Gripen E] meets all of Canada’s specific defense requirements, offering exceptional performance and advanced technical capabilities,” Jonas Hjelm, Senior Vice President and head of Saab’s Aeronautics business area, said in a statement . “A guarantee to share key technology, in-country production, support and through-life enhancements will ensure that Canada’s sovereignty is enhanced for decades.” Saab Gripen Es., Saab Gripen was designed to operate highly efficiently from austere conditions by small teams in cold climates, something that Canada could find attractive. Canadian authorities hope to pick the winner of the FFCP competition in 2022. The goal is to have the first new fighter jet touch down in the country in 2025. The competition over who will supply Canada’s next fighter jet already looks set to be fierce in the coming years.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jul 10, 2020",Topgun Receives Its First F-35C Lightning II,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC), the organization that includes the famous TOPGUN school , has received its first F-35C Lightning II . The aircraft touched down at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, yesterday, emblazoned with the iconic lightning bolt tail flash and TOPGUN badge, albeit in predictably toned-down form, as is standard for U.S. 5th generation fighters. Earlier this month The War Zone reported on how the first F-35 students completed the grueling U.S. Naval Fighter Weapons School (NFWS) course in May and how the advent of the F-35 has triggered one of the biggest revamps in the school’s history. TOPGUN students traditionally borrow jets from their squadrons when attending the course. The arrival of an F-35C for NAWDC means that staff instructors at TOPGUN , as well as those in other departments within the organization, will now be able to fly missions in the Lightning without having to borrow aircraft, as well. NAWDC operates a host of different aircraft types and employs them for a range of taskings, with adversary threat presentations and tactics development being major missions. Instructors at TOPGUN currently fly a mix of F/A-18C Hornets, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, and F-16A/B Fighting Falcons to act as adversaries in air-to-air training missions against students. The arrival of the F-35C at Fallon opens up the potential for instructors to begin replicating advanced low observable (stealthy) tactics to fully test students flying both the Super Hornet and the Lightning II. A TOPGUN instructor in an F-16A., Jamie Hunter The first NAWDC F-35C is an early-build aircraft, Bureau Number 168843, which initially served with the Navy’s first F-35 training unit, Strike Fighter Squadron 101 (VFA-101), the “Grim Reapers.” That unit was established as part of a joint-service training center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, from 2013. The activation of VFA-125, the “Rough Raiders,” at Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore, California, in January 2017 as a second Fleet Replacement Squadron led to the deactivation of VFA-101 last year. It was first delivered to VFA-101 in 2014 and likely has a low number of hours on the clock. NAWDC has always tended to receive early production aircraft for the staff to fly, with the Navy preferring to send newer aircraft to the operational fleet . Similarly, the U.S. Air Force is looking to station early production aggressor F-35As at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, to provide high-end threat replication to students at its Weapons School, as well as other training events, such as Red Flag . A close-up of the tail reveals a low-tone NAWDC lightning bolt and the famous TOPGUN badge., Steve Lewis In keeping with its other aircraft, NAWDC’s F-35Cs could not only support TOPGUN, but they could also allow Fallon instructors to fly stealthy tactics with and against fleet squadrons when they come to the Nevada air station on pre-deployment training. More importantly, having a its own stable of F-35Cs will allow NAWDC to more rapidly test new tactics and procedures that could greatly benefit the fleet. The arrival of a single F-35C at Fallon, which occurred with little fanfare, is a big moment for Naval aviation and another milestone in the navalized Joint Strike Fighter’s young history.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 27, 2017",Now Russia Wants To Bring Back Missile-Armed Ekranoplans To Defend Its Claims In The Arctic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union considered building a fleet of missile-armed Lun -class wing-in-ground-effect vehicles, also known as an “ekranoplans.” Now, Russia says it has plans to revive this concept with a design tentatively known as “Orlan,” which could potentially offer the country a novel access and anti-access weapon in the increasingly contested Arctic region , as well as in more constrained waterways, such as the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea . On July 30, 2018, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov announced that a combat-capable sea-skimming vehicle would be part of the State Armament Program for 2018-2027. Since at least 2015, there have been reports that the Kremlin has been considering bringing back wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) designs, but primarily for transport and search and rescue duties. “The [Orlan] prototype will be created as part of this armament program and it will carry missile armament,” Borisov said, according to Russian state outlet TASS . The deputy prime minister said that the vehicle would be able to help patrol Russia’s vast littoral regions, especially its maritime border along the Arctic and its claims in that region. WIG designs are essentially a seaplane that flies very close to the surface of the water. In principle, the concept allows for an efficient, high-speed “water” craft that doesn’t suffer from the drag of actually sailing on the surface and from having a wing that can generate more significant lift. The Soviets, and others who have experimented with these types of vehicles, looked into variants that could combine the ekranoplan’s benefits with the ability to fly at higher altitudes. A Soviet-era Project 904 Orlyonok ekranoplan now on display., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia Borisov did not offer any other specific details about the new Orlan and it’s not clear if this design will be in any way related to the Soviets’ Project 904 or “Orlyonok,” which means “eaglet” in Russian. NATO had dubbed this craft, which has a maximum take-off weight of approximately 125 tons, as the “ Orlan -class.” Of the five known examples, Russia scrapped two of them and turned the other three into non-functional monuments. Still, in terms of its basic shape and performance, the established Orlyonok design might provide a good starting place for a new ekranoplan missile craft. It has a good payload capacity due to its original role as a transport and reportedly boasted a cruising speed of nearly 250 miles per hour over a range of more than 900 miles. The original type had a turret on top with a pair of 12.7mm machine guns and a simple navigational radar. An old Soviet-era photo of one of the Orlan-class ekranoplans, with the machine gun turret and mast-mounted radar visible at the front., via GlobalSecurity.org In order to arm the craft, Russian engineers could conceivably look to the larger Lun -class design and mount missile launchers on its upper spine of the fuselage on the existing Orlyonok. The only Lun that the Soviets ever built, also known as MD-160, could carry six P-80 Zubr anti-ship cruise missiles, which NATO called the SS-N-22 Sunburn, in this configuration. However, the existing Project 904 design features a large Kuznetsov NK-12MK turboprop engine, the same type found on Russia’s Tu-95 Bear bombers , at the top of the tail and firing missiles from the top of the craft might have some impact its function and, in turn, the ekranoplan’s performance. The Orlan -class also had a pair of jet engines in the nose to propel the craft. The Lun -class did not have a tail-mounted engine of any kind, using that space instead for a Puluchas search radar and other equipment. It’s hard to see where else missiles might easily go on the existing Orlyonok design, though engineers could potentially put them on top of its wings in water-tight canisters. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iINbB1Y5F4c At the same time, it could be possible to position the launchers far enough forward for them not to have any negative effects on the NK-12. Similarly, a missile system semi-recessed in the fuselage that fires the weapons off to the sides instead could avoid the issue altogether. The missiles Russia installs on the ekranoplan might be small enough for it not to matter one way or another. Compared to the P-80, more recent Russian anti-ship missiles have become light and compact enough to make using a smaller ekranoplan such as the Orlyonok feasible as a launch platform in the first place. There are other designs that would fit Deputy Prime Minister Borisov’s basic description for the new Orlan, too. The 737-sized A-050 Chaika, or “Seagull,” is supposed to begin flight testing in 2022 and could serve as the basis for a missile-armed type. The firm responsible for this design, Alexeev’s Hydrofoil Design Bureau, has a number of other types that might work, as well. An artist’s conception of the A-050 Seagull., Alexeev’s Hydrofoil Design Bureau Borisov did not specify any particular type or manufacturer and did not say specifically what kind of weapons the new Orlan might carry, either. He did note, however, that it would be used to fill in for more traditional defenses in the sparsely populated Arctic , according to TASS , but the most likely armament would be some type of anti-ship cruise missiles. The deputy prime minister also noted the craft’s potential value in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and the Kremlin could also potentially deploy them to the highly strategic Baltic Sea. In a maritime patrol role, an ekranoplan carrying a load of supersonic P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles could challenge the ability of potential opponents to move freely through a certain area or engage them rapidly during an actual skirmish. The high speed of the vehicles combined with that missile’s over-the-horizon range could allow the crew to quickly get into position on short notice or readily move to another area to respond to the changing nature of the threat. Multiple missile-armed WIGs might be able to threaten enemy surface ships from multiple directions, as well, limiting their ability to make the most of their defensive capabilities. At the same time, Orlan’s low-altitude flight path and speed might make it harder to detect and engage, as well. Ekranoplans already have the benefit of being effectively impervious to torpedoes and naval mines . The video below shows Russian land-based launchers firing P-800s during an exercise. https://youtube.com/watch?v=294by85-JqU The ability to operate far from and independently of traditional naval and air bases would only make the vehicles more flexible operationally. This might give Russian ekranoplan units equal ability to gain access to certain areas and deny opponents the ability to operate in those spaces. Depending on how common the missile-armed variant is to other proposed transport types, the combat-capable versions might be able to serve as escorts for the others into hostile territory. This could give Russia the ability to rapidly deploy forces on sea and land into specific areas during a conflict. It would likely take relatively little effort to turn a defensive missile armed Orlan into an offensive weapon armed with land-attack cruise missiles, such as Kalibr , to actively threaten enemy shore-based defenses and sites further inland, especially in the close-quarters environment of the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea. Russia has also demonstrated that the P-800 has a limited land-attack capability itself, which could give the ekranoplans some multi-purpose functionality without necessarily needing to carry more than one type of weapon. But, regardless, how viable a surface-skimming missile craft might actually be remains to be seen. Ekranoplans have historically proven to be complicated to operate and maintenance intensive in general, with the Project 904 types reportedly suffering from serious corrosion issues, according to a 1993 edition of Combat Fleets of the World . That year the then recently independent Russia decided to retire the remaining Orlyonoks from active service. The state of one of the three surviving Orlan ekranoplans, on display near the Moscow airport., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia Beyond that, it’s also unclear how committed Russia is to this project or whether it might end up shelved in favor of other defense priorities. The county has continually pushed back projects to build larger traditional ships in order to free up funding for other, high-profile programs , including a host of nuclear-armed strategic weapons developments. Still, with the existing experience with the Lun and Orlan -classes, together with modern improvements in engine and airframe technology, the Russians may see ekranoplans as a relatively low-risk and cost-effective investment. The country has already been spending a not insignificant amount of time and resources on systems specifically to support its Arctic operations , as well. The Kremlin has said it wants to begin flight tests of cargo-carrying and search and rescue types by 2022 or 2023 . The armed versions could easily follow afterward or go into development at the same time as a variant of those designs. We will definitely be keeping our eyes open for the possible reappearance of missile-toting Russian ekranoplans in the Arctic or elsewhere.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",The Inside Story Of How The UK Culled Its Entire Harrier Jet Force In Just Two Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Retired Air-Vice Marshal Gary Waterfall was one of the Royal Air Force’s most senior and experienced Harrier pilots when he was selected to become the figurehead of the United Kingdom’s Joint Force Harrier from September 2009. It was the start of a historic and deeply emotional rollercoaster journey that ultimately culminated in him having to personally oversee a highly controversial decision to completely shut down British Harrier operations over a short, two month period. “I took charge of Joint Force Harrier as it came out of five years dedicated to operations in Afghanistan, with the view of getting it reconstituted, regenerated, and ready for small focused interventions from land or sea,” Waterfall told the War Zone . However, even before he assumed his new role, the lingering economic crisis of 2007-2008 was leading politicians to look at potential cost savings across the entire defense landscape. By mid-2010, the Harrier force was smack-bang in the firing-line, but removing a British-born icon that occupied a place close to the hearts of the services and public alike would not be an easy task. A Harrier GR9 carrying a Sniper advanced targeting pod and a Paveway IV precision-guided bomb., Jamie Hunter Saving money in hard times In 2010, the United Kingdom’s new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government faced a “black hole” in the defense budget that it inherited from the previous Labour Party administration. It had to find cash to fund a wealth of expensive new headline projects such as two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers — that were already underway and virtually impossible to cancel — and other immediate savings had to be made. The Ministry of Defence’s Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) is now firmly established as a five-yearly appraisal of the entire British defense landscape. It forms the basis of a frequent reassessment of capabilities against a constantly changing strategic environment. The first such review in 2010 was entitled “Securing Britain in an age of uncertainty” and it was also the first major review under the new government. The SDSR of 2010 was broadly aimed at saving money in the immediate term, while also setting a new course for the decade ahead. The government faced what the review described as “an unfunded liability of around £38 billion over the next 10 years. That is more than the entire defence budget for one year. We must start to tackle this legacy before we can begin to put defence on a sound and sustainable footing for the future.” Service chiefs vied to save as many prized assets as they could, but ultimately there was widespread resignation that there would be some serious casualties in the plans. Indeed, when the SDSR was released on Oct. 19, 2010, it contained one of the most severe rounds of cutbacks ever seen by the British military in modern times. The wording of the tumultuous SDSR laid this out in stark terms. From an air power perspective, it said the government would “retain a reduced Tornado fleet, but remove the Harrier from service in 2011 as the fast jet force moves to two operational types — Joint Strike Fighter and Typhoon. Retaining the Tornado fleet allowed a fast jet contribution to be sustained in Afghanistan and support to concurrent operations which would not have been possible if Harrier was retained instead.” Joint Force Harrier maintained the British fast jet capability in Afghanistan from 2004-2009., USAF/SSgt Aaron Allmon A British icon The decision to close down the British Harrier force almost overnight was significant in many ways. The joint Royal Air Force/Royal Navy fleet of vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft stemmed from a Cold War desire to operate from small, unprepared airstrips. It meant the aircraft could forward-deploy away from main air bases to locations less vulnerable to a potential Warsaw Pact attack. The first Harriers, also known as GR1s, entered RAF service with No.1 (Fighter) Squadron at RAF Wittering on April 1, 1969. It included very advanced equipment for its day. It was the first RAF aircraft ever to boast a head-up display (HUD), an inertial navigation system (INS), and it had a moving map display. For the Royal Navy, the Harrier became particularly significant. The ability to embark a force of capable fixed-wing multi-role combat aircraft aboard a small “Harrier carrier” was priceless. Traditional “cat-and-trap” Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing carrier operations had been sacrificed in the late 1970s. However, they were replaced by a new series of smaller carriers and a navalized Harrier was the only real option for the Royal Navy to retain a fixed-wing carrier strike capability. The Fleet Air Arm’s Sea Harrier FRS1s were developed and fielded just in time for Operation Corporate in 1982. It was to herald a historic chapter in the Harrier’s life, when Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands in an effort to reclaim the British territory in the South Atlantic, some 300 miles off the Argentine coast and 8,000 miles from Britain. Sea Harrier FRS1s and Harrier GR3s deployed to the South Atlantic for Operation Corporate., BAE Systems Archive It fell to the ‘Harrier carriers’ to spearhead the response. Both HMS Hermes and Invincible were dispatched to the South Atlantic as part of a huge naval task force, with the Sea Harrier squadrons embarked as its centerpiece. The Sea Harriers of 800 and 801 Naval Air Squadrons (NAS) were boosted by the addition of RAF Harrier GR3s. What followed, and what this small force of vertical and short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft achieved, has rightfully passed into aviation legend. The Royal Navy deployed some 28 Sea Harriers, which flew over 1,100 combat air patrols, and 90 offensive sorties. They claimed 23 Argentine aircraft “kills,” and played a pivotal role in the British victory. The Sea Harriers were retired completely by 2006, all too soon after they had received an evolutionary upgrade to the FA2 standard. This included pairing the potent Blue Vixen multi-mode radar with the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), which provided the “Shar,” as the Sea Harriers were nicknamed, with impressive beyond visual range (BVR) capabilities. Fast-forward to 2010 and the Sea Harriers had gone. The new RAF/RN Joint Force Harrier (JFH) operated the Harrier GR9. This was a very different beast to the earlier variants and had been developed in conjunction with McDonnell Douglas in the United States. A Royal Navy Sea Harrier FA2 leads a Harrier GR7 in 2005., Jamie Hunter These Harrier IIs represented a generational leap over the original Harrier. The initial British Harrier GR5 variants were swiftly upgraded to the night attack-capable GR7 standard and, eventually, they became GR9s, the ultimate British Harriers. Notably, they lacked an air-to-air radar and were, therefore, less capable in the air defense role than the Sea Harriers. However, they still boasted a wealth of new equipment including the ability to employ Raytheon Paveway IV precision-guided bomb, the Lockheed Martin Sniper advanced targeting pod, a new Terma defensive countermeasures pod and a helmet-mounted cueing system that it inherited from the Jaguar combat jet . The first upgraded Harrier GR9 was delivered to No. 1  Squadron at RAF Cottesmore in 2006 as part of a £500-million program – around $920 million in U.S. dollars at the time – that updated the avionics of 60 Harrier GR7/7As to GR9/9A standard, and 11 T10 trainers moving to T12 configuration. The “A” variant featured uprated Pegasus Mk107 engines, which provided precious extra thrust for hot and high operations and improved shipborne performance. Winds of change Operation Herrick in Afghanistan was a major focus for the Harrier force from 2004-2009, with elements of JFH having deployed to Kandahar straight after Operation Telic in Iraq in 2003. Initially planned to run for just nine months, Afghanistan evolved into a grueling five-year commitment for a relatively small force of just three front line squadrons. However, as Harrier came out of the Afghan mission, it became an immediate target for cost savings as the SDSR loomed. The continuing Afghanistan commitment passed across to the RAF’s Tornado GR4s, while the operational Harrier squadrons were all back in the United Kingdom, with the aim of regaining a robust all-around capability that had atrophied after half a decade of close air support in a warzone. The then Group Captain Gary Waterfall had flown Harriers in the RAF since 1988 and he ultimately notched-up 2,300 hours in the type, ranging from the Harrier GR3, to the GR9A. When he assumed the role of officer commanding JFH in September 2009, he had a clear vision of moving away from a focused close air support-based mission set in Afghanistan to resuming the Harrier’s full range of capabilities, from land and sea. A pilot from Joint Force Harrier wearing night-vision goggles., Jamie Hunter “We’d quite rightly not done a lot of recent work at sea because of the constant deployments to Afghanistan, but we had done some,” Waterfall said. The Harrier GR9 offered the versatility of being able to operate from short land strips, as well as embarking the Royal Navy’s small-deck aircraft carriers to spearhead the UK’s continued carrier strike capability. However, in the background, thoughts were already turning to the forthcoming SDSR. “From that September through until Christmas there was a lot of work being done on possible savings and talk of the fact that we might have to look at cutting whole capabilities,” Waterfall recalled. “Literally a couple of days before we broke-up for Christmas, the Secretary of State announced that No. 4 (Army-Cooperation) Squadron would close and that the Harrier force would relocate from Cottesmore to nearby Wittering. I think that pretty much cast the die for the eventual culling of the Harrier force.” A Harrier returns to RAF Cottesmore as the sun sets., Jamie Hunter The December 2009 statement from the then-U.K. Secretary of State for Defence Bob Ainsworth said the Harriers would be cut by one operational squadron, with Cottesmore being closed. The remaining two front line squadrons would move to the Harrier’s ancestral home at Wittering by 2011 to join the Harrier Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) as the force was rationalized and centralized. It was a move that never became a reality. When Waterfall assumed control of JFH it consisted of the RAF’s Nos. 1 and 4 Squadrons, plus a further unit known as the Naval Strike Wing, essentially an amalgamation of 800 and 801 NAS. When No. 4 Squadron was closed down as an operational unit, the number plate was retained by transferring it to the OCU. Waterfall says the cutting of the third front line unit was significant. “It took us from three to two operationally-deployable squadrons,” he explained. This was viewed as a critical reduction in mass, which had real implications regarding JFH’s ability to offer a meaningful capability to the overall combat air picture. Throughout the summer of 2010 rumours regarding what might be included in the SDSR were rife. The debate raged in the press and both the Tornado and Harrier communities were feeling the pressure of what might come in the SDSR. The bigger swing-wing Tornado GR4 had taken on the Afghanistan mission, and with a force of five front line squadrons it presented a far bigger target for cuts, depending on the level of savings that were required. Five squadrons of operationally-deployable Tornados, versus two of Harriers. Accepting the need for a significant cut in the defense budget, one of these forces would have to go. BAE Systems had started trials of the Harrier GR9 with MBDA Brimstone anti-armour missiles in 2007, but the work was never completed., Jamie Hunter Significantly, the new Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4s in RAF service still lacked meaningful ground attack capability. If the Tornado had been cut, that would have been far more significant, as it would have represented a loss of five “offensive support,” or ground attack squadrons. Moreover, Tornados boasted a wider variety of effects over the Harrier, such as the Storm Shadow cruise missile , which afforded an important strategic capability. If the RAF was to maintain an ambition for scaled warfighting, it was fairly obvious that it would be the Harriers that would go, if it made that binary cut to get rid of an entire force. A bitter blow What the Harrier bought the United Kingdom was the flexibility of being able to operate from land and sea. The question was at what price? “I think that’s why the debate raged for so long,” Waterfall said. The decision-making over what would go in the SDSR led to an increasingly fractious relationship between the RAF and the Royal Navy at senior levels. The Navy wanted to sustain a fixed-wing carrier strike capability for the follow-on Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers and the F-35, rather than culling the Harrier and taking a “capability holiday.” “I have eternal respect to all within JFH who shouldered the pressure and continued to discharge their duties professionally and in a truly joint sense,” Waterfall added. While JFH tried to continue business as usual, in the background, a battle raged as to what would survive the Treasury’s axe. “I was in the RAF Club in London about a week before the review was due to be announced, and a senior Royal Navy officer sidled up to me and said: ‘Don’t worry Gary it’s all fine, the deal’s back on the table and the Harrier force looks like being saved,'” Waterfall remembered. “That really showed how close the wire it was in terms of the lobbying that was going on.” The SDSR was due to be announced on Tuesday, Oct. 19, 2010. The day prior, Waterfall and other senior commanders were asked to assemble at RAF High Wycombe so that the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, could brief them on what the review looked like. It was a somber meeting for Waterfall as the RAF’s most senior officer told them that it was the end of not just the Harrier, but also the entire Nimrod MR2 maritime patrol fleet and the replacement MRA4 version that was in development. “I drove back to Cottesmore and arrived late, but just in time to greet Wing Commander David Haines who was Officer Commanding No. 1 Squadron, as he completed his 2,500th hour in the Harrier as he came off a night flying sortie. I met him on the flightline, he climbed down, I shook him by the hand and gave him his patch, not knowing whether that was his last hour flying the aeroplane,” Waterfall said. “Everyone knew where I’d been that day. He said: ‘Thanks very much boss, so, what’s happening?’ I couldn’t say a word. I wasn’t allowed to say anything until after it was announced in parliament at 3:30 PM the following day.” Harriers in action at RAF Cottesmore., Jamie Hunter “I’ll never forget, I got home and the news at 10:00 PM came on the TV. It basically started leaking the fact that the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was going to be withdrawn,” Waterfall continued. SDSR also said either HMS Ocean or HMS Illustrious would be decommissioned following a short study to determine which offered the most effective “helicopter platform.” Without the carriers, it made the Harrier’s case look very weak indeed. The next morning, Secretary of State for Defense Liam Fox was interviewed on breakfast TV and he essentially broke the news about the carrier strike “capability holiday” until the introduction of the F-35. Concerned about how this would affect the Harrier personnel, Waterfall canceled all flying that was planned for the day and insisted that JFH should be told of the news by a senior officer before the official announcement in Parliament that afternoon. Air Vice-Marshal Greg Bagwell, Air Officer Commanding No.1 Group, headed to Cottesmore by helicopter and landed in front of the officer’s mess, away from growing media outside the airfield. “We assembled and Greg Bagwell said ‘I’ve been cleared to tell you in advance the Harrier force will close with immediate effect,’” Waterfall recalls. Ironically, the government’s decision to retire the Harrier prematurely was announced almost 50 years to the day that test pilot Bill Bedford hovered the Hawker P1127 Harrier prototype for the very first time at Dunsfold, in Surrey, on Oct. 21, 1960. “I wrote a letter and printed copies to be given to everyone as they left work that evening,” Waterfall said. “It explained that I didn’t know what was going to happen next. From an air force perspective, why carry on flying? Why take any more risk? I told everyone that we wouldn’t fly for at least a week and that they should all get themselves sorted out and ready for the future, whatever that may hold. Feelings and emotions were running high. I got all the Harrier OCU students together and told them that none of them would fly the Harrier again. There was simply no cost-benefit to it.” “It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done — cutting them off in their prime.” A Harrier GR9 in the Markings of No. 4 Squadron, which had become the Operational Conversion Unit., Jamie Hunter Planning the final act Desperate to make the force proud and give the Harrier a good send-off, Waterfall and his team started to devise a plan for how the squadrons could continue to safely fly. “Why? Because we were in charge of a nation’s icon,” he explained. “It was important to me we laid her to rest with respect and dignity. But that couldn’t be done overnight.” After a week of tense negotiations with senior officers, Waterfall was told that the Harrier force could continue flying. The Harriers had to cease operations by the end of 2010, so Waterfall targeted pre-Christmas for a final farewell event at Cottesmore and the final flights. It gave the force just under two-months to wind down operations, decommission the aircraft, and prepare the assigned personnel for the future. “I told the squadrons to pick up as many air-land integration slots as possible in order to relieve the burden on Tornado force, so we were directly contributing to defense output. For all of the pilots, engineers, air traffickers, it was about getting them as many qualifications as possible before we stopped flying. I told the two junior pilots on No. 1 Squadron to get themselves combat-ready, because that way they’d only require a quick conversion course in order to move to the Tornado. Had they not been combat-ready they would have been required to undertake an entire OCU. It’s not so much about flying the aircraft, it’s more about learning the role of ground attack.” Waterfall mandated “measured flying,” with no night flying, and certainly no risk-taking. The Royal Navy wanted to take some jets back to sea for one final embarkation. This was agreed, but Waterfall insisted the embarkation had to be jointly executed between the Air Force and the Navy. A Harrier GR7A departs HMS Ark Royal after the final embarkation., Crown Copyright/Royal Navy Off the coast of Newcastle in northeast England at 11:55 AM on Nov. 19, 2010, a Harrier GR9 landed on the flight deck of HMS Ark Royal for the last time as Captain Jerry Kyd looked on. When one of the jets arrived with a “for sale” sign in the windscreen it caused serious concern at the highest levels in the services. Indeed, the whole retirement event was placed in jeopardy amid RAF concerns that emotions were running too high. On the afternoon of Nov. 24, the four Harriers launched from the ship as she cruised the North Sea. The last pilot to take off was Lieutenant Commander James Blackmore, Officer Commanding ‘A’ Flight, No 1(F) Squadron. Like many of his Harrier colleagues, Blackmore went on to an exchange posting with the U.S. Navy to fly F/A-18E/F Super Hornets in order to retain that “corporate knowledge” of fixed-wing carrier operations, which would ultimately support the United Kingdom’s regeneration of carrier strike with HMS Queen Elizabeth and the F-35B. The final day Bitterly cold winter weather with ice and snow hit the United Kingdom in early December 2010, bringing havoc to the plans for the Harrier’s final retirement. Because Cottesmore had been earmarked for closure, it lacked any equipment to clear the foot of snow that blanketed its main runway. Plans for an impressive 16-ship formation of Harriers as the finale on Dec. 15 had been devised by Waterfall, along with detailed planning by Squadron Leader Dunc Mason. Luckily, nearby Wittering avoided the heavy snow and remained open, allowing the remaining pilots to fly the work-up sorties needed for the flypast. The Harrier OCU was due to leave Wittering en masse on Dec. 9 to centralize the fleet, but Cottesmore remained closed. Luckily, the conditions improved just enough to allow the eight Harriers still at Wittering to depart the following day. Gary Waterfall at the controls of the specially-painted “retro” Harrier GR9A, along with the flagships of Nos. 1 and 4 Squadrons, and the Naval Strike Wing., Jamie Hunter With Dec. 15 looming large, a 16-ship dress rehearsal mission was planned for two days before. But the weather again ruined careful plotting. Low cloud and fog meant the practice was scrapped. It was just too risky to launch 16 jets together. Instead, a sign of improving conditions allowed four specially-painted Harriers to get airborne for a final photocall above the clouds. As they returned to Cottesmore, the clouds parted and bathed the Harriers in golden light as they each touched down. The dress rehearsal was pushed to Tuesday and the weather was just about acceptable. With time running out, Waterfall gave the signal to launch. The 16 Harriers plus a safety/photo chase got airborne. “We grouped together above the cloud layer over RAF Marham, then dropped beneath the overcast and flew around Wyton, Wittering, Scampton, and Coningsby, but we just couldn’t get the 16 jets into Cottesmore for a flypast,” Waterfall remembered. As Dec. 15 dawned, the weather was again awful. Hordes of families and media assembled for the Harrier farewell under leaden skies, but notably, the top brass was absent. It was a huge day for Waterfall. He had orchestrated the send-off, including him leading the big flypast as the centerpiece, using the radio callsign “Kestrel formation”. “Big crosswinds across any sort of V/STOL flying is not ideal, especially if you have wind behind you,” he explained. “We got airborne and all joined up above the cloud in the 16-ship diamond. Harriers on the flightline at RAF Cottesmore for the final flights on December 15, 2010., Jamie Hunter “This was it, the last event. We flew a racetrack up at about 10,000 feet and waited to hear from our weather-ship. He reported ‘a couple of gaps,’ which was enough to tantalize me, but after a few moments of careful consideration I decided it just wasn’t going to be possible to fly the 16-ship over the crowds,” Waterfall said. “We split into four 4-ships and flew back for our carefully orchestrated recovery, which we had briefed in huge detail. Air traffic control did a magnificent job. 16 Harriers broke into the circuit one after another — the sky was full of Pegasus jet noise.” Gary Waterfall waves the crowds during the emotional last flights on Dec. 15, 2010. , Jamie Hunter Waterfall was the last jet to enter the hover over the runway, flying a specially-painted retro Harrier GR9A. With a 15 knot tailwind, he executed a traditional Harrier bow to the crowds as they waved flags and cheered. “I came out of the bow, and up came the gear. I turned and made a steep climb away, but had to bunt over at 700 feet to avoid going back into the cloud. Then we landed and all shut down our Pegasus engines in unison at 2:41 PM. We all walked away and didn’t look back. That was the end of it.” “It was a sad day, but the future was bright with the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers and the F-35. We had to get on the bus of change, there was no point in fighting the decision.” The day after the final flights, the Daily Telegraph ran a piece about how the Royal Navy wanted to keep 20 Harriers to retain carrier strike skills until 2020, but the plan didn’t get anywhere. The first production British Harrier II serial ZD318 was preserved at Wittering and a couple of other jets were retained for museums. However, 72 Harriers were sold to the U.S. Marine Corps for around $180 million — less than the cost of two F-35Bs—to be used as spares sources for its Harrier force. The hulks still reside in the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Having led that final 16-aircraft formation, Gary Waterfall offered his comments on the occasion to the gathered media. “Today has been full of emotion, but actually we have a real sense of pride. I love this aircraft and I’ve flown it since I was 21 years old. Aviation closed a chapter today with the demise of the Harrier force. But we have opened a new chapter and we are already looking ahead to the new Joint Strike Fighter. Today was all about retiring the Harrier with the dignity she deserves.” The 16-Harrier formation flies over RAF Wittering during the rehearsal on December 14, 2010., Jamie Hunter Waterfall went on to become an Air Vice-Marshal and eventually held the prestigious position of Air Officer Commanding No. 1 Group. He commanded the British fast-jet fleet during a period of impressive development in the Eurofighter Typhoon Force , as it became truly multi-role. He also oversaw the introduction of the F-35B , as the new joint RAF/RN Lightning Force was established in the United States in partnership with the Marine Corps. Despite the pain of retiring the entire Harrier force in just two months, the regeneration of British carrier strike started with that SDSR in 2010. Today it represents a step-change in overall capability. Yet budgets and politics still play a major role. Later this year, the next comprehensive British defense review will be revealed, now rebranded as the “Integrated Review.” It comes at a time of even worse fiscal challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking back at the SDSR in 2010 serves as a useful reminder of how long it can take to regenerate an expensive and complex organic capability such as carrier strike. Next year, the new British Carrier Strike Group will set sail for its first operational cruise. For the first time in a decade, the joint team will project British carrier-borne airpower globally once again. When it does, many will remember how the Harrier — a remarkable British-born invention — carved out an important chapter in British history, and gave rise to an aviation era that will never be forgotten.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 1, 2021",India’s First French-Built Rafale Fighters Have Finally Arrived,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Five brand-new Indian Air Force Dassault Rafale fighters recently touched down at Ambala Air Force Station in Haryana, India. The aircraft had departed from Dassault Aviation’s Bordeaux-Mérignac facility in France two days prior and made the over 5,000-mile journey supported by French tanker aircraft, with a stop-off at Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates. The delivery had been planned for May 2020, but it was slightly delayed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Rafales and their seven pilots were greeted by the Indian Air Force chief-of-staff, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on July 29. Their arrival marked the first new residents for the base since India’s first Jaguar fighter-bombers were delivered there, coincidentally, on a similar date of July 27, 1979. The Rafales are joining No. 17 Squadron “Golden Arrows” Squadron at Ambala. This is the first of at least two planned units that will fly the 36 Rafales that are currently on order as part of a €7.87-billion contract, or around $8.7 billion in U.S. dollars at the time, that was signed in 2016. All 36 aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2022 and they will be equally split with No. 101 “Falcons” Squadron, which will be re-established as the second Indian Rafale unit, based at Hashimara Air Force Station. The Indian Air Force’s Rafales are built as F3-R-standard aircraft, but they come with some fascinating bespoke additions. A Dassault-owned, test-configured Rafale B with Indian-specific modifications started flying at Istres-Le Tubé in France in August 2018. It has progressively carried as many as 14 different Indian Air Force modifications to the baseline F3-R standard aircraft. The Thales Front Sector Optronics (FSO) system is said to have been heavily upgraded for the Indian Rafales., Thales Indian Rafales feature an improved version of the Thales Front Sector Optronics (FSO) system, which includes SAGEM infra-red search-and-track (IRST). They also feature the Elbit Display and Sight Helmet (DASH), a modified radar altimeter for flying in mountainous terrain , plus a cold start engine capability for high-altitude airfield operations. They also include software modifications for the RBE2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A new low-band podded jammer and a towed radar decoy are also being added, according to Angad Singh, an analyst at the Observer Research Foundation , in New Delhi. The additional Indian modifications are being added under a concurrent design, modification, test, and certification schedule. “Everything will be integrated and certified around the time the last jets are ready for delivery [in April 2022]. At which point modification kits will be shipped out and all jets will be brought up to the same specification,” Singh added. An MBDA diagram illustrating the Indian Rafale weapons package., MBDA The weapons package that accompanies the Rafale procurement includes the MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM), both infre-red and radar-guided versions of the MICA Multi-Mission Air-to-Air Missiles, and the Scalp long-range cruise missile . Shortly before the delivery of the first five aircraft, it was announced that the Indian Air Force would also procure the Sagem HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range), also known as Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM) , to meet an urgent operational requirement for the new Rafales amid a serious face-off against China . These weapons would be ideally suited to taking out buried targets in mountainous locations such as Eastern Ladakh . The Indian Air Force previously planned to integrate the Rafael SPICE (Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective) weapon on its Rafales in-country. According to Singh this weapon was selected on cost grounds, however, the pressing requirement has resulted in the Air Force opting for a ready-baked solution for the Rafale in HAMMER. The Rafale F3 variant is now France’s primary nuclear-capable combat aircraft. The Indian Rafales are rumored to be similarly capable, but India has never confirmed if that capability exists in any of its fighter aircraft.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a hard line against Pakistan, with recent aerial skirmishes being leveraged to support the Rafale procurement. Modi himself said that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s February 2019 shoot down when he was at the controls of an upgraded MiG-21 Bison would not have happened had he been flying a Rafale . India’s long-running fighter procurement saga started under the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) program, which dates back to 2004. The protracted effort has been run alongside the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) project, which is a light strike fighter built by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL). The Tejas is now entering service with a pair of squadrons after significant development delays. A concurrent development program will see India’s 36 Rafales fully capable by 2022., Dassault/G. Gosset India’s MMRCA project was set against the replacement of its aging MiG-21 Bisons and MiG-27s, the latter of which was retired at the end of 2019. An initial competition included the Rafale, along with the Eurofighter, Gripen, F-16, MiG-35, and Super Hornet. India shortlisted the Rafale and the Eurofighter in April 2011, and after a long and exhaustive evaluation process, the French fighter was declared the winner on January 31 the following year. MMRCA was set as a 126-aircraft requirement, and it mandated that 108 jets should be built locally by HAL. However, after several rounds of negotiations, the MMRCA program broke down in April 2015. Instead, India said it would purchase 36 Rafales under a government-to-government contract, but with no local production. A contract for 36 Rafales was signed in New Delhi on September 23, 2016, and it included a possible follow-on sale of 36 additional aircraft. The initial batch includes 28 single-seat Rafale EH models and eight two-seat DHs. France has proved a reliable partner for India, having participated in a number of fighter projects, including the supply of Mirage 2000 fighters. Dassault is also currently supporting a comprehensive upgrade effort for India’s Mirages. A two-seat Indian Rafale DH., Dassault/G. Gosset First Indian Rafale to fly was DH serial RB008, which made its maiden flight on October 30, 2018, from Bordeaux-Mérignac. This aircraft is supporting the test and certification of the India-specific enhancements. Rafale DH serial RB001 followed by making its first flight at Mérignac on July 17, 2019. This two-seater was formally handed over to the Indian government on October 8, 2019, at an event hosted by Dassault chairman and CEO Eric Trappier with guests including India’s defense minister Shri Rajnath Singh. With MMRCA abandoned and at least 36 Rafales on order, India has now launched yet another fighter tender. On April 6, 2018, it issued a Request for Information (RFI) for “approximately 110 aircraft,” roughly one quarter of which it said should be two-seaters. New Delhi specified that no more than 15% of the jets would be manufactured by the winning manufacturer, with the balance being built locally under the “Make in India” initiative. The key points of the RFI include an openness for single and twin-engine jets , a requirement for air superiority missions at 20,000ft (6,096m), low-level ingress, strike and egress at 492ft [150m]) and anti-shipping capabilities have been mandated. In addition to an option for more Rafales, Boeing is set to offer either the Advanced F-15 or Block III Super Hornet , with Lockheed Martin touting a tailored F-16 design dubbed the F-21 . In addition are the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Saab JAS 39 Gripen E, the MiG-35 “Fulcrum ,” and the Su-35 “Flanker.” A Rafale EH receives fuel during the transit flight to France France to India., Indian Air Force The Indian Navy too is searching for a new fighter now that the naval variant of HAL’s LCA has been deemed unsuitable for carrier operations. The Navy says it wants a powerful twin-engine fighter that would ultimately replace its MiG-29Ks . This puts both the Rafale and the Super Hornet squarely in the running, with eyes on potential synergies with the Indian Air Force’s new fighters. The reaction to the first Rafales arriving at Ambala speaks volumes about a national perspective on the pressing need to recapitalize an ageing fighter fleet of MiG-21s, which is set against the backdrop of pressure from both China and Pakistan . The arrival of five fighters is just the first stage of a potentially huge influx of new fighters to India, which will operate from both land and sea, in the years to come. With a host of exotic optional extras added to its Rafales by the spring of 2022, the French replacement for tired Russian MiGs is shaping up to be very impressive indeed.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on May 19, 2020",We Talk To The Scientist Whose Revolutionary Power Beaming Experiment Is Flying On The X-37B,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When the U.S. Air Force’s shadowy X-37B space plane was launched on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 17, 2020 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, it carried with it a revolutionary new system designed by Dr. Paul Jaffe of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The device, known as a Photovoltaic Radio-frequency Antenna Module (PRAM), will eventually be able harvest power using solar panels and beam that power back down to Earth in the form of microwaves. While the module currently in orbit isn’t transmitting power to Earth, Jaffe and NRL investigators hope to someday be able to leverage space-based solar technologies to provide a revolutionary new source of power to nearly anywhere on the globe regardless of a lack of existing energy infrastructure. The War Zone recently spoke with Jaffe to learn more about the PRAM, power beaming, and space solar in general. Before we get into our interview, here is a quick primer on Paul Jaffe’s research and just how revolutionary microwave energy beaming from space could be. Space-Based Solar And Microwave Power Beaming Paul Jaffe has been an Electronic Engineer at the Naval Research Lab since 1994. He began working on the original PRAM project in 2009. Jaffe would go on to earn his PhD as a result of a Doctoral Research Program while working on PRAM research. His 2013 dissertation described a “ sunlight to microwave power transmission module ” similar to the test module recently launched into orbit aboard the X-37B. Jaffe also holds a patent for “thermally efficient power conversion modules for space solar power,” granted in 2016 and assigned to the Secretary of the Navy. In 2016, Jaffe and his team were named the winners of the first-ever Department of Defense (DOD) Diplomacy, Development, and Defense (D3) Innovation Summit Pitch Challenge, an initiative designed to foster innovation and collaboration on pressing national security issues far from the battlefield. In an NRL press release announcing the award, Jaffe stated that, if found to be successful and feasible, space-based solar-to-microwave power beaming has the potential to radically change the way power is generated and distributed on Earth. “It’s hard to overstate the significance and benefits of this concept if it comes to fruition,” Jaffe said. In the same press release, Jaffe also stated that “other major powers around the world, particularly in Asia, are also investigating this idea in earnest.” Indeed, China’s state-run Academy of Space Technology tested such a system in 2019 and boasted that a fully-functional Chinese microwave beaming power station in space could be in orbit by 2050 . Such a system could potentially beam power to rectifying antennas, or rectennas, on the Earth’s surface, providing power to existing installations or to remote areas without existing power infrastructure. There are many other defense-oriented applications envisioned by the NRL. In 2010, Jaffe published the study “ Defense Applications of Space Solar Power ” in the Space, Propulsion & Energy Sciences International Forum hosted by the American Institute of Physics. In the paper, Jaffe presents a wide variety of defense applications that space-based solar power (SBSP) could augment, including providing power to a number of different installations, vessels, or distributed sensor networks, and even serving as a bistatic radar illuminator. As we cited in our previous reporting , Jaffe’s 2010 research also claimed that SBSP could be used in satellite-to-satellite power transmission or to provide UAVs with greatly extended endurance. Jaffe lists potential applications of space-based solar in his 2010 publication “A Study of Defense Applications of Space Solar Power” , American Institute of Physics More recently, Jaffe stated that the power beaming technologies involved with the PRAM module could potentially enable near-unlimited flight times on UAVs. “If we had a way to keep those drones and UAVs flying indefinitely, that would have really far-reaching implications, Jaffe said in a 2019 NRL press release . “With power beaming, we have a path toward being able to do that.” Keeping UAVs in the air indefinitely was also mentioned as a goal in 2014 by Thomas Mehlhorn, superintendent of the Naval Research Laboratory’s Plasma Physics Division. Other branches of the Armed Forces are pursuing similar technologies and concepts. Since as early as 1964, the USAF has been experimenting with power beaming and UAVs. In that year, Air Force-sponsored researchers were able to keep a small tethered helicopter aloft for ten hours powered only by a microwave power beam . NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tested the concept of beaming power to Earth from space using microwaves in 1975. More recently, in 2019, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) awarded Northrop Grumman a contract valued over $100 million to develop space solar hardware that could provide “uninterrupted, assured, and agile power to expeditionary forces operating in unimproved areas,” such as forward operating bases far from traditional energy infrastructure or fuel supply lines. “Energy is a strategic enabler and potential vulnerability for our nation and our Department of Defense,” U.S. Air Force Col. Eric Felt, director of AFRL’s Space Vehicles Directorate, said in a 2019 Air Force press release . “To ensure DoD mission success we must have the energy we need at the right place at the right time. The Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR) Project is a very interesting concept that will enable us to capture solar energy in space and precisely beam it to where it is needed,” Felt said. “SSPIDR is part of AFRL’s ‘big idea pipeline’ to ensure we continue to develop game-changing technologies for our Air Force, DoD, nation, and world.” Now that you have an idea of what this potentially groundbreaking technology is all about, let’s get to our interview with Dr. Paul Jaffe of the Naval Research Laboratory. Paul Jaffe Talks Space-Based Solar Power To help us understand this groundbreaking technology and its implications, The War Zone spoke with Dr. Paul Jaffe and the Naval Research Laboratory to discuss how the PRAM experiments are going thus far and what the future may hold for space-based solar and power beaming. Brett : Why has it taken until now to get the first hardware specifically for solar power satellites in orbit? Paul : These things definitely take time, and most of it is definitely a function of budget, like if we had 10 times as much money, obviously things would be able to go more quickly. But there is, I think, a very reasonable approach, which is “let’s start with a small amount and if that proves fruitful then we’ll add and expand from there and if it’s not as successful then we’ll investigate something else.” The original PRAM that started in 2009 was intended as a four-year program, which it was, and with that we started essentially with nothing and then ended up with a module, actually multiple modules, of two different designs, one of which we had to pass on. For the microwave conversion, we also tested those in actual space-like conditions. Now, getting from there to space is a whole other story. Between 2013 and I guess it was probably 2015, when we started this process that led to where we got to the launch [in May], there’s a whole lot that has to happen where we get more cycles of Shark Tank -like proposal and competition against other researchers and experiments. And also just like working to get something manifested, right, so we’re effectively a passenger on X-37B. We had many discussions back and forth with them about how we would be hosted and what they would provide for us and how we would behave. We are not radiating any power into space partially because it would be prospectively disruptive to the host. Right now we are radiating into an RF load, a radiofrequency load, and this allows us to measure very precisely how much energy the module is actually producing, which is obviously important for the experiment. We want to make sure that we are measuring and characterizing the efficiency accurately. To send power to the ground at microwave frequencies from lower orbit would require much larger antenna apertures than are practical to put on X-37B or on most satellites. You would probably have to do like a whole custom satellite for that and that’s much more expensive than being a passenger on a host spacecraft like we are doing for this experiment. Jaffe and the Photovoltaic Radio-frequency Antenna Module (PRAM), U.S. Navy/Jamie J. Hartman Brett : So that makes sense why you would use the X-37B for something like this than a more traditional space flight. Paul : Just to be clear, we didn’t pick the X-37B especially. We started the manifesting process in the mid-2010s, it wasn’t like, “Alright, we’re going to go in X-37B.” We briefed to the space test program, and what they do is match payloads and hosts. And they say this one would be a good fit for this because of how big it is and how much it weighs and when this one is going to launch, and how much accommodation this has. So we could have ended up conceivably on another spacecraft or even on the space station, or we looked at actually geosynchronous spacecraft, we looked at some of the ISS resupply ones. But as we got close they’re like, “Hey, we could put you on here, does that work for you?” And we looked at the trade-off and we said, “Yeah, you know, that’ll accomplish what we’re trying to do with this experiment.” The PRAM module currently in orbit., U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Brett : Do you have any data back yet from the experiments? Paul : We’ve gotten preliminary data on the order of, I think, several thousand records at this point, and we are in the process of putting it into spreadsheets and analyzing it, trying to see what’s happening. So far, things are looking really good. They’re comparable to the testing we did on the ground. One of the things that you might have seen, I don’t know how much you would’ve delved into my 2013 thesis, but it’s important for solar-powered satellites to generally be pretty efficient. The most important metric is what’s called specific power or watts per kilogram, and that intuitively makes sense, because if you’re going to be putting something into space, you want to get as much power down as you can, with putting the least amount of stuff in space. So if you think about the specific power watts per kilogram, it’s very important for that to be high. If your hardware is more efficient, it’s easier for that specific power to be high. And to have the specific power and efficiency both be optimized, you want to operate your electronics where they are most efficient under the temperature and illumination conditions that result in that. Because the amount of power coming out of the solar panel changes, and we’re driving the radio frequency electronics so there’s actual power transmission, you want to try to match everything together so that the maximum power is coming out of the solar ray at the same level that the RF electronic can convert at most efficiently. All these things have to be matched, and they all have to stay matched at the equilibrium temperature. This is one of the big things for PRAM, is like finding that equilibrium point, understanding it, understanding the thermal performance, understanding how hot the solar panel’s getting, how hot the RF electronics are getting, how hot the antenna aperture would be getting if we had one and trying to match those things all up. A lot of the testing we did on the ground was to find this point, but we could only simulate the space environment and the solar conditions to a certain degree of fidelity. So one of the biggest things we’re getting out of the X-37B experiment, is since we’re actually testing this in space, we’re going to validate our operating point, and the assumptions we made of the equilibrium temperatures. For any future solar power satellite system, it’s going to be super important to understand these points and to be able to engineer to them and to be able to show that you can operate at this and you can actually get the system power and efficiency this way. Brett : How much dwell time relative to a point on the ground do you have per orbit? Paul: If you’re thinking about a solar power satellite system in the future, the answer to that question is going to depend totally on the orbit that the satellite is. So if it’s in geosynchronous orbit, which is where most of the solar power satellite systems that have been proposed to exist in, it’s going to be in sunlight for more than 99% of the time during the year and it will have continuous 24/7 ground coverage obviously, while in sunlight, of a pretty large swath of the Earth, like in excess of a quarter of the Earth is where it could send the power beam. Now a power beam won’t cover a quarter of the Earth, it’ll send it probably to a specific location. But that would be available close to 24/7, 365. There are periods around the equinoxes at local midnight when the satellite would go into eclipse for some period of minutes, I think it might be slightly longer than an hour. There’s a number of analyses and stuff have been done on these things. This is all for a single satellite, so if you have a single satellite in a lower orbit, the coverage will vary. And there’s many different orbits lower or otherwise, but you can envision that instead of focusing just on a single satellite, that you would likely build a constellation. If you do judicious constellation design, you can ensure that no matter where you are at any point in time, that you could have power provided by a given satellite. Brett: You mentioned that keeping UAVs in the air indefinitely is one of the potential applications of this technology. Is that something you’re looking at specifically with the PRAM module? Paul: Power beaming and space solar are constantly conflated. Power beaming is just moving energy without using wires or moving mass. So you could power UAV from the ground using power beaming, you could power a UAV from another aircraft using power beaming. You can power a UAV from space using power beaming. You could use power beaming to get energy to the permanently shadowed craters on the moon, or a whole range of different places. So the connection between PRAM and power UAVs is really only through the fact that PRAM is part of the system that is envisioned to use power beaming. Space solar depends on power beaming in almost all of its incarnations, but power beaming is a totally separate technology that has many applications that have nothing to do with space solar, or even with space necessarily. Because you can’t have space solar without power beaming, it makes a lot of sense to do the power beaming research first, right? Power beaming makes a lot of sense as a place to focus because without that being more mature, space solar is just harder to justify; and it’s harder to design a system, a concept that makes sense because there are just too many unknowns. Brett: What does the future of space solar look like? Paul: The data we get from that is going to inform these efforts moving toward the next generation that will be built, and then the power beaming work, likewise, will inform whether it makes sense to pursue these other applications, the ones that use laser power beams or some other power beam. And along the way, we’re always looking carefully at the nearer term applications, of which there are many for power beaming. 20 years ago, you wouldn’t have thought about wirelessly charging your phones using the Qi standard or charging pad or something. As power beaming starts to become more of a technology unto its own, I think we’ll see a lot more applications. And there’s a lot of startups even within the last year or so that think they have the secret sauce that’s going to make space solar economically viable. A lot of whom don’t want their existence known just yet. I think that if solar powered satellites become a thing, there’s a couple paths they could take. This is another thing where history is kind of useful to look at, where if we were in 1950 and I was like, “Hey, we should be able to make it so that people can have a little handheld thing and we’ll have this constellation of a dozen satellites, each of which will have its own atomic clock and they’ll beam signals down to the ground, and we’ll do a bunch of math on the device, and they’ll tell people no matter where they are in the world, where they are,” you would think that I was crazy. In 1960, not only was even getting a satellite into space very difficult, but no one had put an atomic clock on a satellite at that point. And all of those things incrementally were advanced until the point where we are today, where we take GPS navigation kind of for granted. Development for solar powered satellites might unfold like GPS, but it also might unfold like communication satellites where Congress recognized like, “Hey, there’s a lot of utilities to be had here, and we’ll pass the Comsat Act and set up the development framework that will let industry take the lead on this.” GPS was all government developed and now, other governments around the world are trying to play catch up.

The War Zone staff,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Dramatic Photos Emerge Online Showing What A Chinook Looks Like After A Power Line Strike,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images have emerged on social media that show the damage inflicted by power lines on a Royal Air Force Chinook. The aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing in a field on Tuesday evening, July 28, 2020, near the village of Llangynin, in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the United Kingdom. The heavy-lift helicopter was on a routine low-level training mission from its home base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, England when the incident occurred. A statement from the RAF said the helicopter sustained “minor damage,” and luckily only one member of the crew suffered “minor injuries due to some broken glass.” The helicopter has clearly received some pretty hefty lacerations to its nose and windscreen, with the incident resulting in a power cut in the local village. Check out the images in the tweet below. It’s not clear if the Chinook hit the powerlines after it suffered a technical issue or whether the need to land in the field was triggered by a low-level wire strike. Flying low-level missions is a standard tactic for Chinook crews. Despite the size of this helicopter, it is agility allows pilots to get down very low if operating in high-threat situations. However, powerlines present an ever-present for helicopters flying at those altitudes, especially at night. RAF Chinooks regularly fly missions at low level., Crown Copyright/SAC Connor Payne RAF Chinooks don’t feature wire-cutters, however, it’s a common safety modification for helicopters that routinely operate at low altitude. These safety systems can sever wires in the event of an accidental collision, theoretically reducing the risk of them catastrophically damaging the airframe and the rotor system. This AW159 Wildcat features a small wire-cutter above the cockpit., Jamie Hunter Engineers were immediately dispatched to the scene to help with the recovery effort, and to assess the site and determining how to best retrieve the Chinook from the Welsh countryside. The Pembrokeshire Herald reported that “helicopters are being brought in to assist with the recovery operation,” according to a source it said was close to the incident, adding: “with operations expected to commence at first light.” Whatever the reason for the wire strike, which will be determined by an ongoing investigation, the incident would undoubtedly have been a shocking moment for the crew. Thankfully, they all escaped without major injuries. Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com The War Zone staff Around The Globe Europe News & Features United Kingdom"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 15, 2021","Australia, Serbia Emerge As First Potential T-7A Red Hawk Jet Trainer Export Customers","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s T-7A Red Hawk jet trainer , which it developed together with Swedish aviation firm Saab for the U.S. Air Force, is already generating interest on the international market. The T-7A, which could also have a future as a light combat aircraft , is now officially in the running to replace the Royal Australian Air Force’s BAE Hawk jet trainers and could be an option to supplant the Serbian Air Force’s G-4 Super Galeb jet trainers and J-22 Orao ground attack planes. Boeing officially announced that it had submitted the T-7A for Australia AIR 6002 Phase 1 future Lead-In Fighter Training System (LIFTS) competition on July 30, 2020, according to FlightGlobal . This was five days after Nenad Miloradovic, Serbia’s Acting Assistant Minister of Defense for Material Resources, said his country was exploring the possibility of buying Red Hawks in a televised interview, which Jane’s was first to report on. “The T-7, which is scalable, interoperable and configurable, is ideally suited to address the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) next-generation frontline fast-jet aircraft training requirements,” Boeing said in a statement to FlightGlobal regarding the Australian LIFTS program. “No other training system in the world today will better develop the skills required to operate the RAAF’s most advanced frontline aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, EA-18G Growler and the F-35 ,” Chuck Dabundo, Boeing’s Vice President for the T-7 program, added. It’s worth noting that the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler are both also Boeing products. The RAAF is also an operator of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and is working with the company’s Australia-based division on an advanced loyal wingman-type drone effort, known as the Airpower Teaming System, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The RAAF is looking to replace its entire fleet of approximately 33 BAE Hawk Mk 127 Lead-in Fighter (LIF) jet trainers, which it first ordered in 1997. Last year, the U.K.-based manufacturer completed an upgrade program for all of these jets, which included a improved electronic warfare system, as well as Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning (EGPWS) and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) suites. Though these aircraft don’t have a radar of their own, they also have updated radar emulation capabilities when combined with podded systems, such as the Air Combat Manoeuvring Instrumentation (ACMI) pod. The aircraft have new glass cockpits with digital multi-function displays, as well. A Royal Australian Air Force BAE Hawk Mk 127., Ian Creek via Wikimedia The upgraded Mk 127s have a configuration very similar to the Hawk T2s , originally known as Mk 128s, that the U.K. Royal Air Force flies. It’s interesting to note that Northrop Grumman had initially planned to submit the T2 to the U.S. Air Force’s T-X competition, but ultimately went with a clean sheet design after deciding that the modernized Hawk could not meet that program’s requirements . The Boeing-Saab T-7A was the winner of the T-X competition in 2018. Australia hopes to have picked a winner for its LIFTS competition in the next few years and have all of the new jet trainers delivered by 2033. Previous estimates have said that the entire procurement effort, which could include various ancillary items and services, could cost between $4 and $5 billion Australian dollars , or between around $2.85 billion and $3.56 billion at the present rate of conversion. The U.S. Air Force is only slated to receive its first production T-7As in 2023. Serbia is also in the process of exploring replacement options for its G-4 Super Galebs and J-22 Oraos, both of which were developed by SOKO in the former Yugoslavia during the Cold War. SOKO designed the G-4 on its own, but crafted the J-22 together with Romania’s Avioane Craiova. The J-22 first entered Yugoslav service in 1978, with the G-4 arriving five years later. The Serbia Air Force inherited examples of both of these aircraft, among many other types, after the breakup of Yugoslavia, which began in 1991. That Serbia is looking at the T-7A as one possible replacement for its G-4s makes good sense. The single-engine G-4 is roughly comparable to many other jet trainers of its era, including early generations of the BAE Hawk. The Red Hawk would offer a substantial increase in overall capability and performance over the Super Galebs in lead-in and advanced jet trainer roles. A Serbia Air Force G-4 Super Galeb., Rob Schleiffert via Wikimedia However, if the Serbian Air Force were to adopt the T-7A, or a variant or derivative thereof, as a replacement for the J-22, it would make the country the first to operate the aircraft in a dedicated combat role. The J-22 is a ground-attack aircraft that can also carry out tactical reconnaissance missions when carrying a pod equipped with visual and infrared cameras. The jet has an internally-mounted 23mm GSh-23 twin-barrel automatic cannon and can carry various weapons on any of five external hardpoints, two under each wing and one under the fuselage centerline. A two-seat NJ-22 variant, but showing an array of different weapons that it, along with the single-seat versions, can carry., Srđan Popović via Wikimedia Serbia didn’t come to the idea of using a version of the T-7A in this role, either. There has already been talk for years, as The War Zone has explored in the past , about how the Red Hawk offers the growth potential to serve as a light fighter jet with a robust ground-attack capability. Boeing itself highlighted this again just this month , suggesting that the aircraft could be a good and relatively low-cost choice for countries looking to replace aging light jet combat aircraft, such as Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs and Franco-German Alpha Jets . Both of those Cold War-era aircraft remain in widespread use around the world. The G-4s also have a limited secondary air-to-ground capability. It is possible that Serbia could acquire a single trainer-attack-type variant to replace both those jets and the J-22s. “These are the initial steps in developing new capabilities as no such capital acquisition is realized overnight,” Miloradovic said in his interview, according to Jane’s . “The [T-7A] aircraft itself is supersonic and features modern avionics, and as such would be able to entirely replace our ground attack aviation and being multirole would also be able to support our [MiG-29 Fulcrum] interceptors.” Beyond the Red Hawk’s capabilities and performance, any foreign customer would be able to benefit from the significant investments that the U.S. government has already made in the design, as well as the supply chains to support it, all of which will help reduce the jet’s unit cost and what it takes to operate and maintain it. The U.S. Air Force has already said it will buy at least 351 examples and possibly up to 475 of the T-7As, which are set to be a major component of its future pilot training programs , if nothing else, for years to come. All told, the T-7A Red Hawk’s future on the export market is already looking very bright. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air T-7 Trainers"
Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 8, 2020",The Night A Mysterious Drone Swarm Descended On Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the news has been filled with claims that strange unidentified craft with unexplainable capabilities are appearing over highly sensitive U.S. installations and assets as of late, a much less glamorous, more numerous, and arguably far more pressing threat has continued to metastasize in alarming ways—that posed by lower-end and even off-the-shelf drones. Less than a year ago and just days after the stunning drone attacks on Saudi Arabia’s most critical energy production infrastructure deep in the heart of that highly defended country, a bizarre and largely undisclosed incident involving a swarm of drones occurred on successive September evenings in 2019. The location? America’s most powerful nuclear plant, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station situated roughly two dozen miles west of Phoenix, near Tonopah, Arizona. In a trove of documents and internal correspondences related to the event, officials from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) described the incident as a “drone-a-palooza” and said that it highlighted concerns about the potential for a future “adversarial attack” involving small unmanned aircraft and the need for defenses against them. Even so, the helplessness and even cavalier attitude toward the drone incident as it was unfolding by those that are tasked with securing one of America’s largest and most sensitive nuclear facilities serves as an alarming and glaring example of how neglected and misunderstood this issue is. What you are about to read is an unprecedented look inside a type of event that is less isolated in nature than many would care to believe. A Rapidly Accelerating Threat Troubling incidents of protracted activity by swarms of drones, including a series of very strange incidents in Colorado and neighboring states last year that the mainstream media was quick to blow off without any real evidence to prompt such a dismissal, are occurring over and near some of America’s most critical infrastructure. These events are occurring as lower-end and lower-performance unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have become weaponized to increasingly remarkable degree in recent years. Even those built-in sheds in the middle of warzones have been employed with not only deadly, but also a highly disruptive effects . As we mentioned a moment ago, drones have even inflicted major damage to one of the world’s richest and most heavily defended country’s cash cow—oil production. They have also been used in an attempt to assassinate a country’s ruler. And yes, the potential for them to be used for similar purposes exists right here in the United States, as well. Even as lower-end drones that are armed with explosives and capable of precision attacks are being mass-produced overseas and America’s adversaries are openly perfecting far more complex swarm capabilities , the U.S. military and federal agencies are desperately trying to play catch-up to the threat even though they had years to proactively work to nullifying it before its inevitable manifestation. It wasn’t before weaponized drones were careening into and dropping bomblets on Iraq soldiers’ heads during the Battle of Mosul that the U.S. military had no choice but to begin to take the issue seriously. Today, American soldiers deal with the ominous presence of drones overhead and even dropping munitions daily in overseas hotspots. America’s top military commander in the Middle East is all too aware of this compounding threat and the lack of resources being placed on countering it: “I argue all the time with my Air Force friends that the future of flight is vertical and it’s unmanned,” U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said at an event hosted by the Middle East Institute last week . “I’m not talking about large unmanned platforms, which are the size of a conventional fighter jet that we can see and deal with, as we would any other platform.” “I’m talking about the one you can go out and buy at Costco right now in the United States for a thousand dollars, four quad, rotorcraft, or something like that that can be launched and flown,” he continued. “And with very simple modifications, it can make made into something that can drop a weapon like a hand grenade or something else.” … “Right now, the fact of the matter is we’re on the wrong side of that equation.” With all this in mind, it isn’t a matter of if similar events will occur in the homeland, it’s a matter of when and of what scope. As it sits now, all the warning signs are there, especially in terms of where mysterious swarms of drones are popping up without explanation. Two Nights In Late September Douglas D. Johnson , a volunteer researcher affiliated with the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) , was able to obtain a large number of internal documents regarding the September drone incidents at Palo Verde from the NRC via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and kindly shared them with The War Zone . It is important to note that these documents primarily reflect the NRC’s perspective rather than that of any other U.S. government agencies at the federal, state, or local levels. The Arizona Public Service Company, which operates the Palo Verde Generating Station, is also a private entity not directly subject to the FOIA. Johnson did also submit a FOIA request for relevant documents to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). DHS said it found 32 pages of documents related to the incident from CISA, but declined to release them, citing exemptions related to law enforcement activities. Another 17 pages of relevant records are still undergoing a review by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). This particular story starts on Sept. 29, 2019. Shortly before 11:00 PM local time at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Daphne Rodriguez, an Acting Security Section Chief at the plant, called the duty officer at NRC’s Headquarters Operations Center (HOC). Rodriguez reported that a number of drones were flying over and around a restricted area near the nuclear power plant’s Unit 3, which houses one of its three pressurized water reactors. A page from a Palo Verde visitor’s guide from 2016 showing a basic map of the facility and offering additional information about the various controlled areas therein., Arizona Public Service Company Thomas Kendzia, a Headquarters Emergency Response Officer (HERO) at the HOC, subsequently created an incident report in the NRC’s Security Information Database (SID). The HOC’s policy is to have one Headquarters Operations Officer (HOO) and a Headquarters Emergency Response Officer (HERO) on duty, 24 hours a day, every day, with no exceptions. “The designated HOO for the shift has the primary responsibility for receiving reports and determining appropriate actions. The HERO counterpart role provides procedural, communications, and administrative support,” according to a 2018 NRC Office of the Inspector General’s report on headquarters staffing issues. The key portions of the SID entry that Kendzia created, which was then updated as time went on, are as follows: “Officer noticed several drones (5 or 6) flying over the site. The drones are circling the 3 unit site inside and outside the Protected Area. The drones have flashing red and white rights and are estimated to be 200 to 300 hundred feet above the site. It was reported the drones had spotlights on while approaching the site that they turned off when they entered the Security Owner Controlled Area. Drones were first noticed at 2050 MST and are still over the site as of 2147 MST. Security Posture was normal, which was changed to elevated when the drones were noticed. The Licensee notified one of the NRC resident inspectors. As of 0237 EST, no drones have been observed at the site since 2230 MST. Officers believe drones were over 2 feet in diameter. Personnel at the HOC also then called the duty officer at the NRC’s Intelligence Liaison and Threat Assessment Branch (ILTAB), a division of the Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response. ILTAB’s mission is to “provide strategic and tactical intelligence warning and analysis of all threats to the US commercial nuclear sector, and serve as NRC’s liaison and coordination staff to the US intelligence and law enforcement communities,” according to a 2010 briefing . Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station as seen from the air. , Cuhlik/wikicommons That wasn’t the end of it, though, for Palo Verde. The very next night, Ismael Garcia, a Security Supervisor at the plant called ILTAB to report another drone incursion over sensitive areas. This new information was originally added as an update to the previous incident, but the HERO on duty, Donald Norwood, eventually set up a new, separate SID entry, which again received additional updates as the situation progressed, with the key details being as follows: Four (4) drones were observed flying beginning at 2051 MST [on Sept. 30, 2019] and continuing through the time of this report (2113 MST). As occurred last night, the drones are flying in, through, and around the owner controlled area, the security owner controlled area, and the protected area. Also, as last night, the drones are described as large with red and white flashing lights. Spotlights have not been noted tonight. The licensee has not changed their security posture. The licensee continues to monitor the drones. As of 0355 EDT, no drones have been observed at the site since before 0020 MST. LLEA [local law enforcement agency] surveyed the area and were unable to locate drones on the ground or anyone controlling the drones. The licensee notified FAA (both Phoenix and Albuquerque), FBI, DHS, and the Maricopa [County, Arizona] Sheriff’s Office. The licensee notified the NRC Resident lnspector. Palo Verde security officials had filed their own report on this second incident, which eventually made its way to NRC. It included the following narrative: “On 9/30/19 at approximately 2051 hours, it was reported by a Security Team Leader that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were approaching the plant from the east (true east). The hours of darkness made it difficult to estimate the altitude at which the UAVs were flying. Two Security Team Leaders [redacted]. The UAVs appeared to have been launching from behind the mountain range at the intersection of Southern Ave and 361 Ave just east of the plant. Four UAVs were confirmed to have been spotted at one time flying northwest over Unit 1 and returning northeast over Unit 3. LLEA (MCSO) [Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office] deputies were dispatched to the area of the mountain range with a Security Unit Team Leader in an attempt to determine the location of the UAV operators, but were unsuccessful. No other UAVs were observed after approximately 2300 hours.” “These UAVs are believed to have been the same UAVs that flew over the plant the night before on 9/29/19 at approximately 2020 hours (refer to CR# 14095 for details).” “All required notifications were made IAW [in accordance with] 20DP-0SK49 Security Integrated Response Plan and additional Security contingency measure [sic] were implemented IAW 21SP-0SK11 Security Contingencies. No additional compensatory measures are required IAW 20SP-0SK08 Compensatory Measures for Loss of Security Equipment/Effectiveness.” Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station., Google Earth The mountain range to the east of the plant. The facility is located in a desolate area roughly 24 miles from the very eastern edge of Phoenix’s urban sprawl. Regardless of its lonely locale, millions live within 50 miles of the plant. , Google Earth A Futile Distraction? Curiously, one of ILTAB’s top priorities seemed to be getting the staff at Palo Verde, or anyone from any other NRC-licensed facility, to stop calling them in the middle of the night about reported drones. “Our folks got calls last night at 2am, which is correct per the procedure,” Laura Pearson, ILTAB’s chief, wrote an Email on Sept. 30 to Silas Kennedy, the Chief of the Operations Branch within the Division of Preparedness and Response of NRC’s Office of Nuclear Security. “However, I am wondering if there is a way to cut down on calls in the middle of the night for issues that ILTAB can’t add value to,” Pearson continued. “The call last night about drones is a good example-in the middle of the night, ILTAB can’t really do anything about it anyway apart from say ‘ok thanks’ and handle it in the morning.” Pearson raised concerns that the late-night calls “interrupts sleep” and that her staff would then arrive at work “either groggy or come in late, so there’s negative returns on it from an, organizational perspective.” Kennedy told her that ILTAB could, on its own accord, change its requirements for when personnel at nuclear sites would need to immediately contact the duty officer to report an incident. Before the second drone incursion had even occurred on Sept. 30, ILTAB was already working on revising its instructions from when the HOC staff should contact them. Pearson also asked Kennedy if there was a way to halt all calls about drones in and around Palo Verde, specifically. “There is nothing ILTAB can do about it at night, and if my staff has to be woken up about it each night, it will start to cause other problems for us. We have a small staff and having people out or late because they are not getting adequate sleep will impact our ability to get work done,” she wrote in another Email on Oct. 1. “Please place a note in the turnover log stating ‘Until further notice, do not call the ILTAB duty officer from 10 pm until 6 am for drone flyovers of Palo Verde. Send an email to ILTAB in the morning. This is specific to Palo Verde only. For all other licensed facilities, continue to follow HOO procedures until changes are made,’” Kennedy subsequently instructed other staff at the HOC. At that time, per a subsequent Email, the list of instances in where HOOs or HEROs were supposed to immediately notify ILTAB included, but were not necessarily limited to the following: Ongoing security events. (basis for the drone calls since they were loitering in the OCA [owner controlled area]) Verbal/telephone/e-mail threats. Bomb threats. Threats to site employees. Fence jumpers/intrusions. Security barrier penetrations. Discovery of weapons or explosives. Event involving law enforcement response/investigation on the owner-controlled area (OCA) or watercraft exclusion areas. Event involving FBI investigation. Security-related media attention at any level. Sabotage/Tampering. Other NRC officials appear to have been unsure as to how they could necessarily help in responding to the incidents, in general. “[Palo Verde] Site security was unable to observe any identifying markings on the UAVs themselves or locate the operator(s), so I do not know how much additional investigation can be undertaken,” an Intelligence Specialist at the Response Coordination Branch for NRC’s Region IV, whose name is redacted, wrote in a separate Email. Inconclusive Investigation The situation on the ground at Palo Verde was completely different. By Oct. 2, officials at the plant were working together resident NRC personnel, as well as local law enforcement, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A subsequent Email shows that the FBI’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Coordinator was specifically contacted in relation to the drones. They were also in the process of deploying unspecified drone detection systems acquired from a company identified in one Email as “Area Armor.” This is very likely an error in referring to Aerial Armor , which describes itself as having “been at the forefront of the drone defense industry since 2015 as a service provider and systems integrator for C-UAS solutions.” The company’s website also says “On countless deployments, we’ve worked hand in hand with local law enforcement, FAA, FBI, DHS and private security professionals throughout the US.” “This technology apparently has a 13-mile radius and can determine the specific point from which the UAVs were launched so that LLEA / site security can locate the operator(s),” a Region IV Response Coordination Branch Intelligence Specialist, with their name redacted, possibly the same individual referenced earlier, wrote in an Email. “I confirmed with the licensee that they have coordinated the use of this counter drone technology with FAA, and they informed me that this technology only locates the UAVs; it does not interfere with the flight pattern of those UAVs in any way.” Aerial Armor supplies drone detection systems from various manufacturers, including small radars and ones that work by spotting and tracking the unmanned aircraft’s signal emissions. Some of them also include full-motion electro-optical and infrared video cameras that can be slewed to visually monitor targets of interest after the other sensors spot them. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9ZfFF79urBw It’s not entirely clear what drove the decision at the time by the Palo Verde staff to set up systems to detect rather than knock down the drones. It’s possible that the detections systems were the only ones readily available or that this was the established protocol for security at the plant at the time. Regardless, it underscored serious questions about what the plant operators could actually do, legally, in response to the intrusions. “At this time, the pilots are not violating any laws or regulations by flying over the plant,” Joseph Rivers, a now-retired Senior Level Advisor on Security for NRC, wrote in an Email on Oct 2. “Since drones are aircraft and they are not violating a law, what is the action that can be taken legally if they locate the operator?” Mark Lombard, the Deputy Director of NRC’s Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, asked in response. The next Email in the chain is unrelated to that question and the one after that is redacted entirely. The last message in this particular string is also heavily censored, though it does say that “NEI has a drone working group and we will bring these examples to them.” NEI very likely refers to the Nuclear Energy Institute , a nuclear energy trade association and lobby group in the United States. It’s unclear if whoever was flying the drones was still violating FAA regulations, which ban unmanned aircraft from flying lower than 400 feet over “designated national security sensitive facilities,” which includes nuclear power plants, even if they weren’t technically breaking any laws. Arizona also has its own state law prohibiting drones from flying under 500 feet over any critical infrastructure, including power plants. Without knowing the exact altitude the drones were flying at during the incursions, it’s difficult to say what the exact legalities of the situation were. We also don’t know for sure if authorities at Palo Verde didn’t deploy counter-drone systems capable of actually knocking down unmanned aircraft later, though NRC’s officials never mention any such development in the documents The War Zone reviewed. What we do know is that by Oct. 3, with assistance from the FBI and the Department of Energy, officials at Palo Verde had begun the process of rectifying that situation and getting the airspace over the plant designated as restricted through the FAA. “DOE is working closely with FAA to designate areas over NPPs [nuclear power plants] are no-fly zones and we are working to communicate to licensees what that means,” Deputy Director Lombard wrote in an Email the following day. “At this time, we are not planning to impose new requierments [sic] on licensees, but the landscape is dynamic and changing.” Fuel assemblies in one of the plant’s three cores. , APS None of the authorities involved in subsequent investigations into the two drone incursions over Palo Verde were able to determine the operators of the drones or their intent. ILTAB followed up with other officials within NRC on Oct. 28 to see if there had been any new developments and had marked the two SID entries “closed unresolved” by Nov. 25. Not An Isolated Incident Whatever the exact story of what happened at Palo Verde might be, the internal Emails from NRC make clear that this was not an isolated incident. “We also had several high speed drones over Limerick [Generating Station in Pennsylvania] that caused a VP to call about 8 months ago,” Brian Holian, Director of NRC’s Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, wrote at one point. “Yes, I agree that both of these overflight incidents at Palo Verde meet several criteria that we have historically used in triaging UAV overflights as particularly worthy of follow-up (# of UAVs involved, time of day, length of overflight, maneuvers, etc.),” another individual whose name is redacted added in the same Email chain. Another response, from another redacted individual, is censored almost entirely. “Just my two cents worth of an observation. I’m off to a tabletop exercise,” the Email concludes with. After the Palo Verde incidents, officials at ILTAB went back and checked and found 42 drone-related incident reports entered into the Security Information Database since 2016, including the two at the Arizona plant. There were another 15 in the system when they searched all the way back to Dec. 27, 2014. This includes another one involving a drone at Palo Verde, also “closed unresolved,” on Dec. 21, 2017. NRC redacted information about all of these remaining cases as “non-responsive” to Douglas Johnson’s FOIA request. It’s also clear that NRC hasn’t been the only U.S. government entity grappling with this issue. Another Email notes that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), part of the Department of Energy, had recently added a “suspicious activity reporting requirement” with regards to incidents at sites under its jurisdiction, but that it was also unclear as to how to approach drone incursions, necessarily. “I just met with Shana Helton [Director of the Physical & Cyber Security Policy Division of the Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response] and Jeremy Bowen [Deputy Director of the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research] for a detailed discussion about drones, FERC, and where we are with reporting requirements,” Geoffrey Miller, Deputy Director of the Reactor Safety Division at the NRC’s Region IV office, wrote. “I look forward to that discussion,” an individual, whose name is redacted, responded. “I would love to have a better understanding of where we are going as an Agency on the topic of drones.” “This week has been Drone-a-palooza for ssure [sic],” the Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response’s Deputy Director Lombard had written in an Email on Oct. 4. “With the two drone swarm flyovers at PVNGS [Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station] early in the week getting a lot of attention in the agency and outside (e.g., folks who work in the EEOB [Electrical Engineering Operating Reactors Division of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation]), we learned a lot and briefed a lot. And our UAV/drone Commission paper should go up to them next week.” The huge storage facility at Palo Verde features rows and rows of 20-foot tall concrete casks that contain the nuclear generating station’s spent fuel rods., APS Rules, regulations, and reporting requirements are, of course, just one part of the picture. Joseph Rivers, the NRC Senior Level Advisor on Security who was coordinating with various other individuals around the Palo Verde incidents, highlighted in one Email that none of this would do anything to directly prevent a hostile actor from using drones in a more nefarious way. “I would point out that restricted airspace will do nothing to stop an adversarial attack and even the detection systems identified earlier in this email chain have limited success rates, and there is even lower likelihood that law enforcement will arrive quickly enough to actually engage with the pilots,” he wrote. “We should be focusing our attention on getting Federal regulations and laws changed to allow sites to be defended and to identify engineering fixes that would mitigate an adversarial attack before there our licensed facilities become vulnerable.” You can find the full copies of the NRC documents as they were released to us, broken into four parts here: Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , and Part 4 . The Changes That Never Came The “drone-a-palooza” over America’s most powerful nuclear powerplant represents an intriguing and puzzling mystery. Who had the capability to put at least around a half a dozen drones up over the plant for hours on two consecutive nights and why? The fact that drone incursions aren’t totally new there, or at other major nuclear facilities, is equally concerning. But above all else, these internal documents show just how naive those tasked with dealing with such threats are to the potential nefarious capabilities of readily available unmanned aircraft. Could smaller weaponized drones have the capability to trigger a catastrophic radiological event at a powerplant like Palo Verde? These facilities and the nuclear waste stored on their grounds are hardened to some degree, but that’s not really the point. Even throwing the plant into disarray and disabling it for a protracted period of time could have substantial impacts on the region as millions depend on the plant for power. Coordinated attacks on other plants across a region could have even more damning, if not somewhat unthinkable impacts. Strategically speaking, a standoff capability with such a low barrier of acquisition, ease of use, and with such a high-chance of evasion for its perpetrators, is highly troubling. We will talk about these elements and tie together many other threads we have been weaving over the past year in an upcoming post, but for now, the Palo Verde drone scare of 2019 should be yet another reminder of how far we are behind dealing with this threat on a legislative, informational, and defensive level. Oh, and if you think this event may have served as something of a wakeup call for the powers that be, you are mistaken. Just a month after it occurred, the NRC made the highly controversial, if not outright dubious decision to formally decline to require owners of U.S. nuclear power and waste storage facilities to be able to defend against drones. “Staff has determined that nuclear power plants and Category I fuel cycle facilities do not have any risk-significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited using UAVs and result in radiological sabotage, theft of special nuclear material (SNM), or substantial diversion of SNM,” according to NRC’s review . “Similarly, the staff has determined that information gained from UAV video surveillance of an NRC-licensed facility is bounded by the type of information that could be provided by the knowledgeable insider currently permitted in the DBTs [ Design-Basis Threats ].” Physicist Edwin Lyman, acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit organization , stated the following about the decision: “The NRC’s irresponsible decision ignores the wide spectrum of threats that drones pose to nuclear facilities and is out of step with policies adopted by the Department of Energy and other government agencies… Congress should demand that the NRC require nuclear facility owners to update their security plans to protect against these emerging threats. Many companies are developing technologies to protect critical infrastructure from drone attacks through early detection, tracking, and jamming… If the NRC were to add drones to the design basis threat, nuclear plant owners would likely to have to purchase such systems. Laws would also have to be changed to allow private facilities to disrupt hostile drone flights. But plant owners are loath to spend more on safety and security at a time when many of their facilities are struggling to compete with cheap natural gas, wind and solar. The NRC seems more interested in keeping the cost of nuclear plant security low than protecting Americans from terrorist sabotage that could cause a reactor meltdown… The agency needs to remember that it works for the public, not the industry it regulates.” Sadly, it’s unlikely that any action will be taken when it comes to the threat posed by lower-end drones until a catastrophe occurs. We will discuss just how much is at risk and highlight other even more concerning incidents that have all but proven how capable such an asymmetric and inconvenient threat can be in the very near future. Regardless, the Palo Verde incidents serve as yet another warning of the potential dark side of the drones that fly among us daily.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are no more M1 Abrams tanks at the U.S. Marine Corps’ base at 29 Palms in California, one of the service’s premier training facilities and its largest base anywhere. The Marines have been retiring M1s, as well as M88 armored recovery vehicles and Armored Vehicle Launched Bridges, and shuttering armored units all month as part of a radical new force structure plan that Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger publicly unveiled in March. The last M1 Abrams left 29 Palms on July 6 , 2020. These tanks had been on the base assigned to the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division and to the Exercise Support Division, part of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center . The Marine Corps has also been in the process of closing out elements of the 4th Battalion, part of the Marine Corps Forces Reserve (MARFORRES), and eliminating the heavy armored vehicles that Marine Corps Logistics Command has in its possession over the course of this month . One of the last of the Marine Corps’ M1 Abrams at 29 Palms leaves the base on a flatbed truck on July 6, 2020., USMC The Marines have been consolidating the retired M1s from all of these units, along with their M88s and Armored Vehicle Launched Bridges (AVLB) – some 200 vehicles in total – at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow (MCLB Barstow) in California. From there, the service has been sending them by train to the U.S. Army’s Sierra Army Depot in California and Anniston Army Depot in Alabama. Sierra Army Depot is a storage facility where, among other things, the Army also keeps the primary production tooling for the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. Anniston Army Depot is that service’s premier armored vehicle maintenance facility . The Marine Corps plans to eventually divest the entirety of its M1 fleet, more than 400 vehicles in total, as part of the new Force Design 2030 plans, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The remaining tanks, including those belonging to the 2nd Tank Battalion, part of the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and other MARFORRES elements, will travel by train and truck to the Army’s depots. “Installations such as Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; Blount Island Command, Jacksonville, Florida; and Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Georgia will most likely be shipping their tanks by rail, as well,” Chad Hildebrandt, Railway Operations supervisor at MCLB Barstow said in an interview for a recent official news story. “Smaller locations that house tanks for MARFORRES will be making individual decisions based off of rail versus commercial truck use cost analysis.” A gantry crane lifts a Marine M1 Abrams tank off a flatbed truck in preparation to move it onto a railcar at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow., USMC The 4th Tank Battalion, which has six tank companies, in addition to its headquarters company, scattered across the country, is scheduled to stand down for good in 2021. The schedule for shuttering the rest of the Marine Corps’ tank-equipped units is not yet publicly known. In addition, while the service is getting rid of M88s and AVLBs as part of this process, it’s not clear if the Marine Corps is planning to also divest their M1-based M1150 ‘Shredder’ Assault Breacher Vehicles (ABV). The M1150, which you can read about more in this past War Zone story , is designed to clear mines and other obstacles and could still be valuable to the Corps’ future expeditionary concepts of operation, which will still involve amphibious landings , as well as Marines riding in amphibious armored vehicles and other lighter vehicles . A Marine M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle, at left, along with an M88 armored recovery vehicle., USMC The same questions apply to the AVLBs. The Marine Corps does still have some number of Cold War-era M60 tank-based AVLBs in inventory. The Marines had also previously planned to adopt the M1-based M1074 Joint Assault Bridge (JAB), which the Army has been developing since 2016 as an alternative to the M104 Wolverine , which that service determined to be too costly to operate and maintain. The Corps had 29 JABs on order as of 2017 and the future of those vehicles is now uncertain. A prototype M1074 Joint Assault Bridge., Leonardo DRS The Army has not yet said what it plans to do with the former Marine tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. Some of these could bolster its own fleets or get refurbished and sold off to allies and partners . Australia’s M1A1 AIM tanks , for instance, are refurbished ex-Army and Marine vehicles. It remains to be seen when the Marine Corps will actually retire the last of its M1s, but the elimination of the tanks at 29 Palms, where the service conducts many of its routine large scale training exercises, underscores how quickly the service is moving to implement Commandant Berger new vision. “Remember that our tanks were just weapon systems,” Marine Corps Captain Mark Rothrock, commander of Company A, 4th Tank Battalion, said during that unit’s inactivation ceremony on July 18. “[Tanks are] a damn fine weapon system, but nonetheless, just equipment. You individual Marines were always the key to the company’s success.” U.S. Marine Captain Chandler Brown, at center, the executive officer for Company A, 4th Tank Battalion, marches with a color guard in front of M88 armored recovery vehicles during the unit’s inactivation ceremony on July 18, 2020., USMC When the Marines do get rid of their last M1s, it will bring to a close nearly a century of tank operations for the service, which established its first tank unit in December 1923 following experience it had gained while conducting operations with first-generation tanks in Europe during World War I. The Marines received their first M1A1s in 1989. The Marines’ history with tanks now seems to be rapidly moving through its twilight period as the service looks to dramatically restructure itself as a lighter, more agile force focused on future expeditionary operations.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Oct 30, 2019",The F-15 “Japanese Super Interceptor” Eagle Is One Step Closer To Becoming A Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has completed a Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) to implement upgrades to Japan’s F-15J Eagle fleet. The contract is part of the larger $4.5-billion modernization program that was announced by the U.S. Government in October 2019. Boeing says this DCS contract “lays the foundation” of the modernization program, although the Japanese government has not yet formalized the project. An artist’s impression released by Boeing to accompany its announcement depicts an upgraded Japanese F-15 carrying a large missile on its centerline station. This appears to confirm long-held ambitions to equip these fighters with Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) . The F-15J’s arsenal could potentially grow to include additional ordnance, such as hypersonic weapons that are in development in Japan. Long-awaited upgrades to Japan’s Eagles would take 98 aircraft to F-15JSI “ Japanese Super Interceptor ” standard with the addition of a new electronic warfare system, new avionics, new weapons, and possibly more. Following a similar operational model to the one adopted by the U.S. Air Force with the F-15EX, the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will use its upgraded Eagles to complement its large planned force of Lockheed Martin F-35s . Targeting 98 upgraded Eagles aligns with the JASDF’s plans to only recapitalize around half of its F-15J fleet, the rest being swapped for 105 F-35As as outlined in the Medium Term Defence Program. MHI built 163 F-15Js and 36 two-seat F-15DJs under license, plus 14 aircraft that were assembled by McDonnell Douglas at its St. Louis plant, in Missouri.Unlike the USAF, which has decided to buy brand new F-15EXs from Boeing instead of upgrading its existing F-15Cs, Tokyo is will retain its 1980s-vintage F-15Js and upgrade them with features from the Advanced Eagle, which is now the production standard aircraft. Boeing had previously offered the USAF an extensive package of upgrades for its Eagles dubbed F-15 2040C . However, it has instead opted to recapitalize the fleet with up to 200 F-15EXs . Japan’s F-15Js will receive a cockpit upgrade, the details of which are not yet clear., Jamie Hunter The Direct Commercial Sale means MHI will act as the prime contractor for the work, with Boeing saying it will “provide MHI with retrofit drawings, ground support equipment and technical publications for the upgrade of the first two F-15J aircraft to the Japan Super Interceptor configuration.” The proposed upgrade package outlined in a DSCA notice on October 29, 2019, listed the following: The Government of Japan has requested the upgrade of up to ninety-eight (98) F-15J aircraft to a Japanese Super Interceptor (JSI) configuration consisting of up to one hundred three (103) APG-82(v)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar (includes 5 spares); one hundred sixteen (116) Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II) Mission System Computer (includes 18 spares); and one hundred one (101) ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare System (DEWS) (includes 3 spares). Also included are Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) with software, training and support; Selective Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM); ARC-210 radio, aircraft and munition integration and test support; ground training devices (including flight and maintenance simulators); support and test equipment; software delivery and support; spare and repair parts; communications equipment; facilities and construction support; publications and technical documentation; personnel training and training equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering; technical and logistics support services; studies and surveys; and other related elements of logistical and program support. The estimated total program cost is $4.5 billion. US DSCA The upgrade is built around the same core avionics as the F-15EX, with the Raytheon APG-82 (v)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and Boeing’s Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II), which it calls “the world’s most advanced mission computer.” The DSCA solicitation also does not include life-extension efforts to the F-15J airframe. A brand new F-15EX is supposed to have a useful life of an amazing 20,000 flight hours. Nor does it include provision for Boeing’s new 11×19-inch Large Area Display (LAD), it’s low-profile Head-Up Display (HUD), however the Boeing media release mentions an “ all-new advanced cockpit system .” It’s not clear if this refers to the LAD or another less extensive upgrade such as the F-15C’s Passive Attack Display , which is used to display a number of information sets, including imagery from the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod for air-to-air visual identification. The upgrade package also notably lacks any mention of an infra-red search and track ( IRST ) sensor. This is particularly important for the F-15JSI as it faces future stealthy threats in the air defense mission now and into the future. Its omission suggests that MHI could be looking to integrate a domestic solution for this important capability. Japan has extensively explored an integrated IRST system for the F-15J, and last year a new indigenous podded IRST system was observed during flight-testing aboard an F-4EJ Phantom II. While dubbed a “Super Interceptor,” the addition of the APG-82 (v)1 AESA radar and JASSM tips a nod to multi-role capabilities. This radar is now retrofitted to USAF F-15E Strike Eagles and is the system chosen for the F-15EX. In 2017, there were initial reports that Japan wanted to transform its F-15s into cruise missile carriers for long-range strike missions. You can read more in this previous War Zone report. USAF F-15E Strike Eagles are already equipped to carry the extended-range version of the AGM-158, known as JASSM-ER , as well as JASSM. Strike Eagles from the 366th Fighter Wing recently used the weapons in combat operations in Syria, details of which can be found here . USAF F-15E Strike Eagles have been cleared to use the AGM-158 JASSM-ER., Lockheed Martin The new AESA radar will provide the F-15JSI with impressive new air-to-ground capabilities and would also enable them to perform maritime patrol and interdiction missions. Indeed, Japan could also look to purchase Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, or LRASM . Until now, only Israel has sought to transform F-15A/B/C/D fighters into multi-role platforms. Japan is also developing indigenous hypersonic weapons, as detailed here . In the Boeing media release that accompanied the formal announcement of the USAF F-15EX contract, the company said: “The F-15EX carries more weapons than any other fighter in its class and can launch hypersonic weapons up to 22 feet long and weighing up to 7,000 pounds.” Like the F-15EX, Japan’s upgraded Eagles could also be kitted-out to act as weapons trucks and be able to carry the kind of large hypersonic weapons that are in development. The F-15JSI could also field Japan’s new indigenous air-to-air missile in the shape of the advanced AAM-4B , but Japan has also expressed interest in the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), which is smaller than the AAM-4B and offers a shorter maximum engagement range. Japan has implemented a number of small upgrades for its F-15Js over the years, but most have become bogged-down in budgetary and political issues. In recent years, the JASDF F-15s have received Link 16 data link connectivity, and some aircraft are equipped to enable pilots to wear the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, known as JHMCS . “These upgrades will deliver critical capability for national and collective self-defense, in which the F-15J plays a key role. At the same time, they will provide MHI and our partners in Japan’s aerospace defense industry with an opportunity to enhance their own extensive engineering capabilities,” said Will Shaffer, Boeing Japan President, referring to F-15JSI. A JASDF F-15J Eagle gets airborne during Red Flag Alaska., Jamie Hunter The JASDF is facing a torrent of airspace incursions from Chinese military aircraft, and the number of scrambles undertaken by its F-15Js continues to rise. Keeping the F-15J reliable and relevant will be key to maintaining air sovereignty around the island nation’s territory. Enhanced F-15Js will also serve to help fill-out Japan’s air combat capability until the fielding of Japan’s next-generation stealth fighter, which will replace the JASDF’s Mitsubishi F-2 fighters by the mid-2030s. In the meantime, the F-15JSI upgrade, along with F-35 procurement, will support the JASDF’s immediate needs. Boeing says MHI is now developing a detailed modification plan for the 98 F-15s and that it will prepare its facilities and workforce for the induction and upgrade of up to 98 aircraft beginning in 2022. This is the latest in a series of renewed business opportunities for Boeing with the F-15 , both in terms of new builds and upgrades. It seems that the F-15JSI upgrade is set to ensure Eagles continue to defend Japan well into the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has offered the first real details about its plans to withdraw approximately 11,900 personnel from Germany, 6,400 of which will return to the United States. The remaining 5,400 will relocate to other countries as part of a larger force posture shift that has an increased emphasis on activities in Poland and the Black Sea region . Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, together with Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force General John Hyten and Air Force General Tod Wolters, who is head of U.S. European Command (EUCOM) and NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), offered the new information about the withdrawals during a press conference on July 29, 2020. President Donald Trump had first announced plans to trim back U.S. forces in Germany in June 2020. At present, there are approximately 36,000 American service members in that country across a number of major bases. Of the 6,400 troops that the United States now plans to pull out of Germany and send back to the United States, around 4,500 will come from the U.S. Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is presently based at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, Germany. Despite its name, this unit is a brigade-sized Stryker wheeled armored vehicle -equipped infantry force and is presently the Army’s only maneuver combat unit forward-deployed anywhere in Europe. Strykers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, as well as other NATO forces, in Poland., US Army The Pentagon did not offer any other specific details about the remaining 1,900 personnel that would be heading back to the United States or the units they’re assigned to. The 5,400 additional troops that would move to other locations within Europe includes the U.S. Air Force’s 480th Fighter Squadron, which would relocate to Italy, very possibly to Aviano Air Base in that country. The 480th, assigned to the 52nd Fighter Wing, is presently the service’s only fighter squadron in Germany and is operates F-16CJ/DJ Vipers out of Spangdahlem Air Base . An F-16CJ of the 480th Fighter Squadron inside a hardened aircraft shelter at Spangdahlem Air Base., USAF Another 2,000 troops will relocate to Belgium as part of the relocation of EUCOM headquarters, as well as that of Special Operations Command-Europe (SOCEUR) to the city of Mons. Esper stressed that more than 24,000 U.S. troops will still remain in Germany and that the 6,400 personnel that will return to the United States will then immediately prepare for rotational deployments in Europe. The U.S. military, as a whole, especially the Army , had already significantly scaled back its permanent force posture in Europe in the late 2000s and increased the emphasis on sending units to the region on shorter, temporary deployments. This trend somewhat reversed course after Russia illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and began directly supporting separatists in the eastern portion of that country fighting the government in Kyiv. However, rotating deployments remained a key feature of the increased force posture in response to the Kremlin’s actions. The Army had actually planned to demonstrate its ability to carry out a much more significant deployment of forces to Europe in response to a regional contingency as part of an exercise called Defender-Europe 20 earlier this year, but had to scale back those plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Esper said that new rotational deployments following the withdrawals from Germany could lead to a general increase in the U.S. military’s force posture in Poland, which has been actively lobbying the Trump Administration to send more troops to its territory, and in the increasingly strategic Black Sea region . “Once Warsaw assigns a defense cooperation agreement and burden sharing deal as previously pledged, there are may be other opportunities as well to move additional forces into Poland and the Baltics,” he explained. The Secretary of Defense also said that a forward element of the Army’s V Corps headquarters, which the service announced plans to stand up at Fort Knox in Kentucky earlier this year, could deploy to Poland in the future. General Wolters, the EUCOM and SHAPE commander, added that there are now discussions about relocating U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and Special Operations Command-Africa (SOCAFRICA), which are both presently situated in Germany, out of the country, as well. An F-16 from Romania, a NATO member, flies with US Air Force B-1 bombers in the Black Sea region in May 2020., USAF In addition to these other force posture announcements, the Pentagon said 2,500 personnel presently based at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom would not be leaving there, despite previous plans to do so. The movement of those forces, including KC-135 aerial refueling tankers and special operations units, which had been slated to go to Spangdahlem, had already been pushed back to at least 2027 previously. The shift in forces will help “strengthen NATO” and “deter Russia,” Secretary Esper said in his opening remarks. He also said that the larger force structure changes would help U.S. military forces in the region be better able to tackle a “new era of great power competition” as outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. “The flexibility that this affords us certainly complicates a potential enemy against us & dramatically improves our operational capability to more effectively deter and defend,” Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hyten added. There are, however, already concerns that the withdrawals could negatively impact the U.S. military’s ability to respond to contingencies in Europe and elsewhere. Beyond supporting operations in the immediate region, American bases in Germany are an important intermediate point for other activities, especially in the Middle East and Africa . In addition, Esper said that the Pentagon had already been looking into shifting forces in Europe, but admitted that President Donald Trump had “accelerated” the plan. However, it’s hard not to see pulling troops out of Germany as being in part the result of long-standing animosity toward the country’s defense policy on the part of the Trump Administration and Trump himself, personally. “Germany is supposed to pay for it. Germany is not paying for it,” Trump told reporters separately after the Pentagon’s press conference. “We are reducing the force because they are not paying their bill. It’s very simple. They are delinquent.” In particular, Trump and others in his administration have long criticized Germany’s failure to meet NATO’s two percent defense spending target , which is in place all members, with the exception of Iceland. Despite increases to its defense budget since 2014, Germany has still struggled with that goal for a variety of reasons , despite being one of the largest states, and the wealthiest in Europe, within the alliance. However, it is worth noting that this is a spending goal, not a hard requirement, and that most NATO members fail to meet this benchmark. “Let’s be clear: I think Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe. Germany can and should pay more to its defense,” Esper said himself. “It should certainly meet the two percent standard, and I would argue go above and beyond that.” Trump’s strong personal relationship with Poland’s Andrzej Duda may also have been a contributing factor. Last year, Duda publicly proposed letting the U.S. military establish a permanent base in his country, which he dubbed Fort Trump. The U.S. military already has a significant rotational presence in Poland. A map showing the disposition of US and NATO rotational forces in Poland circa 2018., NATO Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not this withdrawal plan, which will be complex and costly to carry out, will come to fruition. Esper said that some movements could begin within weeks, but that others will take longer to complete. “It’ll take several billion dollars, I’d say single digits, but that will be spread out over time,” he added. It’s very likely, given the magnitude of the plan, that it will stretch beyond the November 2020 U.S. presidential election. If Trump loses, the next president could easily reverse course. “What we have right now is really a concept – a concept that we’ve shared with our allies, shared with the Congress, and we shared inside the department fairly widely,” Vice Chairmant of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hyten said. “We now have to turn it into plans. As you turn into plans, we have a very structured process involving the Joint Staff, the office of the secretary, and the combatant commands and the services, to make sure we understand what those are, then we’ll lay in the costs.” However, if this withdrawal does proceed as planned, it will significantly alter the U.S. military’s overall posture in Europe.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 4, 2018",Here’s All The Ridiculous Military Pork Baked Into The Proposed COVID-19 Bill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, Senate Republicans unveiled a proposed bill that would authorize a $1 trillion spending package ostensibly to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts it has had, especially economically , across the country this year. The draft law immediately drew criticism for including a raft of line items that seem at best tangentially related to those efforts, while many are not at all, including around $30 billion in defense spending, which would be on top of the more than $705 billion in the proposed defense budget for the 2021 Fiscal Year. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, formally introduced the proposed bill on July 27, 2020. It would need the full Senate to pass it and for the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives to pass their own version before it could even head to President Donald Trump’s desk, where he could then sign it into law. If it were to become law today, here are the main specific defense-related spending items that would be authorized: $283,000,000 to the Army for new-build AH-64E Block IIIB attack helicopters . $375,000,000, to the Army for upgrades for its Double V-Hull (DVH) Stryker 8×8 armored wheeled vehicles . $1,068,000,000 to the Navy for P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. $41,400,000 to the Navy for RGM-184A Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) and launchers specifically for the service’s Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). $2,210,000,000 to the Navy, $1,450,000,000 for four “ expeditionary medical ships ” and $260,000,000 for a single Spearhead class Expeditionary Fast Transport. $49,100,000 to the Navy for sonobuoys . $686,000,000 to the Air Force for F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . $720,000,000 to the Air Force for C-130J Hercules airlifters. $650,000,000 to the Air Force for wing replacement kits for A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft. $76,325,000 to “defense-wide” spending to establish an eighth Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery. $243,270,000 to “defense-wide” spending for an AN/TPY-2 missile defense radar to go with the eighth THAAD battery. $40,100,000 to “defense-wide” spending to replace a modified de Havilland DHC-8 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft belonging to U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) that was destroyed during a terrorist attack in Kenya in January 2020. $20,000,000 to the Air Force to support the integration of the AGM-158 Joint Air-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) onto variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. $65,800,000 to the Missile Defense Agency for hypersonic weapon defense . $39,200,000 to the Missile Defense Agency for cruise missile defense . $200,000,000 to the Missile Defense Agency for a Ground-based Mid-course Defense (GMD) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). $290,000,000 to the Missile Defense Agency for the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor . $153,000,000 to the Navy for depot-level ship maintenance work . $800,000,000 for the “National Guard and Reserve  Equipment  Account.” $20,000,000 to the Navy for “United States Marine Corps Force Design unfunded requirements.” $19,500,000 to the Army for “Force Protection Upgrades.” $882,068,000 to the Army for general operation and maintenance. $458,237,000 to the Navy for general operation and maintenance. $135,542,000 to the Marine Corps for general operation and maintenance. $969,357,000 to the Air Force for general operation and maintenance. $112,071,000 for “defense-wide” general operation and maintenance. $8,000,000 to the Army Reserve for general operation and maintenance. $30,000,000 to the Army National Guard for general operation and maintenance. $12,000,000 to the Air National Guard for general operation and maintenance. $48,500,000, to the Army for “other procurement.” $34,823,000 to the Navy for “other procurement.” $484,000 for “defense-wide” “other procurement.” $5,300,000,000 for Defense Production Act purchases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. $1,494,000 to the Air Force for research, development, test, and evaluation work. $20,931,000 for “defense-wide” research, development, test, and evaluation work. $1,783,500,000 for Defense Working Capital Funds . $705,000,000 for the Defense Health Program . $1,128,000,000 to the Army for a “Defense Industrial Base Resiliency Fund-Army.” $4,664,000,000 to the Navy for a “Defense Industrial Base Resiliency Fund-Navy and Marine Corps.” $4,273,400,000 to the Air Force for a “Defense Industrial Base Resiliency Fund-Air Force and Space Force.” $783,100,000 for a “Defense Industrial Base Resiliency Fund-Defense: Special Operations Command and Missile Defense Agency.” Every single line item in the draft bill, including these proposed defense appropriations, is stated to be justified as being “to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally.” “I believe we need to act with a sense of urgency. The American people are fighters, but the accumulated strain of this pandemic is a serious burden on folks,” Senator Shelby said in a statement that came along with the proposed law. “With the additional resources this legislation provides, I believe we can give them greater confidence that we are getting our arms around this virus. That, I believe, is the key to unleashing the American economy and hitting our stride as a nation once again.” Critics of the draft legislation have openly questioned how various provisions, including the defense-related items, support those objectives. Some of this, especially the Defense Production Act purchases , which accounts for a sixth of the proposed defense-related spending, as well as funds to help shore up the defense industrial base, certainly seems relevant to the broader effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between much of the other spending and managing the ongoing health crisis seems highly dubious, if not outright ludicrous, especially given the continued needs of those on the front lines of the pandemic, as well as the struggles of regular Americans to make ends meet. “Amphibious ships don’t feed hungry children,” House Appropriations Committee Chair Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, said in her own statement in response to Shelby’s spending package. Some of the items make it clear that some legislators are looking to use the bill as a vehicle for pork-barrel spending . A closer reading also shows that there are additional political complications influencing at least some of the proposed appropriations. Eight of the defense-spending items include specific language stating that “funds appropriated by this section may not be transferred to ‘ Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities , Defense.” These provisions are effectively seeking to restore funding that Trump’s Administration has diverted within the defense budget to the construction of controversial walls along the United States’ southern border with Mexico without directly challenging the President. Last year, in the face of strong bipartisan resistance to those plans, Trump had declared the situation on the border to be a national emergency and invoked laws allowing him to use funds already authorized for other major defense projects for the wall without congressional approval. All told, especially given the resistance to these provisions from Democrats in the House of Representatives, it seems very unlikely that this bill will pass in its current form. However, it remains to be seen whether some of the defense spending, as well as other controversial items, will find their way into a final law that would also provide badly needed assistance to many average Americans. If anything, it underscores Washington’s addiction to pork-barrel tactics and a never-ending thirst for more military spending. Have you seen any Apache attack helicopters helping out at hospitals or THAAD missile batteries defending against COVID-19? Yeah, we haven’t either.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The full details of the first five bases to receive contract aggressor support under the U.S. Air Force’s huge “red air” adversary support program have now been revealed. Draken International and Tactical Air Support have both been selected by the U.S. Air Force to support aircrew training at three locations. This is in addition to the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company, or ATAC, having secured adversary air support contracts for Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, which you can read all about in detail in our report from yesterday . Air Combat Command has now divulged the full set of awards it handed out on July 21, 2020, related to the initial round of Combat Air Force Contracted Air Support (CAF CAS) program. In addition to ATAC, Draken International was selected to provide aggressor support at Seymour Johnson AFB in North Carolina and at Kelly Field in Texas. In addition, TacAir has been selected for Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base in Oregon. Draken International will provide aggressor aircraft to help train new aircrews at the F-15E Strike Eagle Formal Training Unit (FTU) at Seymour Johnson and F-16 pilots at the FTU located at Kelly Field, the latter of which is technically part of Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. It is anticipated that Draken will station Mirage F1s and its new Denel Cheetahs at the locations in support of the contract. The contract for Draken International at Seymour Johnson is worth $74.5 million and the one at Kelly Field is valued at $28.2 million. Draken International will support F-15E training at Seymour Johnson AFB., USAF/A1C Shawna Keyes TacAir will provide 800 annual sorties at the F-15C FTU at Kingsley Field under a contract worth $90.4 million. This will likely involve the company’s upgraded F-5AT Tiger IIs . A full table of the breakdown is provided below. The War Zone Air Combat Command says the companies will “provide realistic and challenging advanced adversary air training. The air support services are expected to begin late Summer 2020 at each location.” Eglin AFB, Florida, was also included in the initial tranche of planned awards, but the War Zone has learned that this decision is on hold pending an environmental impact study. TacAir will support F-15 training with its upgraded F-5ATs., Christopher McGreevy Air Combat Command shortlisted seven companies for a combined total of $6.4 billion of potential support work on October 18, 2019. This runs for five years and includes both adversary air (ADAIR) and Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training. Among the seven companies, Blue Air Training and Coastal Defense are only thought to be bidding for JTAC training. Of the remaining contractors, Air USA and Top Aces are not among the initial round of contract awardees. Having proved to itself the concept of contracted aggressor support at Nellis AFB , Nevada, the USAF is now rolling out similar solutions across more of its bases. You can read all about this big round of contracts and why the Air Force is following in the Navy’s footsteps to outsource adversary air support to private companies in this past War Zone piece . Regardless, these contract awards are a huge move forward for an industry that is only poised to continue to expand rapidly in the years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s first operational front-line Lockheed Martin F-35C unit, Strike Fighter Squadron 147 (VFA-147) “Argonauts,” has completed two key milestones in preparation for its maiden deployment next year. The squadron will be the first to take the F-35C to sea on a cruise as part of Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) aboard the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) in 2021. The “Argonauts” completed a Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP) in combination with the U.S. Air Force in May and June at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. This was followed by a “5th Generation Advanced Readiness Program” in July at NAS Fallon, Nevada, alongside its fellow CVW-2 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet squadrons VFA-2 “Bounty Hunters,” VFA-113 “Stingers,” and VFA-192 “Golden Dragons.” The “Argonauts” deployed to Eglin alongside other CVW-2 tactical jet squadrons for WSEP, which is a live missile firing event hosted by the 83rd Fighter Weapons Squadron from May 27 to June 12. A media release from the resident 53rd Wing said its units “facilitated the firing of 26 air-to-air missiles during this event.” The release added: “CVW-2 participated in the event to prepare them for their real-world deployment next year in support of geographic combatant commander taskings.” The Eglin event, known as “WSEP East 20.09” included CVW-2, the 53rd Wing, 325th Fighter Wing F-22A Raptors that are based at Eglin due to damage at Tyndall AFB that was inflicted by Hurricane Michael , plus Eglin’s 33rd Fighter Wing, which flies F-35As. An F-35C of VX-9 “Vampires” fires an AIM-120 during testing., USAF/Christopher Okula A WSEP can be tailored for air-to-air firings, which is also known as “Combat Archer,” or air-to-ground launches, which is “Combat Hammer.” Both are designed to provide an end-to-end evaluation of the complete weapons system, including the aircraft itself, the building and loading of the missiles, and the actual firing, guidance, and ultimate lethality of the weapons. It has become a somewhat common event for U.S. Navy, USAF, and U.S. Marine Corps fighter squadrons ahead of a major combat deployment. F-35Cs of VFA-147 at NAS Fallon in July., U.S. Navy/VFA-147 In addition to being a part of CVW-2’s work-up in preparation for its deployment, the 83rd FWS supported operational test shots to gather data. One of the more significant events included AIM-120D Software Improvement Program missiles. This likely relates to System Improvement Program 3, the newest operational version of the AIM-120D, which itself is a major leap on capability above the previous AIM-120C variant. Raytheon Missile System received a $38.6 million contract for System Improvement Program 3 Engineering Manufacturing and Development upgrades for the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) in September 2017. The contract provides for software development to improve the AIM-120D’s performance against more advanced enemy threats. F-35As and F-35Cs fired seven AIM-120Ds and an EA-18G Growler fired one, according to the news release. It added: “These weapon firings provided valuable data and feedback to combat air force and fleet warfighters and informed strategic weapons allocation and movement decisions.” VAQ-136 “Gauntlets” is currently assigned to CVW-2., U.S. Navy/VAQ-136 “Thank you all very much for the herculean effort you and your teams provided CVW-2.  With your world-class support, we were able to complete 15/15 OFRP — Readiness required shots over the last two weeks,” said Captain Matthew Thrasher, the commander (CAG) of CVW-2. “This event improved readiness of CVW-2 in preparation for real-world tasking, support of operational test objectives, and gathered critical F-35A/C weapons employment data,” said Col Nicholas Reed, commander, 53d Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG). Here is a table showing CVW-2’s current composition of units: Author Following WSEP, the elements of CVW-2 moved to NAS Fallon in July for the next round of preparatory training. Traditionally known by the Navy as SFARP, the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program, the F-35 squadron has coined it the “5th Generation Advanced Readiness Program.” This training will have included a pivotal role for VFA-147’s new TOPGUN graduate , who oversees the squadron training program. The squadron’s Facebook page remarked, “We crushed it!!!” A traditional work-up cycle would next see CVW-2 going into carrier qualifications (CQ) and TSTA, the Tailored Ship’s Training Availability. This is designed to support the aircraft carrier’s crew and prepare it to bring the entire air wing aboard. Air Wing Fallon follows, where the CVW comes together for a five-week exercise that brings together all the elements of the CVW, working together in complex exercises on the Fallon Range Training Complex . Finally comes COMPTUEX (Composite Training Unit Exercise) , which is basically Air Wing Fallon, but fly from the carrier, and integrates all the Carrier Strike Group’s naval assets with the air wing and each other. The USS Carl Vinson is expected to arrive in San Diego , California, shortly, following a maintenance period in Bremerton, Washington. The first cruise with the F-35C will also coincide with the first Navy deployment with the new Bell-Boeing CMV-22B Osprey Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) tiltrotor. VRM-30 “Titans” is now in possession of two CMV-22s at its home base at NAS North Island, California, and the squadron will also make its first operational detachment aboard the USS Carl Vinson in 2021. A VFA-147 F-35C approaches the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2018 during Carrier Qualifications. , U.S. Navy/MCS3C Daniel E. Gheesling The deployment for CVW-2 in 2021 will mark a major milestone in U.S. naval aviation history. The “Argonauts” will be taking a brand new fighter on a maiden cruise for the first time since the Super Hornet joined the fleet in 2002. Above all else, the F-35C will finally give the Navy’s carrier’s air wings the stealth capability they were promised 30 years ago. So, suffice it to say that there is a lot of pressure on the Argonauts and their sister squadrons to get it right!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 27, 2020","Iran Fires Missiles At Its Fake Carrier, Says Its Satellite Has Been Watching From Above (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has now released video footage and other details about a major exercise in and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz that involved various types of attacks on a mock U.S. Navy aircraft carrier . Iranian forces employed various air, sea, and ground-launched weapons against the faux flattop, including anti-ship ballistic missiles and a Bell 206 type helicopter modified to carry an anti-ship cruise missile . The country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps also claimed that its Nour satellite, which was launched earlier this year , had taken imagery of the drills from space. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that the exercise, called Great Prophet 14, had entered its final phase on July 28, 2020. Satellite imagery had shown that it had towed the mock carrier , the centerpiece of the drills, out into the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, sometime last week. You can read more about this heavily modified barge, which was first built in 2014, ostensibly as a movie prop, in our initial reporting on its latest outing here . It had suffered significant damage during the Great Prophet IX exercise in 2015, but Iran began refurbishing it last year. “Surprising weapons and hardware – including long-range ballistic missiles capable of striking intruding vessels floating at a distance – are being used,” IRGC Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, the official spokesperson for the exercise, said, according to PressTV . Video from the drills did show multiple launches of what appeared to be members of the Fateh 110 short-range ballistic missile family, which have ranges between 124 and 186 miles, depending on the exact version. Iran has claimed to have developed variants of the Fateh 110 in the past with anti-ship capabilities, including the Khalij Fars, Hormuz-1, and Hormoz-2 . The latter missiles reportedly also have anti-radiation capabilities, allowing them to home on ground-based signal emitters, such as radars, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CImlCIOUFgM Another variant, the Fateh Mobin , may have an imaging infrared sensor for greater precision in the terminal phase of flight, as well as a possible moving target capability. This missile has also been demonstrated against floating targets at sea. The video below is of older Fateh Mobin (written Fateh Mubeen) testing, including against floating targets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=brzuTdFS4ZQ Great Prophet 14 also included a Bell 206 type light helicopter firing a modified Nasr-1 anti-ship cruise missile from the launch rail mounted underneath its fuselage. The Nasr-1, which has a maximum range of just under 22 miles, is a copy of the Chinese C-704 and has been in use in Iran in air-launched applications from fixed-wing aircraft for years now. To fit under the helicopter, the tips of the fins on the missile’s mid-section are removed. The Iranians also fielded it in truck-mounted launchers and on various ships and revealed a submarine-launched derivative last year. Ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles, which may have also included the larger Noor , a copy of the Chinese C-802, have also been employed during Great Prophet 14. The Imperial Iranian military received a number of license-made Augusta-Bell AB-206s from Italy during the reign of the Shah, some of which remain in service today. The helicopter in question had a civilian type paint scheme rather than a camouflage one and appears to be the same one that was involved in the Great Prophet IX exercise back in 2015. Satellite imagery shows actually relatively limited damage to fake flattop’s deck, though some of the mock fighter jets on top have clearly been destroyed. The lack of visual puncture holes on top calls into question whether any of the ballistic missiles actually hit the target or were even necessarily fired at it at all. The video footage Iran released also does appear to show at least one anti-ship missile hitting the largely open mid-section after skimming at sea level. Beyond these missiles, the exercise also featured a swarm of IRGC speed boats firing artillery rockets at the mock carrier, as well as combat divers who could have placed limpet mines on its hull. A team of commandos also repelled on the barge’s top deck from an Mi-17 helicopter to conduct a simulated assault and at least one individual parachuted onto the ship. Sepah News Sepah News Sepah News Sepah News Sepah News All of these tactics were seen during Great Prophet IX, as well, as seen in the video below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkbS4BQxTgg Iran also says that Great Prophet 14 included air defense drills. More notably, the IRGC said that its Nour satellite, which it successfully launched in April using a previously unseen space launch vehicle called Qassed, had captured imagery of the exercise from space. This satellite, which has been described vaguely in the past as a “ multi-purpose ” system, is Iran’s first dedicated military space-based asset. The Iranian government has yet to release any images from Nour to back up its claim or give a sense of how high the fidelity of the imagery actually is. Still, if true, having its own organic space-based intelligence gathering capability of any kind could be valuable for Iran, which has very limited other means of peering into denied areas in opponents’ territory, such as in Israel or Saudi Arabia . So far, Iran appears to have refrained from actually blowing up the faux carrier as it did during Great Prophet IX. The detonation of a large explosive charge on the barge during that exercise in 2015 caused major damage to it, but provided a spectacular visual for propaganda purposes. Iran’s fake aircraft carrier explodes during Great Prophet IX in 2015., AP Still, just being able to train against a large mockup of any kind offers some degree of practical opportunities for Iran to evaluate its various tactics, techniques, and procedures. Limiting the actual damage to the barge will make it easier to refurbish it and use it in future drills, as well. Though there are questions about the exact state of Iran’s maritime warfare capabilities, Great Prophet 14 has certainly showcased a number of them that do pose real threats to American and other foreign warships , including aircraft carriers , operating in the region. This comes as the USS Nimitz , the first in the class of carriers that the Iranian barge is modeled after, is presently heading toward the Middle East , where it will likely take up station, replacing its sister ship the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower , which has now left the area and is in the Mediterranean Sea. Iran routinely objects to the presence of American warships in the Persian Gulf. The regime in Tehran also regularly threatens to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, through which between 20 and 30 percent of the world’s oil exports pass, in response to foreign sanctions , especially those the United States has placed on its oil and natural gas industries. Of course, Iran could certainly use a major propaganda victory. In addition to being subject to crippling international sanctions, the country has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and recently suffering a string of mysterious explosions and fires. Foreign actors, primarily Israel , have been implicated in at least some of those incidents, which may also have deliberate acts of sabotage carried out with assistance from the United States . The regime in Tehran has also accused the U.S. military of conducting a dangerous intercept of a Mahan Air Airbus A310 airliner as it flew over Syria last week, which American authorities have strenuously denied . There is certainly still time for the IRGC to cap off the Great Prophet 14 exercise with an even more dramatic display involving its fake American aircraft carrier. Update: 2:00 PM EST— U.S. personnel at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, both situated on the opposite side of the Persian Gulf from Iran, went on high alert in response to three Iranian missiles fired during Great Prophet 14 that appeared to be heading their way. These missiles, possibly ballistic missiles, fell into the water, but had come “close enough” to cause concern, according to Fox News . Unspecified ” intel indicators” had detected the missiles, CNN reported. This could include information from a variety of U.S. assets in the region, such as the AN/TPY-2 missile defense radar that the U.S. Army operates in Qatar or any of a number of aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms that routinely operate over and around the Persian Gulf. A U.S. Air Force E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft was seen orbiting off the coast of the UAE earlier today. It and other ISR aircraft, manned and unmanned, have undoubtedly been observing the Great Prophet 14 exercise, in general. Space-based early-warning satellites may have also been involved. These helped spot Iranian ballistic missiles fired at bases housing American troops in Iraq in January.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Aggressor Mirage F1 Fighters Headed To Holloman And Luke Air Force Bases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Air Combat Command has awarded contracts for the first five U.S. Air Force bases to receive contract aggressor support under its huge “red air” adversary support program. The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company, or ATAC, has announced that it has secured the support contracts for Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Contracts for a further three locations have also been awarded, the details of which are unclear at the moment, but further news is expected shortly. The sixth location from the initial tranche of planned awards, the identity of which is not presently known, is on hold pending an environmental impact study. ACC posted its solicitation for the first six bases for adversary air support this past winter. Bids were due by March 31 for the locations at Kingsley Field, Oregon; Luke AFB, Arizona, Holloman AFB, New Mexico; Eglin AFB, Florida; Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina; and Kelly Field, Texas. ATAC says its two awards are worth a combined $240 million, and that it will see the company providing air-to-air adversary training missions for trainee pilots going through the Formal Training Units (FTUs) at these bases. The combined awards provide for over 3,000 sorties per year for up to 4.5 years, with ATAC using its new Dassault Mirage F1 fighters for the work. A former French Air Force Mirage F1CT now operated by ATAC., ATAC The awards are part of what is formally known as the Combat Air Forces Contracted Air Support (CAF CAS) program. It falls under a larger requirement to contract for such services at up to 22 operating locations: 12 for adversary air and 10 for contracted close air support (CAS). The US Air Force’s Air Combat Command (ACC) awarded seven companies contracts worth up to a combined total $6.4 billion on October 18, 2019, to provide adversary air ( ADAIR ) support over the next five years. The seven companies awarded contracts were ATAC, Air USA , Blue Air Training , Coastal Defense, Draken International , Tactical Air Support (TacAir), and Top Aces. “Performance is supposed to start within 90 days, we are shooting to get started a little sooner than that,” said Rich Zins, vice-president for business operations at ATAC as he revealed details of the company’s planned Holloman and Luke operations. “The contract is run on a sortie basis, not on a flight hour basis,” Zins said. This calls for 1,530 annual sorties at Luke and 1,558 sorties at Holloman. ATAC is now part of Textron Airborne Solutions, and in anticipation of the USAF requirement, it procured 61 former French Air Force Mirage F1CR/CT and F1B jets, which began arriving at its new Adversary Center of Excellence (ATAC-ACE) in June 2017. The aircraft are being returned to airworthy status at this Fort Worth Alliance Airport facility. ATAC’s first refurbished Mirage F1 flew at Alliance Airport on August 22, 2019. The first flight was a two-seat F1B which made an initial acceptance flight . The contract at Luke AFB is expected to include both F-16 and F-35A training support., USAF ATAC’s Mirages have received upgrades to date to permit operations in the U.S. This includes a new GPS, air-to-air TACAN, new radios, and a new attitude indicator. The aircraft retain their original head-up display (HUD), and Cyrano IV radar. They will be capable of carrying an electronic warfare training pod, captive air-to-air missiles (CATMs), and some government-furnished and contractor-furnished chaff and flares. Zins said the contract allows for an interim configuration so it can proceed as quickly as possible, but that he expects more upgrades to be rolled out as the contracts progress. ATAC says it currently has 10 Mirage F1s with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, five of which have U.S. Navy airworthiness certification thanks to a contract to support operations from Fort Worth, Texas. This U.S. Navy contract relates to Mirage F1s supporting F-35s on test and acceptance missions from the Lockheed Martin factory here. The ATAC F1s have also supported the U.S. Marine Corps’ reserve F/A-18 Hornets of Marine Strike Fighter Attack Squadron 112 (VMFA-112) Cowboys,” for air combat training. The contract with the Navy at Fort Worth followed disappointment for ATAC when it lost out to newcomer Tactical Air Support Inc (TACAIR) at NAS Fallon, Nevada. ATAC had enjoyed a long period of stable work supporting TOPGUN and fleet work-ups, before it lost out to TACAIR, the details of which you can read here in this previous War Zone report. The ATAC contracts for Luke and Holloman call for a mission rate of 4-turn-4, meaning four jets will fly in the morning and then be “turned” for the second wave of missions. Zins says this probably calls for at least five Mirages to be placed at each location to allow for at least one spare, but that number will probably rise to six jets at each base to allow for scheduled maintenance. ATAC will provide aggressor support for F-16 training at Holloman AFB., USAF ATAC is now working towards military flight release certification following the award of this contract. It’s five “Navy accredited” jets could allow the company to set up a USAF operating location early. “We have certified airplanes ready to go, ready to fly,” said Zins. The contract at Holloman calls for Mirages to support F-16 pilot training with the 54th Fighter Group. At Luke, the contract relates to both F-16 and F-35 training with the resident 56th Fighter Wing. Zins added that the work is related to training new aircrews and will mainly involve “basic radar intercept type stuff.” However, he added that the mission profiles call for the highest level mission system, known as Category C. The missions are expected to have a duration of around 1.2 hours at Holloman and around 1.4-1.5 hours at Luke do to differing transit times to and from the ranges. The USAF ADAIR requirement calls for several different aircraft types including those equipped to emulate 4th generation fighters, with requirements including operations at speeds of between Mach 0.8-1.5 and altitudes up to 50,000ft. The contracted aircraft must also be compatible with captive air-to-air training missiles and electronic countermeasures pods, some will have the ability to carry infrared search and track (IRST) systems, and around half will require a radar with a range of up to 80nm (148km). To date, Draken International has secured a significant amount of the USAF requirement, and it is currently supporting a five-year, $280-million ADAIR II contract, at Nellis AFB , Nevada, which followed an initial pathfinder study there. The Nellis contract specified that Draken’s aircraft must be capable of flying at Mach 1.5 and of completing sorties of up to 60 minutes. Draken has provided extensive support for the resident USAF Weapons School. ATACs new contract will support pilot training at two Formal Training Unit locations., USAF Draken International thas also expanded its fleet with former Spanish Air Force Mirage F1Ms , as well as 12 Denel Cheetahs from South Africa. The first of 22 ex-Spanish Mirages arrived at Draken’s Lakeland, Florida, facility in July 2018, and they are now in service supporting its contract at Nellis. Although ATAC has previously supported a USAF CAS training requirement in Europe with Aero L-39 training aircraft, this latest contract is a major win for the company. It was a company that pioneered much of the contract aggressor work that is now in such dramatic expansion. ATAC has serviced U.S. Navy contracts since 1994, and since the early 2000s has employed fleets of British Hawker Hunters and Israel Aircraft Industries Kfirs. These have become regular inhabitants of various Navy parking aprons as they detach to provide a range of training services to both fleet and training squadrons. That is now set to expand into the USAF community, as ATACs new Mirages herald a new era for the company.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2020",Belarusian BTR-80 Armored Vehicles Bounce Like Bumper Cars In Chain Traffic Accident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged on social media showing a number of Belarusian BTR-80 wheeled armored personnel carriers smacking into each other like pool balls during an accident while traveling in a convoy in the country’s capital Minsk this weekend. The vehicles were there ostensibly to take part in rehearsals for public demonstrations that will take place next weekend to mark the anniversaries of the founding of the country’s airborne and special operations forces. The video clip, which appears to have been shot on a cellphone by a bystander on a bus traveling on the same road, shows that there were at least five BTR-80s in the convoy, along with what may be other types of military vehicles, on July 26. The bus is initially stopped, suggesting that it could be sitting at a red light, when the accident occurs. Whatever the case, the driver of one of the BTR-80s doesn’t notice that the one in front had come to a stop, fails to brake in time, and rear-ends it. That armored personnel carrier then lurches forward and smacks the next one in line, which also travels forward and appears to hit yet another vehicle. It’s not clear if any civilian cars or trucks were hit in this accident. It’s not over yet, either. The BTR-80 that got hit first then tries to back up, but hits the one behind it, which had kicked off the entire pileup and had finally come to a stop. The bus begins to pull away after this episode of BTR bumper cars, which has brought the convoy to a complete stop by that point. It’s not immediately clear what damage any of the BTR-80s involved might have suffered or if anyone was injured in the process. Separate video from July 26 shows a number of these vehicles in downtown Minsk without any visible marks or obvious missing exterior components. Other clips show at least five of the armored personnel carriers, which are amphibious, driving in the Svislach River, which runs through Belarusian capital. There was also at least one other road accident on July 26 in Minsk involving a military truck. However, this was a much more traditional incident, where the truck hit a civilian car. The Belarusian armored personnel carriers careening into each feels reminiscent of an accident in Russia last year in which four civilian cars ended up smashed in between two Russian Army BTR-80s. The incident in Minsk, however, has a slightly more ominous component. These armored vehicles are in the capital ostensibly to take part in celebrations to make the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet Union’s airborne forces, from which independent Belarus’ airborne elements, as well as its special operations forces, draw their history, which is on Aug. 1. However, the country has been experiencing popular protests against the country’s dictatorial President Alexander Lukashenko since late May. Belarusian special operators rehearse in Minsk on July 26., Belta These demonstrations have been fueled in no small part by the Belarusian government’s poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The banning and arresting of opposition candidates who had registered to stand in the presidential election next month have also inflamed popular sentiment against the country’s longtime leader. Despite the official reason for the troops being in the capital, their sudden appearance was unannounced and prompted fears of an impending crackdown. So far, those fears have not materialized, but there remain concerns that Lukashenko, who has been President since the office was established in 1994 following the country’s gaining independence from the Soviet Union three years earlier, could resort to violence to break up the protests if he feels his grip on power slipping. Belarus’ state-run Belta news agency released this picture of a woman in a wedding gown walking in front of special operators in Minsk on July 26, which certainly strikes a different tone from the ongoing protests in the country., Belta It remains to be seen how the celebrations on Aug. 1 play out and what else might happen in Minsk before and after that. One can only hope that, if nothing else, the drivers of the BTR-80s now in the capital will do their best to avoid any more traffic accidents.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 12, 2020",Fender Bender Russian Style Leaves Four Cars Smashed Between Two BTR-80 Armored Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Absolutely no one likes getting in a fender bender for any reason whether you’re responsible for it or not. But recently, in Russia, where everyone seems to have a dash cam for good reason, four motorists found themselves in a particularly bad situation when what might’ve been a minor accident left them all sandwiched in between two 15-ton BTR-80 armored personnel carriers . Video from a dash cam and a passerby on their cellphone appeared online after the accident occurred in the city of Kursk in Western Russia on Feb. 27, 2019. Exactly what happened isn’t entirely clear. The dash cam clip comes from the first car to be caught in the incident and the footage begins with them sitting a red light at intersection. Two BTR-80s turn onto the street before the light turns green and the car drives up behind them. Additional BTR-80s, a BRDM-2 , and various trucks are seen driving in the opposite direction. At a certain point, the car and the BTR-80 in front of it come to a stop. The vehicle commander appears to be having a “lively” conversation with his crew before the armored personnel carrier starts to back up. The driver in the car honks and becomes audibly irate as the vehicle commander walks along the rear deck and begins trying to signal some sort of movement. It’s not clear if he’s trying to indicate that the BTR-80 is looking to turn around and join the convoy moving in the other direction or if he’s trying to tell the driver in the car to move. Then the vehicle commander begins making his way back to the front of the armored vehicle as it keeps reversing and finally slams into the car. But this isn’t over. The vehicle commander walks back to see what happened, appears to tell off the driver in the car for not backing up, and then calmly walks back to the front and sits down before the BTR-80 continues reversing until the hood of the car gives way and rolls up. Both vehicles have come to a stop before the video ends. The separate clip a person in a passing vehicle took after the accident shows why. The only thing that finally brought everything to a halt was three other cars getting caught up in the accident and ending up wedged into another BTR-80 behind them. They’ve all suffered various levels of damage from getting smashed between two 15-ton armored vehicles. Now, military vehicles, including all sorts of armored vehicles and other oversized types are hardly uncommon on Russian roads. The day before this accident in Kursk, a number of transporter-erector-launchers for the RS-24 Yars nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile – which may well have been carrying live missiles at the time – got stuck in bad traffic on the Moscow Automobile Ring Road like anyone else heading home from work. You also see many more of these clips, and other crazy happenings on the road, online from Russia due to the proliferation of dash cams in the country, which has more to do with the worrisome state of drivers in Russia and unscrupulous police. “You can get into your car without your pants on, but never get into a car without a dash cam,” Aleksei Dozorov, a Russian activist working to expose corruption among traffic cops, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in 2012 . It’s not the first time this kind of accident has apparently happened, either. Rob Lee , a PhD student at The Department of War Studies at King’s College in London, who was among those to spot the clips of the Kursk incident found footage of a similar incident where a BTR-80 had crushed a UAZ-452 ambulance in between it and another truck. There’s another clip showing a BMD-2 tracked airborne infantry fighting vehicle going sliding out of control and slamming into someone’s SUV before driving away. The vehicle commander, in that case, seems to wave in their direction as if to say “whoops!” If anything is clear from these accidents, if you intend on driving on Russian roads, Dozorov’s advice holds just as true now as it did six years ago. You might not have to wear pants to drive in Russia, but having a dash cam is a must. How else will you have video evidence when you go looking for a reimbursement from the Ministry of Defense for the damage some conscript driving an armored personnel carrier did to your car?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Angels’ first F/A-18E Super Hornet has touched down at the unit’s home base at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. This is the first of 18 Super Hornets that are set to replace the flight demonstration team’s aging legacy F/A-18 Hornets. Navy Captain Eric Doyle, the Director of the Blue Angels Super Hornet Transition Team, flew the jet from Boeing’s facilities at Cecil Field, near Jacksonville, Florida, to Pensacola on July 27, 2020. Pictures had first emerged of the aircraft, which is set to be the new Blue Angel 1, wearing the team’s blue and gold colors in May. “Acquiring our first Super Hornet is a momentous step in our inevitable transition scheduled for later this year and it required a herculean effort to get these fleet jets ready for our team,” Navy Command Brian Kesselring, commanding officer and flight leader of the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the official name of the Blue Angels, said in a statement. “We would like to especially thank the teams at Boeing, Chief of Naval Air Training Command, Naval Air Systems Command, Fleet Readiness Center Southeast, and Naval Supply Systems Command Weapons Systems Support.” The Blue Angels’ first Super Hornet sits in between the team’s existing legacy F/A-18 Hornets.

Beyond the new paint jobs, these aircraft will all receive special modifications in line with their new flight demonstration duties. You can read more about this conversion process and the modified routines these jets will fly in this past War Zone piece . The Blue Angels are set to get all of the Super Hornets by the end of this year with the hope that the team will be ready to perform with them next year. They are also in the process of getting a new dedicated transport, or “Fat Albert,” an ex-U.K. Royal Air Force C-130J Hercules airlifter, ready for the show season. It remains to be seen whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be a factor in the 2021 airshow season and when exactly crowds will get a chance to see the new Super Hornet-equipped Blue Angels perform for the first time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 8, 2020",Navy’s Super Hornet Boss On The Jet’s Game-Changing Infrared Search And Track Sensor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s fleet of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets keeps getting better with age as it soars into the middle of its service life. The latest Block III upgrade package, which will be applied to many earlier Super Hornets and new build models going forward, will offer a big suite of improvements that you can read all about in detail here . These Super Hornets and earlier Block II ones will soon be able to take advantage of an old concept that has become incredibly relevant once again, not to mention far more potent with an injection of new technologies—the Infrared Search and Track system, commonly referred to as IRST. The Navy has gone without any form of an IRST for nearly a decade and a half, but that is about to change as the Super Hornet’s IRST is slated to enter operations with the fleet in September of 2021, and it really couldn’t come sooner. With the proliferation of stealth technology and advanced electronic warfare capabilities, being able to leverage a passive sensor, one that uses the infrared spectrum alone, to detect and track airborne targets far beyond-visual-range is becoming essential. Not only can the IRST do this independently, but now, leveraging the latest in sensor-fusion capabilities, it can provide another critical sensor data stream that can corroborate a flight crew’s situational air-to-air ‘picture’ at any given time. It can do this while being totally immune to electromagnetic jamming and other electronic attacks, and it can see right through radar-evading stealth technology. F/A-18F equipped with an IRST. , Lockheed Martin Captain Jason Denney, head of the Super Hornet and Growler program for the U.S. Navy, was kind enough to field an in-depth interview and share his enthusiasm for this critical new capability with The War Zone . The discussion below answers a lot of questions many may have about the Navy’s IRST ‘renaissance’ of sorts, such as how the Super Hornet’s IRST ended up in the nose of an external fuel tank and how the sensor differs from its evolutionary predecessor found on the F-14D Super Tomcat before its retirement. Captain Jason Denney, USN For complete context and background, you can read an in-depth primer I wrote on IRSTs some time ago by clicking here . Now, without further ado, lets launch into the fascinating and potentially game-changing world of cutting-edge Infrared Search and Track systems with Navy’s officer tasked with leading the Super Hornet into the future: TR: The last time the Navy fielded an IRST was on the F-14D Super Tomcat. That aircraft was pulled from service 14 years ago. What capability was lost with its retirement? CD: So, an IRST is just another part of the spectrum. So, yes, when we retired the F-14 and we didn’t have the follow-on IRST readily available, we lost access to that part of the spectrum. So, if you think about the spectrum, I like to use analogy because I can get the concepts that I want across without broaching anything that is sensitive or classified. So, if you think about the electromagnetic spectrum, you’ve got parts of it that are widely used and have a lot of traffic like I-5 [the Interstate 5 highway], right? And then, you’ve got other parts of it that not a whole lot of traffic, they’re kind of like that side road, that country road that’s got a lot of stoplights and things. If you’re trying to get to grandma’s house, I-5 is probably the quickest, most direct way to go. You can get there via the side road, but they may not have been cleared from the latest snow, or you’re going to run into some traffic in small towns, but it’s a viable way to get there. So, when we didn’t have the IRST ready to go when we retired the last F-14 squads [squadrons], we kind of lost that off-ramp into that side road and we’re kind of limited to I-5. So, you can see that when you get a traffic jam on I-5, you’re either stuck or if you have the ability to get off and take that road, you have another viable way to get there. F-14D with its chin pod holding the AN/AAS-42 IRST on the left side and the Television Cameras System on the left.  , USN TR: Why does the service want the capability back now? CD: It wasn’t wanting it back now… You got to look at what aircraft were out there at the time, and then, what were we doing at the time with those aircraft. So, throughout the ’80s and ’90s, you have the Tomcat and that was our air-to-air interceptor. We could do some air-to-ground stuff, but it was an air-to-air machine. And I’m a former Tomcat guy, I was a B guy, I never flew the D, but that thing was an air-to-air machine. Then you had the F-18 [Hornet] that was designed as a replacement for the A-4 and the A-7 with a limited amount of air-to-air capability, right? And then, going throughout Navy fighter history, the dark times of the ’90s where Tomcat 21 got shut down, Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter didn’t go anywhere, A-12 got shut down, and the Navy is staring at a blank slate going “What’s our plan?” And so, that’s when they came up with the Super Hornet. “Hey, let’s build a bigger, better Hornet,” if you will. So, it wasn’t a “We got out of the IRST business.” It was just kind of where the aircraft were going at the time and what they were designed to do. If you look at the F-18, one of the aspects that it has that none of the other aircraft that carry an IRST in the nose have, is the location of the gun. Our gun is squarely right in the nose of the aircraft. The other closest one is the F-14, where it’s kinda underneath the aircrew. So, there’s really no good place to put it in the nose without completely redesigning the whole nose of the aircraft. That was not what they had planned to do with the E/F [Super Hornet]. They needed it, they needed it online now, the cost and the schedule were paramount. So, they said, “Hey, let’s get the airframe out there and then we will catch up with the sensors when we need to.” Then, fast forward… So, that’s the Block I Super Hornet. In the Block II Super Hornet, they were focused on redesigning the forward fuselage and to integrate the APG-79 AESA [active electronically-scanned array radar], because we wanted that monster radar in there. About the time that this was going on was the early 2000s and we accelerated getting out of the Tomcat business a couple of years early. The Super Hornet’s AN/APG-79 AESA radar and M61 Vulcan 20mm cannon take up nearly the entire nose of the aircraft., USN So now, about the time that we got Block II [Super Hornet] out the door, with AESAs at a point where we could field that, now we’re looking saying, “Okay, what capability do we need to bring back, now that we’ve retired the Tomcat?” IRST, first on the list. So, that’s when they came in, and our first CDD for that, our Capability Design Document, was in 2007. That kind of matches right about when we had got that first tranche of Block II capability, which had new mission computers, a new software language, the APG-79, all that stuff in there that we were able to actually now start integrating. TR: The IRST21 that is being fielded on the Super Hornet is based on the F-14D’s AAS-42. What improvements have been made to the sensor in 30 years since it was first fielded? CD: Yeah, great question. So, for the sensor itself, we’ve improved the optical design and the detector technology to get up with the 30 years of advancements, and then to provide some improved sensitivity and performance. That’s pretty much all I’ll say about that. The rest of it really has been a lot of reliability and maintainability stuff. We put a new IMU [Inertial Measurement Unit] in there and upgraded the gyro electronics, so that it could maintain a track more accurately, in line with where we are with technology today. Then a lot of the R&M [Reliability and Maintainability] stuff… We couldn’t get the circuit cards anymore, so they were completely obsolete. So, we had to go redesign those and use more modern chipsets and things like that. Then, things, even just for keeping it on the wing longer, if you will, there’s a gear drive that they use to control the elevation, and we found that it was susceptible to getting dust in it and the gears not working properly, so we replaced that with a band drive. Then things like brushless motors, those types of things, just so that when we finally field it again, it has more time on the aircraft and less time being down for maintenance, which was one of the things that really hurt the Tomcat IRST. Lockheed Martin TR: What’s the current state of the program? Have operational units received any early production models? What is the current fielding schedule and how many are each squadron slated to get when it does hit the fleet? CD: Alright. So, some of that belongs in CNAF’s [Commander, Naval Air Forces] wheelhouse and we can talk about that later, but let me talk at the end of your question… I’m gonna jump around a little bit, because right now, we are in developmental tests of Block II. That’s going through developmental tests this year and we’re gonna transition to operational tests sometime next year, for the Block II IRST. Now, originally, the Block II IRST was the original IRST that we wanted on the airplane. Due to sequestration, budget cuts, and things going on in the earlier part of this decade, they split it apart, so you have the Block I and the Block II [IRST]. For various reasons, we did not put the Block I out into the fleet as per the plan and a lot of that had to do with folks not really understanding how to use the IRST. We can talk a little bit about that later. So right now, that’s where we are, in developmental tests on Block II. IRST21 built into the centerline tank on the Super Hornet during tests. , USN For acquisition planning purposes, we have an idea of how many will go to each squadron, but that’s just so that we can budget out how many we need to buy a year, how much that’s gonna cost, so Congress can hold us accountable and things like that. We have a number in mind for what each squadron would have, but once it’s fielded, that’s all up to CNAF. They’re gonna learn how reliable and maintainable it is, or maybe the tactics, techniques, and procedures. There was an assumption made when we said, “Hey, we’re only to give half a dozen to each squadron at fielding.” They say, “No, we’re gonna use it in a different way now. And now we need 10 or 12 in each squadron.” So, they’ll move those assets around, and we’ve done that with everything from ATFLIR [Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared], to ALR-67 [radar warning recievers], to the ALQ-214 jammer. So, that’s all just depending on the fleet use… TR: What type of testing has been done to validate the system? Is there any work being done with the Air Force, which is running a very similar program for the F-15 and potentially the F-16? CD: Yeah, we did full DT [developmental testing] on the Block I, and like I said, we’re in DT for the Block II now. We’ve done carrier suitability and various things like that, just to make sure that the system noise and vibration, all those types of things, and on performance, like going, “Hey, run it against the sensor, against different scenarios,” and things like that. So, that’s really how we do developmental test. Operational test, as you know, is where we give it to the operational testers and they try and use it, kind of how they would think that they would use it in the fleet and say, “Hey, is this operationally suitable or effective?” TR: Right. And that’s upcoming still at this point? CD: Correct. So, you’d asked a question about the Air Force. We haven’t done anything specifically, co-development-wise with the Air Force. There are certain [common] aspects of the IRST, what they’re developing and ours. So, with the hardware modifications, things like that, we’ve kept a lot of those common, and commonality helps us when it comes down to configuration management or being able to buy huge blocks of them. If we all had, say, the same circuit card, for example, then, hey, we combine the Air Force and the Navy buys and then we all get a better price for it. But other than that, we really haven’t done a whole lot of close coordination because their requirements and their implementation are very different than ours. F-15C carrying Lockheed’s IRST carrying Legion Pod., USAF TR: The IRST for the Super Hornet is being fitted on a centerline external fuel tank in a package form where it’s all together in one. Why was this chosen over mounting it somewhere internally? I know we talked a little bit about the gun being an issue, but what about another podded form, like, say, on the intake station, or on a wing station? CD: Yeah, so that’s a great question. I was actually a lieutenant in my first tour of the VX-31 [Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 31] when this debate began, and I will tell you, there were a lot of opinions and a lot of heated discussions about it. But ultimately, it came down to, you got a balance of the size/weight/power/cooling requirements of what the IRST would be, what’s available on the aircraft versus how much money it costs to develop and integrate that form factor. Then you balance that against the field of regard versus giving up a weapon station versus giving up fuel. So, there were all kinds of discussions on, “Hey, if we put it in a dedicated pod kinda like the Air Force has done, on the centerline, okay, that mitigates the fact that we don’t have room in the nose. And that gives you a pretty good field of regard left and right, but now I’ve given up 3,300 pounds of gas.” Okay, well, that’s no good, especially on the Super Hornet. Now, you’re limited to having to carry double-bubble fuel tanks. “Well, okay, now I’ve given up two weapon stations instead of one.” So, there are all these iterations of, “Hey, where can we put this thing?” Then, again, back in 2006-2007, when we were having these discussions, we were right in [the] middle of OEF [Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan] and OIF [Operation Iraqi Freedom]. So, having the ability to carry varied loadouts and maximum flexibility on what you could carry meant that nobody was really willing to give up a weapon station. So, they weighed all of those options and it came down to, “Hey, if we put it in a fuel tank on the centerline, we get the best field of regard that we can, because if you put it on the left or the right wing, you’re blanking one side of the aircraft or the other.” It’s kind of odd to put a sensor in a fuel tank, but now I’m only giving up 900 pounds of fuel instead of 3,300 pounds of fuel. A conceptual diagram of how the IRST21 sensor is mounted in the fuel tank for the Super Hornet. , Lockheed Martin That was kind of the trade-offs that went into, “Okay, why are we doing it this way?” And those are the big things, plus, like we said, trying to find room for it in the nose, you’d have to remotely mount the electronics for the optics and they didn’t really know how to do that at the time, to work around the gun. So, cost and integration-wise, it was supposed to be simpler and easier to put it where it is. TR: There have been some questions regarding that location where it’s on the centerline, that it would block a lot of the sensor’s upward field of view, but it’s good left, right, and down. How does this actually work in practice? Is it a major limitation? CD: I can’t get into details of what the field of regard is, but I will say that, in general, unless you are lined up pretty much exactly on centerline, really close and really high, the IRST is gonna see you. Its field of regard is actually surprisingly good, because remember, you’re down and aft. So, like in the Tomcat, if I was up close to the chin and underneath the nose, that nose is blocking more angles than maybe if I’m further down and away from the nose. And then, we never fight by ourselves, so I’m going to have a wingman out there, hopefully he’s offset enough and has enough range that his IRST is gonna be able to pick up what mine doesn’t and vice-versa. Test F/A-18F with the IRST. , Lockheed Martin TR: Right. How will the Super Hornet pilot use an IRST? Is it integrated and fused into the mission systems on the aircraft? What do they see in a cockpit, information-wise, when they employ it? CD: Interestingly enough, in the Tomcat, it was completely separated. And I, as a RIO [Radar Intercept Officer], my job was managing all the sensors. So, when I talk to some of my F-14D RIO buddies, that was one of the things that the pilot used, the IRST, and the RIO managed the radar, and then they kinda correlated together as they got closer to try and figure out what the information was telling them. Obviously, that doesn’t work very well in a single-seat cockpit like the F-18E. So, there will be much tighter integration with the systems. We do have our version of fusion, it’s called MSI. It was originally Multi-Sensor Integration, but it’s kinda changed to Multi-Source Integration since we added Link 16 into the mix. What that does is, it was originally designed for the legacy Hornet, was to be able to correlate an IFF [Identification Friend or Foe] hit with the radar track. If the computer says, “Hey, okay, I’ve got an IFF hit here and I got a radar track here, yes, those are the same track.” So, we’ve added Link 16 over the years, and now IRST is going to be a contributor to that as well. So hopefully, what the pilot will see is a fused track on his display that says, “I’ve got a contribution from the radar, IFF, Link 16, and an IRST.” TR: And for stealthy targets, that means if it doesn’t show up on radar, you’re still going be able to get some sort of sensor location off of it, hopefully. That’d be the goal, correct? CD: Yes. So, depending on what’s out there, maybe there’s a Link 16 track that’s somehow able to either not get jammed, or they’re in a different band of radar, that says, “Hey, we’ve got somebody here and the IRST can correlate with that,” sure, absolutely. But they’re supposed to, hopefully, see some sort of information out there correlated with the other information that’s in the jet. With stealth technology now proliferating around the globe, both in terms of fighter designs like the J-20 above, cruise missiles, and especially drones, the IRST will be critical to spotting these threats before it is too late. , PLAAF TR: Are there different modes that the sensor can operate in, kind of like a radar? Does it provide an actual image to the pilot of the target for them to even get an idea of what it is, if it’s a fighter or what type even? CD: So, that would be specific capabilities and we’re not gonna talk about the image piece of it. But as far as the different modes, yeah, actually it’s much more akin to a mechanically-scanned radar than it is anything else. Which is interestingly enough, with this generation of JOs [Junior Officers] that have grown up with AESA , to go back and teach them, “Hey, you’ve gotta actually have dedicated mechanics to make sure the thing’s pointed where you want it to,” has been interesting to see, because I grew up with mechanically-scanned radar and it was almost a joke to go to AESA. So, yeah, it has a couple of modes, more like the Track While Scan [TWS], if you’re familiar with TWS on mechanically-scanned radars. So, it’s TWS-Manual, TWS-Auto, where either you pick where the sensor’s looking or it picks where the sensor’s looking based on what track it sees. So, it’s very much in line with a mech-scan radar construct. TR: It can track multiple targets at one time? CD: Yes, it can track more than one target at a time. TR: I know range figures are confidential, but is there any way you can just speak to sort of what it’s supposed to be able to see, just generally, and how weather and whatnot would impact a sensor like this? CD: We won’t get into specifics, that’s capabilities, but you’re really talking about physics now at this point. So range, if you think about the submarine using its sonar , it’s the same kind of thing, it’s a passive sensor. I can get a line of bearing from it, but other information? Now I’ve gotta do something. So, if I take a line of bearing on anything, and then I move, and I take another line of bearing, and I take another line of bearing. Eventually, I can get kind of a sense of where that thing might be. And if that’s a stationary target, that’s easier. If it’s a moving target, or if I’m stationary and the target’s moving, okay, I take a cut, take a cut, take a cut, I can then tell generally which direction he’s going, but without knowing something about the range or something about the velocity, I gotta make some assumptions… If it’s really close to me, then it may be going really slow to have that same angular displacement in the same amount of time as if it’s really far away from me, then it’s gotta be going ungodly fast in order to have the same angular displacement, right? So, in order to determine range and things like that, there’s a whole lot of crazy math that has to go on, and in the end, your radar is a much better range sensor than an IRST is. Does that make sense? TR: Yeah. And I’d imagine since you’re all data linked together, you could have a couple of Hornets working together with their IRSTs to figure out triangulation and that sort of thing using that same math, correct? CD: Well, so that would go into specific capability, but like I said before, I have Link 16 tracks coming across, so if somebody else has a range on a track and now my IRST can correlate to it, then I can start correlating my sensors. A render of Block III Super Hornets packing IRSTs. , Boeing It’s an extra tool in the toolbox that gives me options that I wouldn’t have otherwise if I didn’t have it. Then to your question on weather and things like that. Yeah, just like every other IR sensor out there it is also a slave to physics, which is beautiful because physics doesn’t care what side of the conflict you’re on, it plays fairly both ways. There are parts of the spectrum where either oxygen or water vapor really crush your transmissivity, or if I’ve got a lot of water droplets or things in the air, it’s gonna decrease the amount of infrared radiation that’s able to make it to my sensor, and it’s going to degrade performance. Believe it or not, that happens to our radar as well. If I see enough water vapor or… Well, not water vapor, but water droplets in the air, my radar can pick that up, and it’s actually a useful thing because now I have basically a poor man’s weather radar. I can steer myself around thunderstorms and such. So, there are gonna be limitations to it, and we just have to work through those, and sometimes you can turn them into an advantage. If you think about a submarine that’s got the different thermal layers it has to deal with, it actually uses those to hide rather than complain about, “Well, my sonar doesn’t work going through a thermal layer.” So, these are all kinds of things that, going forward, what kind of mindset do you have? Is it, the degraded performance, is that really always a bad thing or maybe it’s helping hide me from them as well? TR: Right. Will it be able to work in a missile defense role? Or checking out surface targets? Detecting stealthy surface targets, that sort of thing in the future? And is this something that would be tied into CEC? CD: Yeah, that’s all capabilities and TTP. Sorry, Ty. TR: No worries. Obviously, you’ve gotten a lot of pilot feedback because this thing has been in the air in some form for years now. What are they telling you? What’s their perspective on the new sensor and how do they see it fitting into their potential gameplans during their training and operations? CD: Topgun is giving us a lot of good feedback right now, believe it or not, because they’re working through trying to figure out what the TTPs are going to be so when we fleet release, the fleet has them ready to go. So, a lot of the feedback we’ve gotten is, like I said, the, “Hey, once you have to manage another sensor and get used to using a mechanically-scanned sensor again,” and they’ve wrapped their heads around that, the feedback’s generally been very positive. A lot of the other feedback we’ve got is more crew-vehicle interface and the ability to… Maybe I can slave it to the radar or I can slave the radar to the IRST, things that we used to do in the Tomcat. But just how that plays out, so that either in an E-cockpit or an F-cockpit, the aircrew can maximize the potential benefits of the sensor. But generally, the feedback has been very positive. F/A-18F takes to the air with its centerline fuel tank/IRST. , Lockheed martin TR: Has the Marine Corps shown any interest in maybe adding something like this to their legacy Hornets that are getting the upgraded with the AESA radar and everything else? CD: Yeah. So, that’s not a priority for them right now, at least IRST, the legacy radar upgrade is. And it’s just management of resources and the amount of time they have left on that platform. It takes time to integrate these things, and are they going to get a return on investment by the time they get it on to, by the time that they have to wind down the platform. So, that’s the calculus the Marine Corps is going through right now. But right now, they’re not purchasing it. TR: The IRST is kind of an advantage for a fourth-plus generation fighter, that you can put something like this on it without having it screw around with a stealth fighter’s low observability. At the same time, obviously, this is being fielded for low observable targets as one of the driving factors. F-35, has there been any work to kind of see if they could work together with an F-35, a Super Hornet with an IRST, and anyway that the IRST could help that team? CD: Yeah. Well, and you’re exactly right. So, what we say here at Super Hornet is we have the capacity to augment the F-35’s capability. So, as an air wing, we want to make sure that we have the ability to go out and fight as a cohesive force, the whole 4th, 5th gen mix. So, yeah, there are discussions going on of how the capabilities on the Super Hornet are going to augment what the F-35 is capable of. And that’s pretty much all I can say about that. DAWDC F/A-18E/F Super Hornets fly alongside F-35Cs, USN TR: Any talk about loading this on to an MQ-25 or even a ship? Using it as a sensor on a surface combatant? CD: I can’t really talk about that. MQ-25 is… It is hard-over that the MQ-25A is a tanker only. I’m sure there’s probably some discussions going on at Boeing about trying to throw it on there, but that’s not a Navy requirement right now. And then for a ship, I haven’t personally seen anything on that. I suppose it’s possible. I just don’t know… I don’t know what it would buy the ship. I’d have to see what their requirement is, what they think that they’re gonna do with it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Iran Looks Set To Blow Up Its Fake Aircraft Carrier Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery shows that Iran has towed its refurbished mock aircraft carrier out into the strategic Strait of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, strongly suggesting that it will be a feature in an upcoming exercise. The movement of the heavily modified barge, which is meant to be a surrogate for an American flattop, came just days before a still-murky U.S. Air Force intercept of an Iranian airliner over Syria last week and followed a string of mysterious explosions and fires, some of which may have been the result of foreign sabotage. One image from satellite firm Maxar, dated July 25, 2020, shows a tug moving the barge , which has a broadly similar outward appearance to a U.S. Navy Nimitz class carrier and has 16 faux fighter jets on its deck, including some that are visually reminiscent of F/A-18 Hornets or Super Hornets . Another image, from the following day , shows the mock carrier, which also has a large crosshair painted on its top deck, stationary with a small speed boat-type watercraft approaching it at high speed. It’s not clear when the Iranians moved the barge into the Straight of Hormuz from its mooring in the port city of Bandar Abbas. The War Zone reviewed imagery from Planet Labs that shows that it was still at Bandar Abbas on July 20, but had left by July 23. The carrier first emerged in 2014, ostensibly as a prop for a movie, titled Airbus , about the infamous shootdown of Iran Air Flight 655 by the USS Vincennes in 1988. American-Canadian owned Reel Knights and an unspecified “entertainment company” were reportedly set to join forces on the movie, with Sean Stone, Oliver Stone’s son, directing. However, in February 2015, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) attacked the fake carrier during major exercise, known as Great Prophet IX, in the Strait of Hormuz. The barge suffered significant damage and had sat for years a largely unrepaired state outside the Iranian naval base in Bandar Abbas. IRGC speed boat-type craft fire rockets at the fake aircraft carrier during Great Prophet IX in 2015., AP The fake carrier explodes during the 2015 exercise., AP In 2019, there were indications that the Iranians had begun to refurbish it . In August 2019, satellite imagery showed that they had moved it inside the protected portion of the naval base’s harbor to continue working on it. By February 2020, it looked complete. The fake carrier outside of the protected portion of the harbor in July 2019., Google Earth The faux flattop moved inside the protected portion of the harbor in August 2019., Google Earth Work on the barge looks complete in this satellite image from February 2020. The fake aircraft on its deck are visible., Google Earth Iran, which is subject to an ever-growing number of international sanctions, especially from the United States with regards to its oil and natural gas industries, routinely conducts military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz and threatens to blockade the strategic waterway in response to foreign aggression. Though the total amount fluctuates regularly, between 20 and 30 percent of all of the world’s oil exports pass through this maritime passage. Closing it off, even relatively briefly, would have major first and second-order worldwide economic impacts, something The War Zone has explored in-depth in the past . Iran also routinely objects to the presence of American warships in the Persian Gulf, especially aircraft carriers, and constantly threatens to attack them if provoked. In April, a swarm of IRGC speed boats harassed Navy and Coast Guard ships in that body of water while they conducted their own exercises, coming dangerously close at times. The Navy has also confirmed that, in December 2019, at least 18 IRGC boats sailed alongside the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships in her strike group as they passed out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Oman by way of the Strait of Hormuz. A key component of Iran’s simulated operation against the mock aircraft carrier during Great Prophet IX in 2015 was a swarming boat attack. This is a very real threat to American and other foreign ships in the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere, as The War Zone has highlighted on multiple occasions . https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkbS4BQxTgg Iran also has a wide array of other anti-ship capabilities, including midget submarines capable of launching anti-ship cruise missiles , land-based anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles , naval mines , remote-controlled suicide boats , and combat divers carrying limpet mines . In May, the IRGC also revealed what appeared to be a small, unmanned submarine-shaped vehicle that could also launch suicide attacks. An apparent unmanned submarine-like vehicle the IRGC debuted publicly in May., ISNA IRNA It’s unclear whether this craft was capable of fully submerging or operating only in a semi-submerged state, which would be similar to the method of operation of many so-called “ narco subs ” used for drug smuggling. Even if a small portion of the vehicle would have to remain above the waterline, it could still be very hard for a target ship to spot. It remains to be seen just what Iranians might throw at the fake carrier, though the overall signal it is meant to send, a broad challenge to the United States and policy of maximum pressure toward the regime in Tehran, will be clear, regardless. It could also provide a sorely needed propaganda victory for the regime in Tehran, which is under immense pressure, including internally over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic . It may take on greater significance in light of the nebulous intercept by two U.S. Air Force F-15 combat jets of an Airbus A310 airliner belonging to Iran’s Mahan Air over Syria on July 23. The U.S. military has denied that it harassed the A310 and simply conducted a legal visual inspection after the aircraft did not respond to requests to identify itself after appearing to deviate from an established air route over a strategic forward operating base housing U.S.-backed Syrian forces. Iranian Road Minister Mohammad Eslami has described the incident as a “terrorist act, one of aggression” and Laya Joneydi, Iran’s Vice President for Legal Affairs, has said it was a “clear violation of aviation security.” Iran has also seen a number of explosions and fires in recent weeks, which reports have indicated could, in some cases, be deliberate acts by foreign powers, chiefly Israel , potentially with assistance from the United States . In one of these incidents earlier this month, seven civilian ships caught fire in the port city of Bushehr, which is situated on Iran’s southern coast on the other side of the Persian Gulf from Bandar Abbas. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pcOa2ckihEc A separate report recently said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has expanded the Central Intelligence Agency’s authority to conduct covert operations against the regime in Tehran, including cyber-attacks . Iran blowing up its fake aircraft carrier again will offer an opportunity to both evaluate and publicly demonstrate its extensive naval warfare capabilities, sending a signal to the United States and producing some highly value propaganda for domestic consumption at the same time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 5, 2020",Check Out This Sailor Holding A Laser Rifle Aboard The Nuclear Submarine USS Minnesota,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy posted an image on Twitter of the USS Minnesota , the 10th Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarine, congratulating its crew for earning the Meritorious Unit Commendation. The image shows sailors atop the sub’s conning tower and has some interesting details, but the weapon that one of the submarine’s crewmen is holding really stands out. Submarines are at their most vulnerable when transiting on the surface in busy waterways. As such, force protection is critical in order to shield them from everything from explosive-laden boats to drones. When just a number of seconds can mean the difference between a possible threat and an imminent attack, having a less-than-lethal option for deterring nearby potential threats and repelling actual attacks is highly valuable. Enter the laser dazzler. US Navy These light projection devices fire highly powerful and sometimes modulated laser beams with pinpoint precision over long distances. The idea is they will temporarily blind and disorient an attacker, or even the electronic optics being used by a threat. What you can’t see you cannot attack, or at the very least the disorienting nature of the dazzler will buy precious seconds to better assess the situation and apply lethal force, if necessary. The weapon we see in this image is the B.E. Meyers Glare LA-9/P. The manufacturer’s website describes the system as such: For long-distance hail and warning, especially during maritime security, the GLARE® LA-9/P combines a powerful green beam with Eye Safe® technology. The laser rapidly determines if an unintended observer is within the nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and immediately shuts off the glaring output to prevent accidental eye injury. Once the bystander has moved out of the NOHD, the laser output instantly resumes. Warnings can be sent out to 4 km at night and 1.5 km during daylight. Offensive glaring is achievable out to 500m to hinder and prevent further aggression. In theater, GLARE lasers have been proven to save lives of both civilians and soldiers by providing a rapid warning method across cultural and linguistic boundaries. The main idea behind the system is that it modulates its output based its range to the target via using an internal laser range-finder. Thus the maximum eye-safe setting can be used throughout the engagement. This is also important because international law prohibits the employment of any such system that is deliberately designed to cause permanent blindness. LA-9/P., B.E. Meyers A Navy fact sheet on what it calls ‘non-lethal optical distractors’ reads: Non-lethal optical distracters are visible laser devices that have reversible optical effects on human targets. These types of non-blinding laser devices use highly directional optical energy to support several non-lethal capabilities, including: • Temporarily overwhelming an adversary’s visual sense by emitting a credible glare source • Providing an unequivocal, non-verbal warning • Providing the target an opportunity to clarify intent Although these capabilities are generic to any high-intensity light source, laser light sources are ideal for non-lethal applications, as the optical energy is collimated and very directional. This allows the user to precisely deliver the optical energy to a target at long ranges, while minimizing the total power output of the device and minimizing collateral effects to other bystanders. While defending checkpoints and disorienting potential threats during raids are major applications for these weapons, you can see how well suited they can be to protecting vulnerable maritime assets, too. At the very least, they can make it clear to nearby boaters and pilots that they shouldn’t come closer without having to communicate audibly, by radio, or by firing actual warning shots. Laser dazzlers aboard a US Navy ship., US Navy With suicide and unmanned vessel attacks being among the biggest potential threats to ships these days, laser dazzlers offer an essential layer of protection. Even lower-end drones, whether airborne or waterborne, could be repelled via dazzlers by blinding their electro-optical systems. The ability to pinpoint the laser’s aim is why they are mounted on a rifle stock that is also equipped with a scope. The Navy has deployed these systems on many of its ships, including its aircraft carriers, but the service is already fielding a far more powerful, hard-mounted, laser dazzler that will have a much greater range and a better ability to blind more advanced electronic optics. Named ODIN, it’s already deployed on one of the Navy’s destroyers and will be on seven more in just three years . LA-9P laser dazzler training aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz ., US Navy Laser dazzlers are becoming increasingly common among other militaries around the world, as well. China, in particular, has embraced them to a high degree , and they have used them against U.S. assets in troubling ways . When it comes to lasers on submarines, there was a recent report that U.S. submarines may receive a laser mast of some sort in the future. Although some conjecture was likely overblown as to what is feasible in terms of such a system’s capabilities, it would likely only be able to engage drones and small craft, if at all, and more likely it would be a dazzler system similar to ODIN. Also seen in the picture of the Minnesota that the Navy posted is the submarine’s dual AN/BVS-1 photonics masts . Unlike traditional periscopes, these do not penetrate the main hull. Instead, they send their electro-optical and infrared video and imagery to the sub’s control room digitally. This allows the control room to be placed lower in the main hull on the Virginia class as the periscopes don’t have to reach it physically. US Navy The system has high-power infrared and electro-optical cameras, a laser rangefinder, as well as a modular top unit that can be swapped out with electronic warfare, electronic surveillance, and communications payloads. The mast is coated in radar-absorbent material and is designed to avoid detection when extended. So, the big takeaway here is if you are sailing near a U.S. Navy warship and suddenly get hit with a green beam of light, turn around. The next opportunity to pull away may come via a burst from a machinegun, or not at all.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",RQ-170 Sentinel Stealth Spy Drone Photographed Landing At Plant 42 In Palmdale,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Well over a decade since the “Beast Of Kandahar” was first exposed, the stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel spy drone remains an elusive beast indeed. We only know of it operating from six locales with certainty: Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan, Kunsan Air Base in South Korea , Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, Tonopah Test Range Airport and Creech Air Force Base in Nevada , as well as Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . Now we can add its place of birth to the list, Plant 42 in Palmdale, California—home of the world-famous Lockheed Skunk Works . The Sentinel, which was made famous for helping find and kill Osama Bin Laden just to fall into Iranian hands months later, landed at Plant 42 in broad daylight while wearing some peculiar bright orange markings on its fuselage. Its small airframe, which only spans roughly 38 feet , is designed to be disassembled and shipped overseas by aerial cargo jet. So, even though the still unknown number of RQ-170s that exist were all built at the Skunk Works plant, they don’t operate from Plant 42. The person who took the photos noted the following about the chance encounter: All of a sudden I heard a clearance for a short approach from “JOHNNY01.” A prop plane, a Beech 55 with the registration N254BC, comes high overhead and then I turn and there’s an RQ-170 with dayglo markings! The RQ-170 just dropped out of the sky and did the steepest approach ever, followed by high-speed taxi into the Skunk Works area. The Beech 55 chase plane circled over Skunk Works until the RQ-170 disappeared into a tent there. Then the Beech landed. There were two C-130s in the pattern also and they asked the tower if the UAV landed because they had a hard time seeing it move from the downwind. It is such a small airframe. The witness also noted that the whole movement lasted maybe just two minutes. The aircraft dove in for a landing, fast-taxied to the Skunk Works ramp, and disappeared. We cannot confirm that the Beech 55 was indeed the chase aircraft for the Sentinel in question, but the aircraft, which appears to live at nearby Fox Field, does make some unique flights around ‘Flight Test Valley,’ and regular trips to Beale Air Force Base . N254BC over Plant 42. , Submission As for the RQ-170’s curious coloring, the aircraft appears to wear the darker of three schemes we have seen so far. One is a white-cream color, another is a black and cream test scheme, and finally, the darker gray one , although there may be slightly lighter and darker variations of the latter. submission The orange areas on the aircraft immediately reminded me of the first color photo I ever saw of the RQ-170, which was then operating in Afghanistan and dubbed the elusive ‘Beast of Kandahar.’ That image, which is from around 2007, showed a cream-colored Sentinel with similar high-visibility treatments applied to its upper fuselage. Since then, I have never seen or heard of another Sentinel configured with the orange markings. That is until today. The Beast of Kandahar, before we knew it was the RQ-170, sporting some kind of high-visibility orange skin treatment. , Uncredited It isn’t precisely clear what this orange-colored treatment is for. Is it tape used to seal crevices and gaps in the Sentinel’s skin, similar to those used on all stealth aircraft? If so, why orange? The answer could be that it provides high-visibility markings to assist in visual tracking during test flights. Bright orange is synonymous with flight testing for a reason. As the witness mentioned, the RQ-170 is easy to lose sight of, especially side-on, where its visual footprint looks more like a flying saucer than a flying wing. A bit of orange paint or tape could probably go a long way in fixing this issue. As for why would a Sentinel land at Palmdale now, after all these years? That isn’t clear either. Maybe a handful of the drones have slipped in and out before, but that would have been far from a regular occurrence, especially during the daytime. Otherwise, they would have been seen. So there you have it, at least one of the still secretive RQ-170s has returned to the nest under its own power where it was originally hatched. With any luck, this will be the first of many flights of Sentinels back to their place of birth.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2020","No, The Air Force’s Shadowy Surveillance Test Plane Wasn’t Spying On Portland Protesters","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says that a specialized Dornier Do-328 twin-engine turboprop was not snooping on ongoing protests in Portland, Oregon during a series of flights earlier this week. Online flight tracking software had shown the aircraft, which belongs to a secretive special projects office called Big Safari and conducts research and development and test and evaluation activities in support of U.S. Special Operations Command, flying circular orbits often associated with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in the area. The aircraft, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N645HM and is also known by the nickname Cougar , had first arrived at Hillsboro Airport outside Portland on July 19, 2020. The plane flew patterns for three days straight, but was never actually over downtown Portland, where protests are occurring, for any protracted period of time. It left the area today for Denver, Colorado, another area where it had been observed flying similar orbits last week. N645HM’s route near Portland on July 21., ADS-B Exchange The aircraft’s flight on July 22., ADS-B Exchange Cougar’s orbit on July 23., ADS-B Exchange A similar orbit that N645HM flew near Boulder, Colorado outside of Denver on July 17., ADS-B Exchange. “The Dornier Do 328 aircraft, assigned to Air Force Materiel Command’s 645th Aeronautical Engineering [Systems] Group, was not gathering intelligence or conducting operations related to civil unrest in Portland, Oregon,” Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokesperson, said in a statement to The War Zone , using the formal unit designation for the Big Safari program office . “This week the Air Force conducted previously planned test flights in the Northwest United States that required the environmental conditions typical of the region. This location was chosen several months ago due to the high likelihood of cloud cover desired for this equipment test.” Portland has seen persistent protests since May, when they first began in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. President Donald Trump’s Administration sent Federal law enforcement officers from various agencies, including Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Marshals Service , to the city earlier this month where they have been engaged in a controversial crackdown on the demonstrators using at best murky legal authority . The appearance of N645HM nearby drew the attention of activists, journalists, and politicians, who were concerned that this reflected a further militarization of the Federal Government’s response. There are strict laws for when the President may order military elements operating in a Federal capacity to respond to any crisis or contingency within the United States, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . “It would be totally unacceptable for U.S. armed forces to take part in surveillance of protests in an American city,” Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, had told The Intercept . “I’ve asked the Air Force to explain these flights, including why this plane is circling Portland, what data it is collecting and who approved the mission.” That’s not to say there hasn’t been actual aerial surveillance going on of the Portland protests in recent weeks. These flights have included a number of aircraft, including those flown by local and federal law enforcement agencies. At least one of Customs and Border Protection’s Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft , which are twin-engine Beechcraft King Air turboprops configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, has arrived in the Portland area just this evening.. So what was Cougar actually doing? “We do not discuss specific capabilities or testing conducted by Big Safari,” Stefanek, the Air Force spokesperson, said in a separate statement to The War Zone , using the official nickname for the 645th Aeronautical Engineering Systems Group (AESG). “For all research, development, test and evaluation missions, as well as system modernization missions, Air Force Materiel Command units routinely fly in dedicated military operating areas, restricted airspace and the broader national airspace system. Each mission profile is logistically unique depending on the nature of the system being tested.” However, as I was first to report back in 2015 for War Is Boring , Cougar is set up to be a modular, plug-and-play testbed for sensors, communications systems, defensive countermeasures, and even weapons. Inside, the aircraft has readily reconfigurable work stations and equipment racks, as well as adaptable fuselage bays, to support all kinds of related testing. The plane also has two external sponsons, one on each side of the rear fuselage, that can carry stores or other equipment externally. SOCOM SOCOM Aviation photographer Paul Carter was kind enough to share pictures of N645HM that he took during the plane’s recent visit to Hillsboro that show it is fitted with one large sensor turret on the sponson on its left side. These kinds of turrets typically hold full-motion electro-optical, infrared, or multispectral video cameras . They can also support persistent wide-area aerial surveillance systems. The right-side sponson appears to have a small pod of some kind fitted. It’s hard to say what might be inside, but possible options might include a communications or data link system, a miniature electro-optical system, some sort of lidar or laser mapping scanner, or even a countermeasures system. There are increasingly tiny radar systems , as well, although that is quite small for that type of application. Paul Carter A closeup of the pod N645HM was carrying while at Hillsboro., Paul Carter The aircraft also has a large dome on top, typically associated with high-bandwidth satellite communications systems able to send video feeds and other data beyond-line-of-sight in near-real-time. It also has a bat-wing ultra-high-frequency satellite communications antenna on top of the forward fuselage. Both the dome and the platter antenna have been seen fitted to the aircraft regularly in the past. Paul Carter Without being able to see inside, its not clear what other systems it might have been carrying during its flights over Oregon this week. Still, we do know that those sorties took it over both rural and some urbanized areas, which could have provided a good opportunity to test any systems in very different environments. This would be especially valuable for evaluating the ability of payloads to collect useful imagery or other data about objects of interest. It’s just important to test all types of systems under different atmospheric conditions, too. Oregon definitely provides a dynamic weather environment. As to who ordered up these tests, it’s unclear. Big Safari traces its history back to the Cold War and today it is responsible for managing a wide variety of specialized and often classified aircraft programs. These include the Air Force’s RC-135 fleets , Area 51’s unique HH-60U Ghost Hawk helicopters, and what are often described as “non-standard” aircraft . It supports secretive aviation projects for other U.S. military services, U.S. government agencies , and even foreign allies and partners , too. N645HM is known to actively support U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) projects, specifically, though it is not related in any direct way to the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) fleet of C-146A Wolfhounds , which are militarized Dornier Do 328s configured primarily as light airlifters. A US Air Force C-146A Wolfhound., USAF Not much is known about N645HM, which the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) sold to the Air Force in 2014, or its specific activities, in general. The fact that it is known that it belongs to Big Safari at all is something of a clerical error. SNC listed the 645th AESG the buyer in the official bill of sale that it sent to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In 2018, officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where the group is headquartered, tried to get it changed to simply “United States Air Force,” but the FAA said they would need to submit a revised bill of sale, according to documents the author obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Air Force appears to have dropped the issue and renewed the plane’s registration just this year without making any changes to the information about who actually owns the plane. USAF via FOIA FAA via FOIA In many ways, Cougar’s appearance in the Portland area seems very similar to the activities of an even more top-secret Air Force CASA CN-235 aircraft near Seattle, Washington in 2017. That aircraft, which is also configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and affiliated with the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), flew circles over that city for days as part of what could have been a test or exercise. Whatever N645HM was or wasn’t doing near Portland this week, the Air Force has now unequivocally said it was not related to the protests in that city.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 22, 2022",Huge Pacific Exercise Centered On Guam Brings Allies Together Amid Growing China Threat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia has joined forces with the U.S and Japan for a huge trilateral exercise that is being held in the Indo-Pacific region over the coming months. The collaboration brings together the Australian Defense Forces, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, which are engaged in the regional deployment. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has dispatched an impressive fleet of fighters, tankers, and an airborne early warning aircraft to Andersen Air Force Base, on the U.S. Pacific island of Guam, as part of the Regional Presence Deployment. This particular phase of the activities runs from July 21 to August 2. The series of events are designed to act as a clear example of how the U.S. is partnering with regional allies amid concerns over security in the Indo-Pacific area, including the South China Sea. More than 150 RAAF personnel deployed to Andersen AFB as part of a series of training events originally unveiled by Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds in early July. The RAAF Air Task Unit on Guam includes F/A-18A Hornets from No. 77 Squadron, EA-18G Growlers from No. 6 Squadron, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft from No. 2 Squadron, and KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transports (MRTTs) that will collectively conduct advanced air-sea integration drills with maritime forces. EA-18G crews arrive at Andersen AFB., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence/Sgt Guy Young Australian and Japanese naval flotillas joined the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) and her associated Carrier Strike Group in the Philippine Sea on July 19. It marked the start of the joint exercises that are taking place throughout Southeast Asia and will later move on to Hawaii. Australia and Japan both share long-standing alliances with the U.S. and this year marks the 60th anniversary of the treaty of mutual cooperation and security between America and Japan. Complementing the land-based air power, the Royal Australian Navy involvement includes the first-in-class amphibious assault ship HMAS Canberra , along with first-in-class destroyer HMAS Hobart , the Anzac class frigate HMAS Arunta , and fleet replenishment ship HMAS Sirius . The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) involvement is based around the Akizuki class destroyer JS Teruzuki . “The experience in this exercise will give us tactical and operational advantages and make our friendships stronger, in addition to our regular joint exercises with both like-minded navies,” commented Capt Sakano Yusuke of the JMSDF. Australian and Japanese ships joined the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in the Philippine Sea on July 19., U.S. Navy/MCS2C Codie L. Soule The forward-deployed aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan is at the center of the U.S. Navy participation. The Carrier Strike Group includes the embarked Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5), the Ticonderoga -class guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam (CG-54), and Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin (DDG-89). Exercising interoperability during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to some unusual operating procedures, particularly related to the health and safety of personnel. In one example, two Australian Army Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters flew from the Canberra to land on the Ronald Reagan . In line with Australian Government advice relating to COVID-19 restrictions, the helicopter crews remained in the cockpits while U.S. Navy personnel supported the turnaround. Australian Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters approach the USS Ronald Reagan ., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence/LSIS Kieren Whiteley The concept of forward-deploying land-based Army helicopters aboard naval assets, as illustrated by the Tigers aboard HMAS Canberra , is nothing new . In recent years, the U.S. Navy’s converted amphibious transport dock USS Ponce regularly hosted attack helicopters, and its successor, the USS Lewis B. Puller, continues to do so today . The ability to combine offensive support rotary-wing assets with a maritime environment serves as a useful means to expand their reach and missions set, primarily through the ability to refuel and rearm them at sea. The various ships will operate together in Southeast Asia, before moving east to participate in the large Rim-of-The-Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise near Hawaii. The overall Australian deployment is planned to encompass a wide range of activities, including bilateral and multilateral naval maneuvers, as well as proving the ability to contribute to regional contingencies and humanitarian assistance missions if they arise. “Training serials will include a RAAF E-7A Wedgetail working alongside the Royal Australian Navy air warfare destroyer HMAS Hobart to generate the overall air and sea picture,” said Wing Commander Jason Easthope, the Air Task Unit commander. Australia aims to demonstrate the ability to conduct complex and extended deployments at sea and in the air with its regional partners. Interoperability coupled with maritime integration is a key training objective, particularly during the operations surrounding Guam. The Royal Australian Navy’s HMAS Canberra ., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence//LSIS Ernesto Sanchez “The opportunity to work alongside the U.S. and Japanese is invaluable,” said Commodore Michael Harris, commander, Australian Joint Task Group. “Maintaining security and safety at sea requires navies to be able to cooperate seamlessly. The combined tasking between our navies demonstrates a high degree of interoperability and compatibility between Australia, the U.S., and Japan.” Australian and Japanese participation in joint exercises with the U.S. in this region is not unusual. The huge Cope North exercise earlier this year centered upon Andersen AFB, included a range of aircraft from the Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) and the RAAF). “The high-end interoperability we enjoy with the JMSDF and ADF provides us the unique ability to meet at-sea and immediately operate at an advanced level. This highlights the enduring nature of our alliances with Japan and Australia,” said Capt Russ Caldwell, the commanding officer of the USS Antietam . “The U.S is fortunate to routinely operate alongside its allies across the Indo-Pacific, and coordinated operations like these reinforce our mutual commitments to international maritime norms and promoting regional stability.” A No. 6 Squadron EA-18G lands at Andersen AFB., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence/Sgt Guy Young The RAAF deployment to Guam underscores the strategic importance of the island, which stands as a key air force and naval staging base in the western Pacific. Andersen is far enough away from potential adversaries to offer a greater level of survivability during conflict than would be expected for America’s air bases in Japan, for example. However, Guam’s vulnerabilities have led to the U.S looking to expand and exploit other facilities such as Wake Island , which would offer a larger buffer against potential enemy attacks. That vulnerability of Andersen AFB includes forward-deployed airpower’s reliance on vulnerable runways, which would clearly be a key target in the event of a conflict with China. Guam currently has a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery for ballistic missile defense, but an all-out attack would easily overwhelm any defense efforts to render the airfield inoperative. Admiral Philip Davidson, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command wants an Aegis Ashore System on Guam by 2026, according to recent reports. The system comes with an estimated price tag of $1.67 billion over six years. This is seen as a vital requirement for protecting Guam that needs to be in place as soon as possible. Aegis Ashore would provide a 360-degree, persistent, integrated missile defense for Guam as part of a new U.S Pacific Deterrence Initiative. Despite the potency of this system, Japan recently rejected Aegis Ashore plans amid strong public opposition to the program and its shoreline basing locations. The Pentagon is working hard to bring unpredictability to its Pacific theater operating model. Evolving to a new emphasis on austere expeditionary warfare in the Pacific. This includes the use of small landmasses and staging operations from them, setting up shop at austere locations, quickly developing airfields , adding defenses, and completing the mission before moving on. A Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A tanker refuels a U.S. Air Force B-1B during the Regional Presence Deployment., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence In line with this, in April the USAF ended its 16-year Continuous Bomber Presence in Guam, saying it was now focused on sending smaller bomber deployments to the region as part of a new dynamic force employment model. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) boss Gen Timothy Ray said this means bombers can operate around the globe, even without being permanently deployed to bases abroad: “We can come and go anytime they need us, we don’t need to be there physically,” he said. The latest series of Indo-Pacific joint exercises come during a particularly low ebb in U.S.-Chinese relations. This has been exacerbated by a number of factors including new security laws in Hong Kong, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and an aggressive Chinese stance toward Taiwan. Recent months have seen a notable increase in U.S. military activity in the South China Sea, which was monitored and amplified by the Chinese SCS Probing Initiative, as is detailed in this piece by the War Zone . U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally rejected many of China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea in July. He said that Beijing’s claims to offshore resources across the area were “completely unlawful.” The joint nature of the recent exercises also included the Indian Navy on July 20, when the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) worked together with four Indian ships during a passing exercise, known as a Passex, near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The possible invitation for Australia to join the U.S.-Indian Malabar exercise is yet another example of expanding U.S. military cooperation with allies in the Pacific, with a clear eye toward challenging China. Aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Five overfly the navy flotilla., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence//LSIS Ernesto Sanchez Early July also saw the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan operating jointly in the South China Sea in the first dual-carrier exercise there in six years. In addition, U.S. Air Force B-52Hs flew all the way to the area from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before they landed on Guam . The USAF continuous bomber presence in Guam may have ended, but it hasn’t resulted in a vacuum of activity from Air Force Global Strike Command in the region or from Guam itself. In May, four B-1B Lancers from the 7th Bomb Wing returned here for yet another deployment. These aircraft have also been working alongside the RAAF aircraft since their arrival in July, including KC-30A tankers supporting the bombers’ missions. These U.S.-led exercises illustrate a clear resolve for the U.S., Australia, and Japan to stand shoulder-to-shoulder when it comes to this critically important and volatile theater. Bringing together multi-faceted military capability and operating with uncomplicated understanding is essential to providing a firm deterrent through agile and scalable warfighting.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 24, 2020",New Details Emerge About F-15 Intercept Of Iranian Airbus Over Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. officials now say that a U.S. Air Force F-15 only came within 5,000 feet of an Airbus A310 airliner belonging to Iran’s Air Mahan during an incident over Syria yesterday. They have also stated that Air Mahan Flight 1152 appeared to deviate from the established flight route and did not respond to radio calls to identify itself while flying over a strategic garrison near the city of At Tanf that U.S.-backed Syrian forces operate, prompting the intercept in the first place. Details about exactly how the July 23rd incident went down remain limited. Supposedly, the F-15’s intercept prompted Mahan Air Flight 1152, which was on its way from the Iranian capital Tehran to Beirut in Lebanon, to make an evasive maneuver leading to several injuries among the passengers on board. The U.S. military has established a deconfliction zone around the garrison at At Tanf that stretches 55 miles in all directions, which it says is a no-go zone for forces aligned with the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, including Russian and Iranian-backed groups . American aircraft, especially F-15E Strike Eagles based in neighboring Jordan , routinely patrol the area to keep foreign combat aircraft out and reportedly require all planes , even commercial airliners, to identify themselves while passing over. Fox News has now reported that U.S. forces saw that Mahan Air Flight 1152 had “drifted from [the] established air route” and sent two F-15s to investigate. ABC News says that the aircraft did not identify itself in response to radio calls, leading to the combat jets flying closer to visually inspect it. A U.S. official also told Fox News that the F-15s had come within around 5,000 feet of the airliner at the very closest, after approaching from behind on a parallel course, during the intercept. U.S. Central Command had issued a statement yesterday saying that the combat jets had come to within around 3,290 feet from the A310. That same official said that at least one of the F-15s had received a tonal alert about being in close proximity to another aircraft, but that this is “fairly standard” and there was “no risk” of the two planes actually hitting each other. Typically, collision avoidance systems, such as the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), produce auditory and visual alerts based on the estimated time and space separating two aircraft. For example, two planes with TCAS installed that are closing on each other at a speed of 300 knots will get particularly serious notifications telling them to change course in some fashion when they are 25 seconds away from hitting each other, which translates to a distance of around 2.1 nautical miles. However, it’s not clear exactly what collision avoid capabilities the American combat jets had available at the time of this encounter. A visual representation of a hypothetical interaction showing when Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems will produce a “traffic advisory” (TA) about the presence of a nearby aircraft, as well as more serious “resolution advisories” (RA) directing pilots to maneuver to avoid a collision., Eurocontrol via Wikimedia It is possible that the pilots of Air Mahan Flight 1152 received a similar warning and may have overcorrected for any of a number of reasons. Online flight tracking software does show that the A310, which appears to have had its commercial ADS-B transponder on and configured appropriately the entire time, did relatively suddenly drop in altitude while near At Tanf. Other previously available data shows an earlier Air Mahan airliner making a very similar maneuver in the same general area of Syria on July 20, though there were no reports of another dangerous intercept at the time. “The visual inspection occurred to ensure the safety of coalition personnel at At Tanf garrison,” according to CENTCOM’s statement from July 23.” Once the F-15 pilot identified the aircraft as a Mahan Air passenger plane, the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft. The professional intercept was conducted in accordance with international standards.” For its part, the Iranian regime has been surprisingly reserved about this incident, which reportedly resulted in four people having to go to the hospital once Air Mahan Flight 1152 touched down in Beirut. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) was first to report there had been an intercept of any kind, initially incorrectly identifying the F-15 as belonging to Israel. “The incident is under investigation,” Abbas Mousavi, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said, according to Iran’s PressTV . “Due political and legal measures will be taken upon completion of the information at hand.” Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi also told U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the regime in Tehran would hold the United States “responsible” if anything happened to the Air Mahan A310 as it returned to Iran, PressTV also reported. Online flight tracking software showed that the aircraft returned to Iran last night along the same route without any further excitement. What fallout there might be from this incident remains to be seen, but it does come amid a new period of increased friction between the United States and Iran. The U.S. government continues to pursue a policy of maximum pressure against the regime in Tehran, primarily through economic sanctions. However, this campaign may also now increasingly include covert activities, including cyber-attacks . Mysterious fires and other incidents, including an explosion at a centrifuge production building at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, have wracked Iran this month. Reports have suggested that at least some of these are actually acts of sabotage by Israel , possibly with American assistance . Mahan Air has been under U.S. sanctions for nearly a decade and is heavily linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its external operations arm, the Quds Force, which is responsible for supporting proxy forces around the world, including in Syria and Lebanon. The U.S. government killed the previous head of the Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani , in a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, in January, which prompted an unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strike on U.S. forces in that country and led to a particularly worrisome spike in regional tensions, the effects of which are still being felt . Whatever may or may not have happened in the skies above At Tanf certainly underscores the continued risk of relatively routine activities leading to much more serious escalations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 24, 2020",U.S. Says Its F-15s Intercepted Iranian Airliner That Made Erratic Maneuvers (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two U.S. Air Force F-15 combat jets reportedly flew in the vicinity of an Airbus A310 airliner belonging to Iran’s Mahan Airlines over Syria today, but a U.S. official has said that the warplanes were conducting “legal, routine flights.” This follows still murky reports that the F-15s harassed the Mahan Airlines flight, causing it to make an evasive maneuver and leading to a number of injuries among its passengers. VOA was first to report that American military aircraft were flying in the same general airspace as Mahan Air Flight 1152 on July 23, 2020, as the A310 passed over a strategic forward garrison that American forces and their local Syrian partners operate near the city of At Tanf in Syria. This site is situated in the southeastern portion of the country near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. At the time of writing, the U.S. military has not offered a detailed explanation of exactly what happened in the skies over At Tanf. The state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) news agency had been the first to report the alleged dangerous maneuvering by the F-15s based on information from one of its journalists on Mahan Air Flight 1152, which was heading from Iran’s capital Tehran to Beirut, Lebanon at the time of the incident. Video footage reportedly from onboard the aircraft after the incident shows debris in the aisles and at least one passenger with blood running from their forehead. Others are seen wearing uninflated life jackets. Some emergency oxygen masks are seen deployed in the cabin, but no passengers appear to be wearing them. Another clip taken from behind one airliner’s windows shows an F-15 flying alongside the airliner at a considerable distance away and then peeling off. Iranian quasi-state media, Syrian state media, and pro-Iranian Lebanese outlets quickly picked up the story , with many initially identifying the two F-15s as Israeli. There has been no official statement from the Israel Defense Forces, but Israeli media reports had said that the IDF had denied any involvement even before the confirmation that the U.S. aircraft were in the area at the time. Online flight tracking software does show that Mahan Air Flight 1152 did make a relatively rapid descent of about 250 feet as it flew over western Iraq toward the airspace over At Tanf. However, Another Mahan Air airliner flying the same route from Tehran to Beirut made a nearly identical maneuver in the same general location on July 20 without there being any apparent incident. The A310 landed safely Lebanon, though there were unconfirmed reports that at least four individuals had to be taken to the hospital after the plane touched down. A photograph reportedly of the plane on the tarmac Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport shows individuals being transferred to an ambulance. After a normal amount of time on the ground in Beirut, the aircraft took back off and headed back toward Tehran along the same route. It passed back over At Tanf, without any further reported harassment. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles are forward deployed to Jordan and do routinely patrol the airspace around At Tanf , which has been the target of a number of attacks by forces aligned with the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, including Iranian-backed militias and drones , in recent years. It’s not necessarily unfounded that these combat jets would fly up to check out an Iranian airliner flying over the garrison. The U.S. government has also sanctioned Mahan Airlines, which it says is a key instrument in Iran’s support of proxy forces in Syria, as well as Lebanon and elsewhere. It has also been tied to Iranian efforts evade other sanctions . Other countries, including Israel and France , have also alleged that Mahan Air is actively involved in illicit and otherwise hostile activity on behalf of the Iranian government. This incident also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump continues to pursue a policy of maximum pressure against Iran, which includes extensive sanctions and reported covert activities aimed at destabilizing the Iranian regime. In recent weeks there have been a series of mysterious incidents, including an explosion at a centrifuge production center within Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, as well as numerous fires, that have put Iranian forces on high alert. Reports have suggested that at least some of these separate incidents could be the work of foreign actors, namely Israel and possibly with the help of the United States . Whatever may or may not have happened between the U.S. Air Force’s F-15s and Mahan Airlines Flight 1152 over Syria, it seems almost certain it will further contribute to the already heated tensions between the two longtime foes. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: U.S. Central Command has made it clear that U.S. Air Force F-15s did indeed intercept the airliner in question near At Tanf, but that the fighters stayed thousands of feet away from the Airbus during the intercept: The below statement is attributable to Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command: A U.S. F-15 on a routine air mission in the vicinity of the CJTF-OIR At Tanf garrison in Syria conducted a standard visual inspection of a Mahan Air passenger airliner at a safe distance of approximately 1,000 meters from the airliner this evening. The visual inspection occurred to ensure the safety of coalition personnel at At Tanf garrison. Once the F-15 pilot identified the aircraft as a Mahan Air passenger plane, the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft. The professional intercept was conducted in accordance with international standards. UPDATE: Iranian authorities have now said they are investigating the incident. “The incident is under investigation,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, according to Iran’s PressTV . “Due political and legal measures will be taken upon completion of the information at hand.” PressTV also reported that Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi also told U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the regime in Tehran would hold the United States “responsible” if anything happened to the Air Mahan A310 as it returned to Iran. There is no indication of any further incidents involving the flight, which made the return trip last night. You can find our continuing coverage of this incident in a new story here .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020","Here’s The List Of Studies The Military’s Secretive UFO Program Funded, Some Were Junk","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a year after its existence became public, the details surrounding the U.S. military’s Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, or AATIP , continue to be as fascinating as they are bizarre. We now know the titles of all of the nearly 40 studies the project funded in roughly four years of operation, as well as their authors and who they worked for. These reports cover a far wider breadth of topics than previously known, ranging from invisibility cloaks and warps drives , to fusion power and laser weapons , to more general advanced physics and materials science work. Some of the work appears to have been legitimate, but there’s at least one instance where the U.S. government almost certainly paid for junk science. Steven Aftergood, who leads the Federation of American Scientists’ (FAS) Project on Government Secrecy obtained a copy of the list on Jan. 16, 2019, along with a cover letter, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which you can see below. The original five-page document is available here . The Defense Intelligence Agency had originally put together the list at the request of the offices of the late Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona and his ranking Democrat colleague on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island’s Jack Reed. Author’s note: It has come to our attention that George Knapp’s I-Team , part of Las Vegas CBS affiliate Channel 8 News, had obtained and published a near-complete list of the report titles and authors in July 2018. Nick Pope also obtained the same five-page document that FAS did earlier this month. DIA via FAS DIA vis FAS DIA via FAS DIA via FAS DIA via FAS “Based on interest from your staff regarding the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)’s role in the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program (AATIP) please find attached a list of all products produced under the AATIP contract for DIA to publish,” the cover letter reads. “The purpose of AATIP was to investigate foreign advanced aerospace weapons threats from the present out to the next 40 years.” That second statement is interesting in of itself given what is otherwise known about the program , which officially began in 2007 as the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications (AAWSA) program. Between 2008 and 2012, DIA spent approximately $22 million on the program, which eventually became known as AATIP, and produced a total of 38 reports. Robert Bigelow’s Bigelow Aerospace had won the AATIP contract and managed its research. Bigelow, who made his money in the hotel and real estate industries, is well known for his interest in unidentified flying objects (UFO), fringe science, and the paranormal. Individuals who worked for the program, including Luis Elizondo, who was head of the project for DIA, have since said publicly that investigating reported UFO sightings was a particular focus of the efforts. As we at The War Zone have noted before , this actually makes good sense in many ways, since UFO sightings can turn out to be very real advanced and top-secret aviation programs . At least outwardly, DIA appeared to be taking the work of AATIP seriously, placing it under its Defense Warning Office, which has been monitoring for “threats to U.S. interests in critical regions” since its creation in 2002 . We know that AATIP definitely did do some investigating of UFO sightings. The disclosure of the program’s existence has led to the emergence of a detailed report on a 2004 sighting of an object commonly known as the “Tic-Tac,” as well as video footage that F/A-18 Hornets shot using their Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) targeting pods during that incident. You can view those clips below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Fd6ssvcBoM But it has also already been clear that AATIP sponsored research into a much wider array of topics beyond UFOs. Based on the list that FAS obtained, much of the research does appear to have come from reputable sources, even if the topics sound highly theoretical or outlandish in some cases. Of the 38 studies, more than half were the work of individuals working at academic institutions, such as the University of Nevada-Las Vegas , University of Nevada-Reno , The Ohio State University , and the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. You can find a good rundown of different authors and their known work at The Black Vault , which collects previously classified government documents and makes them available online. One report from the University of St. Andrews may sound particularly fanciful with its title “Invisibility Cloaking,” but came by way of German scientist Dr. Ulf Leonhardt , who has been publishing papers on that topic since 2006 and is a noted expert on the topic. Though widely thought to be still far away from being practical, his research is grounded in real science to do with quantum physics and the behavior of light . There are two more reports from Lockheed Martin, one of which is explicitly about fusion power and another that appears to be related to that topic. That firm’s legendary advanced projects division, the Skunk Works , has been publicly working to make fusion a reality since 2014 . A third report from the company is simply titled “Air Breathing Propulsion and Power for Aerospace Applications” and sounds well in line with its known work on advanced propulsion technologies, including hypersonic aircraft and missiles . Virginia-headquartered Directed Technologies, Inc., which has been receiving government contracts since 1985 , appears to have provided a report so legitimate on high energy laser weapon development that AATIP published two versions, one of which was classified Secret with instructions not to release it to foreign nationals. This is the only one of the 38 studies that is classified in any way. All of the others are simply labeled “For Official Use Only.” But the full list also exposes more dubious projects based on more questionable science from a network of individuals with close ties to Bigelow. The largest single source of these reports is EarthTech International of Austin, Texas. EarthTech’s CEO Harold ‘Hal’ Puthoff, Ph.D. and another one of the company’s employees, Eric Davis, Ph.D. both have ties to the Nevada business mogul’s now-defunct National Institute for Discovery Science, or NIDSci . An archived copy of that organization’s website is available here and features information UFO sightings, extraterrestrials, and other fringe topics. Puthoff and Davis were the primary authors on six of the 38 reports in total between them. Davis is also the co-author on another report from independent consultant Richard Obousy. Since the list FAS received only notes the primary author, it’s impossible to know how many of the studies EarthTech may have actually had a hand in. Three of these reports are available online and we at The War Zone have examined their contents previously . In late 2017, after news of the program first broke, Corey Goode posted copies of two of the reports online, one covering “Advanced Space Propulsion” and another delving into “Warp Drive, Dark Energy, and the Manipulation of Extra Dimensions.” A third report, dealing with “Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, And Negative Energy,” is available separately . A figure representing a notional “stargate” in New York City from “Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, And Negative Energy,” a report that AATIP sponsored., DIA All three of these works rely on what is, at best, borderline fringe science. All three individuals have direct links to Bigelow himself. The list contains additional reports from Dr. George Hathaway of Hathaway Consulting, another person with clear ties to Bigelow and his more fringe and paranormal interests, including Paul Czysz , a retired Air Force officer and McDonnell Douglas engineer, another known name in the UFO watcher community, was also among the contributors to AATIP’s research. Marc Millis, a former NASA propulsion engineer who founded the non-profit The Tau Zero Foundation , which works on various efforts related to novel spaceflight concepts, including faster-than-light travel, is also among the authors. Millis left NASA following an apparent scandal for attending a venture capital event that Joe Firmage hosted in 1999. Firmage is a Silicon Valley tech millionaire who says he had an unexplained visionary experience with a being who he says produced a ball of energy, which then entered his body. In addition, there is at least one instance where the work that DIA, or Bigelow acting on their behalf, agreed to fund is especially suspect. Robert Baker’s GravWave company supplied AATIP with a report on high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). However, a 2008 report from the JASON group , a collective of expert scientists who advises the U.S. government, questioned the very scientific grounding of separate work Baker had done for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on this topic. “The proposed applications of the science of HFGW are fundamentally wrong,” the JASON review said of Baker’s work. “No foreign threat in HFGW is credible.” With all of this in mind, the newly released list of reports that AATIP funded paints a newly complex picture of the organization and its research efforts. It also further calls into question what its exact objectives were and how focused its work was in meeting those goals – or not. Hal Puthoff and Luis Elizondo both have gone on to work for the To The Stars Academy , which former Blink 182 front man-turned- UFO enthusiast Tom DeLonge founded in 2015. This private enterprise is continuing to pursue similar work as what had occurred under AATIP, albeit in the unclassified realm, as well as entertainment-related projects and extremely exotic aeronautics programs of questionable merit. There’s still nothing official to confirm the more outlandish claims of work that AATIP may have been doing on the side, including accounts of having mysterious material from downed objects in storage lockers. But what is clear is that there is still much about the program that we don’t know. Some would say that this information remains squirreled away out of concern that it would reveal an actual threat to national security, or alternatively, it would be overly embarrassing to disclose. The nature of a number of the reports the program generated would seem to lend evidence to the latter. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Joe Firmage claimed he had been abducted by aliens. He claims that he had a visionary experience with an unexplained being. He has also said that he believes in extraterrestrial life and that those beings have visited earth, but not that they have abducted him.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2020",Space Force Boss Says One Of Russia’s Killer Satellites Fired A Projectile In Orbit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of U.S. Space Force, the U.S. military’s newest branch, had said publicly for the first time that the Russian government has conducted two on-orbit anti-satellite weapon tests in the past three years. These revelations come less than six months after the U.S. military expressed concern about a Russian “inspector” satellite that appeared to be shadowing an American KH-11 spy satellite. Chief of Space Operations General John “Jay” Raymond, Space Force’s top uniformed officer, revealed the two apparent tests in an interview with Time for a profile of the new service. Raymond is also presently head of the joint-service U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM). That piece, which was published on July 23, 2020, offers a detailed look at where Space Force is now and where it hopes to go in the future and is worth reading in full . “Russia is developing on-orbit capabilities that seek to exploit our reliance on space-based systems,” Raymond told Time . He explained that, on July 15, 2020, a satellite identified as Cosmos 2543 launched a projectile that could be used to destroy another craft in space. The Kremlin describes Cosmos 2543, also sometimes written Kosmos 2543, as a “ space apparatus inspector ,” one of a number in orbit now, which are ostensibly intended to do just what the name says, inspect other satellites. On the face of it, this offers Russian officials a way to investigate problems with or assess damage to other space-based assets on-orbit. However, given their small size and high degrees of maneuverability, there have been long-standing concerns that these orbital inspectors could double as spies or even “ killer satellites ” capable of getting close to and then disrupting or destroying other space-based platforms by any of a number of means, including electronic warfare jamming or a directed energy weapon, such as a high-powered microwave beam . They could also potentially manipulate a satellite in a way that would disable it or launch kinetic attacks, either smashing into the target themselves or launching projectiles, the latter being something that Space Force now says the Kremlin has been actively testing. An infographic from the Defense Intelligence Agency depicting a number of ways in which one satellite might attack another, including by acting as kinetic kill vehicle., DIA The destruction of various satellites could easily be a key feature of any future large-scale conflict, especially during its opening stages. The U.S. military, among others, is heavily reliant on space-based systems for a wide array of functions, including early warning , intelligence gathering , communications and data-sharing, navigation and weapons guidance , and more. It’s worth noting that another inspector satellite, Cosmos 2542, which the Russian government launched in November 2019, had actually deployed Cosmos 2543 while in orbit the following month. Time says the U.S. military has dubbed these “nesting doll” satellites, a reference to traditional Russian matryoshka dolls . The Russian Ministry of Defense had previously announced a test involving Cosmos 2543 on July 15. However, it said that this simply involved the satellite maneuvering close to another orbital inspector, Cosmos 2535, and gathering imagery and other information in line with its publicly stated inspection mission. At that time, U.S. Space Command did note that it had detected something separating from Cosmos 2543, which it labeled Object 45915, but recorded its type as “to be determined.” The assertion that these satellites are actually part of a space-based anti-satellite weapon system is even more significant given that Cosmos 2542 had moved into a position to shadow a U.S. KH-11 spy satellite, publicly identified only as USA 245, in January. The month before, USA 245 had shifted its own orbit, potentially to avoid hitting the smaller Cosmos 2543, which Space Force later said also appeared to be following the American satellite. A graphical representation of the position of Cosmos 2542 with regards to USA 245 in January 2020. , via @M_R_Thomp “This is unusual and disturbing behavior and has the potential to create a dangerous situation in space,” General Raymond said at the time in a statement to Business Insider . “The United States finds these recent activities to be concerning and do not reflect the behavior of a responsible spacefaring nation.” It’s worth noting that this was hardly the first instances of satellites shadowing each other in space and that U.S. government has conducted similar activities in the past, as well. However, it appears now that the U.S. military had a particular concern about what was going on in January based on existing intelligence. General Raymond also told Time that the space-based anti-satellite weapon test on July 15 was similar to something the U.S. military had observed in 2017. He did not elaborate on that previous incident, but it seems very possible that is related to another set of “nesting doll” satellites that emerged that year . The Kremlin launched the first of these, Cosmos 2519, in June 2017. Two months later, that satellite deployed another, dubbed Cosmos 2521. These were joined by a third, Cosmos 2523, which also appeared to have been deployed on-orbit from other these other satellites, in November 2017. If that trio is what Raymond was referring to, it’s unclear if Cosmos 2523 is what the U.S. military believes was actually an anti-satellite interceptor or if one of these satellites launched yet another object at some point. “This is further evidence of Russia’s continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin’s published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk,” the head of Space Force said in a separate statement following the publishing of Time ‘s piece. Chief of Space Operations General John “Jay” Raymond., USAF “This event highlights Russia’s hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control, with which Moscow aims to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting its own counter-space program – both ground-based anti-satellite capabilities and what would appear to be actual in-orbit anti-satellite weaponry,” Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford also said. Russia, as well as China and others around the world, has been actively developing various anti-satellite systems, including ground-based and air-launched interceptors and directed energy weapons . In April 2020, Space Force publicly accused Russia of testing an unspecified “direct-ascent anti-satellite missile,” or DS-ASAT. “Russia’s DA-ASAT test provides yet another example that the threats to U.S. and allied space systems are real, serious and growing,” General Raymond said in a statement after that test. “The United States is ready and committed to deterring aggression and defending the Nation, our allies and U.S. interests from hostile acts in space.” These public statements, together with the disclosure of the earlier assessment that an on-orbit anti-satellite weapon test had taken place in 2017, also follow comments from various senior U.S. military officials about the need to declassify more about what it is doing in space and the threats that it faces, as well as how it might be able to respond. In 2019, then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson warned that the United States might have to demonstrate its own counter-space capabilities in the future in order to deter potential adversaries. “We’ve got some education to do for the average Americans on just how reliant their lives are on space capabilities,” General Raymond told Time . The disclosure that Russia has been testing on-orbit anti-satellite weapons certainly appears to be part of a campaign to increase public awareness of the very real threats to space-based systems that exist now and are continuing to emerge.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Dec 22, 2020",F-35s Nest In Big New Alaskan Facility Marking Strategic Shift For Critical Region,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The arrival of the first pair of Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning IIs at Eielson Air Force Base on Apr. 21, 2020, was significant on many levels. This remote installation is located 26 miles southeast of Fairbanks in the interior of Alaska and about 110 miles south of the Arctic Circle. The installation has received huge funding over the past three years to create a massive secure enclave for its new stealthy inhabitants. While the sheer amount of work that has been conducted at Eielson to bring the F-35 into the arsenal of the Pacific Air Forces is highly evident, the strategic impact on an increasingly important region that the rejuvenated fighter wing will have cannot be understated. The resident 354th Fighter Wing hasn’t been combat-coded since 2007 when its A-10 Thunderbolt IIs were redistributed to other units. Since then, Eielson has operated a squadron of aggressor F-16s , which provide support for the resident Red Flag Alaska exercise and for the F-22 Raptors based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, near Anchorage. Eielson also supports the 168th Air Refueling Group, part of the Alaska Air National Guard, which operates KC-135Rs in support of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) operations. Eielson will be home to the U.S. Air Force’s second operational active-duty F-35 wing, the first being the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. This emphasizes the strategic importance of Alaska. The 354th will be home to a pair of Lightning squadrons that will operate 54 of the Low observable (LO) stealth fighters by the time deliveries to the base are complete. This target was initially scheduled for December 2021, but is now set for early 2022. An 18th Aggressor Squadron F-16C leads a pair of F-35As over Eielson AFB. The aircraft nearest the camera is one of four on loan from Hill Air Force Base., USAF The Arctic assumes greater strategic importance The USAF unveiled its Arctic Strategy on July 21, 2020. It outlines the unique regional role and efforts to optimize air and space capabilities in this area. “The Arctic is among the most strategically significant regions of the world today — the keystone from which the U.S. Air and Space Forces exercise vigilance,” said Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett. “This Arctic Strategy recognizes the immense geostrategic consequence of the region and its critical role for protecting the homeland and projecting global power.” USAF USAF The strategy outlines four main focus efforts: vigilance in all domains, projecting power through a combat-credible force, cooperation with allies and partners, and preparation for Arctic operations . Combining the combat capability of 5th generation fighters in Alaska with the reach afforded by an organic force of tanker aircraft provides an impressive means to project air power. Eielson’s F-35s will be able to reach the Asia-Pacific or European theaters with relative ease. “While the often harsh weather and terrain there call for appropriate preparations and training, Airmen and Space Professionals remain ready to bring the nation’s Arctic air and space assets to bear to support the National Defense Strategy and protect the U.S. homeland,” said Barrett. Fighters based in Alaska have access to the vast Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex., USAF Bringing the F-35 to the Arctic Eielson was announced in April 2016 as the first operational USAF location outside the contiguous United States (CONUS) to receive the F-35A. It followed an exhaustive analysis of the base’s facilities, environmental factors, and cost. But pairing the F-35 and Eielson has been far from straightforward. The extreme winter weather conditions are the toughest yet faced by the USAF’s latest fighter. With the weather dropping below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, combined with snow and dark winter days, this is an extremely challenging operating environment. F-35s were first subjected to cold weather trials in the USAF’s McKinley Climatic Laboratory located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in late 2013. A focus on cold-weather testing was also directed at the Royal Norwegian Air Force, with its F-35s expected to regularly operate from snow-covered runways in plummeting winter temperatures. This gave rise to a unique drag chute modification for Norway’s F-35s. This is mounted in a removable pod between the aircraft’s vertical stabilizers. The USAF’s jets bound for Eielson don’t feature the same landing stability modification. An F-35A fitted with the Norwegian drag chute modification taxies at Eielson in 2017., Lockheed Martin Following initial trials of the drag chute at Edwards AFB in California, an F-35A with the chute attachment was dispatched to Eielson in late 2017 for runway suitability trials. The second period of extreme cold-weather testing was conducted at Eielson in February 2018 as part of the pre-Initial Operational Test and Evaluation work. “We’re here at Eielson to prove the capability of the aircraft to operate under extreme conditions of cold weather,” said Robert Behler, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The multi-flight evaluation in 2018 ran into problems when pilots received warnings that an important battery was failing in flight. It was discovered that the extreme cold affected the battery when the F-35’s nose wheel bay door was open, according to Defense News . This triggered a warning to pilots, which meant they had to land as soon as possible, according to standard operating procedures. The problem was solved in the immediate term via a workaround, with a full software fix following to correct the issue. Massive infrastructure changes at Eielson to support new F-35s In addition to ensuring the aircraft themselves were ready for the harsh northern environment, the base infrastructure at Eielson was also in need of major upgrades in order for it to be able to support the incoming fighters. The arrival of the F-35s required a major expansion in support facilities at the base, as well as housing to accommodate a huge influx of personnel. Significantly, the arriving aircraft are not recapitalizing other departing assets. Moreover, the stealthy F-35s require significant bespoke facilities to meet security and environmental requirements. Bringing the F-35 to Eielson required huge investment and a lot of new construction. USAF The Department of Defense asked Congress to fund seven major construction projects at Eielson in the fiscal year 2017. It was the start of a huge effort to support expected population growth of nearly 50 percent at the base as 1,250 active-duty personnel relocated here. By the end of 2021, the number of Airmen at Eielson is expected to rise to 3,250. The Alaska District of the U.S Army Corps of Engineers is the primary design and construction agency for the massive new facilities to accommodate the two new F-35 squadrons and the men and women that will support them. It is overseeing the reconstruction of 32 new buildings and the significant refurbishment of other structures that equates to more than 420,000 square feet of infrastructure, with an associated price tag of over $500 million. The new F-35 simulator building at Eielson AFB., USAF/SrA SrA Beaux Hebert The Senate’s 2017 spending bill included $563 million in military construction projects throughout Alaska. It received a larger share of the 2017 military construction budget than any other state. At the heart of the development work are two huge new F-35 weather shelters that include 16 bays, each of which can accommodate one aircraft. These shelters are planned to house all aircraft that are available for daily operations across the two squadrons. As well as providing a welcome refuge for the aircraft, the weather shelters are vital to providing maintainers with insulated and heated space to work in through the cold winter months.

A Senate subcommittee approved $298 million for Eielson construction work during the 2017 fiscal year. A firm-fixed-price contract was awarded to Watterson Construction in January 2018 to design and construct the first of the $58 million weather shelters for the 356th Fighter Squadron, with completion set for November 2019. Contracts also included the refurbishment of an existing 8-bay weather shelter, previously used by the resident 18th Aggressor Squadron, and the overhaul of Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) facilities. In addition, Coffman Engineers was contracted to upgrade an existing 4-bay hangar. The facility was previously used for general maintenance of F-16s and has been repurposed hazardous maintenance activities to support fuel cell maintenance for the F-35As. A further $169 million was appropriated in fiscal 2018, and $45 million in fiscal 2019. The House funding bill initially included money for only one weather shelter, however as can be seen in new satellite imagery The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, seen above, the second is nearing completion. This work is also being undertaken by Watterson Construction following a contract award on June 5, 2018. According to the contract notification, a weather shelter for “squadron 2” was scheduled to be completed by July 23, 2020. Operations begin Alaska will be the most concentrated state for combat-coded, 5th generation fighter aircraft. “When you station the F-35 at Eielson and you have the F-22 Raptor down at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, working together in the JPARC [Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex] with our 18th Aggressor Squadron and ground training assets, you have the perfect training field for the F-35 to develop,” said Colonel Benjamin Bishop, the former 354th Fighter Wing commander. The availability of the JPARC is one of the most important factors in exploiting the full potential of the assembled assets in Alaska. Recently expanded to 77,000 square miles of airspace, this massive restricted area provides a realistic training environment and allows commanders to train for full spectrum engagements, ranging from individual skills to complex, large-scale joint engagements. JPARC 2025 is an initiative designed to ensure the airspace is optimized for the arrival of the F-35s. “The JPARC will have more 5th generation fighter squadrons stationed locally than any other range,” said Lieutenant Colonel John Anderson, the 353rd Combat Training Squadron commander. “If we’re going to have an opportunity like that, we need to capitalize on it and prepare the training venue for those fifth-generation squadrons. Not just for the local squadrons, but also for temporarily-deployed units from sister services and international partners as well.” You can examine a full high-resolution copy of the entire satellite image of Eielson AFB that The War Zone obtained here .

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The arrival of the first two F-35s at Eielson on April 21 was closely followed by the start of local flying three days later. Four jets from the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill AFB were added on April 27 as a temporary measure to increase capacity at the 354th Fighter Wing for two months. By the end of June, six 354th-owned F-35s had arrived at the base and the jets were slated to continue arriving from Lockheed Martin at a rate of 2 to 3 aircraft per month. However, in the background, the build-up was being hampered by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The new face of tactical airpower in Alaska. , USAF According to a report by Defense News , the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), an organization charged with delivering new F-35s to customers, was drafted to deliver aircraft to Alaska. It removed the need for 354th FW pilots to step away from local operations and exposure to COVID-19 risks, according to Lt Col James Christensen, the 356th Fighter Squadron commander. The pandemic meant the DoD put a stop-movement order on personnel that ran until June 30, however sufficient maintainers were already in place at the 354th FW to support the buildup of F-35 operations over the summer. According to the Defense News report, pilots and maintainers going through the training system have been granted a blanket exception to transfer to Eielson. A 354th Fighter Wing F-35A prepares to taxi out for a mission in June 2020., USAF/TSgt Jerilyn Quintanilla Moreover, other potential COVID-19 concerns loom. Speaking at the Virtual Farnborough Air Show on July 22, Lockheed Martin’s Vice-President of F-35 production Darren Sekiguchi said the company expects supply chain issues to lead to production delays of approximately 2-3 months at the Fort Worth, Texas, assembly line. This could have an impact on 18 to 24 deliveries of the 141-target scheduled for this year. Sekiguchi said the company expects to return pre-COVID-19 production levels by the late summer/early fall. It’s unclear how and if this will impact deliveries to Eielson. The next big focus for the Eielson F-35s is Red Flag Alaska , which will kick-off in August . It will be an initial high-end warfighting test for the new F-35 wing as it ramps up flights from its big new flight operations center. While it won’t feature bitterly cold winter weather, it will provide an initial test for the capabilities of the 354th Fighter Wing as it seeks to stamp its mark on this increasingly critical region with its new F-35s.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Mar 17, 2022",Here Are The First Photos Of Egypt’s New Su-35 “Super Flankers”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first photos of factory-fresh Egyptian Air Force Sukhoi Su-35SE Flankers have been captured, apparently, as the first batch of jets was on a delivery flight to North Africa. The images of five different “Super Flankers” reveal that the aircraft are painted in the same camouflage scheme as Egypt’s new MiG-29M/M2 Fulcrums. The photographs were taken by Andrey Neyman on July 22, as five Su-35SE fighters arrived in Novosibirsk for a fuel stop. The location and routing suggest the fighters were on delivery to Egypt from the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant (KnAAZ) in the Russian Far East. The five different jets carry serials 9210, 9211, 9212, 9213, and 9214. In June, a report by Defence Blog claimed to show satellite images of Egyptian Su-35s at the manufacturing plant. Although the Su-35 has been tested with external drop tanks, Flankers rarely fly with them, even for long ferry flights. The flight from Komsomolsk-on-Amur to Novosibirsk is well over 2,000 miles, and even though the Flanker boasts an impressive unrefueled range on internal tanks, the aircraft probably required at least one fuel stop between the two locations. It’s also notable that the report from Novosibirsk did not mention transport or in-flight refueling support aircraft. The Su-35 was conceived as the ultimate variant of the big Russian fighter, sometimes referred to as the “Super Flanker.” It was initially planned for export, however, it is also now in service with the Russian Air Force. The Su-35 features thrust-vectoring engines and a brand-new mission suite, including a Tikhomirov NIIP N135 Irbis Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar and a ‘glass’ cockpit. In May, the Russian state news agency TASS reported that the production of the first five Su-35s for Egypt had begun at KnAAZ. Various other reports have stated that Egypt ordered “over 20” Su-35s, but the exact number varies between 24 and 31 of the new fighters. The deal has never been officially confirmed, but Russian arms company Rosoboronexport is understood to have signed a $2 billion contract that called for deliveries between 2020 and 2023. Egypt is the second export customer for the Su-35. China has already received 24 fighters from a firm order placed in 2015 and all 24 were delivered to the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) by the end of 2018. The Su-35 is the most recent in a series of high profile defense orders from Egypt. It has now received all 46 MiG-29M and two-seat MiG-29M2 multi-role fighters from an order that was placed with Russia in 2015. It also ordered 24 Dassault Rafales in a $6.8 billion deal with France. Having traditionally relied heavily on U.S and French arms manufacturers, Egypt’s latest acquisitions reflect a desire to diversify its arms suppliers and its influence abroad. Cairo appears to be carefully managing its ties with the U.S while leveraging Russia’s willingness to supply less costly arms in a more straightforward manner. In May, it was widely reported that Egypt is seeking a deal with Italy that could include 24 Eurofighter Typhoons, M-346 training aircraft, and frigates. This further underscores Egypt’s desire to step away from exclusive suppliers and to use military procurement as a means to strengthen its influence over key allies. This possible delivery of the first Egyptian Flankers is a major development in North Africa. Last November, U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper threatened sanctions if Egypt didn’t cancel the deal. There have also been repeated concerns over Egyptian human rights issues . However, in May, a large arms package was approved by Washington, that includes upgrades for Egypt’s AH-64 Apaches , suggesting a compromise may have been reached. Confirmation of the Egyptian Su-35 deal through these images underscores the big military expansion underway in this North African nation. With U.S F-16s, French Rafales, Russian MiG-29s and Su-35s, and maybe even European Typhoons, the modern Egyptian Air Force is clearly growing as a highly diverse force with considerable combat capabilities, at least in terms of hardware alone.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 17, 2020",This Portable Remote Weapon Turret Is Right Out Of Call Of Duty Or Contra,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remote weapon turrets, man do they suck to run into on the virtual battlefield. Whether trying to dominate a hijacked cruise ship in Call Of Duty multiplayer or doing your damnedest to beat Contra without the cheat code, they can be the great equalizer that shatters your quest for a perfect game. On real battlefields, remote weapon turrets, also referred to as remote weapon stations, have quickly become commonplace. Although they are usually mounted on vehicles to provide its occupants cover while surveilling and engaging enemies in their surroundings, other concepts have seen them pop-out of unassuming containers and even act as missile silo sentries . Now, via leveraging big advances in computerized weapon sights, they are becoming far more mobile and adaptable to pretty much any situation. Case in point: Smart Shooter’s Light Remote-Controlled Weapon Station (LRCWS). Israel’s Smart Shooter has blazed a trail for what we now call computerized rifle sights that literally provide “one-shot, one-hit” accuracy even for relatively untrained users. The firm’s SMASH 2000 system, which is capable of engaging static and moving targets, including drones in the air, has matured to the point that U.S. special operators are now packing them in Syria. You can read all about the historic deployment of this technology in this recent piece of ours . Now the company is combining its gunsight technology with a light-weight remote-controlled weapon station that can be rapidly packed-up and relocated. SMASH HOPPER., Smart Shooter A press release from Smart Shooter about their new ultra-portable smart weapon mount system reads: Measuring approximately 15 Kg, SMASH HOPPER can be integrated into an existing Command-and-Control system(C2), providing operators with the ability to hand-off or receive targets across existing communications networks. Featuring a safe trigger mechanism, a mounting solution, and a ruggedized Remote-Control Unit (RCU), SMASH HOPPER provides a pan–and–tilt capability for the weapon system and can be controlled via cable or wireless connectivity. Offering day and night capability with automatic scanning and target detection, SMASH HOPPER is ideal for multiple mission areas including force protection, border security, anti-drone, remote ambush, and offensive action operations at complex environments. It can be mounted utilizing a standalone deployable tripod, a stationary fixed mast or a lightweight vehicle. Smart Shooter What’s key here is the brains and optics for the system are evolved from the SMASH smart sight. As a result, the remote turret not only displaces the user away from the weapon itself, and does so in a highly mobile package, but it also incorporates the company’s extremely accurate targeting capabilities. It has a low-light mode so it can be used at night as well as day and with its auto-tracking capabilities combined with the freely traversable SMASH HOPPER base, it can auto-scan an area and perfectly track targets of interest. Because it leverages the company’s existing compact computerized sighting technology, there is no need for big, heavy optics and computer systems, which allow for a massive reduction in bulk. This all culminates in a capability that has only been accessible in the form of far larger and more complex remote weapon stations in the past, and in the case of the company’s super-precise computer-aided gunsight technology, not on any other remote weapon station. SMASH HOPPER can accommodate 5.56 NATO and 7.62 NATO individual weapons like M16/M4 and AR-10/SR-25 pattern rifles. While more limited in magazine depth and volume of fire than say a light machine gun, using an assault or battle rifle as a weapon is offset in low weight, commonality, and especially accuracy when combined with the company’s one-shot, one-hit capability. Apparently, a SMASH HOPPER Light is also in the works that will provide some similar capabilities, but in an even more compact and lightweight that is fully man-portable by a single individual. SMASH HOPPER Light., Smart Shooter The potential applications for either system are remarkable. These could be set up as sentries around the perimeter of a base, with multiple units being operators from a central control facility. They could surveil and defend critical chokepoints or the perimeters of forward operating bases or temporary camps. They could even be used to protect critical locales and VIPs during temporary periods of vulnerability. Being able to lower the barrier for mounting a remote weapon station on light vehicles and small boats is also highly intriguing. So there you have it, the mobile weapon turret you grew up on using or trying to take out during your video game heroics are now a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020","Navy Chief Says USS Bonhomme Richard Fire Damaged Most Decks, Gutted Island, Warped Flight Deck","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s top officer says that the fires that burned for four days on the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard last week left 11 of its 14 decks damaged and its island effectively gutted. Meanwhile, there has been a rash of other fire incidents aboard other U.S. Navy ships undergoing work in recent days. A shipyard in Virginia where Navy ships are repaired has resumed normal operations after halting work following a thankfully much less severe fire on Bonhomme Richard ‘s sister ship, USS Kearsarge. Another fire broke out on the future USS John F. Kennedy , a Ford class aircraft carrier under construction at a separate Virginia yard, two days ago. Defense News was first to report the new details about Bonhomme Richard ‘s condition on July 22, 2020. This information came from a letter that Admiral Michael Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, had sent other flag officers and senior non-commissioned officers. The fire onboard the amphibious assault ship, exacerbated by multiple explosions, first broke out on July 12. The Navy announced that all known fires on the ship had been extinguished on July 16. “There is fire and water damage, to varying degrees, on 11 of 14 decks,” Gilday, who visited Bonhomme Richard on July 17, wrote in the letter Defense News obtained. “With the flight deck as a reference, I walked sections of the ship 5 levels below and had the opportunity to examine the superstructure.” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday, wearing the helmet with the stars, tours the USS Bonhomme Richard on July 17., USN “The island is nearly gutted, as are sections of some of the decks below; some perhaps, nearly encompassing the 844 ft length and 106 ft beam of the ship (NAVSEA’s [Naval Sea System Command] detailed assessment is ongoing),” he continued. “Sections of the flight deck are warped/bulging.” Gilday’s comments align with images from inside the ship that emerged during and after the fire. The Navy had previously disclosed that the fire had spread to most of the ship as the blaze burned on, with some areas experiencing temperatures as high as 1,200 degrees. A thorough investigation into the incident is currently underway, but the Navy has said that the initial fire started in the ship’s lower vehicle storage area among a pile of various flammable materials. Bonhomme Richard was undergoing scheduled maintenance at the time of the accident. The Navy has yet to say whether or not it believes the ship is salvageable and a total loss could have significant ramifications for the service’s force structure and operational capacity in the near future, something that the War Zone touched on while the fire was still raging. It has also raised questions about the service’s ability to respond to severe battle damage onboard ships during a major conflict, as well as how quickly it could return those vessels to service afterward. However, it is worth pointing out that ships undergoing maintenance are actually often more vulnerable to serious accidents than those conducting operations at sea, something the War Zone recently explored in depth. After firefighters got the situation on the Bonhomme Richard under control last week, the Navy issued a message calling for a variety of readiness assessments from all of its ships and submarines, as well as ordering the crews of those ships to perform various safety inspections and exercises, including major firefighting drills. The fires onboard the USS Kearsarge and the future USS John F. Kennedy , which occurred on July 17 and July 20 , respectively, no doubt further underscored the desire for this fleet-wide wellness check of sorts. The incident aboard the Kearsarge , which is undergoing maintenance at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia, was minor. “The fire was quickly extinguished by the fire watch and resulted in minimal damage,” Colleen O’Rourke, a spokesperson for Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), told USNI News on July 20. Nevertheless, the Navy told the yard, which is also presently serving a number of the service’s other major surface ships, to halt work pending various safety reviews. General Dynamics NASSOC-Norfolk completed those requirements to resume regular operations today. The USS Kearsarge ., USN “To remove the stop-work order, General Dynamics NASSCO-Norfolk was required to validate proper housekeeping and cleanliness, removal of unnecessary clutter and ensure unrestricted access to firefighting and damage control equipment,” Rory O’Connor, another NAVSEA spokesperson, told USNI News on July 22. “Secondly, NASSCO employees and subcontractors supporting GD-NASSCO-Norfolk were required to complete fire and general safety training. Compliance with these actions is necessary to ensure established procedures and protocols are adhered to in order to prevent any unforeseen incidents or fires. Navy officials verified that these actions are complete, and as such, have lifted the stop-work order.” This update about the situation at the shipyard in Norfolk came just a day after the announcement of the fire on the future John F. Kennedy , which is in the latter stages of construction at Newport News Shipbuilding’s yard in the Virginia city of the same name. “Thankfully, no one was injured. Our shipbuilders and firefighters responded swiftly, and the fire was extinguished quickly,” Newport News Shipbuilding President Jennifer Boykin wrote in a post on Facebook. “Although the fire was put out quickly, we did experience heavy smoke and immediately evacuated the entire ship,” she continued. “The damage was contained to the compartment where the fire occurred, and we are investigating the cause.” All of this also comes amid persistent concerns about naval shipbuilding and maintenance capacity, in general, in the United States. Limited yard space available for repairs has had particularly cascading impacts on the availability of Navy ships in recent years, especially with regards to submarines . The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global economic downturn have only exacerbated the situation and added additional complexities to even routine work. “We will thoroughly look into and learn from the fire on Bonhomme Richard ,” Chief of Naval Operations Gilday wrote in his recent letter. “As we look hard into recent events – and revisit and assess what we’ve learned from previous incidents, I am relying on you to reinforce those aspects of our culture demonstrated on Bonhomme Richard and across the Navy right now. Focus on the positive attributes – that will overcome the negatives we want to avoid.” While it remains to be seen what the final fate of the Bonhomme Richard will be, hopefully, the lessons learned from the accident will help prevent similar disasters from occurring in the future. The full investigation should also help in determining whether the blaze on that ship, as well as the smaller fires on Kearsarge and the future John F. Kennedy , reflect any broader and more worrisome systemic issues that the service will need to address. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Mar 19, 2020",Fighter Pilots Warn Of Newly Trained Pilots’ Lack Of Actual Flying Experience,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A team of senior U.S. Air Force officers has met with airmen across a range of fighter wings to gain a better understanding of possible reasons behind a surge in mishaps in recent months. As official investigations into the accidents continue, experienced pilots are raising concerns over possible cuts in flying hours and increasing reliance on simulators that could lead to future mishaps, or even might have been a contributing cause of some of the recent ones. Last week, Gen Mike Holmes, the boss of Air Combat Command (ACC), visited several flying wings across the country to discuss training and safety. It’s part of an effort to establish if there are any common factors in the recent incidents. The USAF last saw a surge in crashes in fiscal year 2018, which prompted reviews across major commands and an operational pause to facilitate a safety review . The Air Force has lost five fighter aircraft in a spate of high-profile accidents, two of which claimed the lives of their pilots. You can read the War Zone’s account of the recent incidents here . “The recent incidents involve multiple aircraft types from multiple commands,” Air Force spokesperson Leah Garton told Military.com ahead of Holmes’ tour. “ACC has also distributed updated guidance and safety information to all of our flying units.” Experienced instructors are emphasizing the importance of live flying., Jamie Hunter As ACC sent that new information to its flying squadrons, some experienced pilots spoke out regarding their concerns over initiatives that are aimed at expediting pilot training. While the exact cause of the recent crashes requires a full and thorough investigation, pilots have emphasized the importance of live flying and building airmanship in young fighter pilots. One USAF pilot told the War Zone that the increased use of simulators must not be at the expense of time spent in a real cockpit. A widely held concern in the fighter pilot community is that new aviators are arriving at front line fighter squadrons with a lower initial experience level than their predecessors: “Students receive less total flight experience in their initial flight screening, in UPT [Undergraduate Pilot Training], and IFF [introduction to fighter fundamentals], with increased emphasis on virtual training and efficiency on the horizon,” one USAF fighter pilot recently told the War Zone . “While FTUs [Formal Training Units] and undergraduate training programs can get student pilots up to par for a few flights in each phase [enough for them to progress along the timeline], the lack of experience is beginning to show in basic flight discipline.” A student and instructor walk to their T-6 Texan II training aircraft at Vance AFB, Oklahoma., USAF/Airman Zoe T. Perkins The pilot says the evidence is not anecdotal, adding that in feedback sessions from the operational squadrons to the FTUs, there has been a clear message: basic airmanship is lacking in the pilots that show up to their units. “While a student may reach the level of expertise to graduate a fighter basic course, they can still find themselves in situations where experience would be of great value.” The fighter pilot crisis As far back as 2017, the USAF said it was 1,500 pilots short, and it expected the situation to get worse as airlines hired aggressively and as personnel grew increasingly demoralized due to relentless deployment cycles and time away from home, among other lifestyle and professional factors. During his time as the head of the USAF, General David Goldfein has spearheaded efforts to radically improve the situation for pilots within USAF squadrons, tackling the issues of aircraft availability and removing time-consuming trivial tasks. The War Zone reported in 2016 how a range of variables have contributed to the pilot shortfall. The USAF set up an Aircrew Crisis Task Force in August 2017 as part of its efforts to address the problem of personnel retention. It also looked at new ways that could expedite training to help build capacity. At the time, General Goldfein said that it took a decade and between $6-10 million on average to train a fighter pilot. In 2018, he added that the USAF needed to grow the pilot training pipeline from 1,200 slots to 1,400 annually . Capt Ray Stone, a Pilot Training Next instructor pilot, helps a student strap into a T-6 Texan II., USAF/Sean M. Worrell The shortage in trained aircrews to fill cockpits was further compounded by USAF leadership calls in 2018 for unprecedented levels of growth, with an aspiration of 74 squadrons in overall strength by 2030. Dubbed “The Air Force We Need,” this was designed to match overall force mass with the range and scale of missions the service is asked to fulfill. Ironically, a worsening personnel situation and tightening budgets led to Gen Goldfein later acknowledging: “there’s a difference between the Air Force we need and the Air Force that we can afford .” The USAF’s fighter pilot crisis piled pressure on Air Education and Training Command, or AETC, to make the training pipeline more efficient, both in terms of cost and productivity, in an unprecedented bid to get young aviators to frontline squadrons faster. The organization has been looking to exploit advanced learning techniques, combined with simulators, in an effort to maximize production and graduate students faster, with less training time and fewer weeks in the process. Despite the push to bring more technology into the process, experienced USAF pilots began stressing the importance of strapping into a jet and going flying. Every single sortie generates new experiences and lessons that cannot be replicated even inside the most advanced full-motion dome simulator. There is no way to accurately replicate the stress of life-threatening situations, unprecedented combinations of events, G-forces, or the pumping adrenaline that are part and parcel of live flying. Students participate in virtual-reality training at the Pilot Training Next facility at the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Austin, Texas., USAF/Dan Hawkins The Pilot Training Next (PTN) initiative was launched as part of an AETC effort to “reimagine” ways to teach new airmen. It looked at methods for better, faster, and deeper learning. It also sought to embrace new technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, which could be tailored to the training environment and each student. PTN reflected a clear need for change. The USAF pilot training model had remained largely untouched for decades and was in need of a major overhaul. However, pilots fear flight hour reductions may be executed while replacement virtual training remains in experimental phases. USAF fast jet training still relies on the 1950s-era T-38 Talon., USAF/SrA Moshe Paul A new hope For air arms around the world, the massive economic downturn of 2020 triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has seen many ex-military commercial pilots hanging up their white short-sleeved dress shirts and black trousers and pulling out their green or tan flying suits to swing back into military life. Earlier this year the service acknowledged it had made little progress in addressing pilot shortfalls , so for the USAF, specifically, it could offer something of a reprieve. While some experienced personnel returning to the Air Force’s flying squadrons may represent a partial relief, but the flow in of new pilots at the bottom end is no less critical. Recruiting the right caliber of young people and efficiently training them is vital to getting highly-skilled young aviators out to the front line and yielding maximum return on the investment in their tuition and fortifies the force’s future. In a bid to carefully build efficiency into the training system and embrace the advanced training attributes of new aircraft such as the Boeing T-7A Red Hawk , a further new strategy is now being evaluated. Air Combat Command’s (ACC’s) “ Rebuilding the Forge ,” or Reforge, is a concept of operations (CONOP) that could dramatically change the way fighter pilots are trained. An instructor provides a watchful eye over his student as he pre-flights a T-6 Texan II., USAF/Airman Zoe T. Perkins It is hoped that Reforge will generate a better product in less time. The initiative would deliberately train fighter aviators to a mission-ready, flight lead status at a pace and manner that could shave up to 18-months off the overall training cycle. It would dramatically overhaul the existing training pipeline with a shift away from using segregated and disjointed programs that each teach differing core skills. Reforge also aims to blend basic tactical and leadership skills into a new integrated program. The concept is centered upon a 12-month initial tactical training (ITT) syllabus that proposes to use an advanced training aircraft such as the T-7A to develop new aviators and impart vital tactical skills and experience before they transition into the Combat Air Forces (CAF) via a short course at an FTU. You can read more about this radical change and its many potential impacts in this recent War Zone piece. T-7A Red Hawk., Boeing The need for change ​​​​ While recognizing the critical importance of live flying, introducing young aviators to synthetic training is similarly valuable. It doesn’t just have to be in a mock-up cockpit in a simulator building. Through embedded synthetic training, instructors can present an array of emulated threats and scenarios for young students to experience in a realistic fashion, in their aircraft, in the air. Looking further ahead into training on the front line, certain real-world flights cannot embody the kind of learning afforded in some high-end simulation. As an example, the USAF recently connected an F-35, F-22, F-16, and E-3 Sentry in a highly contested simulated environment during Distributed Mission Training (DMT) final acceptance test at Nellis AFB, Nevada. This training event was the first time these platforms were connected virtually. Bringing these assets together in the real-world is reserved for well-planned large scale exercises , but the synthetic world affords regular events like this. “The initial delivery at Nellis AFB is a major step forward as it establishes the framework for F-35 simulators around the world to interconnect,” according to a Lockheed Martin media release. DMT links pilots at bases through an existing distributed network, enabling simulated training events between disparate aircraft types. “This base capability lays the foundation for pilots to truly train as they fight by enabling advanced tactics training through multi-domain operations in a simulated environment,” said Chauncey McIntosh, Lockheed Martin, vice president of F-35 Training and Logistics. While modern 5th generation fighters have become easier for a pilot to fly, the tactical know-how and demands for pilots to absorb more roles and more tasks have spiraled. Also, some critical tactics and weaponry cannot be simulated in real-life mock air combat, so a synthetic environment isn’t just ideal, it’s necessary. As such, regular exposure to training events such as those in DMT will enable pilots to better experience the breadth of training required to stay current in all functions that a modern fighter aircraft offers. Maintaining a high standard There’s no telling what led to the crashes that tragically claimed the lives of two young pilots in June. We will need to await the formal reports from the safety investigation boards. But, in light of these accidents, fighter pilots have been keen to emphasize that while technology must be allowed to advance, it must not impact the ability for pilots to gain vital experience actually flying the planes they are assigned to potentially go to war in. An F-22A Raptor on a combat mission for Operation Inherent Resolve., Jamie Hunter “As far as I can tell, standards concerning student expectations or the level of proficiency we require of them have remained the same,” one pilot concluded. “However, issues arise when instructor pilots demand the same level of competence out of students who show up with less total experience in flight.” They further argued that cutting flight training earlier in a student’s career is a critical factor. “In later phases of training, they simply don’t have access to the same ratio of instructors. From initial flight training through the Basic Course at the FTU, there is an instructor pilot present for every single sortie. They can help students identify and recognize scenarios that could develop dangerously. This builds a student’s experience level, hopefully to the point that later in their flying training [post Mission Qualification Training, MQT] at their front line squadron when they no longer have the safety blanket of a watchful instructor, that they will be able to recognize a dangerous situation on their own.” Experienced instructors want to ensure that young aviators arriving for their first operational assignments are equipped with all the necessary tools to be both lethal and safe. The Reforge initiative has the potential to help them do just that. It is a unique and ambitious opportunity to bring many factors together to suit both the needs of the USAF and those who engage in aerial warfighting in its aircraft each and every day. At the same time, it seems that those on front lines are adamant that it should do this while also preserving or even increasing actual time spent in the cockpit during what are the most formulative years of a fighter pilot’s career.

Raytheon has received a contract from the U.S. Air Force to build a “flight-test ready” mini-missile that an aircraft could use to shoot down incoming air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles. This effort is one of a number of aircraft self-defense weapon concepts that the U.S. military as a whole has been exploring in recent years as potential opponents, especially Russia and China , continue to develop and field new and more advanced missiles of their own The Pentagon announced the deal in its daily contracting notice on July 21, 2020. The first task order under the contract is worth just over $93 million, but it could eventually net Raytheon up to $375 million, in total. The announcement says that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is managing the project, expects the work to be completed by October 2023. The full announcement is as follows: “Raytheon Co. Missile Systems, Tucson, Arizona, has been awarded a $375,000,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for a miniature self-defense missile.  The contract provides for the research and development of a flight-test ready missile.  The first task order is $93,380,234.  Work will be performed in Tucson, Arizona, and is expected to be completed by October 2023.  This award is the result of a competitive acquisition and two offers were received.  Fiscal 2020 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $26,712,000 are being obligated at the time of award.  Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, is the contracting activity (FA8651-20-D-0001).” Though described here as “a miniature self-defense missile,” by every indication, this is the latest development in AFRL’s Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM) program. This project first emerged publicly around 2015, at which time the goal was to have finished risk-reduction efforts by the end of the 2020 Fiscal Year and then move on to testing sub-systems for the mini-missile in the 2021 Fiscal Year. The schedule for the MSDM program, among others, as of 2015., USAF In 2016, Raytheon had secured a $14 million contract for various missile work, including on MSDM. Lockheed Martin had also received a contract to work on the MSDM program. It seems that this was the company that had submitted the second offer that AFRL said it passed over in favor of Raytheon’s proposal for this new deal. Lockheed Martin had previously developed a ground-launched weapon to knock down incoming artillery rounds and small drones for the U.S. Army, known as the Miniature Hit-to-Kill (MHTK) interceptor, which you can read about more in this past War Zone story , a modified version of which would seem to fit well with the MSDM’s known requirements. A full-size model of Lockheed Martin’s Miniature Hit-to-Kill (MHTK) interceptor., Joseph Trevithick In 2017, Northrop Grumman also patented the design of an anti-missile interceptor system for aircraft that also seems similar to what AFRL has described it is looking for in an MSDM in the past. Boeing had also been reportedly involved in earlier stages of the program. Drawings from Northrop Grumman’s 2017 patent for anti-missile defense system for aircraft., USPTO To date, AFRL has revealed relatively limited details about the MSDM program, its objectives, and its progress. It has described the notional weapon in the past as being an “extremely-agile, highly-responsive” missile that is also very small so as to have a “minimal impact to platform payload capacity.” The plan was also for it to be a hard-kill design, meaning that it would not have a traditional explosive warhead and would instead destroy its target by physically slamming into it. A broad overview of the MSDM program as of 2015., USAF AFRL has said in the past that the desired length of the notional missile was around one meter, or just under 3.3 feet. This would make it roughly a third as long as the AIM-9X Sidewinder dogfighting missile and even shorter than the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). It’s unclear if that is still the length requirement for the MSDM. If it is, this would be mean AFRL is looking for a weapon about half the size of Raytheon’s own self-funded Peregrine compact air-to-air missile, a design the company revealed last year and has said is around six feet long. You can read more about Peregrine in this past War Zone piece . An artist’s conception of the Peregrine missile., Raytheon AFRL has also said that a “very low-cost passive seeker” will be a key component of the MSDM. Associated renderings it has released in the past suggest this could be some form of imaging infrared seeker , which would give the missile a means of finding its target that is immune to electronic warfare jamming. A graphic from 2019 describing “tech enablers” for various AFRL projects, including the MSDM’s seeker., USAF It’s unclear if this would be the MSDM’s only guidance option or whether it might include others, such as an active radar seeker . Multi-mode seekers, combined with two-way datalinks, have become increasingly popular on air-to-air , as well as air-to-ground munitions , as a means of defeating various countermeasures. However, an incoming missile is unlikely to have the same kind of self-protection features as an enemy aircraft. No matter what the exact guidance configuration might be, low-cost seekers could help keep the MSDM’s overall unit cost down, which will be critical to making the system cost-effective given that an aircraft will likely carry a significant number of these interceptors and could need to fire more than one at a single threat to ensure that it is destroyed. It can already cost thousands of dollars for a plane to launch decoy flares and radar-confusing chaff cartridges , as well as expendable decoys. This has also been an issue with regards to ground-based missile defense systems, as well as those specifically intended to shoot down artillery shells and rockets, mortar rounds, and similar lower-tier threats, a mission set commonly referred to as Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM). The Tamir interceptor that Israel’s Iron Dome C-RAM system uses is a good example of a lower-cost weapon, but its reported unit price is, at its very lowest, still around $40,000 . Other reports have said each one costs between $100,000 and $150,000 . AFRL has already said that it sees the MSDM as just one element of a new slate of layered hard-kill self-protection options. This could also include a larger weapon it is developing under the Small Advanced Capabilities Missile (SACM) program, as well as directed-energy weapons, such as the one it is working on as part of the Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) effort. The Air Force recently announced a delay in the testing schedule for SHiELD. An artist’s conception of a stealthy aircraft using a laser to shoot down an incoming threat., Lockheed Martin The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have also been exploring similar hard-kill anti-missile defenses for both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in recent years and could leverage the Air Force’s work in the future, as well. There’s also the aforementioned hard-kill interceptor system that Northrop Grumman patented in 2017, indicating that there is growing interest, in general, among defense contractors in similar concepts, too. Other self-protection systems , including advanced electronic warfare systems , including expandable options , as well as further support from offboard platforms will also be part of this overall defensive ecosystem. Improved networking capabilities will further help link all this together , making it easier to spot threats and do so faster. A mix of MSDMs and these other systems could be increasingly invaluable for stealth aircraft, including future unmanned combat air vehicles, which may find themselves operating in dense hostile air defense environments with limited outside support. MSDM “enables penetration into contested A2AD [anti-access/area denial] environment,” AFRL said of MSDM in 2015. Similar concerns are driving the Air Force’s development of a dedicated Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) that its stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighter will be able to carry internally and that will give them another option for dealing with pop-up threats in heavily defended areas. SiAW is a derivative of the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), which the Navy is leading the development of and that will also be a multi-purpose weapon beyond its primary mission of destroying enemy air defense radars. Of course, the MSDM would be just as applicable to any other aircraft capable of carrying it, including bombers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms . It could be especially valuable for protecting vulnerable non-stealthy support platforms , such as aerial refueling tankers and airlifters . If the final design is cheap enough, it could be a useful countermeasure against short-range, man-portable surface-to-air missiles or even rocket-propelled grenades , which pose a very real threat to low and slow-flying aircraft and helicopters, especially when taking off or landing. Still frames from the test of a hard-kill defense system that Israel’s Rafael developed to protect helicopters from rocket-propelled grenades., Rafael It’s unclear whether AFRL expects to receive the first MSDM flight-test ready prototype before its new contract with Raytheon wraps up in 2023 or when any actual flight testing will start. What we do know is that there is work going on now to move what could be an important self-defense option for U.S. military aircraft in the future out of the laboratory and into a more practical realm.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 13, 2021","Navy Eyes ‘Hard-Kill’ Defenses For Transport, Tanker, and Possibly Unmanned Escort Planes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking into whether it might be feasible to install a so-called “hard-kill” self-defense system to physically shoot down incoming missiles that could go onto various transport, tanker, and other combat support aircraft, or equip an entirely new unmanned escort platform . The contracting notice comes as the U.S. military as a whole is becoming increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of these assets in any future high-end conflict , especially as potential opponents, such as Russia and China , continue to develop and field more capable air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles , as well as associated sensors . On May 3, 2018, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced it was interested in what it calls the Hard Kill Self Protection Countermeasure System (HKSPCS) in a request for information it issued on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps. At present, the Navy has no formal plans to purchase any such equipment and the notice only provides basic parameters, asking interested contractors to submit proposals that would meet those requirements. The notice says that the HKSPCS could serve as an “alternative and/or adjunct to more conventional electronic self-protection solutions.” The rudimentary requirements do not specify the exact means of interception, but the most likely concept would be a salvo of some form of miniature, highly maneuverable interceptor missile. Northrop Grumman patented a system matching that basic description in 2017 and we did a large feature on it and its potential applications. Some of the associated artwork from Northrop Grumman’s patent for a hard-kill self-defense system for aircraft., USPTO Since modern air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles use proximity fuzes and fragmentation warheads to shoot down aircraft, other systems that employ an explosive charge or burst of shrapnel, similar to the active protection systems on ground vehicles, would be largely ineffective for aerial use. On top of that, the debris from those close-in detonations near the host platform could easily damage sensitive equipment or clog air and engine intakes, or worse, with potentially disastrous results . However, the same launcher could eventually fire various other types of munitions as well, just as existing countermeasures dispensers can already release both flares and chaff. Active electronic warfare expendable decoys, such as Leornado’s BriteCloud , are already steadily gaining popularity around the world. NAVAIR says it wants the HKSPCS concepts that will be able to have enough shots to successfully defeat at least four to 10 incoming missiles. The systems could either be internal to the aircraft or an external pod that will work with any standard BRU-32 bomb rack. The Navy wants an internal system to weigh 2,300 pounds or less, while the podded arrangement could be anywhere from 850 to nearly 2,890 pounds. The external type would need to be less than 210 inches long and have a maximum diameter of just over 31 inches. The request for information specially says the platforms that NAVAIR is interested in installing the added defenses on include derivatives of Lockheed Martin C-130 family , the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 , and Boeing’s 707 , 737 , 757 , and 767 . This would effectively encompass almost all of the U.S. military’s large, airliner-sized combat support aircraft, not simply those in Navy service. The Air Force, for example, is the only operator of a DC-10-based platform, the KC-10 tanker . One of the U.S. Navy’s E-6B airborne command post aircraft. This aircraft is a derivative of the Boeing 707, one of the aircraft NAVAIR mentioned in its HKSPCS request for informatino., DOD This broad requirement would also include a slew of other aircraft, such as, but not limited to KC-135 tankers , RC-135 spy planes , E-6B airborne command and posts , C-32 and C-40 personnel transports, P-8 maritime patrol aircraft , and any of the myriad variants of the C-130 in use across the services. By naming the 767, the Navy also appears to be considering a system that would work with the Air Force’s forthcoming KC-46A tanker , as well as any future combat support aircraft that might emerge based on that design . A common, U.S. military-wide system would help reduce training and logistics requirements and allow for larger, block buys that could help push down the unit costs. The U.S. Navy is already familiar with this model when it comes to aircraft self-protection systems, having acted as the lead service when it had come to the development and procurement of directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) systems in use across the services. The video below shows a directional infrared countermeasure system deflecting a missile during a test. Those are soft-kill active defense systems that use a laser to confuse and disrupt the seekers on infrared missiles. Many of the aircraft NAVAIR mentions in its contracting notice question already have DIRCM defenses. A large number of American allies and partners use military aircraft based on these same platforms, which could open up the possibility for foreign participation in development or procurement. This, in turn, could help drive down costs even further. A DIRCM system underneath a US Air Force KC-135 tanker., USAF More interestingly, though, NAVAIR specifically mentions the possibility of adding this system to future unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) that would act as escorts for the U.S. military’s combat support aircraft. The Air Force has been particularly active publicly in this space, advancing the concept of a pilotless “ loyal wingman ” that can coordinate semi-autonomous operations with aircraft. The U.S. Marines Corps has conducted similar experiments , as well. The main focus of those efforts has been teaming the drones with combat jets rather than with larger combat support platforms. But providing an aerial perimeter defense against those platforms would make a lot of sense. America’s potential opponents have long been growing more aware that they might be able to significantly hamper U.S. military operations by focusing kinetic and non-kinetic attacks on the tankers , command and control, and other aircraft supporting an increasingly large fleet of low-observable aircraft. Using unmanned aircraft in this role would free up manned platforms, or more advanced UCAVs, from having to provide this localized defense, as well. Additional artwork from Northrop Grumman’s 2017 patent showing how it might install its hard-kill defense system on a stealthy UCAV., USPTO Of course, the Navy’s HKSPCS concept is hardly the first time the U.S. military and private contractors have investigated adding self-protection systems using small, kinetic interceptors to aircraft. In 2015, Lockheed Martin revealed it was working on a similar defensive suite for the Air Force as part of that service’s Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM) program. The next year, Raytheon received a $14 million contract for various missile development, including additional work on the MSDM system. It’s unclear whether or not this system is still in development. The Air Force has publicly shifted attention to a laser-based hard-kill system called the Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator ( SHiELD ). This program has focused mainly on getting that system onto fighter jet-sized aircraft, but the service has since said it is looking into adding it to larger aircraft, such as tankers , as well. A briefing slide showing the Air Force’s plans for aircraft laser weapons as of 2013., USAF And, as already noted, Northrop Grumman’s patent shows almost exactly the kind of system NAVAIR seems to be describing. The associated imagery showed the system on what appeared to be a stealthy UCAV, but the description said it could be suitable for any type of aircraft, including helicopters. The Navy itself is working on a separate hard-kill active protection system to defend rotary-wing aircraft from rocket-propelled grenades. This program, called the Helicopter Active RPG Protection (HARP), is the only hard-kill self-protection system for aircraft that the Navy included in research and development portion of its budget request for the 2019 fiscal year. In 2012 , Israeli firm Rafael demonstrated a prototype of an air-launched interceptor that could shoot down RPGs. A hard-kill system for larger aircraft might also be able to tackle these less advanced threats and would definitely be an added boon in guarding against the increasing danger of short-range, man-portable surface to air missiles. These shoulder-fired systems continue to proliferate around the world and terrorist and insurgents continue to make good use of them to bring down low- and slow-flying aircraft and drones . A series of still captures from a video showing Rafael’s prototype anti-RPG hard-kill defense system for helicopters in action. The interceptor is the object to the left., Rafael The biggest limitation of all of these hard-kill systems using physical interceptors is their magazine depth, which effectively turns them into dead weight when they run out of ammunition. Laser-based systems could offer significantly more total engagements, but each projector can only shoot at a single target at a time and needs to keep its beam on the target for an extended period of time. Clouds, smoke, and other obscurants can easily impact the range and power of the beam and only one of the turreted lasers can’t provide full 360 coverage around an aircraft by itself. NAVAIR’s HKSPCS may indicate the Navy, as well as other services, are looking for additional alternatives as a hedge against one type of weapon, such as a laser, being able to offer total protective suite by itself. A hard kill system would also likely work best as part of a layered defensive approach “adjunct” to existing and other future defensive suites, rather than a straight alternative to them, providing a last line of defense against an incoming missile. Concept art from Northrop Grumman showing a notional sixth-generation fighter jet shooting down an incoming missile with a laser., Northrop Grumman As noted, the final launcher design might be able to fire decoys or other types of projectiles to expand its capabilities, too. The various systems might be able to share a common set of sensors to detect and target incoming threats, as well. Combining the hard-kill system and other defenses with a picket of unmanned platforms might be able to mitigate these limitations. An individual UCAV might only need to carry one or two types of protective systems, reducing its overall size and cost. It could then work in concert with other drones in a small group to provide the most effective anti-missile bubble possible around one or more manned aircraft. Whatever the Navy ultimately envisions for its hard-kill self-defense arrangement working, the aircraft the service is interested in protecting are increasingly vulnerable now to potential adversaries such as Russia and China, which have made significant investments in advanced aircraft and improved, networked air defenses . While HKSPCS might not offer a complete defense for larger transport and combat support platforms by itself, it would definitely be an important part of a multi-part defensive suite for those vital aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick and Jamie Hunter,"Posted on May 10, 2021",F-15 Eagle Seen Loaded With Loyal Wingman Drone For Previously Unknown Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has been quietly experimenting with air-launching Kratos Defense and Security Solutions’ UTAP-22 Mako low-cost loyal wingman drone . The revelation came to us via images showing an F-15C from the Oregon Air National Guard’s 142nd Fighter Wing with a highly modified UTAP-22 hanging off its left-wing. The images were taken in one of the Arizona Air National Guard’s 162nd Wing’s hangars—the unit is located at Tucson Air National Guard Base adjacent to Tucson International Airport. The wing’s primary role is training foreign F-16 pilots, but it also hosts the Air National Guard-Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC). The AATC works as the Air National Guard’s development and testing arm for unique capabilities. The F-15C with a jet-powered drone attached to its left underwing pylon was photographed last winter by @tucson.plane.spotter on Instagram. The aircraft’s intake coverings feature the 57th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron’s insignia. The unit is assigned to the 57th Maintenance Group, part of the 57th Wing, which is very unique as it supports the huge range of aircraft that are hosted at Nellis Air Force Base where it calls home. This includes various tests of developmental systems and subsystems aboard the vast majority of the Air Force’s combat aircraft fleet. It turns out that the F-15C in question was borrowed from the 142nd Fighter Wing for trials related to the UTAP-22 drone that could last to around a year. @tucson.plane.spotter @tucson.plane.spotter Kratos describes the UTAP-22 as an “unmanned aircraft capable of collaborative operations with manned assets in contested environments,” a role also commonly referred to as “ loyal wingman .” This means that the drone is primarily intended to operate at least semi-autonomously based on instructions from another aircraft with an actual pilot in it. Beyond their primary loyal wingman mission, the company has also demonstrated the ability for multiple Makos to work together cooperatively on their own and they could operate independently, as well. A BQM-167 target drone., USAF The California-headquartered drone maker self-funded the development of the UTAP-22, which is derived from the BQM-167 Skeeter , as part of a $50 million initiative to develop a low-cost tactical unmanned aircraft. In 2012, Kratos had bought Composite Engineering, Inc. (CEI), which designed the BQM-167. The Skeeter, which is presently in service with the U.S. Air Force, is an expendable target drone that offers fighter pilots something to actually shoot at during live-fire training. Outwardly and in terms of general performance, the UTAP-22 is very similar to the BQM-167. Both can fly to altitudes of up to 50,000 feet, have a top speed just under Mach 1, can pull up to 9Gs, can carry substantial external stores, are highly reconfigurable, and can stay aloft for around three hours, which translates to a maximum range of around 1,500 miles, in total. The UTAP-22s, which have a reported price of between $2 and $3 million , can carry up 350 pounds of stores or other payloads inside 8.5 cubic feet of readily reconfigurable internal bays, as well as an additional 500 pounds of stores externally on underwing pylons and wingtip pods. Possible payloads could include munitions, as well as other systems, such as electronic warfare jammers or various kinds of sensors to carry out intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. UTAP-22 can be ground-launched using a rocket booster from basically anywhere. , Kratos Kratos originally designed the Mako to take off from a static launcher on the ground using a rocket booster, as is the case with the BQM-167. After conducting its mission, the drone deploys a parachute and descends to the ground or the surface of a body of water where personnel can then recover it for refurbishment and reuse. It’s not clear whether the drone is now capable of routine air-launched use, if so, what platforms beyond the F-15 may be capable of deploying it this way. In 2015, Kratos announced that the UTAP-22 had flown for the first time . In November of that year, the company conducted a second set of flight tests at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake (NAWS China Lake) that included f the drones flying ‘tethered’ via data-link to a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet, supporting the Harrier’s mission in a semi-autonomous fashion. Multiple Makos have also flown together during other tests. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lcP66syzQls During the collaborative tests in 2015, the AV-8B carried a Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) data link to communicate with and issue commands to the unmanned aircraft. TTNT is already found on the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growlers and will be a feature on that service’s Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . The Air Force has also acquired at least one UTAP-22, though, curiously, the one seen in the picture attached to the F-15C at Tucson Air National Guard Base carries Navy markings. In 2018, the news came that Mako had been cleared for sale to a number of allies overseas, although details about those potential deals remain shrouded in secrecy. Still, it is the first known loyal wingman drone to reach such a milestone. UTAP-22 after safely landing using its parachute. , Kratos video screencap The Mako was also a stepping stone to Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie , previously known as the XQ-222, a purpose-built low-cost unmanned aircraft also intended to perform as a loyal wingman-type drone, as part of a networked autonomous swarm, or by itself in various roles, including as a communications and networking relay node . XQ-58A is a clean-sheet design and is roughly three times the mass, has stealthy features, and is more advanced overall than the UTAP-22. The particular UTAP-22 configuration seen under the Eagle’s wings is unlike anyone we have seen before. The pods on the tips of the wings are new, although not new to the baseline BQM-167 design, which can accept a wide array of modular wingtip pods. It isn’t clear what they are housing, but the covers on the end apertures look very similar to the design of missile approach warning systems (MAWS) sensors that are used to provide threat awareness and countermeasure cueing on combat aircraft. Their placement would provide seamless coverage around the horizontal plane around the aircraft. If there are additional sensors pointing up and down on the fuselage, the coverage would be spherical all around the aircraft. The biggest unknown in the drone’s configuration is what the large faired golden ball-like protrusion on top of the forward fuselage is meant to do. @tucson.plane.spotter @tucson.plane.spotter @tucson.plane.spotter It is possible that this is a rotating infrared search and track system (IRST) that can scan the skies ahead of the drone, and far ahead of the Eagle in the loyal wingman role, for potential threats, including those with very small radar cross-sections. It could also be a shorter-wave infrared sensor used to provide navigation and general forward situational awareness for man-in-the-loop control or even totally autonomous operations. UAE’s Block 60 F-16E/F Desert Falcons have a similar system installed on their noses, although the concept dates back to the 1980s in the guise of Falcon Eyes infrared sensor. You can read all about the UAE’s system and Falcon Eyes in this piece of ours . Generally speaking, imaging infrared sensor systems can have gold-colored opaque glass enclosures that they peer through. The AGM-65D/G Maverick or the LANTIRN system’s navigation pod are good examples of this. On the other hand, the enclosure could be a solid metallic golden finish, with the sensor swiveled inward at the time the photos were taken. An AGM-65G Maverick missile with its imaging infrared seeker. , USAF With perfect spherical infrared coverage via the distributed infrared sensors and a much more capable primary infrared sensor mounted on the nose, one could potentially fly it with somewhat unprecedented situational awareness for a high-performance unmanned aircraft. It could also provide an enhanced sense and avoid capability that would allow it to autonomously operate with other aircraft in dense airspace with a high margin for safety and without relying on a data-link alone for comparative positioning information. Maybe having a robust and passive ability to safely navigate alongside the manned aircraft that it supports was the idea behind this UTAP-22 test. Another possibility is that the ball on the nose is some sort of electronic warfare device and the pods also support the electronic warfare mission, but that would be a unique emitter configuration, to say the least. These are just a couple of the many possibilities. We really don’t know what the UTAP-22 is configured to accomplished beyond its primary capability set as a loyal wingman platform and the ability to be networked with other UTAP-22s. What we do know is that whatever is going on with these trials, the ability to carry and launch the UTAP-22 from under an Eagle’s wing is central to them. The Eagle would be the obvious fighter for this mission. It has the ability to lug outsized payloads into the air like no other fighter in the U.S. inventory. This has played a huge factor in the Air Force pursuing the F-15EX , something we posited in detail when we broke the story two years ago. UTAP-22 Mako., Kratos There are a number of manned-unmanned teaming and attritable (optionally expendable) unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) initiatives currently underway across the DoD’s portfolio, with the Skyborg and XQ-58 Valkyrie programs —the latter, as already noted, is also a Kratos product—being the most well known. Could this system be a precursor to those endeavors or something altogether different? Drones that can dogfight and even potentially beat a human in that highly dynamic air-to-air arena has been a major talking point and objective of the Air Force’s recent unmanned experiment push. A major initiative to do just this is underway , with a pilot set to face off against a drone in just one year’s time. The UTAP-22 would be far better suited for this experimental role due to its performance capabilities than some of the alternatives, such as the XQ-58, and it is available now, easily reconfigurable, and affordable. Could this be our first glimpse of a dogfighting drone? The aircraft’s configuration would make sense for this, but unfortunately at this time, we just don’t know. We reached out to Kratos for more information, but we have no received a reply. The Air Force has been a different story. The public affairs office at Nellis is actively working to get us some information, but as of publishing, they say it will take an unknown amount of time to get us some information due to the number of players involved in whatever this program.

The U.S. Air Force’s 44th Fighter Squadron, the “Vampires,” is currently deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve . Since arriving in theater, the squadron’s maintainers have applied bold and remarkably large nose art to a number of the jets. Recent imagery clearly shows the artwork and reveals the aircraft are flying combat missions fully loaded with live AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs), AIM-9X Sidewinders , plus a Lockheed Martin’s AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) on the aircraft’s centerline station. The unit’s F-15Cs departed their home station at Kadena Air Base , Japan, on April 28, 2020, headed so Saudi Arabia to join U.S. Central Command’s (CENTCOM’s) 378th Expeditionary Operations Group (EOG). Once on deployment, technically the unit’s designation turned into the 44th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (EFS). The 44th Fighter Squadron departed from Kadena Air Base on April 28., USAF Lt Col Ryan Corrigan, the 44th EFS commander stated the following about the unit’s mission to the Middle East: “We are honored to join the Prince Sultan Air Base team and partner with the Royal Saudi Air Force… We look forward to strengthening the coalition as we continue to provide stability to the region.” “The F-15C brings an important capability to the AOR, enabling the coalition to maintain air superiority against any threat we may face. It’s an extremely capable fighter,” added Col Robert Raymond, the 378th Expeditionary Operations Group commander. https://youtube.com/watch?v=a25BUVo4vP0 USAF F-15C Eagle and F-15E Strike Eagle squadrons are leading the way when it comes to nose art . The practice was outlawed in the early 1970s when General John Ryan was the USAF commander. Following a directive issued in 2015, this kind of stunning artwork is being applied to fighters on deployment with increasing frequency. However, the delicate properties of low observable (LO) coatings mean that 5th generation fighters are never likely to receive such decoration. “Nightrain” on patrol over the Middle East., USAF/SSgt Justin Parsons Adding nose art and special paint schemes to certain aircraft is part of a USAF initiative to revive old traditions and foster squadron culture. However, the handiwork must conform to strict Air Force guidelines . According to a report by Military.com , the nose art must be “distinctive, symbolic, gender-neutral, intended to enhance unit pride, designed in good taste” and abide by copyright and trademark laws. Typically, maintainers use grease pencils to apply the creative themed artwork, which has the additional benefit of being easily washed-off by corrosion control teams when the aircraft return from deployment. This F-15C named “Chaos” is seen on the flightline at Prince Sultan Air Base., USAF The “Vampires” deployment to PSAB has given rise to some of the largest nose art seen on modern fighters for a very long time. This has been characterized by huge stenciling for a number of the aircraft, including those dubbed “CHAOS”, “NIGHTRAIN”, and “THE TROOPER.” The latter is applied to double MiG-killer 85-0114, which claimed a MiG-23 and a MiG-29 during Operation Desert Storm when it was assigned to the 58th Tactical Fighter Squadron from Eglin AFB, Florida. Double MiG-killer 85-0114., USAF Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of Desert Storm and the very same F-15Cs are back in Saudi Arabia, standing guard over the region. This time around, they are sporting far more modern weaponry and sensors, and some big, brash, and colorful nose art.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Aug 6, 2020",The Time When The USAF Got Caught Trying To Sneak F-117s Through Austrian Airspace,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent media reports regarding the Republic of Ireland’s ability to defend its own airspace have unearthed the hitherto scarcely reported story of when the U.S Air Force tried to sneak two Lockheed F-117A Nighthawks through Austrian airspace. A related post on Twitter referred to the Austrian story as a reminder that fighter aircraft are an integral part of a modern air defense system and vital to the ability to conduct air policing. The story dates back to Oct. 18, 2002, when the USAF filed a flight plan for what turned out to be a McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender tanker to fly through Austrian airspace. What the USAF reportedly didn’t divulge was that two F-117s were neatly tucked under the wings of the big tanker in close formation during the flight. The U.S. military regularly overflew Austria and Switzerland when routing from Germany to Italy or to the Middle East to avoid long transits over France, however, the two the neutral countries could block any unwanted transits. It was a time when the U.S. military was building up its forces in the Middle East ahead of a possible offensive against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Even NATO member states were struggling to secure public support for American overflights or support from their bases. Austria’s lack of credible air policing aircraft underscored a feeling of weakness in the face of U.S. strength. It flew a fairly ancient fleet of Saab J-35ÖE Drakens for quick reaction alert, armed only with AIM-9P3 Sidewinders, as well as two internal 30mm cannons. However, it remained bullish about the use of its airspace. “Not a single American plane has any business flying over Austria,” said Peter Pilz, a Green Party member of the Austrian Parliament in a report in the Wall Street Journal in 2003 . Austria retains clear guidance for the procedures of transiting its airspace, as detailed on this web page . Georg Mader Generally, diplomatic clearance was more straightforward for big unarmed tankers and transports than aircraft capable of employing weaponry. Moreover, the flight plan stated the aircraft seeking the transit was a “DC-10,” which would largely go unnoticed. This was submitted and an application was made for permission for the aircraft to fly from Spangdahlem, Germany, routing over Austrian airspace, using the radio callsign “Cacti 31.” It was approved. However, Austrian air traffic control officials spotted that the plan included a DC-10 serial plus others. This serial was subsequently changed, which aroused further suspicion. Shortly before 3:00 PM, the aircraft was detected by the Austrian air defense network’s new Goldhaube radar system as the aircraft approached the Austrian Tyrol region. Due to the irregularities in the flight plan, two Austrian Air Force Drakens were “Alpha Scrambled” from Zeltweg air base. At 3:03 PM, the “DC-10” entered Austrian airspace and then deviated from its intended track. According to Austrian aviation writer Georg Mader: “After our two Drakens closed-in, we identified two F-117s very close below the KC-10.” Mader adds: “[The] US formation was in our airspace for exactly 10 mins.” It was also said at the time that the formation tried a “defensive maneuver” as the Austrian fighters closed in. A KC-10 refueling an F-117., USAF The two Sidewinder-toting Drakens shadowed the formation and captured imagery, which was presented by the Austrian Minister of Defense Herbert Scheiber during a meeting of the National Security Council and was presented as part of a diplomatic protest lodged at the US embassy in Vienna. According to the Wall Street Journal report and an online feature by Austrian defense journalists, MP Peter Pilz spoke at the National Security Council meeting on Oct. 24 accusing the government of authorizing illegal overflights. However, the Austrian Ministry of Defense presented the imagery to prove that such incidents were being taken very seriously. Austria was highly alert to airspace incursions, which were of particular significance during the Balkan Wars of the 1990s. It increased its quick reaction alert to include primary and standby pairs of Drakens. Due to the country’s geography, incursions often only occur for a few fleeting minutes, especially where the flight time between German and Italian airspace is very short. According to reporting at the time, the U.S. Embassy said the flights had been properly planned and after the story broke, the Austrian Defense Ministry said there had been confusion, but stopped short of accusing the U.S. of breaking the rules. It remains unknown if the F-117s were equipped with radar reflectors or not during their transit close to the KC-10, but either way, it would have likely appeared as one target. Austria retired its last Drakens in 2005., Bundesheer Austria’s air policing remains a thorny subject to this day. The acquisition of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons has been a contentious issue since it was announced in 2002. Austria recently announced that it is planning to retire its aging Saab 105ÖE jet trainers that have been used for air surveillance and that the Eurofighters would be retained for the foreseeable future. As if to add more confusion, a report from Jane’s has subsequently revealed a move by Indonesia to purchase Austria’s Eurofighters. At a time when air policing in the European Union is under the spotlight, the Austrian F-117 overflight fiasco has not only reemerged, but it has been held up as an example of why a credible air defense force is so important. It also serves as a useful reminder of a tactic that remains in use to this day when air forces want to move fighter aircraft without drawing unwanted attention.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 5, 2020",This Is Our First Look At Boeing’s MQ-25 Tanker Drone Carrying A Refueling Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We now have our first look at Boeing’s MQ-25 carrier-based tanker drone test article, also known as T1, carrying a Cobham buddy refueling store under its wing. Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, Tweeted pictures of T1 after a recent tour of MidAmerica Airport, where work on and various testing of the unmanned demonstrator have been going on for more than a year now. Duckworth said she had visited Boeing’s facilities at MidAmerica last week as part of a larger visit. The airport, which is adjacent to Scott Air Force Base, is situated in the southwestern end of Illinois, approximately 18 miles east of St. Louis in neighboring Missouri. Boeing moved T1, which also carries the U.S. civil registration code N234MQ, there in April 2019 and that’s where it took its first flight five months later. Senator Tammy Duckworth, in the wheelchair at center, along with others in front of T1 at Boeing’s facility at MidAmerica Airport in July 2020., Office of Senator Tammy Duckworth Office of Senator Tammy Duckworth “Last week I visited @MAAirport, where I met with local officials and viewed the Navy’s new MQ-25 unmanned aircraft system,” Duckworth wrote on Twitter in addition to posting the pictures. “MidAmerica Airport is an important driver of our state’s economy, and I’ll keep working to make sure it has the federal support it needs.” Senator Duckworth is a U.S. Army veteran and former Lieutenant Colonel who lost both her legs when a rocket-propelled grenade hit her UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter during a mission in Iraq in 2004. She was a member of the House of Representatives from Illinois between 2013 and 2017 before winning her current Senate seat. She is now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, among other assignments, and is a contender to be Joe Biden’s running mate in this year’s presidential election. Last week I visited @MAAirport , where I met with local officials and viewed the Navy’s new MQ-25 unmanned aircraft system. MidAmerica Airport is an important driver of our state's economy, and I’ll keep working to make sure it has the federal support it needs pic.twitter.com/Gp0JOBiNW9 — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) July 20, 2020 As noted, Boeing has been working on the T1 demonstrator at MidAmerica since 2019. The company had won the Navy competition to design and build the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone the year before. The ability to carry the Cobham buddy refueling pod, which the service’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets carry when acting as carrier-based tankers now, was a key requirement for what had become known as the Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) program. This was an outgrowth of the abortive Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS), a saga you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The T1 test article is a modified version of the design that Boeing submitted to the UCLASS program. The company is now under contract to deliver four more refined Engineering Development Model (EDM) prototypes, the first of which it is scheduled to deliver to the Navy next year. The plan is to have the remaining three finished by 2024. Boeing has said it hopes to get T1 onto the deck of a Navy aircraft carrier sometime in the future to begin conducting various deck handling tests. However, actual carrier-based flight testing, which will use the EDM prototypes, isn’t scheduled to begin until 2022. The MQ-25 could offer revolutionary benefits for the Navy’s carrier air wings, fundamentally altering how they operate in the future. It will also relieve the service’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets from having to fly in the tanker role, freeing them up for other missions and otherwise reducing the strain on that fleet. The Stingrays, or follow-on variants or derivatives thereof, could eventually take on other missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance , as well. The Navy continues to say that it believes its carrier air wings will continue to evolve to contain a mix of manned and unmanned platforms. The picture that Senator Duckworth shared shows that, at least right now, Boeing continues to conduct work that supports the development of the MQ-25 in its initial tanker role.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 7, 2019",Syrian Regime Troops Captured A Black Hornet Nano Spy Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A picture has emerged online reportedly showing members of the Syrian Arab Army holding a FLIR Systems Black Hornet 3 drone that they captured in the northeastern corner of the country. Variants of this pocket-sized helicopter drone have seen increasing use, including within the U.S. military, in recent years, as a way to give small units important added situational awareness without necessarily exposing their position or otherwise putting personnel at increased risk. You can read all about Black Hornet in this past article of ours . This photograph first emerged online on July 19, 2020. Pro-regime social accounts claimed that Syrian troops recovered the Black Hornet near the town of Tal Tamr in the country’s northeastern Al Hasakah Governorate, which borders Turkey to the north and Iraq to the south. Forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, together with Russian troops, moved into this area in October 2019 after a unilateral Turkish intervention prompted American personnel and their local, predominantly Kurdish partners to vacate various operating bases and otherwise pull back . The Black Hornet 3, also known as the Personal Reconnaissance System (PRS), is the latest in the Black Hornet series, which Prox Dynamics first put on the market in the early 2010s. FLIR Systems subsequently bought Prox Dynamics in late 2016. The latest version of the tiny helicopter-like drone is fewer than seven inches long and weighs under a tenth of a pound. A single individual operates the Black Hornet using a tablet-like touchscreen device and a hand-held controller. Users fly the tiny unmanned aircraft primarily via a line-of-sight control link, but can also send it to specific locations further afield using a GPS-enabled beyond-line-of-sight navigation capability. In this mode, it can gather imagery along a route of preset waypoints and then return to its point of origin automatically. Despite its size, it has two full-motion daytime video cameras and a thermal imager. While operating at night, the system fuses the feeds from all three cameras to provide a single, higher-fidelity view, making it easier for operators to identify potential threats and other objects of interest. The user can also grab still images using these cameras for further exploitation after the conclusion of an operation. A typical PRS package consists of two drones inside a storage container that doubles as a docking station for recharging the battery-powered drones, along with the tablet and controller, all of which can easily fit inside one individual’s rucksack. FLIR system has also developed vehicle-mounted dock/launchers for up to eight Black Hornets. A US Army soldier holds a Black Hornet 3 drone. The other components of the basic package are seen on the table., US Army It’s not clear who was operating the drone in Syria before the Syrian troops captured it, but last year the U.S. Army began issuing Black Hornet 3s to various units. U.S. special operations forces, who have been very active in Syria, along with supporting conventional elements, have also been using versions of the drones since at least 2015 . Various other members of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS who are known to have special operations elements deployed in Syria, such as France , also operate or have operated variants of this drone, though it’s unclear whether any of them have sent Black Hornet 3s, specifically, to units in the country. For instance, the British Army first began using the first-generation Prox Dynamics PD-100 variant in 2013, but said it had withdrawn all of those from service between 2016 and 2017, in favor of larger, man-portable unmanned aircraft . In 2019, the U.K. Ministry of Defense announced it was buying 30 “Black Hornet PRS,” but officially for “research and development into a capability gap identified by Army HQ,” rather than operational use. A first-generation PD-100., US Army Regardless of who specifically was flying the drone, with a maximum stated range of under two miles, the recovery of the Black Hornet simply highlights just how closely the U.S.-led coalition is operating to the Syrian Army and its partners, chiefly Russia, on a day-to-day basis. In the past six months, there have been numerous alterations between American and Russian troops that run the risk of escalating into a more serious confrontation. This includes numerous instances where U.S. armored vehicles have blocked or attempted to block the passage of Russian convoys into certain areas, with vehicles dangerously jostling for position on the road at times. With all this in mind, it’s not surprising that elements of the U.S.-led coalition, especially special operations units, would be using Black Hornets in northeastern Syria, where the lines separating areas under the control of a wide array of actors, which also include Turkish forces and their local Syrian partners and pockets of ISIS terrorists , can be extremely fluid. The drones are ideal for scouting ahead along a patrol route or for reconnoitering urban areas, as well as monitoring the perimeters of small bases, where they might be able to spot impending attacks, ambushes, and all sorts of other hazards. As the Syrian conflict became increasingly internationalized over nearly a decade, it has also become a dumping ground of military hardware of sorts, and some of that hardware has been extremely advanced. For example, Israel’s loss of a Stunner surface-to-air missile, possibly the most advanced in the world, that careened undetonated into Syrian, and as a result, reportedly Russian hands. It’s also a conflict where drones have been omnipresent and especially small ones used for reconnaissance, pinpoint strikes , or even synchronized mass attacks . As Black Hornet underscores, these drones are only getting smaller and more capable. If anything, the war in Syria points to a future where small drones will dominate conflicts of all types.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jan 11, 2021","China’s Enhanced J-20B Stealth Fighter May Arrive Soon, Here’s What It Could Include","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports indicate that China is building a brand-new variant of its Chengdu J-20 Mighty Dragon stealth fighter. Chinese air power watchers and a number of media stories suggest that the production of the long-expected J-20B commenced this summer. The variant will likely feature upgraded powerplants that will add thrust-vectoring controls (TVC) as well as increased power to the J-20’s capabilities , and possibly more. It’s been rumored that the powerplants fitted to the new J-20B will be an improved version of the indigenous Chinese WS-10 Taihang engines that are fitted to the latest production examples of the fighter. A variant of this engine with thrust vectoring was revealed at the Zhuhai Airshow in November 2018 , and demonstrated in-flight fitted to a J-10B single-engine fighter. It endowed the Chinese fighter with the similar jaw-dropping performance and high angle-of-attack nose authority that has become synonymous with late-model Russian “Flankers” and the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 Raptor . The engine fitted to the J-10 at Zhuhai was named as the WS-10B-3 and it represented a major breakthrough for Chinese engineering and for the performance of its indigenous fighter aircraft. Increased power and thrust vectoring will be a major boost for the big, canard-equipped J-20 fighter-interceptor, a type that is aching for more thrust. As The War Zone previously reported , on the surface, equipping the jet with thrust vectoring technology seems counterproductive because it adds weight to an aircraft that is already underpowered. However, the new engines are also thought to provide both extra power and the added agility of thrust vectoring, which could be seen as an acceptable tradeoff depending on the goals of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the J-20’s design team. More powerful engines combined with thrust vectoring would also theoretically allow the aircraft to fly and maneuver at much higher altitudes, giving its sensors more reach and its missiles greater kinematic performance. You can learn more about how the F-22’s utilizes thrust vectoring to achieve high-altitude operations in this past War Zone piece . Increased fuel efficiency and improved range could be other features of the new powerplants. J-20As fitted with the original AL-31 engines, China Military/PLA Despite being the jewel in the crown of Chinese fighter aircraft technology , early J-20A models were all fitted with Russian AL-31 engines. The J-20A demonstrators used AL-31FN engines, but the prototypes and low-rate initial production (LRIP) versions moved to the improved AL-31FN Series 3 rated at 137 kN (30,800 lbs) thrust. It was a customized version of the AL-31 that was the result of a joint development project between China and Russia’s Salyut. China has struggled to produce a quality, indigenous jet engines for its fighters despite close ties with Russian industry. They have tended to lack thrust and reliability. Chinese engineers have been able to cleverly recreate or reverse-engineer certain technologies, but lack the experience and corporate know-how when it comes to matching the high-end jet engines of their peers. Imagery of a J-20A carrying the serial ‘2021’ that surfaced in September 2017 also revealed new serrated engine nozzles for the first time. This confirmed that J-20 production had shifted to include indigenous WS-10C engines built by Shenyang Liming. These featured sawtooth exhaust feathers to help reduce the aircraft’s rear hemisphere radar cross-section (RCS) . These new engines delivered a much-needed increase in thrust to around 147 kN (33,070 lbs). Reports at that time suggested that these engines featured thrust vectoring, but this was never confirmed. A J-20A with WS-10C engines., Chinese Internet Images that were released in November 2019 showed J-20s in yellow primer, with the same sawtooth nozzles. These were claimed to be evidence of the J-20B by Chinese media. However, these aircraft were actually additional J-20As with standard WS-10C engines. These engines were also incorrectly identified as WS-10Bs, as that engine is mainly intended for the latest production batch J-10Cs and J-16s and lacks the sawtooth nozzles. Supposedly, the decision to enter production on the J-20B follows a period of flight trials that were designed to prove the new thrust vectoring configuration for the heavy fighter. The decision to move forward would suggest that this testing has proved successful. Sources have told the War Zone that up to six J-20Bs could be in production at the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation (CAC) and the first aircraft are expected to be complete by the end of this year. They are thought to be followed by a further batch of regular J-20A fighters that are fitted with conventional, non-TVC, WS-10C engines. This suggests the PLAAF intends to use the first six aircraft for development flight testing, while continuing production of the current standard J-20A with WS-10C to equip further squadrons. The first J-20As were delivered to the PLAAF’s 176th Brigade at Dingxin Air Base at the end of 2016. This unit undertook formal operational evaluation (OPEVAL) and the J-20A officially entered service in September 2017. Aircraft from the latest production batches are expected to join the 1st Air Brigade at Anshan, in the Shenyang Military Region. There have been various rumors about the actual configuration of the J-20B amid much tighter security rules around Chinese fighter programs. Conflicting open-source information suggested that either Russian TVC-AL-31FN-X engines or the indigenous WS-10 with thrust vectoring could power the new variant. However, given that a J-10B flew a public flight demonstration with the WS-10B-3 at Zhuhai in 2018, the technology now appears to be substantially mature. Furthermore, it is thought that CAC has not built a J-20 fitted with AL-31FNs since mid-2019, having now consolidated on indigenously-produced engines. A J-20A shows off its underside. The dragon emblem is a watermark in the image., Chinese Internet The WS-10B-3 with TVC is considered to be a vital step towards the WS-15 ‘Emei’ engine, which was always considered to be the definitive choice for the J-20. However, this powerful Chinese engine has always lagged behind the development curve of the aircraft itself. The added capability of thrust vectoring has been debated by the War Zone , but as the J-20’s designer stated , it could reduce the J-20’s canard deflections during flight. Fluttering flight control surfaces are not good for a stealthy aircraft’s radar signature. Furthermore, the J-20 is unlikely to have the power required to achieve supersonic speed without afterburner, also known as supercruise, in its current configuration. That important ability is only considered possible once the aircraft receives the powerful WS-15. The addition of thrust vectoring and major configuration changes would involve significant work, but Chinese military technology is moving fast . The J-20B could go further than just being an engine upgrade. It will likely include avionics enhancements and sensor improvements . There have even been rumors that it could feature a new outer mold line. J-20As in yellow primer., Chinese Internet Removing the big canards and re-certifying the complex flight control system would be a huge undertaking for the CAC engineers, but doing so could dramatically enhance the J-20. In addition to removing the canards, cleaning up the empennage strakes, refining the wings, and other small low observable (LO) tweaks would substantially reduce the aircraft’s radar signature, especially in the radar frequency bands beyond the X-Band that is used by most fire control radars. Thrust vectoring could help compensate for these changes and, along with the slew of other tweaks, it could still render the fighter somewhat nimble. It is also possible that we could see a more dramatic iteration of the original J-20 design, similar to what is described here, in the future, once the powerplants have been upgraded and smaller enhancements have been made. Regardless, it seems ever more likely that China’s Mighty Dragon will get much more mighty in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels’ newest Fat Albert , an ex-Royal Air Force C-130J Hercules , has flown for the first time in its new paint scheme. The plane is undergoing a series of final checks in the United Kingdom before returning home to the United States to join the rest of the flight demonstration team. Aviation photographer and friend of The War Zone Ashley Wallace was kind enough to share the picture seen at the top of this story of the C-130J taking off from Cambridge City Airport in Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom with us. The Blue Angels have also released a number of official shots of the flight on social media. “Your C-130 pilots and crew are currently performing their first functional check flight (FCF) in our new C-130J this morning over England,” according to a post on the team’s official Facebook Page on July 20, 2020. “This FCF is part of a series of scheduled maintenance tests that will be completed prior to our transatlantic flight back to the United States!” USN USN USN On June 30, 2020, the Blue Angels released the first full look at the aircraft on the ground in its new paint job at Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group’s facility at Cambridge City Airport. At that time, the team also announced that “a series of maintenance tests, which include an aircraft systems operational check out and a functional check flight,” would be occurring in the next few weeks. Online flight tracking software shows the Blue Angels’ newest Fat Albert airborne during its check flight in the United Kingdom on July 20, 2020., ADS-B Exchange This aircraft is set to become the Blue Angels’ dedicated transport from show-to-show, as well as taking part in the performances itself. It will replace the team’s last Fat Albert, an aging C-130T , which they retired without an immediate replacement last year. The Navy finalized a deal to buy former RAF C-130J, which that service had designed a Hercules C5, for around $29.7 million in 2019. The U.K. government’s 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review had recommended divesting the RAF’s Hercules C5 fleet, while retaining 14 long-fuselage Hercules C4s, also known as C-130J-30s. The U.K. Ministry of Defense subsequently sold all but one of the Hercules C5s, the last of which is now slated to remain in inventory through at least 2021. Though the Blue Angels flew over Mount Rushmore for the “Salute to America!” on July 4 and previously took part in flyovers around the country to show support for first responders, healthcare workers, and others on the front lines of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains to be seen when the team may return to a normal airshow schedule that will include their newest Fat Albert.

A Pentagon contracting announcements indicates that the first of the U.S. Navy’s new class of guided-missile frigates , commonly referred to as FFG(X), will be named the USS Brooke . Former Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly had sought to the name the first of these ships the USS Agility , before resigning earlier this year amid a scandal having to do with a serious COVID-19 outbreak on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt . Editor’s note: See update at the bottom of this post. The mention of a new frigate named USS Brooke appeared in the Pentagon’s daily contracting notice for July 17, 2020, in an entry having to do with the purchase of Raytheon Enterprise Air Surveillance Radars (EASR), which you can read about in more detail here .

Kennedy (CVN-79); and USS Brooke (FFG-1).  Work is expected to be completed by January 2023.  Fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2020 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $122,301,170 will be obligated at time of award.  Funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year.  The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.” The hull number given, FFG-1, appears to be a typo, as it has already been reported that the first FFG(X) will be FFG-80. FFG-1 refers to a previous first-in-class USS Brooke , a guided-missile frigate that first entered service with the Navy in 1966. The service has not named any other ships after John Mercer Brooke , a 19th Century American naval officer, as well as scientist and engineer, who played a key role in the laying of the Great Transatlantic Cable , since then. The original Brooke class vessels were the first guided-missile frigates in the Navy. The design was based on the Garcia class , originally categorized as destroyer escorts, but which were later termed frigates. The first USS Brooke , FFG-1., USN The principle change between the Garcias and the Brookes was the addition of the RIM-24 Tartar surface-to-air missile system, along with improved radars. The Brooke and her five sister ships also had a five-inch main gun, deck-mounted torpedo tubes, and an eight-cell launcher for the RUR-5 Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC). For the time, this gave them a decidedly multi-role set of capabilities for their size, in particular, a robust air defense capability, something the Navy is also looking for in its new frigates . The Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company in Seattle, Washington, built Brooke and the next two ships in the class. Bath Iron Works in Maine built the remaining three examples. In April 2020, the Navy picked Marinette Marine , a Wisconsin-based subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, to build at least the initial batch of FFG(X)s, which will be based on its parent company’s established Franco-Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. While it remains unconfirmed, Brooke certainly seems like it might make sense name for these new FFG(X)s. It has more significant Navy history and heritage behind it than former Acting Secretary of the Navy Modly’s proposed Agility class. Additional suggested names for further ships in the class included Dauntless , Endeavor , and Intrepid , according to a document USNI News obtained in April. Navy officials reportedly rejected these proposals entirely. However, John Mercer Brooke also resigned his Navy commission during the American Civil War to join the Confederacy, becoming a key figure in the Confederate Navy, including being involved in the conversion of the ironclad CSS Virginia . Naming a ship after him now, at a time when there is a renewed push to remove monuments and other references to the Confederacy from public display across the United States, including within the U.S. military , could prove controversial, at best. We have reached to the Navy to confirm whether or not the service has indeed settled on USS Brooke as the first example of its new guided-missile frigates, but as it sits now, it is right there in black and white. UPDATE : The Navy got back to us and they say this was a mistake—at least that is their official position at this time. An email sent to The War Zone regarding our query reads in part: …We are working to correct the contract announcement that went out. The Secretary of the Navy has not named the FFGX yet. We are working to understand how this happened.” We will update this post with more info as we receive it, but for now, the first FFG(X) remains unnamed, at least officially.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Oct 21, 2020",Eurofighter’s New Radar Is Nearly Ready But Royal Air Force Wants An Even Better One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom is holding out for a unique cutting-edge Active Electronically-Scanned Array (AESA) radar for its Eurofighter Typhoons, while its European partners in the fighter program are forging ahead with a less capable, but ready solution. The Royal Air Force will likely receive its special version of the Captor-E radar that is currently in secretive development sometime in the middle of the current decade, which will enable its Typhoons to neatly complement its 5th generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in high-end warfighting. In a written statement on July 10, 2020, U.K. Minister for Defense Procurement Jeremy Quin stated: “ The Ministry of Defence is committed to implementing an Active Electronically Scanned Array radar on our Typhoon fleet. The demonstration and manufacture phase for the UK’s variant of the European Common Radar System is continuing at pace, and in June 2020 a contract was let with our European partners to develop a common integration solution across the Typhoon radar enterprise.” An AESA radar in a modern fighter is extremely important. Compared to older mechanically-scanned array radars, AESAs can spot and track targets further away and with greater speed and accuracy, even against smaller and harder to detect threats, such as low flying cruise missiles. With increased power, they generally have better target discrimination and multi-target tracking capabilities, as well as greater resistance to jamming. With longer range, they allow fighters to make better use of a new generation long-range air-to-air weaponry, such as the MBDA Meteor that the Typhoons can carry. They are also significantly more reliable than their mechanically scanned array counterparts. You can read more about AESA radars and their unique capabilities in this past piece of ours . The Luftwaffe is planning to upgrade 110 of its Eurofighters., Jamie Hunter Airbus announced in late June that it had been awarded a contract for the development, supply and integration of 115 AESA, or E-Scan, radars for German and Spanish Eurofighters. The news was extremely significant, marking the biggest development by far in a long-running saga related to the European fighter’s EuroRadar Captor-E system. Airbus operations in Germany and Spain are two partners in the Eurofighter Typhoon program, alongside BAE Systems in the United Kingdom, and Leonardo in Italy. The European fighter has made significant progress over the past five years through the addition of an array of new weapons and avionics to herald a true multi-role mission capability. However, the story of the fighter’s next-gen radar has proved less impressive. The June 2020 agreement for 110 Captor-E radars for Germany and an initial batch of five radars for Spain is significant in that it is the first such order from the partner nations involved in the Eurofighter program. The Airbus media release said the contract foresees the delivery and integration of the radars by 2023. “Whereas the Airbus sites in Manching, Germany, and Getafe, Spain, will act as overall integration hub, the development and building of the radar will be subcontracted to a consortium under the leadership of Hensoldt and Indra and by participation of further Eurofighter partner companies,” according to the statement. Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, said: “The contract for the Captor-E radar is a main achievement to equip Eurofighter with sensors that ensure today’s dominance of the aircraft also in the threat scenarios of tomorrow.” Eurofighter’s Complicated E-Scan Origins The European Common Radar System for the Typhoon is a complicated collection of projects that are being run by the overarching EuroRadar consortium comprising Leonardo in the United Kingdom and Italy, Indra in Spain, and Hensoldt in Germany. EuroRadar has already manufactured over 400 mechanically-scanned Captor radars for the existing Eurofighters that are in service, and an eagerly-awaited AESA follow-on dates back to early demonstrator flight trials in 2006 and 2007 under a project known as CAESAR (Captor AESA Radar). As long ago as 2012, then Eurofighter CEO Enzo Casolini said the E-Scan radar was “in full development,” as the partners sought to dispel confusion over the exact status of the radar with talk of an agreement by the end of 2012. “We started development, the gate target is to have entry to service in 2015,” Casolini said. The Captor-E antenna is mounted on a swashplate repositioner., Eurofighter At the Farnborough International Air Show in 2014, BAE Systems, Eurofighter, and EuroRadar held a public unveiling of a production representative Euroradar Captor-E, fitted to BAE Systems-operated Eurofighter Instrumented Production Aircraft 5 (IPA5) serial ZJ700. The aircraft flew into the event with the radar fitted and Eurofighter declared that a trials program was under way. A second aircraft, a two-seat new-build Tranche 3 production batch aircraft (IPA8), was also in construction in Manching, Germany, ready to join the combined E-Scan test program. Significantly, at the time of the unveiling, a contract for the radar was still not signed, with work being undertaken with contractor funding. However, speaking at Farnborough in 2014, the then British Minister for Defense Equipment, Support and Technology Phillip Dunne said that he expected to have a radar contract in place by the end of 2014. In fact, a €1 billion contract for the core development program of the common Captor-E radar was funded by the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and Spain in November 2014. Captor-E Moves Into Flight-Test A further two years passed before the Captor-E entered flight trials at BAE Systems’ site in Warton, Lancashire, when Typhoon IPA5 undertook a flight of around one hour on July 8, 2016. A media release said that IPA8 in Germany was also set to join the integration program. The kick-start came due to a pressing need to ensure the radar and weapons system would reach the required capability in time for first deliveries in late 2020 to the Kuwaiti Air Force , which became the aircraft’s eighth customer in April 2016 with an order for 28 jets. Importantly, Kuwait was the first Eurofighter operator to order the Captor-E for its aircraft and will be the first to operate with it. Kuwait will be the first Typhoon operator with the Captor-E radar., Eurofighter In addition, Qatar ordered 24 Eurofighters in 2017. It too required Captor-E, and despite none of the original European partners having ordered the radar, more vital funding was flowing into the E-Scan project with these new foreign customers. The latest radar order fits into a major enhancement project that was recently outlined for the Luftwaffe’s Eurofighters. Germany originally purchased 143 aircraft, consisting of 33 early Tranche 1 aircraft, 79 from Tranche 2, and 31 Tranche 3 aircraft. The Tranches are essentially the progressively more capable main build standards applied to three main batches of orders and manufacture. The Luftwaffe now plans to upgrade 110 Tranche 2/3 aircraft and procure new Tranche 4 aircraft to replace its early Tranche 1 jets under Project Quadriga. The radar contract appears to apply to both upgraded and new-build aircraft. The Spanish element of the order relates to a plan to add Captor-E to its 19 Tranche 3 aircraft. Like Germany, Spain is also evaluating buying additional Eurofighters under Project Halcon, an emerging requirement to replace its aging EF-18 Hornets. Why Is The E-Scan So Important? BAE Systems says the Typhoon E-Scan will “deliver the largest electronically scanned array for increased detection and tracking ranges, advanced air-to-surface capability and enhanced electronic protection measures. The large airframe also allows a wider field of regard than any other platform.” This diagram details the advantage of the wider field-of-regard., Eurofighter The antenna at the front-end of the E-Scan is mounted on a swashplate repositioner, that allows a much wider field-of-regard in terms of angular coverage (azimuth) compared with a fixed-plate antenna. It provides the ability to slew the antenna to “look” at far greater angles off the centerline of the aircraft. As such, a Typhoon could be traveling perpendicular to its target while still maintaining lock. This unique capability enables some highly unique tactics, which can be especially for non-stealthy fourth-generation fighter aircraft, that you can read all about in this past piece of ours. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aYvkL6_wTEY Eurofighter says “The Captor-E electronically scanned radar is the future primary sensor on Eurofighter Typhoon and has a full suite of air-to-air and air-to-surface modes. The capacious aperture of the Eurofighter Typhoon allows the installation of Captor-E’s optimized and repositionable array whose field of regard is some 50 percent wider than traditional fixed plate systems.” A different repositioner system that looks to achieve the same goal is used by the Saab JAS 39 Gripen E for its Leonardo ES-05 Raven AESA radar, which you can read more about here . One Radar Becomes Three Details regarding the Captor-E test program since 2016 have been limited, although in Italy, Leonardo’s test aircraft Instrumented Series Production Aircraft 6 (ISPA 6) was reconfigured to full Kuwaiti Air Force standard and it returned to flight on December 23, 2019 , to commence trials from Leonardo Aircraft Division in Turin-Caselle, Italy. The aircraft became the third to carry the Captor-E and it is in Phase 3 Enhancement Package b (P3Eb) standard, which is the latest multi-role configuration — the standard specified for Kuwait. Eurofighter said that ISPA 6 has been used to refine Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM) for the radar and for software release certification flights. While the baseline Captor-E is an integral part of the four-nation development program for the Eurofighter, there are actually three different variants of the radar. Kuwait and Qatar will receive the Mk 0 version, which was previously known as “Radar 1+.” The order for Germany and Spain will deliver 110 Mk 0 systems, but they will be subsequently upgraded to Mk 1 standard, which is a step-up in capability. Leonardo remains the industry lead on the Captor-E Mk 0 radar and the company will provide “knowledge transfer” to enable Hensoldt to assume the role of design authority for the Mk 1 upgrade, with Leonardo continuing to provide the processor for this radar variant. The upgrade is thought to include the provision of new Transmit-Receive Modules (TRMs) for the antenna and a new multi-channel digital receiver. This is to be embodied initially as an upgrade and then via new-build radars. Royal Air Force Typhoons based at RAF Lossiemouth, in Scotland., Jamie Hunter Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom is targeting a third, altogether more advanced and more clandestine version of Captor-E, dubbed “Radar 2.” This is shaping up as potentially the most capable of all the Typhoon E-Scan radars, although officials are staying tight-lipped about its capabilities. According to RAF sources, “Radar 2” is “the preferred capability pathway for operating it in a true contested environment with a radar that can do more than just support air-to-air weapons and provide situational awareness.” RAF pilots have always been swift to praise the legacy mechanically-scanned Captor, but procurement chiefs have robustly laid out ambitious plans to retrofit a small fleet of Tranche 3 jets with the new “Radar 2.” This will include additional electronic attack and secure data-link modes, whereby the radar is used as a high-bandwidth communications node and to make pinpoint electronic attacks. A number of secretive and lengthy technology demonstrator projects, including one named “Bright Adder,” have been leveraged to develop technology and mission requirements for “Radar 2.” The United Kingdom’s Strategic Defense and Security Review in 2015 stated: “We will continue to enhance its multirole capabilities and integrate an Active Electronically Scanned Array radar.” According to a 2018 House of Commons Defense Committee document, “Radar 2” was then “in the assessment phase.” It added: “we anticipate Ministry of Defence Main Gate investment approval in the latter half of 2019. We expect that the new radar will be embodied on 40 Tranche 3 Typhoons.” A cutaway artwork of the Captor-E in the nose of a Eurofighter., Hensoldt Leonardo Electronics Division is leading the RAF E-Scan program from an industry perspective. Its laboratory in Crewe Toll, North Edinburgh, Scotland, is thought to host the technology for the “Radar 2” program, now referred to by the company as Captor-E Mk 2. The next likely phase of the United Kingdom project would appear to be a move into live flight trials aboard a Eurofighter at BAE Systems’ Warton Aerodrome, but this has not been confirmed. A far clearer picture of the overall Captor-E program is now forming and getting Typhoons with an E-Scan into service is a vital step in cementing the future credibility of the fighter, both for existing users and potential new customers . An AESA radar is an intrinsic part of what a modern fighter aircraft must bring to the air combat arena. While competitors have passed the Typhoon by in this critical technological regard over the last decade and a half, that is finally about to change. In many ways, the Typhoon will finally be able to become all that it can be with this long-overdue reality sensor technology, and the RAF looks slated to get the most capable of the soon to be realized Captor-Es.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent satellite images of Al Jufrah Air Base in central Libya shows two Su-24 Fencer combat jets parked outside hardened aircraft shelters at the southern end of the base. This indicates these jets are still operating out of the base nearly a month after U.S. Africa Command released imagery showing one of them actually in flight there. This all comes amid an intensifying aerial component of the country’s civil war as foreign powers, chiefly Turkey and Russia , become even more directly entangled in the fighting. The pair of Fencer attack jets appear in imagery dated July 13, 2020, that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs. U.S. Africa Command’s (AFRICOM) image that caught an Su-24 landing at Al Jufrah was taken on June 18. Russia sent at least 14 combat jets, in total, to Libya, including both Su-24s and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets , in May.

PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The U.S. government has said it believes Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been operating these aircraft, as well as a variety of supporting infrastructure at various Libyan bases, in support of Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA). Su-24s have been seen in past satellite imagery of Al Khadim Air Base in eastern Libya, as well as at Al Jufrah. Wagner is at least closely tied to Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, also commonly referred to by the Russian acronym GRU. A stock photo of a Russian Su-24MR Fencer. The exact variants now present in Libya are unclear., Papas Do via Wikimedia The LNA, which has its main hub in the eastern city of Tobruk, is locked in a civil conflict with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which resides in the internationally recognized capital of the country, Tripoli. The LNA also received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, among others. At present, the GNA’s primary international supporter is Turkey. In the weeks since the arrival of the Russian jets, Turkey appears to have bolstered air defenses around key GNA sites. The Kremlin’s decision to dispatch the Su-24s and MiG-29s was itself a reaction to Ankara’s growing involvement in the country, particularly the increased use of armed Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones , which were instrumental in the GNA’s routing of LNA forces in western Libya earlier this year. These unmanned aircraft proved particularly devastating against UAE-supplied Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense systems. Earlier satellite imagery shows what looks to be at least one U.S.-made MIM-23 HAWK surface-to-air missile battery at Al Watiyah Air Base, which the GNA recaptured from the LNA in May. Unconfirmed video footage has also emerged online of HAWK system elements moving toward Al Watiyah, as well as others in place at Mitiga Airport in Tripoli. Turkey is one of a shrinking number of HAWK operators around the world and has been working to replace this Cold War-era system with more modern, domestically developed alternatives . Deploying some of its remaining examples to Libya would make good sense given the deterrent capabilities it could still provide against the LNA’s combat jet fleets, which are primarily made up of aging and increasingly difficult to maintain Soviet-era types, including MiG-21 and MiG-23s, as well as French-made Mirage F1s. HAWK would still represent a threat to the newly arrived Su-24s and MiG-29s, especially if they are flown by pilots with limited experience. There were reports of airstrikes on Al Watiyah targeting the HAWK emplacements earlier in July, but details remain murky. Subsequent satellite imagery indicated that, if nothing else, the surface-to-air missile systems were at least subsequently replaced. Just today, Turkey conducted what appeared to be the first sortie to the base, using a C-130 Hercules airlifter, indicating that the Turkish military believes that it is secure enough for this kind of operation. This could reflect the start of a new airbridge in support of the GNA. There are also unconfirmed reports that Turkey has sent KORKUT self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Libya, as well. KORKUT consists of a turret with two 35mm Oerlikon KDC automatic cannons on a modified FNSS ACV-30 armored personnel carrier chassis. The vehicle also features its own radar to direct the guns and can also be equipped with man-portable short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, such as the U.S.-made Stinger , which Turkey produces under license, or Russia’s Igla series . Satellite imagery shows what may be examples of these vehicles at Mitiga Airport in Tripoli, as well as in the Banana Projects, a stunted housing development just south of the capital. In recent years, GNA-aligned forces have turned parts of the Banana Projects into an artillery firebase and it is also now home to a bizarre airstrip that emerged last year that runs right between some of the apartment blocks. Turkey has and continues to supply a variety of other heavy and light weaponry to the GNA, which may also include armored 155mm T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitzers, as well as Kirpi mine-resistant armored vehicles . It’s unclear the extent to which actual Turkish troops may be operating or otherwise supporting the more advanced systems deployed in Libya. Ankara has acknowledged having troops, as well as intelligence personnel, in the country, but has, so far, said that they are engaged in advisory, special operations type missions, and support activities only. Those support functions notably include demining and explosive ordnance disposal in areas where GNA forces have recaptured from the LNA. Starting June, reports began to emerge , including from the Turkish government directly, that LNA-aligned groups had laid mines, improvised explosive devices (IED), and booby traps are they retreated from Tripoli and other areas in the country’s northwest concern the month before. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EhDStqKsXPA On July 15, AFRICOM released a statement, along with photographs, that it said were of these mines, IEDs, and other traps. “These weapons are assessed to have been introduced into Libya by the Wagner Group,” the press release noted , based on their Russian markings, which were painted over the conceal them. These munitions had been recovered in various areas between Tripoli and the strategic city of Sirte, which is situated to the east along Libya’s central coastline. Sirte is now a major focal point for continued fighting between the GNA and LNA. “The Russian-state sponsored Wagner Group is demonstrating a total disregard for the safety and security of Libyans,” U.S. Marine Corps Major General Bradford Gering, AFRICOM’s Director of Operations, said in a statement. “The Wagner Group’s irresponsible tactics are prolonging conflict and are responsible for the needless suffering and the deaths of innocent civilians. Russia has the power to stop them, just not the will.” It’s worth noting that Libya is presently under an international arms embargo, which the LNA’s benefactors, as well as Turkey, have been openly flouting for some time now. Turkish authorities have notably been defiant even in the face of pressure from their NATO allies in Europe, some of whom are part of a European Union-led maritime effort to try and stem illicit smuggling of oil, as well as human trafficking, in and out of Libya. French authorities have said that Turkish warships painted a French Navy corvette with their fire control radars when the latter attempted to stop, board, and inspect a cargo ship apparently carrying arms to Libya in June. French President Emmanuel Macron has since decried Turkey’s involvement in the North African country’s civil war as “ criminal .” “NATO allies shouldn’t be turning fire control radars on each other. That’s not good,” U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien told reporters on July 15 while in Paris on an official visit. “We are very sympathetic to the French concerns… We’re taking it very seriously.” There are no indications that foreign involvement on both sides of Libya’s civil war will be declining any time soon and there is now the potential for further escalation, as well. Authorities in Egypt, which has, so far, had more limited direct involvement in the fighting have threatened multiple times in recent weeks to intervene on behalf of the LNA in response to Turkey’s deepening support of the GNA. “Egypt is able to change the military situation quickly and decisively if it wants,” Egyptian Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said during a meeting with Libyan tribal leaders aligned with Haftar in Cairo on July 16, 2020. They had told the Egyptian leader that he had their approval to launch an overt military intervention into the eastern portion of the country. It is worth noting that el-Sisi, whose government is now also in the midst of a maritime boundary dispute with Turkey, also called for all sides to stop the fighting. Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, which included discussions about Libya. Despite being firmly on different sides of the conflict, Erdogan and Putin have been trying to get the GNA and the LNA to agree to at least a ceasefire, which, if it were to hold, could lead to a de facto partitioning of the country. In the meantime, the fighting in the country remains unabated, with increasing airpower, air defenses, and other newly supplied weaponry in the mix on both sides.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",All Known Fires On USS Bonhomme Richard Have Been Extinguished (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After over four days of frantic firefighting aboard the stricken amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard berthed in San Diego Bay, the U.S. Navy says all the fires aboard have been put out. This great news comes after the ship listed in the opposite direction overnight , forcing the evacuation of the vessel and the pier it is tied up to for a period of time while the situation was assessed. An official statement from Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet reads: Below is a statement from Rear Admiral Philip E. Sobeck Commander, Expeditionary Strike Group THREE – ESG-3 : After four days of firefighting, all known fires have been extinguished aboard USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) . Our fire teams, are investigating every space to verify the absence of fire. Until every space is checked and there are no active fires we will not be able to commence any official investigations. We did not know the origin of the fire. We do not know the extent of the damage. It is too early to make any predictions or promises of what the future of the ship will be. We cannot make any conclusions, until the investigation is complete. What we do know is, that brave Sailors from commands all across San Diego worked tirelessly alongside Federal Firefighters to get this fire extinguished and I want to thank them for their efforts. This was a Navy team effort. We had support from the air and sea. Three helicopter squadrons conducted more than 1,500 water bucket drops, fighting the fire and cooling the super structure and flight deck enabling fire crews to get onboard to fight the fire. Tugs also provided firefighting support from the waterline, cooling the ship’s hull. We had 63 personnel, 40 U.S. Navy Sailors and 23 civilians, treated for minor injuries including heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation. We have no personnel hospitalized. The Navy continues to work together with regulators, county and state in protecting our environment and preparing to address the community’s concerns as we move forward to the next phase. I’d like to thank our partners from state and county, the U.S. Coast Guard , and all agencies for continued support. There will be a press conference held shortly. We will update this post with all the important information after it concludes. UPDATE: From today’s press conference: The painstaking process of going compartment by compartment to begin to assess the damage and to make sure the fires are indeed put out is underway. There still may be high heat in some areas. In other cases, the hatches may be sealed shut due to a vacuum, in which case teams must cut through to gain access. This can provide oxygen that could restart the fire or result in a backdraft situation. It’s dangerous and slow work with crews rotating every 15 minutes or so. Temps reached 1,200 degrees in some areas. The superstructure is largely made of aluminum that clearly didn’t take the heat well. Rear Admiral Sobeck stated that the ship has proven to be survivable. He also says that it can be rebuilt, but will it be is the question. The list is caused by the “free water effect” of water shifting around the ship’s spaces and hull. It has remained stable throughout the ordeal regardless of the list the Sobeck said, but dewatering will further stabilize it and reduce the list now. 85 crewmen were living aboard when the fire broke out. The fire began and then caused an explosion. The ship was roughly two-thirds of the way through its deep maintenance cycle with systems being moved back aboard when the fire hit. The loss will impact the Navy’s force mix and combat capacity, but the Rear Admiral says there are enough ships to fill the gap. Hundreds of sailors from 20 ships based in San Diego pitched in to fight the fire. The Admiral started the presser with a couple of good stories about the sailors who valiantly fought the fire over the last four days.

We will continue to monitor as the ship settles. Bonhomme Richard had begun listing to starboard on July 13th and that list only increased until being brought under control recently. Now it looks like the ship has listed to port, toward the pier, which triggered the evacuation as the fire approaches the four-day mark. Chris Cavas corroborated the ship’s list to port using local harbor cameras: The good news is that crews were able to return at least alongside the vessel to continue emergency response operations. There have been concerns regarding the amount of water the ship has taken on over the last few days via firefighting efforts on board, from the sea, and from the air. It was reported on the morning of July 15th that Navy MH-60S Seahawks have dropped 1,500 Bambi Buckets of water on the ship in an effort to keep its exterior cool. The 15th was the first day since the fire broke out in which a press conference wasn’t held. Only a couple of tweets from the Navy provided basic updates: While the fires aboard Bonhomme Richard wore on, the Navy commissioned an all-new amphibious assault ship into service, the America class USS Tripoli (LHA-7). The coincidental timing wasn’t lost on anyone. Tripoli is the second America class ship. The third, which will be USS Bougainville (LHA-8), will be in a new subclass of its own, with the inclusion of a floodable well deck in the design. The original America class configuration was heavily focused on aviation operations and lacked the well deck entirely. You can read all about this in this past piece of ours . USS Tripoli . , US Navy Now that the initial public shock of the fire has subsided, calls for answers as to how what may be the total loss of a capital ship while it was pier-side in its homeport could happen are growing. Our contributor Aaron Amick, a Navy veteran with twenty years of experience, discussed exactly this in a recent editorial for The War Zone . It is quite illuminating. You can check it out in full here . We will continue to update this post as more information comes available on this ongoing crisis. UPDATE: More photos are emerging of damage done to the ship. While we can not confirm them at this time, this is the best collection of them we have seen: UPDATE: The Navy has announced that, as of 6:00 AM local time, firefighters are back on the USS Bonhomme Richard continuing their work. There have been no new injuries. The ship still looks to be listing heavily to port. UPDATE: We have daytime overhead shots of the ship’s port-side list. The good news is there is no sign of smoke!

Jamie Hunter and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 11, 2020",F-15 Uses New Infrared Search And Track Pod To Shoot Down Target With AIM-9X Sidewinder,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle has fired an AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile for the first time using targeting data provided by Lockheed Martin’s Legion infrared search-and-tracking pod. The AIM-9X live-fire mission took place during testing at Eglin AFB, Florida, on July 8, 2020, and involved an Eagle from the resident 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), the “Skulls,” part of the 53rd Wing. Five days later, an F-16DM from the same unit flew the first-ever operational test flight carrying the pod. “Both the F-15C and F-16 teams have been doing phenomenal work under difficult conditions to rapidly field this new capability,” said Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Moser, commander, Operational Flight Program Combined Test Force, a joint 96th Test Wing/53rd Wing unit at Eglin. An F-15C from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron carrying a Legion Pod and an AIM-9X., USAF/TSgt John McRell The Legion Pod will provide F-15C and F-16C/D pilots with the ability to identify, track and target aircraft, including stealthy platforms that cannot be “seen” on radar, in complex electronic warfare environments. The Legion Pod pre-developmental test phase began in early 2019. In a statement, Lieutenant Colonel Morser said the unit had completed 80% of required testing before it entered the official developmental test phase, which he says sped up developmental and operational testing considerably. “What would normally take several years has been reduced to 18 months from the start of DT to expected fielding,” he said. F-16s carry the Legion Pod on the starboard station under the air intake, USAF/TSgt John McRell Pairing the Legion Pod with the advanced capabilities of the AIM-9X is particularly significant. The AIM-9X Block II, also known as the AIM-9X-2, which entered service in 2015, offers a big leap ahead in capability with its data-link and lock-on-after-launch improvements, meaning it can be fired at an enemy without first locking its seeker on to the target. Today’s AIM-9X is more than just a short-range dogfighting air-to-air missile. Under certain conditions, its imaging infrared seeker can see well beyond the distance it can actually travel and an extended range variant is in development. You can read more about the AIM-9X and its growing capabilities in this past War Zone piece . While the latest tests are a major development on the path towards formal fielding of the Legion Pod, the Air Force has been testing the system for a while. It was noted that a podded IRST that appears very similar to the Legion Pod was carried by an F-16C of the 64th Aggressor Squadron at Nellis AFB, Nevada, as long ago as 2013 . Formal F-16 carriage and integration trials were subsequently undertaken by Lockheed Martin from 2015 . In addition, shadowy F-16s based out of Area 51’s Groom Lake flight test center were also seen toting the podded IRST in 2017. This F-16C from the 64th Aggressor Squadron was photographed carrying a Legion Pod in 2013., Jamie Hunter The Legion Pod flew for the first time on an F-15C in 2016 and the following year the Air Force selected the Lockheed Martin system over Northrop Grumman’s Open Pod . Boeing was subsequently awarded a contract by the USAF to integrate the pod onto the F-15C, including $154.6 million for engineering, manufacturing, and development work, plus production, integration, test, and deployment. A total of around 130 pods were planned to equip the F-15C fleet. As of November 2018, the Air Force’s plan was to reach initial operational capability with the system on the F-15C in 2020. In May 2019, a picture emerged showing an F-15C from the 57th Wing at Nellis Air Force Base carrying a Legion Pod during the U.S. military’s biannual Northern Edge exercise in Alaska, an advanced integration event. Lockheed Martin The Legion Pod is fitted with Lockheed Martin’s AN/ASG-34 infra-red search-and-track (IRST) sensor, which can locate and track targets at long range. It also provides targeting information to enable the pilot to engage threats using the IRST alone, or in combination with other sensors, which provides a robust capability in all situations . This is particularly effective in dense electronic warfare (jamming) combat environments. Unlike a traditional radar, the IRST operates passively putting out no electronic emissions, which means it also reduces the risk of alerting potential opponents that they are being targeted. Lockheed Martin Legion Pod is actually a modular pod system that can accommodate additional payloads in the future, as well as the IRST in its front end. As such, it could offer an easy way to bring new capabilities to the aircraft that carry it, such as communications gateways, electronic warfare systems, or even other sensors. In recent years, the USAF F-15Cs have started carrying Lockheed Martin’s AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) on the aircraft’s centerline station. This is primarily used for long-range visual identification of targets , day or night. The Sniper pod primarily finds its targets by slaving its optics to the F-15C’s AN/APG-63V3 radar. The pilot can also manually steer the Sniper pod or cue it to their Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System ( JHMCS ), but it is far less capable when it comes to searching for and providing targeting data in the air-to-air regime compared to the Legion Pod’s IRST. A California Air National Guard F-15C carrying a Sniper pod on its centerline station., Jamie Hunter Lockheed Martin has also developed the IRST21 sensor, which was based on the earlier AN/AAS-42 IRST system that was fitted to the F-14D Tomcat. Another version of that system, known as Tiger Eyes , is now featured on export versions of the F-15 Strike Eagle and Advanced F-15 Eagle. IRST21 is being fielded by the U.S. Navy on its Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , as well, and it reflects growing popularity of IRST carriage on 4th generation fighter platforms in U.S. military service. For more detail on how IRSTs are employed and why they have become so important to modern fighter aircraft, click here , but in this case, using the IRST with the AIM-9X signifies a big capability boost. A fighter equipped with the IRST carrying Legion Pod and an AIM-9X can hunt and kill targets, even just beyond visual range, in a largely electromagnetically silent state. It can do this while also leveraging the maximum efficiency of the AIM-9X Block II. The targeted aircraft wouldn’t be alerted as to the incoming missile presence even during its terminal stage of flight because the AIM-9X uses an imaging infrared sensor (IIR), which is also passive. As such, IRST and AIM-9X together are one heck of a ‘hunter-killer’ team. These types of tactical opportunities are just another reason why advanced IRSTs are becoming absolutely critical kit on fighter aircraft.

Brett Tingley and The War Zone staff,"Updated on Jun 6, 2020",Newly Released FAA Documents Give Unprecedented Look Into Colorado Drone Swarm Mystery,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As covered in previous reports by The War Zone , law enforcement agencies in numerous rural counties in eastern Colorado and adjacent areas of Nebraska and Kansas received an influx of reports of large drones flying in formations at night for a period of several weeks during December 2019 and early January 2020. Many law enforcement personnel were among the reporting witnesses. In short order, the “mystery drone” wave also elicited serious expressions of concern from at least two U.S. senators and attention from Colorado’s governor and state public safety agency. The activity soon drew the attention of regional and later national news media, as well. Now, The War Zone can offer an unprecedented inside look at what was going on behind the scenes within the FAA, which was leading a task force to solve the drone mystery. Not only is the confusion within the agency made clear, but we now have multiple highly credible official reports from trained observers from the timeframe when the objects were present in the region. Many of them match to a remarkable degree and they allude to a unique arrangement in which a large drone seems to have been accompanied by a fleet of smaller ones. We also have the latest conclusions, or lack thereof, of what the FAA thinks actually was happening over those peculiar weeks last winter. Over the past several months, Douglas D. Johnson , a volunteer researcher affiliated with the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) , has utilized the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain many hundreds of pages of emails and other pertinent documents from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other federal agencies regarding the mystery-drone flap and has made them available to The War Zone . In addition, hundreds of additional relevant pages have been located, but are still being processed by the FAA. The FAA is also currently withholding some key documents, citing FOIA exemptions. Nevertheless, the documents already released suggest that the FAA, despite a short-lived, but strenuous effort, was unable to determine the origin of the flying formations of sizable aerial devices reported by many credible witnesses in December and January. Senior FAA officials were able, however, to conclude that “there is high confidence these are not covert military activities.” The released documents contain no evidence that any federal criminal laws were broken by whoever was operating the devices, although the FAA has withheld at least one key document discussing the legal issues surrounding the case. No document yet released suggests that the mystery drones ever encroached on any U.S. military installation, or even into any airspace that was under special FAA restrictions. In a statement to The War Zone , Johnson summarized his impressions after months of research into a subject that he still considers far from closed: “For at least a couple of weeks, the mystery drone flap had the serious attention of top FAA leaders, and at least two U.S. senators. The FAA assigned apparently capable investigators, and mobilized resources from multiple FAA components. The assistance provided by other federal agencies such as the FBI, DHS, and military was apparently quite limited, because of the absence of evidence of criminal intent, or of a proximate threat to military assets or other critical infrastructure. Once the aerial activity stopped, it appears that both federal and state agencies quickly dropped the matter – I have not yet seen any evidence of a continuing federal investigation, although there are many documents still not released.” Law Enforcement Officers Provided Detailed Descriptions Some of the communications received by veteran Special Agent Michael Bumberger of the FAA’s Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP), situated within the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, or ASH, and his associates contain detailed descriptions of the unusual formations of unmanned aerial devices that were reported by law enforcement officers and other credible witnesses. [FAA Bumberger]1-2020-006226 First Release_Redacted.pdf Bumberger Second Release 1_Redacted.pdf Bumberger Second Release 2_Redacted Reduced.pdf Bumberger Third Release_Redacted (7-6-20).pdf Bumberger 1-14-20 activity drops away -Third Release_Redacted 152.pdf For example, a Jan. 5, 2020, email from Bumberger said an FAA LEAP agent had spoken to sheriffs in 16 counties in Colorado and Nebraska and “each agency contacted advised at least one deputy has witnessed the activity.” The email went on: “The activity reported occurs primarily between the hours of 1800 and 2200 MST and demonstrate the pattern of multiple “drones” flying a grid type pattern and remaining airborne for several hours at a time in less than optimum flying conditions (high winds and storm-like conditions). The number of drones reported operating at one time range from between 2 and 16 and appear to be approximately 6 feet width and length. Flight time has been 2 to 3 hours continuous. All reports indicate flight is between 200 and 300 feet. However several people interviewed stated it was hard to determine height due to the darkness and lack of clouds. Other sightings lights were also reported to be either flashing or steady white, red, or green. One report mentioned flashing blue lights. They have not been described as operating in a manner that place persons on the ground in danger.” Memo for FAA Adm Steve Dickson from ASH 1-3-20.pdf An email from FAA Chief of Staff Angela Stubblefield contained a late December 2019 report from Nebraska: “The Lincoln FSDO [Flight Standards District Office] has received a call regarding multiple, larger sized drones flying over rural western Nebraska…The caller reported there were maybe 12 or more drones with a 6 foot wingspan flying approximately 200 feel AGL, in a grid pattern. From his contacts, the drones seem to have covered 10 to 20 square miles. Some farmers/ranchers reported the drones flying over their farmsteads. The caller stated he saw the drones December 29 approximately from 1900-2230 MST. He was unable to get a photo or video. The caller does have an aviation background; he is a private pilot.” A Dec. 31, 2019, email written by FAA aviation safety officer Michael Sanford stated: “The drones are reported to have 6’ wingspans and there are several reports that indicate the drones are operating in coordination with a ‘Big Drone’ that may be stationary in the area. There is also an unverified report of the larger ‘drone’ potentially landing and taking back off from an airport in Imperial, Nebraska (Chase County). This larger drone, also described as a ‘Mother Ship’, is said to hover while all the others fly around in close proximity. The large drone, as described, is about 5-6 feet in diameter with a cylindrical shape and a red front.” A Bumberger memo, also from Dec. 31, stated that a “Chase County Nebraska sheriff deputy reported observing 30 to 50 flying independently of each other with a larger ‘mothership’ hovering for hours. The deputy stated it the larger drone appeared to be way over 55 pounds.” An early January 2020 email from a lieutenant in the Kansas Highway Patrol described a sighting “by one of our K-9 Troopers” near Oakley, Kansas: “He said one of the drones had a really bright light on it, like a spot light. That drone stayed relatively stationary at that location. He then said there were anywhere from 10 to 15 drones that flew all kinds of patterns around that stationary drone. At one point one of those drones flew directly over his house. He had his night vision with him so he tried to look at it. Some of the lights on the drone drowned out a good picture with the NVG’s, but he said he thought he saw 4 rotors on the drone as well as a horizontal stabilizer or wing. The wing appeared to be about 10 foot in length. He said the drone was about 200 feet in the air and made absolutely no sound at all, even though the wind was calm.” A report from Jan. 6, 2020, in Lincoln Nebraska described a dozen or more smaller UAVs flying alongside a larger aircraft estimated to be four to six feet in diameter. Lincoln NE witness Brumley 1-6-20- Third Release_Redacted 160.pdf One of the releases also contains a telephone report of a sighting in Eglin, Illinois, on Jan. 8, 2020. That sighting was mentioned in a few other FAA emails, although the summary of the call ultimately concludes that “the reports about these drones were not carried over to the next shift because they were dismissed as UFO sightings by others at the Police Department.” Elgin PD report 1-8-20 – Third Release_Redacted 78.pdf Even top FAA officials invoked the term “UFO” on at least one occasion. In a December 31, 2019 email from FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to FAA Chief of Staff Angela Stubblefield, Dickson observed that “not too long ago we would have called these ‘UFOs’.” Stubblefield responded “Yep! Now everything is a drone!” FAA via FOIA FAA Launched Investigation As Media, Senators Pressed For Answers It appears that public reports of night-flying drone formations began to surface around Dec. 17, 2019.  Some lower-level FAA components may have become aware of such reports within a few days, but it took some time, and media attention, before the issue registered with top-level FAA officials, judging from the emails. Elwell 2nd interim – Resp_2020-006224 Prod 2 20200622_Redacted.pdf On Dec. 29, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson emailed senior managers a link to a press account on the Colorado events with his comment, “I’ve seen several of these reports. Do we have any information about these purported sightings? The rumors seem to be spreading rapidly.” Dickson’s inquiry was forwarded to others by the head of agency’s internal security branch, Associate Administrator for the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety Claudio Manno. Manno added his own question:  “[D]oes this potentially link to incidents other than in Colorado and Nebraska?” The FAA documents provide no further clues on the “incidents” to which Manno referred, but The War Zone is currently actively pursuing inquiries into several incidents in which drones of unknown origin showed up at unexpected places during the past year. FAA ASH Claudio Manno 1-16-20 email summarizing FAA investigation.pdf The FAA quickly emerged as the lead federal agency seeking to get the bottom of the Colorado-centered flap. The investigation was conducted by FAA-ASH, with the field investigation run by Bumberger, who was assigned to the case about Dec. 26. Ian Gregor, public affairs manager for the FAA Pacific Division, served as the agency’s public spokesman during the investigation. The emails show that Gregor was in constant touch with both Bumberger and senior FAA officials in Washington, and constantly fielding inquiries from news media of all kinds, including sometimes cryptic e-mail responses to The War Zone ’s editor. FAA [Gregor] Response.2020-005892_Redacted_Reduced.pdf The documents Johnson obtained reveal a high level of interest in the investigation on the part of U.S. Senators Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, and Deb Fischer, another Republican from Nebraksa. On Dec. 30, Leesa Papier, director of the Office of National Security Programs and Incident Response, a part of the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, or ASH, emailed Bumberger that “the drone issue is really ratcheting up. Some of the drones flew near Senator Gardner’s house [in Yuma County, Colorado].” Both Gardner and Fischer made public statements expressing their concerns during the height of the drone flap. “I’ve been in contact with the FAA and I’m encouraged that they’ve launched a full investigation to learn the source and purpose of the drones,” Gardner said in a Dec. 31 press release. “I will continue to closely monitor the situation.” On the same day, an FAA congressional relations officer emailed the FAA chief of staff that Gardner’s office was “hearing from the local farm bureau that the drones have been disturbing cattle operations and may have caused injuries, and that the drones are flying closely to some of the general aviation airports in the area. They may elevate this to a call from the Senator to the Administrator [Steve Dickson] given the level of concern in the area. They are also just concerned that it’s taking this long to identify such a large number of drones.” On Jan. 8, 2020, Gardner stated , “I think this shows a significant gap in our understanding and national security understanding of the threat drones pose. If we can’t find out who they are, how they are being controlled, who is controlling them, what is to keep a nation like Iran or North Korea from looking at this instance and saying ‘Boy now we should come out and do the same thing with cameras and sensor equipment to find out the kinds of things that would help with international security’ so I think it is a concern.” The Senator’s concerns are not unfounded. The threat that lower-end drones pose to national security is something The War Zone has been highlighting for years. The War Zone reached out to Sen. Gardner’s office for comment and will update this article when we hear back. In early January, the national media attention escalated, including reports by CNN , The New York Times , and The Washington Post . On Jan. 9, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, said that he had asked the Colorado Department of Public Safety (CDPS) to ramp up its monitoring of the aerial activity. “I think we need to find out what is happening before an accident occurs,” Polis said. Memo for FAA Adm Steve Dickson from ASH 1-3-20.pdf One of the key documents uncovered by Johnson is a four-page memorandum written by the then-second-ranking official at ASH, Joshua Holtzman, and sent to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson [misspelled as “Dixon” on the memo] to bring the FAA chief up to speed on the issue for “a telephone call with Senator Fischer this afternoon [Jan. 7].” Among the memo’s talking points was that “The FAA understands the interest in identifying the operator(s) and mitigating any potential risks these UAS [Unmanned Aircraft Systems] could pose to the safety of other aircraft and people and property on the ground.” FAA via FOIA The mystery drone investigation reached its public climax with a large meeting convened by Morgan County Sheriff Dave Martin in Brush, Colorado, on Jan. 6.  According to FAA notes, the closed-door meeting was attended by 77 people. Federal representation included personnel from the FAA, FBI, DHS, Air Force Office of Special Investigations from F.E. Warren Air Force Base, and the office of Senator Gardner. State and local representation included sheriff’s office personnel from 12 Colorado counties and six Nebraska counties, the Nebraska State Patrol, the Colorado Information Analysis Center (a division of CDPS), and Colorado Fish and Wildlife. FAA notes 1-6-20 Brush meeting.pdf Bumberger wrote that “the meeting did not provide an answer or new leads” but that “several good things came from it.” It was agreed that an ad hoc “Drone Sightings Task Force” would continue the work of the meeting in facilitating coordinate of an expanding investigation . However, in the days that followed the Jan. 6 meeting – which was widely publicized by regional and national news media – the reports of unidentified drones flying in formation tapered off rapidly. In a Feb. 5 email to a reporter, Gregor said, “As far as I know, the reports dried up around the middle of January. We have not received any information that enabled us to determine what exactly it was that people were seeing and, if they were drones, who was flying them.” Sheriff Martin on March 6 confirmed to SCU’s Douglas Johnson that drone reports stopped “shortly after we had the [Jan. 6] meeting.” Without evidence that any criminal activity had been involved, Martin set the matter aside, and the working group was discontinued, Martin said, adding,  “I’m not in charge of airspace.” The CDPS had posted a final update on its website back on Jan. 13, saying “CDPS will scale back proactive operations but will continue to respond to and investigate reports of suspicious activity… Despite all of the reported activity, we are still unaware of any crime being committed.” FAA Concluded No Military Involvement Much initial speculation about the strange aerial activity centered on the military, in part because some early drone sightings were only about 30 miles from ICBM missile fields controlled by the 90th Missile Wing of F.E. Warren Air Force Base. In public statements at the time, an F.E. Warren spokesman denied having any role in the sightings. Internal emails obtained by SCU’s Douglas Johnson and reported by The War Zone on Feb. 24, 2020, confirmed that officers at the base were mystified by the drone reports. The Air Force emails, while heavily redacted, showed the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Strategic Deterrence and. Nuclear Integration, abbreviated AF/A10, as well as Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), and other Air Force components, queried and assured each other that no component of the Air Force was responsible for the aerial activity or knew its origin. Johnson has appealed some of the Air Force redactions. The early January talking-points memo to FAA Administrator Dickson said “AFOSI from F.E. Warren AFB have also confirmed no DOD involvement in or knowledge of the [mystery drone] operations.” In a Dec. 30, 2019 email, FAA Chief of Staff Angela Stubblefield wrote that “NORTHCOM/NORAD has been contacted and does not have any information, other than they are aware of the reports.” U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) is tasked with command and control of Department of Defense homeland defense activities and the coordination of civil authorities in relation to defense. It is co-located and shares command with the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which is a bi-national command with both American and Canadian personnel. USNORTHCOM – 20-R-030 Response Letter_Reacted.pdf Johnson filed a FOIA request with NORTHCOM, asking about the Jan. 6 meeting and any information about the aerial activity. The command responded that “NORAD personnel received an invitation for the Jan. 6, 2020 meeting; however, no one attended because the invitation arrived too late.” NORTHCOM said that Johnson’s broader question about the drone activity “led only to NORAD records,” and those records were not reviewed because NORAD, as a bi-national command, is exempt from FOIA. FAA ASH Claudio Manno 1-16-20 email summarizing FAA investigation.pdf Manno wrote: “In response to concerns the Army or one of their contractors was conducting UAS operations or testing and evaluation, on January 13, the FAA contacted multiple offices within the Pentagon in both the Army and the Office of the Secretary. All provided negative responses. Combined with previous DOD engagement [by FAA] with USAF and NORAD/NORTHCOM, there is high confidence these are not covert military activities.” Legal Issues Murky And FBI Role Limited No released FAA document says that whoever was operating the mystery drones broke any federal laws. The FAA-circulated notes on the Jan. 6 Brush meeting said that Agent Bumberger “advised the attendees, based on current information it is unclear what if any laws or regulations have been broken and/or violated.” FAA General Counsel Arjun Garg produced a memo titled “UAS Sightings – Potential Enforcement Remedies,” circulated to senior FAA staff on Jan. 9, but the FAA currently takes the position that the memo is exempt from disclosure under FOIA under a “deliberative process privilege.” Several documents refer to local law enforcement officers hearing gunshots from the ground during several drone sightings. At the January 6 meeting, federal representatives advised local officials that it is a violation of federal law to shoot at an aircraft. The lack of any obvious criminal element limited the roles of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in investigating the flap. On Jan. 7, Joshua Holtzman, the then-second-ranking official at FAA’s Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, or ASH, wrote to Special Agent Bumberger that “I sent an email earlier today to the SES [Senior Executive Service] at FBI CIRG [ Critical Incident Response Group ] to stoke the fires on what the FBI is doing, both in the field and at FBI HQ… FBI is struggling, at least at HQ, with the conundrum that technically without a criminal nexus, there is not much they can do.” ASH chief Manno’s Jan. 16 summary email suggests that the FBI’s overall involvement in the investigation remained rather marginal: “Neither the Omaha nor the Denver FBI Field Offices have opened investigations, and FBI HQ has not received any request from their field offices or local LE [law enforcement] for deployment of their UAS detection assets. DOJ and FBI noted none of the thresholds for their C-UAS [counter-unmanned aircraft systems used to detect and disable drones] use under 6 USC 124n have been met; therefore, the FBI was not contemplating deploying any technical resources. DHS also agreed no threshold had been met for DHS to deploy technical resources under 6 USC 124n.” However, the FBI was helpful at least in resolving one short-lived aspect of the investigation. After viewing a drone formation, deputies in Perkins County, Nebraska, recovered three unrecognized objects from a field, subsequently referred to by some as “space potatoes.” According to an FAA email, “FBI from North Platte advised the strange items referred to as space potatoes have been identified as SOILPAM Tracklogs… The gel is made up of poly-chloride tablets in a mesh stocking. When they get wet they form a log which replaces the dirt that was displaced by the pivot machine’s wheels.” FAA via FOIA During the drone flap, FAA officials repeatedly suggested to reporters and others that the aerial activity in Colorado illustrated the need for a regulation already proposed by the FAA to require “Remote ID” capacity for most drones. The early January talking-point memo prepared for Administrator Dickson concluded, “If they are UAS, this is an exemplar of why Remote Identification requirements, such as those put forward in the FAA’s recently released Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, are critical to safety and security of UAS integration into the National Airspace System.” In a Jan. 10, 2020 email from Joshua Holtzman, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for the FAA’s Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, to a redacted email in Nebraska, he states that private drone firm DJI had just offered to send mobile devices to the field to try to identify the mystery drones. Holzman said he had also connected DJI with the Colorado Information Analysis Center. It’s worth noting that DJI has its main headquarters in China and various agencies of the U.S. government have raised concerns about potential security risks, especially based on what information the company collects about the use of its products. In 2017, the U.S. Army banned the use of any DJI drones and there has been talk since then about a possible U.S. government-wide prohibition on Chinese-made unmanned aircraft. There is no further mention of DJI in the documents, and, at that point, the sharp drop-off in drone activity had already occurred. Note that the FAA tried to redact the name of the firm wherever it appeared, but overlooked the banner subject line in this email. DJI Aeroscope 1-10-20-Third Release_Redacted 102.pdf Search For Non-Military Origins Led To Dead Ends The FAA emails show that in the early days of the investigation, Bumberger and others thought that the drone formations might be related to surveys of a possible pipeline route. For example, in an email dated Dec. 30, 2019, FAA Chief of Staff Angela Stubblefield wrote that “the two leading potential explanations point to possible survey work: 1) A new pipeline has been proposed in the Julesburg Basin, an area northeast Colorado on the Colorado/Nebraska border and the counties where the sightings have taken place are adjacent to that basin; and 2) Colorado recently enacted more strict EPA-related laws leaving some to speculate that the aircraft are conducting IR surveillance for gas leak detection.” However, subsequent emails and memos show that as the FAA pursued inquiries into many such commercial, educational, and other possibilities, they all led to dead ends. The early January memo to FAA Administrator Dickson summarized the results: “We have contacted entities (UAS companies, pipeline operators, colleges, etc.) that have received permission to operate UAS in these areas, but to date, none of these approved operators have been determined to be the source of the UAS operations.” While it’s true that drones have been used for industrial inspection for some years now, it seems unlikely a major utilities provider or energy company would conduct such inspections and night and without notifying authorities, or deny responsibility once the FAA launched widespread inquiries and media coverage of the mystery drones ramped up. The emails also show that the FAA monitored mystery-drone-related Facebook groups for reports and leads. Many Questions Remain The War Zone reached out to the FAA’s Ian Gregor, public affairs manager for the FAA Pacific Division, to inquire if the FAA ever established the origins of the drone formations reported in Colorado, Nebraska, and other states. Gregor stated that “We have not received any information that enabled us to determine what exactly it was that people were reporting seeing and, if they were drones, who was flying them.” Douglas Johnson told The War Zone that even though the FAA has been forthcoming in regards to some aspects of his FOIA requests, the agency hasn’t been in others: “The FAA has been very slow in responding to some of my FOIA requests, and not all of the delays are satisfactorily explained by the pandemic restrictions. Among other issues, as of July 13 the FAA had yet to produce a single responsive document to a FOIA I submitted 19 weeks ago for pertinent records held by Jay Merkle, who is the executive director of the FAA UAS Integration Office, although the agency has acknowledged possession of thousands of pages of responsive Merkle-associated documents. Some other key documents have been withheld or redacted based on questionable legal justifications, and I may appeal some of these. A January 13 exchange of emails between Ian Gregor and Carissa Vandermey, senior advisor for the Science and Technology Directorate for the Department of Homeland Security, were redacted in their entirety.” So, although The War Zone and the SCU have pursued the Colorado drone flap for over half a year, we still don’t know who was behind the mysterious activity, and from what we’ve seen so far, no one in the Federal Aviation Administration knows either. It’s clear from these FOIA releases that the FAA, state and local authorities in Colorado, and even the AFOSI, took the sightings quite seriously, but it appears that their attention quickly shifted elsewhere once the public reports stopped. Given the FAA conclusion that there is “high confidence these are not covert military activities,” it is difficult to make a case that the mystery drone activity could have been some sort of classified test or black operation. There always remains the real possibility that the drones could have been operated by a hostile actor, whether homegrown or foreign, or some rogue hobbyists with considerable resources. While these documents provide an unprecedented view into the government’s response and its own apparent confusion surrounding these bizarre events, above all else they offer detailed and consistent descriptions from trained observers indicating that some kind of relatively advanced UAS operation was indeed underway over the central United States for a period of weeks last winter. Surely, once word of the strange happenings spread locally and eventually made national news, many sightings throughout the region were caused by a combination of misidentification and public excitement. However, for a period of time around Christmas and New Years, something truly unexplained was happening over the Colorado Plains. So unexplained that the federal government’s own agency tasked with regulating the skies over the United States still has no clue what exactly took place or who was behind it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 28, 2019",The Pentagon Moves To Launch Its Own Experimental Mini Space Station,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Sierra Nevada Corporation recently received a Pentagon contract to craft an experimental space outpost capable of supporting various research and development, training, and operational missions, including potentially with humans aboard. This comes as the U.S. military as a whole, including the nascent U.S. Space Force , is increasingly focused on operations in various orbits around the Earth , and competition there , as well as in cislunar space between our planet and the Moon. On July 14, 2020, the Nevada-headquartered aerospace company announced the deal with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), but did not state the approximate value of the award. DIU is charged with “accelerating the adoption of leading commercial technology throughout the military” and has offices in California’s Silicon Valley, as well as Boston, Massachusetts and Austin, Texas, in addition to its headquarters in the Pentagon. The Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) will now modify its Shooting Star space transport vehicle design as an Unmanned Orbital Outpost. The company has been developing Shooting Star since at least 2016 for NASA’s Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program, which is seeking new means of delivering cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). The existing 15-foot-long cargo vehicle is intended to be able to carry up 10,000 pounds of cargo, both inside in a pressurized compartment and in unpressurized packages attached to three external mounting points. The design has two solar panel arrays capable of generating six kilowatts of onboard power and is capable of maneuvering independently in space using six thrusters. SNC is hoping to conduct its first demonstration mission to the ISS using Shooting Star next year. An artist’s conception of SNC’s Shooting Star space transport vehicle., SNC “We’re excited by the multi-mission nature of Shooting Star,” SNC’s CEO Fatih Ozmen said in a press release regarding the DIU contract. “It was originally developed for NASA resupply missions to the International Space Station, and since then we keep identifying new capabilities and solutions it offers to a wide variety of customers. The possible applications for Shooting Star are really endless.” “The current Shooting Star is already designed with significant capabilities for an orbital outpost and by adding only a few components we are able to meet Department of Defense needs.” Steve Lindsey, Senior Vice President of strategy for SNC’s Space Systems business area, who is also a retired U.S. Air Force pilot and former NASA space shuttle commander, added. “We are proud to offer our transport vehicle to DoD as a free-flying destination for experimentation and testing, expanding beyond its current payload service capabilities for Dream Chaser cargo missions.” The prototype Shooting Star now under construction., SNC DIU first announced it was interested in a “solution… for a self-contained and free-flying orbital outpost,” just over a year ago. The miniature space station could support “space assembly, microgravity experimentation, logistics and storage, manufacturing, training, test and evaluation, hosting payloads, and other functions,” it had said in a July 9, 2019, notice. “Space assembly” and “manufacturing” refer to the potential future capability to assemble, as well service, satellites and other spacecraft in orbit, something the U.S. military, as well as NASA, has been exploring for some time. The outpost itself could serve as platform on which to test those capabilities. The Air Force has also publicly raised the possibility of using orbital platforms as logistics nodes, the feasibility of which The War Zone has explored in the past . “The proposed orbital outpost will be initially established in LEO with guidance, navigation and control for sustained free-flight operations to host payloads and support space assembly, microgravity, experimentation, logistics, manufacturing, training, test and evaluation,” SNC’s press release says, showing that DIU is still interested in an orbital platform that may be capable of performing these and the other previously stated mission sets. “Future outposts may be based in a variety of orbits including, medium-Earth orbit, highly elliptical orbit, geosynchronous Earth orbits (GEO) to include GEO transfer orbits, and cislunar orbits.” A diagram showing the different distances and other information about various orbits around the Earth., Cmglee via Wikimedia Neither DIU’s original notice nor SNC’s press release mentions any specific payloads that could find their way onto the orbital platform. It could be an ideal space to test new space-based communications, data-sharing, or navigation systems. The outpost could also potentially support sensor suites for intelligence, surveillance, or reconnaissance purposes or weapons, either defensive or offensive . It is worth noting that the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, to which the United States is party, bans the deployment of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in outer space, but does not expressly prohibit arming satellites or other spacecraft with conventional weapons. DIU had also said when it first publicly unveiled its orbital outpost plans last year that it was interested in proposals that could eventually have a “ human-rating ,” meaning they could support manned operations, or serve as a stepping stone to a larger and more robust military space station. It’s interesting to note that in the 1960s, the U.S. Air Force, together with the then-classified National Reconnaissance Office, explored the possibility of a Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) for intelligence-gathering purposes. The name was part of a cover story that this miniature space station was purely for research and development use. The Pentagon eventually canceled that program in favor of spy satellites without any MOLs ever reaching space. NASA ultimately launched America’s first space station, Skylab , in 1973. The U.S. military and NASA, of course, have very actively collaborated over the years on various aerospace projects, including the use of the Space Shuttle as an orbital platform for military purposes , including the deployment of classified payloads , on multiple occasions. DIU’s decision to hire SNC to build a modified Shooting Star vehicle for this new orbital outpost program could have other implications, as well. The company plans to deploy the cargo-carrying version using an unmanned version of its Dream Chaser reusable spaceplane. At present, during the demonstration flight next year, SNC expects an unmanned version of Dream Chaser to launch with the Shooting Star module attached using a traditional rocket booster. It will then bring the cargo to the ISS and return without the module attached, landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Shooting Star is designed to be disposable, detaching from the ISS and then maneuvering to safely burn itself up in the atmosphere after getting unloaded. The U.S. military is already separately exploring various options for rapidly launching satellites and other spacecraft, which follows decades of previous work on similar concepts, including the use of reusable spaceplanes. You can read more about these projects, past and present , in these past War Zone pieces . Dream Chaser, which is also set to have a version capable of carrying actual people, could offer a way to rapidly deploy new payloads to the orbital outpost, or even new sections to expand its physical size, and bring them back down to Earth, as necessary. DIU described “modularity and scalability” as “favorable characteristics” in its initial notice last year. With this in mind, this orbital platform could serve a similar purpose, broadly, to the Air Force’s experimental X-37B mini space shuttle , but with even greater persistence in space . Whatever this space outpost ends up doing, it could be in orbit in the next two years. DIU’s original contracting notice said that it hoped to have a prototype of the outpost in LEO within 24 months of awarding the contract. It’s unclear what service or services might be involved in actually launching and operating it once its up there, though Space Force would be the obvious the choice, even DIU or another office within the Pentagon continued to formally manage the program. All told, SNC’s reworked Shooting Star vehicle turned orbital platform for the Pentagon could be an exciting stepping stone for the U.S. military’s future plans for operating in space.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 1, 2021",Boeing Says India And Israel Are The Focus For Future Advanced F-15 Eagle Sales,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing is lining-up big new potential deals with Israel and India that could keep variants of the F-15 Advanced Eagle in production for the next decade and beyond. Prat Kumar, Boeing’s Vice President and Program Manager for the F-15, said the company was in the process of responding to a request for information from Israel for up to 25 new Advanced F-15s , plus upgrades for 25 existing F-15I aircraft . He said Boeing expected to see the next steps in the potential requirement over the “next year or so.” Boeing is also eyeing India as another potential customer for its slowly-evolving 144-fighter jet requirement . Kumar said the firm was in the process of requesting a marketing license from the U.S Government to start discussions with India, adding that he is not sure if the F-15 is “in the sweet spot” for the requirement. India is looking at solutions from a range of manufacturers from the around world, including Boeing’s own F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. These revelations come hot on the heels of the huge U.S. Air Force deal announced earlier this week that could see Boeing building as many as 200 F-15EX fighters . The contract includes $1.2 billion for an initial eight aircraft in Lot 1, to be followed by a further 76 in the five-year Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). The USAF will purchase a projected minimum of 144 F-15EX jets, with the associated indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract having a ceiling of $22.89 billion that would cover a maximum of 200 new Eagles. A Boeing infographic detailing the overall F-15 program., Boeing The plan covers the replacement of most of the USAF’s remaining F-15C/D Eagles in service. Kumar said Boeing had anticipated the contract for some time and that the company had been “leaning-in” to be ready to deliver the first pair of jets by the first quarter of 2021. The USAF has laid out dual objectives for the F-15EX. To quickly recapitalize the F-15C/D fleet and to incur the lowest possible training burden in doing so. In doing so, the F-15EX is the most advanced Eagle to date, which builds on the F-15QA that is in production for Qatar. The new USAF jets feature the same advanced fly-by-wire design that was pioneered in the F-15SA for Saudi Arabia . This opened up wing stations 1 and 9 to permit increased stores carriage. The Qatari jets are the first to get an array of new features , including a new wide-area display, low-profile HUD, and an all-new wing that saves weight and increases longevity. The F-15EX is supposed to have a useful life of an amazing 20,000 flight hours. The first two F-15EX aircraft are currently being built. , USAF Kumar confirmed the F-15EX will be fitted with the same Raytheon AN/APG-82 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar that has been retrofitted to the USAF F-15E fleet . Similarly, the new aircraft will feature the Advanced Display Core Processor II mission computer and Suite 9 Operational Flight Program, which also brings them into line with the latest Strike Eagle standard. A new 11×19-inch Large Area Display is also fitted to front and back cockpits, although the USAF initially expects to fly the aircraft with a single pilot. The rear cockpit will be fully operational, and Kumar said the space and capability of the rear seat has other possible uses, which you can read more about here . The Boeing executive also discussed the potential for adding artificial intelligence to aid F-15EX crews in the future. Boeing Boeing expects the F-15EX to carry the new Lockheed Martin Legion infra-red search-and-track (IRST) pod as it is a current USAF program of record. As a multi-role aircraft, Kumar also noted that the F-15EX could also be fitted with the LANTIRN navigation pod, Tiger Eyes IRST, and Sniper targeting pod under the intakes if the USAF so desired. This combination has been adopted by Saudi Arabia, Korea, and Qatar for its advanced F-15s. An F-15C Eagle from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron carrying a Legion pod on its centerline., USAF/TSgt John McRell Elements of the F-15 Advanced Eagle are transferable into existing Eagles as part of an upgrade plan. Saudi Arabia is upgrading its F-15S aircraft to F-15SR standard, which incorporates most elements of the F-15SA. However, the fly-by-wire control system is unique to the newer F-15s and prohibits older airframes from the added capacity of opening up the two additional wing stations. Israel could follow Saudi Arabia by upgrading its existing F-15Is and Boeing was also working with the U.S Government to offer an upgrade to Japan for its F-15Js . According to Kumar, this would retrofit the Japan Air Self-Defense Force aircraft with similar capabilities as the F-15EX, such as the enhanced cockpit, new radar, and electronic warfare suite. Boeing expects that the first six F-15EX jets will join a USAF development and operational flight-test program at Eglin Air Force Base, in Florida. This will include expanding the test fleet assigned to the new Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System ( EPAWSS ), which is being developed as a retrofit for existing F-15Es and will also be an integral part of the F-15EX. Kumar said EPAWSS is “included in the price” for a new F-15EX. Boeing says the F-15EX is being developed as a “pathfinder” for the USAF’s new “ Digital Century Series ” concept. This is designed to rapidly evolve new platforms through digital engineering and build future fighters in an entirely different manner. A diagram that details the digital engineering elements of the F-15EX., Boeing Boeing is using the EX to modernize the way an airframe is built, in this case using digital engineering to precisely model parts in 3D and therefore reduce touch labor on the assembly line. Kumar said Boeing’s T-7A Red Hawk advanced training aircraft was instrumental in developing these concepts and that these have been “deployed in F-15 where applicable.” Boeing has digitally engineered the nose barrel section of the F-15EX and the same technology is being applied to the wings, with the forward fuselage to follow. Similarly, open core mission system architecture is designed to enable Boeing to test new capabilities, sensors, and weapons in a faster and more efficient way. Kumar said the challenge from DevSecOps, a new USAF software development initiative, is to migrate to an agile environment for software upgrade releases and adding third party systems. This approach will pay dividends when it comes to configuring aircraft for manned/unmanned teaming. The USAF has not purchased Boeing’s Advanced Missile and Bomb Ejection Rack (AMBER) that could add weapons capacity for the F-15EX. Kumar said the USAF is “happy” with the current dozen air-to-air weapons stations. However, no secret is being made of the F-15EX’s ability to carry a large store, such as a hypersonic missile, on its centerline station, which The War Zone posited in detail when it broke the F-15X story two years ago. “The F-15EX carries more weapons than any other fighter in its class and can launch hypersonic weapons up to 22 feet long and weighing up to 7,000 pounds,” the Boeing statement said when the USAF contract was announced. Kumar said the centerline can carry “fuel, weapons, or advanced pylons for large stores under development and in flight-test, the capability exists in the jet.” He wouldn’t talk specifics regarding hypersonic weapons, but it’s clear the Air Force’s newest fighter is much more than just a straight swap for old Eagles. Both domestically and internationally, the future is looking very bright for the F-15. Contact the author: Jamie@thedrive.com Jamie Hunter Contributor Air F-15 Fighters"
Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Aug 3, 2020",This Rare Cockpit Video Of Chinese Fighter Pilots Dogfighting Offers Unique Insights,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In-cockpit footage of actual air combat training always makes great viewing, however, a new video offers rare insight into Chinese fighter operations making it even more engaging. This intense clip posted online by China’s People’s Daily newspaper shows People’s Liberation Army Air Force pilots turning and burning in Chengdu J-10 multi-role fighters. The full version of the video can be seen here. Without the overdubbed music, the English communications are easy to hear. The People’s Daily Twitter post states: “The Northern Theater Command brigade in the video is known for its notable combat record, having shot down or damaged 67 warplanes in the Korean War against the US.” The full video seems to include some stock footage, but the main in-cockpit sequences appear to have been shot from inside two-seat J-10AS variants, the combat-capable training version of the original J-10A. This would indicate that the aircraft depicted are from the 34th Air Brigade based at Qihe, in Shandong province. This base comes under China’s Northern Theater Command (NTC) and is home to the 34th Air Brigade, which is the only unit equipped with both the J-10A and AS versions within this command. One of the most interesting aspects of the footage is that it apparently confirms Chinese fighter pilots use English to communicate in these kinds of engagements, unless the words have been overdubbed on the footage. It has long been thought that PLAAF fighter pilots use English, but it has never been officially confirmed. The pilots in this clip use radio callsigns “Jaeger 1 and 2” and common air combat language, such as “tally,” which means they have made visual contact with the other aircraft, and “Fox 2” which means firing a close-range heat-seeking missile. Also of note in the video is the overlay of a situational display and head-up display, albeit with some critical information being obscured. In addition, a forward-facing camera has the aircraft’s main console similarly obscured. All told, even in this short clip, there is plenty of interesting information to be observed, as well as some good old-fashioned air-to-air adrenaline and exuberance as J-10 pilots train together and hone their “dogfighting” skills.

Aaron Amick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Veteran Sailor On Why Navy Ships Can Be Most Vulnerable In Port And How To Change That,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy is facing a unique and severe disaster in what could be the total loss of the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard. What is so puzzling to many is how this could happen to a capital ship that was unarmed and sitting at rest at one of the world’s most capable naval bases that is situated along the shores of a major American city. The answer may come as disturbing to some—U.S. naval ships can be at their most vulnerable while sitting at rest in their homeport. Many have also asked what would the situation be like if this had occurred aboard a nuclear-powered supercarrier, three of which are based just across San Diego Bay from the Bonhomme Richard at Naval Base Coronado. The answer to that question is interesting in of itself, but it may actually provide a way to help make sure that similar disasters don’t occur on conventionally-powered vessels in the future. An MH-60S Sea Hawk from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Three (HSC-3) flies over the badly damaged Bonhomme Richard. , USN The Dangers Of Sitting Still The USS Bonhomme Richard was in an unusual condition on July 12th before an explosion onboard would set the ship ablaze. The amphibious assault ship was wrapping up a significant maintenance period at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard and had been moved to Naval Base San Diego’s Pier 2. The maintenance activity was still ongoing at the time of the “casualty,” or accident. This means many systems were offline. The ship was full of shipyard personnel wrapping up their parts of the project. Under these circumstances, the decks can be littered with welding crews bonding fixtures to the outboards, cutting torches removing old mounts, grinding disks showering sparks into a fire-retardant cloth, and various workspace debris. Other workers would be working on ship’s wiring, air conditioning, and pretty much anything else. Aviation Ordnanceman Airman David Gaona conducts preservation maintenance on an elevator aboard amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard . , USN During these maintenance periods, passageways of the ship are often clogged with cables powering temporary light bulbs that cast shadows in corners. White strings tie up thick, black ventilation hoses that hum with air. Temporary alarm panels and fire hoses are mounted at critical locations shrinking the already highly limited corridor space. To provide these services to lower decks, some hatches are “fouled,” preventing or obstructing access. All this dramatically restricts how the crew can move between levels. They have to snake their way past obstructed hatches to get to an available ladder to move to the next level. Sailors and shipyard workers constantly weave around these obstacles during the workday to get to their workspaces. When a vessel is in a long maintenance availability window, the ship is in a constant state of filth. Dust, fiber, shavings, and oils begin to pool in corners and crevices the moment a vessel begins a refit. If left unattended, this debris quickly becomes kindling for fires. Sunshine streams into the upper vehicle deck of the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard as Sailors and contractors prepare the ship for dry-dock circa 2010             , USN This noisy, cluttered, hot work environment is precisely the type of fire hazard that sparks disasters onboard ships. Every shipyard worker and crewmember must police themselves and the area around them to identify and mitigate potential flashpoints. A clean ship is fire-resistant. Human Factors During these long in-port periods, many experienced sailors are rotating off the ship to new commands. Many of the crewmen who report to the ship while in a maintenance availability either have not been to sea for years or are new and have never been to sea at all. They may struggle to navigate to their workspace and have never visited some parts of the ship when it is in this condition. This lack of familiarity with their vessel creates delays in response to casualties. Every month the ship is in maintenance, it becomes more susceptible to disaster, not only from its inherent condition, but from the lack of onboard crew experience. Sailors assigned to the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard walk through early morning fog to the ship and the messing and berthing barge., USN Many of the crew who do not rotate to new commands are often temporarily detached to other sea commands for experience and proficiency retention. This shrinks the crew below normal manning numbers and removes some of the most experienced sailors from its roster. This leaves the remaining sailors responsible for a large ship they may not be familiar with that is also in a state labyrinthian disarray. Crew manning is a managed risk the command leadership is responsible for maintaining. They must have a proficiently trained crew on the ship during a difficult and long in-port period while providing some of their sailors at sea experience whenever possible. The maintenance availability environment is ripe for discipline issues. Crews see their ship in pieces with entire systems removed. They know they will not stand a watch at sea for months and it’s easy to fall into a sense of complacency. It is human nature to prepare for the moment and not the eventuality. At a time when the ship is scheduled to be in port for months, the crew will need management and motivation to train harder because of the lack of sea experience, not despite it. From the deck plate crewman looking up at this top-down management, it appears unnecessarily harsh, and this lowers morale. It is part of the maintenance availability process. Morale will suffer when sailors are pushed hard in port. USS Bonhomme Richard undergoes maintenance in San Diego in 2016. , USN Declining morale ripples across the crew like a tide. It begins with the crew not focusing during training or work parties and showing up late or not showing up at all. The sailor’s uniforms are often stained or dirty from the shipyard environment and cleaning they do every day. If allowed to continue, the crew will spiral into a lethargic, undisciplined pool of individuals who resent their command. This weighs on the crew mentally and instead of serving their country, they feel like they are serving the sweeping broom. Their performance will decline the more prolonged the ship and its crew remain in this condition. At sea, the USS Bonhomme Richard fire would have been resolved much differently. It probably would not have happened in the first place. Sailors aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard conduct a hangar bay fire drill while underway to Sasebo, Japan, USN Underway, there is a full complement of crew, many of whom are experienced sailors. They can recognize a casualty and respond before it spreads beyond control. The entire crew is trained to respond cooperatively to an emergency and that training to do so is current and well administered. At sea, the ship is not fouled with temporary fixtures that block the passageways and they are well lit and orderly. At sea, the ship is easier to maintain and clean, preventing the potential spontaneous combustion of discarded materials. The fire aboard Bonhomme Richard appears to have been started with maintenance debris left unattended in a vehicle storage area. These spaces are in use and monitored more closely while underway. In other words, if the fire had happened while the ship was underway, it would have been much better prepared to handle the casualty because the crew is trained to prevent, contain, and resolve battle damage. The damage control tools and teams would have been on board, well trained and motivated, and in sufficient numbers to respond quickly. Sailors assigned to the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard check the structural integrity of Landing Craft Air Cushion 21 (LCAC 21) during a fire drill., USN To minimize the chance of this disaster from repeating itself, the U.S. Navy should look at its practices. In fact, the Navy has the very model for success deployed on their nuclear-powered ships and submarines under the authority of NAVSEA and the U.S. Department of Energy . That model emanates from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, better known as Naval Reactors . Naval Reactors has an excellent track record of few casualties onboard U.S. nuclear-powered ships since its inception. If the Navy would enforce standards required in the maintenance, watchstanding, and operation of nuclear power on all ships, crew performance would improve and we would lose less fighting capability due to poor practices. Borrowing A Proven Strategy And Applying It To All Imagine if the Bonhomme Richard was a nuclear-powered ship. That may seem terrifying at first, but the reality is really the opposite. Naval Reactors sets the standard for nuclear-powered ships and submarines in the Navy. These standards are strictly enforced and have a high-level redundancy from top to bottom. From the most complicated evolution involving year-long maintenance availability to relatively simple valve maintenance, every evolution is a minimum two-man operation or reader-worker routine. This breeds accountability. Accountability to each other and for the ship’s combat readiness. Accountability imparts hard work values on sailors. Those values become pride when the task is complete. Pride in a job done well raises morale. Every sailor must be reminded of their purpose and their value to the crew, especially during long maintenance availability periods. On a nuclear-powered vessel during a refit period, everything you bring on the ship comes off with you when you leave. A nuclear-powered vessel is not a storage locker for your tools, trash, and rags. This means cardboard and crates are often left on the pier during a refit. Rags and tools are kept with the worker at all times, not stored on board for convenience. Convenience breeds complacency. The Navy Reactors’ standard of performance is about much more than reactor safety. It is a standard that creates a culture on board a vessel that is less likely to incur a casualty. Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska undocks from a dry dock at Puget Sound Navy Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility on March 8, 2016., USN Cleanliness on a ship is a safety issue. This cannot be stressed enough. Dust accumulated is tinder. Oiled rags in an unventilated pile can react chemically and can eventually begin to burn. Workspaces must be inspected after work is complete by a supervisory element. This often falls on the Chief Petty Officer responsible for the area. It’s about enforcing a command policy that requires shipyard personnel to check out with the duty section when their work is complete. It’s about taking the time to ensure a clean, safe ship environment. This has been the Nuclear Navy’s standard for decades. Nuclear-powered Nimitz class supercarriers birthed at Naval Base Coronado across from downtown San Diego. , USN The Nuclear Navy is held to an exceedingly high standard, from construction to maintenance to operation, both at sea and during shipyard periods. These practices are reviewed annually by an Operational Reactor Safety Examination inspection team that includes performance standards by the entire crew. The ship itself must meet the Naval Reactors ORSE standard to operate. This demands a culture of high performance and cleanliness that results in fewer fires, or other catastrophes, and a timely response when something goes wrong. Perhaps, after the Bonhomme Richard disaster, it is time to hold the entire Navy to Naval Reactors’ standards for crew performance, cleanliness, and preservation of our fighting capability. In the event of catastrophic fire or flooding, the nuclear power plant cannot be abandoned . We must not fail. Let’s bring this attitude to the entire service.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it recently wrapped up a series of tests involving a prototype low-cost cruise missile developed under a program called Gray Wolf . This comes as the service is also working toward starting flight testing of networked swarming munitions as part of a separate project known as Golden Horde . The 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base in California announced the completion of the latest round of Gray Wolf tests on July 14, 2020. Air Force personnel conducted both Electromagnetic Interference and Compatibility (EMIC) testing on the ground and captive carry flight tests using an F-16C Viper fighter jet from the 416th Flight Test Squadron. “The EMIC check is ground check to confirm the missile is okay to fly on our specific test aircraft,” Conor Most, a Flight Test Engineer with the 416th explained in an official interview. “A captive-carry flight is the first flight with the weapon; the goal is to rehearse the weapon flight profile and gather critical state/environmental data about the weapon.” Members from the Gray Wolf test team and personnel from the 416th Flight Test Squadron stand behind a prototype Gray Wolf missile ahead of a captive-carry flight test. , USAF “Getting the weapon airborne and gathering data is crucial to the development for a new weapon system like this,” he continued. “With just one captive carry flight, the team learned more than in weeks or months of laboratory testing. Modeling and simulation go a long way to helping you predict how a new weapon will behave, but they will never replace actually putting the weapon on an aircraft and observing how it actually behaves in a real-world environment.” One of the 416th’s F-16Cs with an experimental Gray Wolf missile under its left wing., USAF USAF The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is leading the Gray Wolf program, had previously announced the successful completion of a series of tests of the low-cost Technical Directions Inc. (TDI) TDI-J85 turbojet engine that is set to power these experimental weapons in March. TDI is a division of drone-maker Kratos. A TDI-J85 turbojet engine., TDI All of this is building toward a planned live flight test of one of the missiles, which Northrop Grumman has developed in cooperation with Griffon Aerospace, on the Naval Air Station Point Mugu Sea Test Range off the coast of southern California by the end of the Summer. AFRL initiated Gray Wolf, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , in 2017 to demonstrate the feasibility of an air-launched cruise missile that would be very low-cost and highly fuel-efficient when compared to similar existing weapons, such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) series. Increased fuel efficiency could translate to increased stand-off range, valuable in an era of ever-improving air defenses among potential adversaries. It would also allow a missile to use less fuel to reach certain distances, freeing up space inside a weapon for larger warheads, improved guidance systems and seekers, or other features, all without increasing its form factor. This could be very valuable for designs intended for stealthy aircraft , which need to carry their ordnance internally to maximize their radar-evading capabilities. Lowering the unit costs of cruise missiles could be absolutely critical in the future, as well. The Air Force expects to pay, on average, $1.266 million for each JASSM, regardless of variant, in the 2021 Fiscal Year, according to the service’s most recent budget request . This could easily make a mass cruise missile strike prohibitively expensive, especially during any major future conflict. These costs concerns are only magnified when considering the Air Force’s desire to field large swarms of autonomous networked munitions in the future. AFRL has already used the Gray Wolf project to explore initial concepts in this regard and it will help inform the Golden Horde program . In 2019, the service announced it was canceling additional phases of Gray Wolf specifically in order to shift resources to Golden Horde. Golden Horde, another AFRL-led effort, is working to develop artificial intelligence-driven systems that could potentially go into various types of munitions, as well as other air-launched stores, that will allow them to work together as an autonomous swarm. On July 13, 2020, Defense News reported that the Air Force was looking to begin flight testing of the first experimental munition developed under this project, a modified GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), dubbed the Collaborative Small Diameter Bomb 1 (CSDB-1), by the end of this year. An F-16 is expected to carry the CSDB-1s during those tests. The goal is then to move on to tests of a modified ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), referred to as the Collaborative Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (CMALD). A B-52 bomber is set to be the test launch platform for those networked decoys. ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoys (MALD) under the wing of a US Air Force B-52 bomber., Raytheon “With all the talk about artificial intelligence and other things in ‘ Terminator ‘ movies … [there’s] certainly some trepidation of what independent capability a weapon may have,” Air Force Colonel Garry Hasse, head of AFRL’s Munitions Directorate, told Defense News . “[Mission planners] would give information to the weapon on an appropriate engagement zone, where it would be considered proper for the weapon to engage targets … and they would give the weapons information on known targets in that zone,” Norma Taylor, the Golden Horde Program manager, also explained to Defense News . “But if they have some idea that there might be other targets out there that they don’t know, they will give the weapon some information in terms of priorities, so that if you come across a higher-priority target that’s in the authorized engagement zone, then you have permission to change your assignment.” Technologies to enable increased autonomy in various systems , combined with developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning , is a steadily expanding field of interest broadly within the Air Force, as well as across the U.S. military as a whole . You can read more about potential autonomous concepts of operation for munitions, as well as unmanned aircraft, in this past War Zone feature. “One of the important aspects of the networking aspect of the technology is the ability to send information to the weapon while it’s in flight and give it a new mission download, so to speak,” she continued. “But the important thing is to realize that whether it’s preprogrammed in mission planning or whether it’s a mission update to your flight, the operators are still required to provide the weapon those rules of engagement are on, where they can and can’t engage, and what their mission priorities are.” Of course, Golden Horde isn’t expected to be limited to munitions carrying out kinetic strikes. The swarms could also include other air-launched stores, including decoys, such as the CMALD, which could carry electronic warfare packages to jam or otherwise confuse enemy air defenders, potentially drawing their attention away from a main line of attack or otherwise spreading their forces thin across a wide area. The Air Force hopes to test CSDB-1s and CMALDs together in 2022. Updated mission instructions and associated data, including targeting information, could potentially come from a wide variety of sources, including aircraft, ships , forces on the ground , and even assets in space , as well. It’s possible that ultimately a portion of the swarm itself might be configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and be able to feed data to other munitions or air-launched stores. Colonel Hasse said that there is a goal for the Golden Horde munitions to eventually be able to leverage the Air Force’s separate plans for an expanded, overarching, multi-faceted network architecture known as the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . It’s not clear what systems developed under Golden Horde may actually become operational. It, just like Gray Wolf before it, is more of a technology demonstration effort intended to serve as a stepping stone to a future operational capability. “I don’t know [that it’s] specifically a collaborative SDB that we’ll transition into the inventory,” AFRL’s Taylor said. “I think more it’s a matter of looking at some of the plays and the networking capabilities and the collaboration capabilities that could be put into other systems.” With a live flight test planned for Gray Wolf in the near future and flight testing of the CSBD-1 set to kick off within months, we shouldn’t have to wait much longer to see what exciting progress the Air Force has made toward low-cost cruise missiles and autonomous swarms of munitions.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Apr 9, 2021",South Korea Has Already Started A Search For New Airborne Early Warning Radar Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The South Korean Air Force has formally kick-started a long-expected search for a new airborne early warning and control aircraft. It’s part of an overarching effort to dramatically enhance the country’s intelligence, surveillance, targeting, and reconnaissance capabilities. Seoul is especially concerned over gaps in its aerial surveillance coverage amid increasing security threats from neighboring countries that threaten its Korean Air Defense Identification Zone. The Defense Project Promotion Committee approved the airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) acquisition plan on June 26, 2020, for an undisclosed number of new aircraft, as well as for a partnering signals intelligence (SIGINT) capability. A statement from South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) indicated that a domestic solution had been discounted and that a direct acquisition would be made by 2027 under a project dubbed AEW&C II, with an attached $1.32 billion-budget that will kick-in next year. South Korea first identified an emerging airborne early warning requirement as long ago as 1980, which it deemed necessary due to the country’s topography. This limits the performance of ground-based radar stations. It took until 2005 for the country to launch E-X, which put the Boeing 737 AEW&C aircraft up against a U.S.-Israeli consortium of Gulfstream, L-3 and Israel Aircraft Industries/Elta offering the Gulfstream G550 Conformal AEW (CAEW) . Despite the attraction of low acquisition and through-life costs, South Korea was unable to proceed with the G550 due to export restrictions and the Boeing 737-based offer was selected by default in August 2006. The resulting $1.6-billion Peace Eye project included four aircraft that recieved the local designation E-737. The first of these was constructed and missionized by Boeing in Seattle, Washington, with Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) carrying out equipment installations on the remaining three examples in Saechon, South Korea. Deliveries were completed on Oct. 24, 2012. South Korea ordered four E-737s under the Peace Eye deal, with deliveries completed in 2012., Boeing While many reports on the new AEW&C requirement have suggested that Seoul will simply order two more E-737s, there have been a number of domestic reports detailing disappointment with the Boeing aircraft. In October 2019, the South Korean daily newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported on a South Korean Air Force document that had been submitted to the Korean parliamentary National Defense Committee. It cited “frequent failures” in the period from 2015 to September 2019 that meant the E-737s had failed to meet a targeted availability rate of 75%. This lack of airframes reportedly exposed gaps in South Korea’s air defense coverage network due to aircraft being unavailable to maintain constant patrols. This is of particular concern because the E-737 is considered to be one of South Korea’s primary indigenous means of monitoring North Korean missile activity. The aircraft is also key for detecting low-flying targets and those will small radar signatures , which are a big threat to South Korea. With the announcement of a budget and a timeline, AEW&C II is now very much a live program. Korea will next decide whether to go with a straight Foreign Military Sale (FMS) deal for two more Peace Eye E-737s or launch a competitive tender. The Royal Australian Air Force also operates six 737 AEW&Cs, known locally as E-7A Wedgetails, the deliveries of which were completed on May 2, 2012, after a succession of delays mainly related to mission system integration. It is already heavily-invested in significant upgrades for its E-7s under Project AIR 5077 5A, which will, amongst other things, improve the type’s combat identification capabilities, add new data links, plus new wide-band satellite communications. Seoul has not taken up Boeing’s offers of a similar upgrade for its aircraft, despite them being broadly similar to the Wedgetails in overall configuration, except for a local electronic support measures (ESM) suite. A Royal Australian Air Force mission crew at work in an E-7A Wedgetail., Australian Defence Force/Wg Cdr Paul Carpenter In addition, despite positive operational reports, and the comprehensive upgrade project, Australia’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update and Force Structure Plan, released on July 1, revealed a rather surprising statement regarding the Wedgetails: “To protect the joint force, the Government will continue to invest in support and upgrades for the E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft, as well as the development and support of a joint air battle management system to better coordinate and synchronise ADF operations. In addition, plans for the E-7A replacement will now involve increasing the fleet to provide greater coverage of the highly-complex future air and joint-battlefield environment that will include a proliferation of autonomous systems and long-range and high-speed weapons.” Australia’s E-7A Wedgetail Replacement was an unexpected inclusion, particularly so soon after upgrade of the existing platform. However, finding a replacement will not be a quick process. It may look at what options are available to realize its ambition to afford an expanded fleet of platforms. This could also potentially involve an aim for greater range from its AEW&C aircraft to hold potential adversaries at risk from a greater distance. However, it makes stark reading for the United Kingdom, which has recently started down the path of replacing the Royal Air Force’s fleet of E-3D Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft with five new Wedgetails under an almost $2-billion deal with Boeing. The contract was announced on Mar. 22, 2019, with an aggressive timeline for delivery, with the first aircraft arriving in 2023. The United Kingdom heralded the decision as involving a significant partnership with Australia. Boeing has to date secured four customers for the 737 AEW&C, Australia, Korea, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The design has, significantly, received little public interest domestically from the U.S. Air Force. Signs of mission readiness shortfalls in Korea coupled with Australia’s announcement that it might replace its Wedgetails have inevitably turned attention towards other AEW&C candidate platforms that could compete to upset the Boeing platform’s success in the region. Saab is offering two of its GlobalEye aircraft for the South Korean requirement., Saab Saab is offering its GlobalEye Swing Role Surveillance System (SRSS) to South Korea, of which the first aircraft was delivered to its launch customer the United Arab Emirates Air Force on April 29. The GlobalEye combines Saab’s Erieye Extended Range (ER) radar and a range of additional advanced sensors, now offered in a missionized, long-range Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft in place of the original Global 6000, which is no longer manufactured. IAI is also in the mix with a derivative of its CAEW system . Although unconfirmed, it’s widely expected that Korea will purchase two additional AEW&C aircraft to complement the existing Peace Eyes to improve its border coverage. Seoul was unable to participate in extensive integration work on its initial E-737s and Saab is likely to be dangling the carrot of substantial incentives to domestic industry through the transfer of technology and integration work, which is seen as a key differentiator over a straight FMS deal for more E-737s. Saab says the GlobalEye would be able to neatly operate alongside the Peace Eyes, with the Erieye’s S-Band gallium-nitride radar complementing the E-737’s L-Band radar. Israel Aircraft Industries and Elta was at the forefront of efforts to pair Airborne Early Warning and Control solutions with business jets, such as the Gulfstream 550., IAI Importantly, the 737 AEW&C is not an active production program, and Boeing would need to source airframes and select an integrator for the mission systems if Korea opted for additional E-737s. In comparison, the RAF is buying at least two secondhand commercial airliners for its Wedgetail program. Marshall Aerospace, which was to have acted as the systems integrator, withdrew from the project in March due to “commercial considerations.” Boeing subsequently announced that STS Aviation Services was to assume the conversion work when the first airframes arrive later this year. In the meantime, Korea is examining its options on whether to stick with the E-737 or launch a formal competition. The latter would bring Saab and IAI Into the frame for a fascinating shoot-out for a prized competition in a market that could have huge implications for others looking at airborne early warning options.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 14, 2020",Navy Says At Least One Fire Continues To Burn On The USS Bonhomme Richard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck, head of Expeditionary Strike Group Three, says that the USS Bonhomme Richard is stable and structurally safe despite a still ongoing fire onboard the Wasp class amphibious assault ship. The vessel has now been burning continuously for more than 48 hours now and has produced sustained temperatures of at least 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. Sobeck addressed reporters at Naval Base San Diego, where the Bonhomme Richard is still pier-side, on July 14, 2020, during his third press conference in as many days. He was joined by the commanding officer of the base, Navy Captain Mark Nieswiadomy, Navy Region Southwest Environmental Director Jason Golumbfskie-Jones, head of Coast Sector San Diego Captain Timothy Barelli, and Federal Fire San Diego Chief Mary Anderson. You can get fully up to speed on how the fire has developed and the state of the Bonhomme Richard in The War Zone ‘s previous rolling coverage of this situation. The key new details from this latest press conference are: The ship is stable and the structure is safe. No major damage to the ship’s four main engineering spaces. No threat to the ship’s fuel tanks at present. The fuel tanks are well below any of the remaining active fires or heat sources, so any risk to them at this point is low. The ship has salt water-filled compensation tanks that also help keep the fuel tanks cool. There is at least one active fire in a forward area of the ship. Firefighters had been unable to get to those spaces until today. There is another heat source that could be another fire aft. These two areas are isolated from each other. Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Three (HSC-3), based at nearby Naval Air Station North Island, has conducted more than 1,200 water bucket drops, in total. In addition to other external firefighting operations, these drops have been essential in allowing firefighters to actually get on the ship. 61 personnel have been injured, in total, so far, 38 sailors and 23 civilians. None of those individuals are hospitalized. An explosion occurred while the crew was securing the space where the initial fire had broken out before they could safely energize the fire suppression system. The fire spread rapidly from the front to the rear of the ship. Navy is working with San Diego authorities to step up monitoring of potential adverse environmental impacts. Coast Guard is prepared to respond to any potential environmental issues, including an oil spill. No visible evidence of oil spill at present. Hope that all fires will be out within the next 24 hours. Too early to tell the full extent of the damage. The Navy’s position that the ship, which has been visibly listing , is stable and structurally sound is a significant and positive development. There had been concerns that areas that had been exposed to persistent temperatures in excess of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit could be compromised. Still, the pictures that have already emerged online show significant internal damage, as well as to the flight deck and superstructure. It will take the Navy a not-insignificant amount of time to just conduct a full damage assessment. The situation certainly continues to be serious, as well, even as the remaining fires are increasingly under control. Of the 61 injuries, two occurred just overnight. Thankfully, the pair of Navy sailors did not need to be hospitalized. The Navy had also earlier announced that five sailors who had been in the hospital after suffering minor injuries after the fire broke out on July 12 had been released. They were the last of a group of 17 who had needed more serious medical attention. The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation, but the Navy had previously said that it began in Bonhomme Richard ‘s lower vehicle storage area, where large amounts of cardboard, rags, drywall, and other flammable material had been present as part of maintenance on the ship. That work also meant that many of the spaces were full of debris and other obstacles, which made the firefighters’ jobs harder, as well. “There’s plastics that go around cabling, those kind of things, there’s different rags, there’s all the things that are used to kind of maintain the ship, clean the ship … and so right now we’re testing and we’re checking everything that we know, and we’re within EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] standards,” Rear Admiral Sobeck had told reporters yesterday , also addressing potential environmental concerns. The San Diego Air Pollution Control District has advised local residents to stay indoors, if possible , to avoid potential exposure to pollutants. “A one-nautical mile temporary flight-restriction zone from surface to 3,000 feet altitude has been established to maintain the safety of all firefighting aircraft,” U.S. Coast Guard Commander Chris Wright, the head of the response department at Coast Guard Sector San Diego, said in a statement on July 13, according to Defense News . “Neighboring marinas are also currently being advised to utilize protective safety measures.” The Coast Guard “continues to assess environmental sensitivities and has contracted an Oil Spill Response Organization to preemptively deploy a protective boom to guard against any potential environmental concerns,” Wight added. Bonhomme Richard had approximately one million gallons of fuel onboard when the fire started. The Navy said yesterday that the blaze was just two decks away from the ship’s fuel tanks. While the Navy has not yet declared whether it believes the ship to be a total loss, if it is unable to repair the ship and return it to service, it could impact the service’s ability to respond to various contingencies. Including Bonhomme Richard , the Navy presently has eight Wasp class amphibious assault ships . It also has two newer America class amphibious assault ships , including the USS Tripoli , which is the first example a distinct subclass. This category of ships forms the core of the Navy’s Amphibious Ready Groups, which, together with embarked U.S. Marine Corps expeditionary units , sometimes with significant airpower in the form of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , are constantly patrolling or otherwise postured around the world. It is worth noting that the Marine Corps is now exploring new concepts operations that do not necessarily involve the use of traditional large amphibious warfare ships . It remains to be seen exactly what will become of the Bonhomme Richard , but the Navy is clearly still hopeful that the ship will be salvageable at the end of the day. Navy sailors and civilian firefighters stand at attention for reveille at Naval Base San Diego as the USS Bonhomme Richard continues to burn in the background., USN We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Many people regard the F-14 Tomcat as the coolest jet the U.S. Navy ever flew and a video clip making the rounds online only helps to endorse that feeling. Few fighter aircraft stir the emotions like the big Grumman fighter , even though the type was retired from American service nearly 14 years ago. This footage, seen below, that has surfaced on Twitter is pure aviation gold and it captures an incredible moment as an F-14D makes a close, high speed, pass to overtake another Tomcat, possibly the flight leader or wingman. The jet’s wings are fully swept for a very high-speed pass followed by a sharp crossing maneuver. The clip is a particularly dynamic moment from the final cruise video made by Navy Fighter Squadron 31 (VF-31), the “Tomcatters,” filmed during the final weeks of Navy F-14 operations in 2006. The full video, which is well worth watching, is available below. The aircraft in the video clip on Twitter is BuNo 164603, which was first delivered on May 29, 1992, to Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124), the “Gunfighters,” but ended its flying career as “Bandwagon 101” in a specially-painted retro scheme with VF-31.

Details are very limited at this time, but an F-16 flying out of Holloman Air Force base located near the town of Alamagordo, New Mexico, crashed during landing. The good news is the pilot ejected and survived, but is being treated for injuries that are supposed to be fairly minor. A press release from the 49th Wing’s Facebook page reads: A U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper assigned to the 49th Wing crashed during landing at Holloman AFB at approximately 1800 MDT today. The sole pilot on board successfully ejected, and is currently being treated for minor injuries. Emergency response teams are on scene at this time. An investigation conducted by aboard of qualified officers is underway to determine the cause of the incident. Additional details will be released as they become available. F-16s belonging to the 49th Wing are used to train Viper pilots. The incident is one in a troubling string of crashes over the last two months. Just 12 days ago, another USAF F-16 crashed at Shaw AFB during landing. The pilot died in that incident. In the six weeks prior to the Shaw crash, the Air Force lost an F-15C and its pilot, as well as an F-35A and an F-22A . Major mishaps also occurred involving a C-130 and another F-35A .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck addressed reporters at 11:00 AM local time in San Diego to provide new information on the ongoing fire aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6) that has now burned continuously for 27 hours. The press conference follows a terrible night for the ship, which saw the fire expand to its bridge and greater island superstructure, partially melting its upper forward portion. The ship now lists at the pier as firefighting efforts continue at a frantic pace from both the air and the ground. Before we continue, make sure to catch up with the situation via our previous rolling coverage linked here. With that said, here are the main takeaways from the press conference: It is thought that two decks separate the fire from the ship’s fuel reserves. The Admiral says the Navy is doing everything they can to make sure it doesn’t migrate there. No welding was reported in the area of the fire when it broke out. At least significant parts of the automated halon firefighting systems were offline at the time of the fire. Enhanced pier-side fire watch readiness posture was supposedly in place. 415 Bambi Buckets of water have been dropped on the ship by three MH-60S Seahawks from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Three (HSC-3) based out of nearby Naval Air Station North Island. 160 people were on the ship when the fire began. 400 sailors are now involved with fighting the fire aboard the ship. The area where the fire started, which was the lower vehicle storage area, was filled with cardboard, rags, drywall, and other combustible material. The fire is producing temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees. Extreme heat in and under the island and in the bow. There is a list that they are trying to correct via dewatering as part of a larger balancing act of keeping the ship stable while also fighting the fire Five remain hospitalized and in stable condition out of 57 that have been treated at the hospital. There is burn damage throughout the skin of the ship. Due to the ship undergoing maintenance, there is debris scattered throughout the passageways of the ship making it challenging to safely fight the fire. There are no plans to let the ship burn down to the waterline. The Admiral is not aware of the fire being in the ship’s critical engineering spaces. Crews are keeping a close eye on the environmental air quality and so far it has been within EPA limits. Here are some recent screencaps of the ship.

Joseph Trevithick and Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Jul 2, 2020",Here Is Our First Look At One Of Boeing’s New F-15EX Eagle Fighter Jets For The Air Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has released the first picture of one of its new Boeing F-15EX Eagle fighter jets now under construction. This coincides with the service awarding the Chicago-headquartered plane maker a contract worth nearly $23 billion for work on these jets, $1.2 billion of which will go to the delivery of the first lot of eight aircraft . The Air Force announced the deal on July 13, 2020. Additional information about the contract was also included in the Pentagon’s daily contracting notice . The full contracting announcement from the Pentagon is as follows: “The Boeing Co., St. Louis, Missouri, has been awarded a $22,890,000,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract (FA8634-20-D-2704).  The first delivery order has been awarded as an undefinitized contract action with a total not-to-exceed value, including options, of $1,192,215,413.  It is a cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price-incentive-fee, firm-fixed-price effort for the F-15EX system.  This delivery order (FA8634-20-F-0022) provides for design, development, integration, manufacturing, test, verification, certification, delivery, sustainment and modification of F-15EX aircraft, as well as spares, support equipment, training materials, technical data and technical support.  Work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri; and at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and is expected to be completed Dec. 31, 2023.  This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition.  Fiscal 2020 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $248,224,746; and fiscal 2020 aircraft procurement funds in the amount of $53,000,000 are being obligated at the time of award.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is the contracting activity.” Congress approved funding for a total of eight F-15EX’s in the Fiscal Year 2020 defense budget. The aircraft that is seen in the picture that the Air Force has now released shows that it carries the serial number 20-0001, indicating that it is the very first aircraft that the service has purchased in this current fiscal cycle. A second example is also under construction, according to Boeing. The Air Force has requested money to buy an additional 12 aircraft in the 2021 Fiscal Year and hopes to purchase a total of 76 F-15EXs over the five-year Future Years Defense Program. The service’s full F-15EX fleet could eventually comprise 144 jets. The Pentagon’s contracting notice notably makes no specific mention about the procurement of engines for any of these aircraft. On June 30, the Air Force awarded a separate contract to General Electric for an unspecified number of F110-GE-129 engines to power at least some of the initial batch of F-15EXs, citing an “unusual and compelling urgency.” The Air Force had planned to power all of its F-15EXs with F110-GE-129s, but is now preparing to hold an open competition to select an engine type after it became apparent that Pratt & Whitney would protest any sole-source award to General Electric. Pratt & Whitney is expected to submit its F100-PW-229 engine as an alternative. You can read more about the issues surrounding the selection of the F-15EX’s engines in this recent War Zone piece . An artist’s conception of a pair of F-15EXs., Boeing “The F-15EX is the most affordable and immediate way to refresh the capacity and update the capabilities provided by our aging F-15C/D fleets,” General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, also said. “The F-15EX is ready to fight as soon as it comes off the line.” “When delivered, we expect bases currently operating the F-15 to transition to the new EX platform in a matter of months versus years,” he added. “Pilots and mechanics currently operating the F-15 anticipate transitioning to the F-15EX in a matter of days as opposed to years,” Boeing said in its press release. The first eight F-15EX aircraft will be based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, and they will initially support testing efforts. The delivery of the first two aircraft is scheduled for the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2021, which begins on Jan. 1, 2021. The remaining six aircraft are scheduled to arrive in the 2023 Fiscal Year. The Air Force is using the Strategic Basing Process to determine the fielding locations for subsequent aircraft lots. “We are capable of delivering two jets by the end of 2020 assuming a timely contract award,” Prat Kumar, Boeing’s Vice President and Program Manager for F-15, had said in December. While the 2020 Fiscal Year defense budget had given the Air Force the funding that it had sought for the first F-15EXs, the subsequent Appropriations Act that Congress passed stipulated that the service could only procure two F-15EX prototypes plus long-lead items associated with the remaining six fighters until a report detailing its acquisition, test and evaluation, logistics, and post-production fielding strategies – along with cost and schedule estimates – had been submitted to the House and Senate defense committees. Boeing “The F-15EX is the most advanced version of the F-15 ever built, due in large part to its digital backbone,” Lori Schneider, Boeing’s F-15EX Program Manager said in a statement regarding the new contract award. “Its unmatched range, price, and best-in-class payload capacity make the F-15EX an attractive choice for the U.S. Air Force.” A key difference between the F-15EXs and the older F-15C/Ds they are slated to replace lies in the former’s Open Mission Systems (OMS) architecture. The OMS architecture will enable the rapid insertion of the latest aircraft technologies. The F-15EX will also have fly-by-wire flight controls, a new electronic warfare system, advanced cockpit systems, and the latest mission systems and software capabilities available for legacy F-15s. You can read more about the F-15EX and its capabilities in these past War Zone pieces . US Air Forces F-15C Eagles., USAF “The F-15EX’s digital backbone, open mission systems, and generous payload capacity fit well with our vision for future net-enabled warfare,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics said. “Continually upgrading systems, and how they share data across the Joint Force, is critical for defeating advanced threats. F-15EX is designed to evolve from day one.” In addition to simply being a replacement for the Air Force’s existing F-15C/Ds, the F-15EX will also be able to act as a weapon truck and be able to carry the kind of large hypersonic weapons that are in development, but that will not fit inside a fifth-generation fighter weapons bay. This is something Boeing specifically highlighted in its press release regarding the new Air Force contract. “The F-15EX carries more weapons than any other fighter in its class and can launch hypersonic weapons up to 22 feet long and weighing up to 7,000 pounds,” the statement said. With the heavy emphasis on its OMS architecture, the Pentagon is also using the F-15EX as a “pathfinder” program for its “ DevSecOps Initiative , aimed at developing secure, flexible and agile software,” Boeing said. All told, the F-15EXs, the first two of which Boeing is building now, promise to bring new and impressive capabilities to the Air Force in the coming years. NOTE: There is conflicting information about whether the photo at the top of this story is actually of an F-15EX. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has the same photograph in their report with the following caption: “F-15EX decals affixed to F-15QA4 jet in Building 67, Final Assembly_St. Louis, MO. Purpose of the photo is to show aircraft readiness to our USAF customer (F-15EX contract award). MSF20-0024 Series.” However, an official Boeing Tweet features this picture and also says “We’ve already begun construction of the first two #F15EX jets.” In addition, the Air Force’s official news item on the new contract includes this photo, but does not say one way or another whether it shows an F-15EX. We have reached out to Boeing for clarification. NOTE 2: Boeing has confirmed to The War Zone that this picture shows F-15EX-1, the first F-15EX for the U.S. Air Force, under construction.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 25, 2020",First KC-10 Extender Tanker Jet Heads To The Boneyard For Retirement (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is sending a KC-10A Extender tanker to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for the first time ever. This comes just a day after the 40th anniversary of the type’s first flight. The retirement also comes amid a brewing battle between the service and Congress over its aerial refueling tanker plans given persistent problems with its new KC-46A Pegasuses . The public affairs office for the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, the unit that manages the Pentagon’s aircraft boneyard in Tucson, Arizona confirmed to The War Zone that it is expecting a KC-10A to arrive today, July 13, 2020, but that it has not yet arrived. The 309th was unable to confirm the serial number of the aircraft or the unit that is sending it into retirement, but it is reportedly tail 86-0036 from the 305th Air Mobility Wing at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. We have reached out to that base’s public affairs office for more information, as well, but have not yet heard back. If the aircraft does arrive today, as expected, it will have gone to the boneyard four decades and one day after the KC-10A, derived from the DC-10-30CF airliner, flew for the first time at McDonnell Douglas’ plant in Long Beach, California on July 12, 1980. The Air Force had picked the KC-10A as the winning design for its Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program three years earlier. It beat out proposals for tankers based on Boeing’s 747 and Lockheed’s L-1011 TriStar airliner and C-5 Galaxy transport plane . A KC-10A seen at the Paris Air Show in 1981., Acroterion/Wikicommons The Air Force acquired the KC-10As as heavy tankers to supplement the KC-135 family and with an eye toward buying a design it could field relatively quickly to provide important additional tanker capacity, especially in regards to refueling large fully laden transports flying over great distances. The KC-10A, which first entered Air Force service in 1981, has an 88 percent commonality with the DC-10-30CF. The aircraft’s additional fuel tanks, which can hold up to 356,000 pounds of aviation fuel, nearly double that of the KC-135, are installed in what would’ve been the baggage compartments in the lower portion of the fuselage on the standard airliner DC-10 variant. A KC-10A supports the 1985 iteration of Exercise Bright Star in Egypt., DOD Unlike the KC-135, the KC-10A also has an integrated hose-and-drogue system , in addition to its boom, which can refuel aircraft that use that refueling method, such as those from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. This arrangement presents fewer risks to both the tanker and the receiving aircraft compared to the hose-and-drogue system that attaches to the boom on the KC-135. Some KC-135s now have wingtip hose and drogue refueling pods, as well. It’s worth noting that, in addition to aerial refueling, the KC-10As also have a cargo-carrying mission . The Extenders are capable of carrying a wide variety of cargoes, including light vehicles, such as Humvees. Tyler Rogoway The Air Force ultimately bought 60 KC-10As, 59 of which remain in service today. The service lost the 60th aircraft after it suffered an explosion and subsequent fire while undergoing maintenance at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana in 1987, which killed one of the individuals working on that tanker at the time. The Dutch Air Force also received two similar KDC-10 aircraft . The youngest Air Force Extenders are now over 30 years old and the Air Force has been looking at options for replacing them for years now. The aircraft have been showing their age. In May 2018, smoke on the flight deck of a KC-10A assigned to the 305th Air Mobility Wing forced the crew to evacuate . Their aircraft’s escape slides failed to activate during that incident, exposing a separate fault in that safety system across the entire fleet. The Air Force had initially planned to hold a competition to select a replacement specifically for the Extenders, referred to as KC-Y, after selecting Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus , originally referred to as KC-X, to replace the KC-135s. It subsequently decided to supplant at least a portion of the KC-10A fleet with KC-46As. A KC-10A refuels a KC-46A while a KC-135R flies in the foreground., USAF In its most recent budget request, for the 2021 Fiscal Year, the Air Force announced plans to retire 16 KC-10As, along with 13 KC-135s, in the coming year. The service has since backed away from this proposal in the face of significant backlash from Congress , as well as from within the U.S. military itself . A key issue is that the KC-46A program has been dogged by a host of major quality control and technical issues, especially with the plane’s Remote Vision System (RVS), over the years. Unlike in previous tankers, where an individual would lie at the rear of the aircraft and visually observe the situation while manipulating the refueling boom into receiving aircraft, boom operators in the KC-46A use the RVS to do this remotely from the plane’s main cabin. The existing RVS has proven to be difficult and potentially dangerous to operate under certain circumstances and the Air Force has said that it will not use the KC-46As for day-to-day refueling activities, in combat or elsewhere, until Boeing implements a fix. The goal is for Boeing to have finished the development and testing of the new RVS by 2023. You can read more about this saga in these past War Zone pieces . The type also has an integrated hose and drogue system, like the KC-10, that can refuel Navy and Marine Corps aircraft without the same risk issues. A view of the boom operator stations in the KC-46A and the Remote Vision System that they use., USAF The service has now pushed back making a decision about approving the start of full-rate production of the Pegasuses until at least 2024, with the hope that the improved RVS will be ready by then. It’s unclear how long it will take to integrate the fix into the more than 30 KC-46As the Air Force will have already received by then. As it stands now, the Senate is looking add a provision to the next annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, to force the delay of any tanker retirement plans until the RVS issues are resolved. It’s not clear how this might impact the Air Fore’s plans to send the KC-10As to the boneyard, which are already in progress now. AMARG adjacent to Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. , US Navy U.S. Transportation Command, by way of the Air Force’s Air Mobility Command, is also exploring options for hiring contractors to provide important additional tanker capacity. One of the options that Air Mobility Command has been considering is the sale or lease of tankers from U.S. military stocks, such as the boneyard at Davis-Monthan, to private companies, who would then operate them under contract with the U.S. military. The influx of KC-10As would add to a number of KC-135s already at the boneyard. Private aerial refueling firm Omega Air has already bought the two KDC-10s from the Dutch Air Force, which retired them in favor of new Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transports (MRTT). A KDC-10 refuels an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter., Omega Air It is worth noting that private companies that the Air Force has consulted with about these plans rejected the idea of buying or leasing aircraft from the U.S. government. It’s unclear exactly why this was the case, but there were significant potential legal and regulatory hurdles to the proposal. You can read more about that proposal, as well as the others the Air Force has been exploring, in detail in this past War Zone story . What is clear is that the Air Force is moving ahead with its plans to retire at least some KC-10As in the near future, at least until Congress orders them to stop. USAF Update: 3:10 PM EST— Flight tracking data available from ADS-B Exchange shows that KC-10A, serial number 86-0036, has touched down at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base after leaving Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, further indicating that it is indeed the first Extender to head to the boneyard.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",Trump Says He’s Working To Get 10 More Icebreakers For The Coast Guard From “A Certain Place”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump says his Administration is working to secure 10 icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard. He also claimed that these ships would be cheaper to acquire than that service’s future Polar Security Cutters , a new class of heavy icebreakers, the first of which is now under construction. This comes just over a month after Trump ordered the Coast Guard to review its existing icebreaker plans and to look into the possibility of buying or leasing additional ice-capable ships, including nuclear-powered types. Trump made these comments in a speech during a visit to U.S. Southern Command’s headquarters in Doral, Florida, just outside Miami, on July 10, 2020. You can watch his full remarks in the video in the Tweet below. The icebreaker-specific portion begins at around 6:00 in the runtime. “We’ve approved the two new state-of-the-art National Security Cutters and two Polar Security Cutters for the United States Coast Guard,” Trump said. “We have under construction right now the largest icebreaker in the world and we’re going to be trying to get, if we can, an extra 10 icebreakers.” “We only have one. Russia has 40. We have one,” he continued. “So, we will have two, but we think we’ll have 10.” At present, the U.S. Coast Guard actually has two operational icebreakers, the heavy icebreaker USCGC Polar Star and the medium icebreaker USCGC Healy . Polar Star ‘s sister ship Polar Sea remains in the service’s inventory, but in an inactive state, primarily as a source of spare parts. The Polar Star is aging and has been increasingly prone to serious breakdowns in recent years. Healy , while newer, is still over 20 years old now and is also simply smaller and less capable when it comes to busting through thick ice on the water. The USCGC Polar Star , the Coast Guard’s only active heavy icebreaker., USCG In April 2019, the U.S. Navy announced that it had hired VT Halter Marine, on behalf of the Coast Guard, to build the first new Polar Security Cutter. The initial contract was valued at nearly $746 million. The ship is expected to have a displacement of around 33,000 tons with a full load. This is roughly the same displacement as Russia’s future nuclear-powered Project 22220 icebreakers , the first three of which are now in the final stages of construction . The Polar Security Cutters are set to be some of, if not the largest conventionally-powered icebreakers in the world. An artist’s conception of the Coast Guard’s future Polar Security Cutter., VT Halter Marine The Russian government intends to build at least five Project 22220 icebreakers and has other ice-capable ships under construction, as well. At present, it does have around 40 icebreakers in service and in the works, in total. The disparity between the size of the Kremlin’s icebreaking fleets and those of the Coast Guard has become an increasingly pronounced issue for the U.S. government in recent years, especially as geopolitical competition in the Arctic region has grown. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ipeFgaPMP8Q Even with 10 more icebreakers, the United States would trail significantly behind Russia in total fleet size. Still, it would represent a huge increase in American icebreaking capacity compared to what the Coast Guard has now. Trump did not say specifically where the U.S. government would acquire these additional icebreakers from and whether it would do so through an outright purchase or some other type of arrangement, such as a lease deal. “We’re trying to do a deal with a certain place that has a lot of icebreakers and we’re seeing if we can make a really good deal where you can have them very fast,” the President said cryptically. “We’re working on it and I think we can surprise you at a very good price, which will be nice,” he continued. “Much cheaper than the one we’re building and that’s also nice.” This would all seem to indicate Trump is talking about the potential to buy or lease existing ships. This was something that the President alluded to in his Arctic memorandum , which focused heavily on icebreaking, in June. “In anticipation of the USCGC Polar Star ‘s operational degradation from Fiscal Years 2022-2029, an analysis to identify executable options, with associated costs, to bridge the gap of available vessels as early as Fiscal Year 2022 until the new PSCs required to meet the objectives of this memorandum are operational, including identifying executable, priced leasing options, both foreign and domestic,” the memo explained. “This analysis shall specifically include operational risk associated with using a leased vessel as compared to a purchased vessel to conduct specified missions set forth in this memorandum.” It’s unclear, though, where this many existing icebreakers could be sourced from quickly. No other single country, except Russia, operates 10 icebreakers, in total, which the Coast Guard would consider suitable for independent Arctic operations. A breakdown of major icebreakers in service, under construction, or otherwise in planning around the world, as of 2017., USCG Certain friendly countries, most notably Finland , do have shipyards with significant expertise in building ice-breakers and other ice-capable ships, but having any new ships built, even abroad at yards with applicable designs already in production, would still take time. The Coast Guard already sought to keep costs as low as possible and simplify construction as much as possible with regards to its new Polar Security Cutters by choosing a relatively mature design derived from that of a ship, the Polarstern II , for in Germany. The future of that German icebreaker program is uncertain after the cancellation of the formal tender earlier this year due to legal issues. There is also a possibility that Trump may have misspoken, at least in part. The Coast Guard’s existing plans, at least as they are known publicly, call for a fleet of three new heavy icebreakers and three new medium icebreakers. The plan could be to increase the overall size of the service’s future icebreaking fleets to 10 ships, which would only take the addition of four more vessels, either via new production or a lease arrangement. Trump’s Arctic security memo, which he issued on June 9, gave the Coast Guard 60 days to submit its full report on its icebreaker plans to the White House, by way of the Departement of Homeland Security. This means the review should be completed by the first week of August. So, we may find out more specific details about the future of America’s icebreaking fleets, and the “certain place” that additional ships might come from, soon. UPDATE: It has been brought to our attention VT Halter Marine corrected its initial press release regarding the displacement of the new Polar Security Cutter, downgrading it from 33,000 tons to 22,900 tons , making it clearly smaller, by this metric, to Russia’s Project 22220 design.

Fire crews from across San Diego have been called in to fight the fire, which some sources state emanates from below the waterline. Loud booms have been heard coming from the ship, but it isn’t clear what exactly is causing them. The last major pier-side incident for a U.S. Navy ship in San Diego occurred when disaster struck at the nearby NASSCO shipyards in 2018 when one of the dry docks holding the still under construction USS Miguel Keith flooded , causing significant damage to the vessel. As for other major U.S. Navy fires, this could end up being the worst one since the arson fire that struck the Los Angeles class nuclear fast-attack submarine USS Miami in 2012. Unlike that vessel, Bonhomme Richard is conventionally powered, but is one of just nine big-deck amphibious assault ships within the Navy’s inventory. It is a strategic and very costly asset that provides major air and amphibious power projection when operating abroad. A fire on China’s new and quite similar Type 075 amphibious assault ship occurred last April , which drew negative attention from the international press. Evidence of the fire was quickly covered up by crews that literally painted over the smoke damage just hours after it occurred. Here is a local news live feed of the fire aboard Bonhomme Richard: We will continue to live-update this post as more information comes available. UPDATE: 11 sailors were taken to the hospital with minor injuries out of about 200 that were onboard the ship when the fire struck according to the San Diego Union Tribune. The paper also reports that all of the sailors have been accounted for, which is a bit of good news. Around 150 firefighters are on the scene fighting the ongoing fire. UPDATE: Chris Cavas noted that the USS Fitzgerald is berthed right next to Bonhomme Richard . Not good. The ship just got repaired after the fatal collision in 2017. The Navy may be trying to pull some of the ships off the pier in the vicinity to Bonhomme Richard. The live stream just now had a destroyer moving by, although it isn’t clear exactly which vessel it was. Facebook live of CBS Channel 8 UPDATE: Apparently, the Fitzgerald was towed away. The damage to the destroyer isn’t clear, but smoke damage is very possible. Also, the Navy has updated the hospitalization numbers from 11 to 18: UPDATE : As of 2 pm PDT, the fire continues. Two experts in the space shared identical observations with me. First, the amount of water being poured into the ship is concerning and they noticed that the bow appears to be sitting low in the water. The other issue is that with the crew evacuated, the fire will basically burn itself out, which could take a very long time, at which point the ship may not be repairable. There is also some chatter about the automated firefighting systems being disabled due to some work being done on the vessel, but this is not confirmed at this time. Some recent screengrabs from the firefighting effort, note the destroyer that was pulled away seen in the upper-right of the frame across from the DDG-1000s: CBS8 via Facebook CBS8 via Facebook CBS8 via Facebook UPDATE: So, destroyers Fitzgerald and Russel were moved away from Bonhomme Richard . Also, an update on the human toll, four civilians and 17 sailors now reported having been taken to the hospital. UPDATE: The Navy says there are two firefighting teams fighting the fire aboard the ship and rotating in and out. They are trying to find where the fire in emanating from in order to extinguish it. So, they don’t know what caused the fire or where it is burning exactly on the ship, which has been on fire for many hours and the smoke has picked-up once again recently. Channel 10 News Screencap Channel 10 News Screencap The above screenshots were taken from San Diego’s Channel 10 News at 5:32pm PDT. The fire could very well go into the night at this point. There has been a shelter in place order for the area around Bonhomme Richard issued by Naval Base San Diego: UPDATE: Per the 6:30 pm PDT Navy presser in San Diego: At 8:30AM the fire was reported in the lower vehicle storage area on the Bonhomme Richard, but the exact location and source are unknown. The crew began to fight the fire immediately. Local fire departments were quickly called and reported to the ship to begin fighting the fire. The ship’s crew was then evacuated and accounted for. Sailors are back fighting the fire now. All 17 wounded sailors are in stable condition. No ordnance is onboard. All on the scene are now trying to save the ship. Not clear what caused the reported explosion related to the fire on the ship. 1,800-yard safety perimeter around the ship at this time. Fireboats are trying to cool the hull. The type of fire is an “ashy” fire indicative of burning debris, not fuel or any other toxic substances. The Admiral says the ship will sail again. 1,000,000 gallons of fuel are on the ship, but that fuel is located below the heat source. UPDATE : We have posted a new article linked here that shows the bridge engulfed in flame and the forward island superstructure having melted, as well as helicopters using Bambi Buckets to try to douse the blaze from above. All our rolling coverage will be in that piece going forward.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 15, 2020",This Lecture By An F-22 Test Pilot On The Raptor’s Flight Control System Is Bonkers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lt. Col. Randy “Laz” Gordon is an accomplished test pilot, engineer, and F-22 Raptor squadron commander who lent his expertise about all things aviation, and especially about the F-22’s incredible fly-by-wire flight control system, to students taking MIT’s Private Pilot Ground School in 2019. His lecture is astonishingly accessible considering the complexities of the systems and concepts he describes and will give anyone a remarkable appreciation for just how incredible the super-maneuverable Raptor’s flight control system really is. Gordon covers so much ground in his talk. He talks about the constant tension between low-observability (stealth) and aerodynamics that resulted in the F-22’s design , the massive loads the Raptor’s powerful flight control system and its huge control surfaces have to instantly counteract, how supersonic flight requires unique flight control concepts, and even how permanent magnetic generators keep power running to the F-22’s flight controls just by having the engines windmill. There is truly an astonishing amount of information in this presentation and it also acts as a great primer for anyone who is new to the concept of fly-by-wire flight control systems. Some other interesting tidbits include: Raptor pilots make sure their hands are off the flight controls and visible when ground crews are working around a running jet because one touch of the stick could cause the 4,000psi hydraulic system to send a control surface into deflection which can decapitate a ground crewman. Although the F-22’s high altitude capabilities, partially a product of its thrust vectoring capabilities, are known, Gordon notes the aircraft flies at altitudes from 60,000-65,000 feet. He describes the pressure-sensitive sidestick control concept, which moves less than a half-inch, very well. The concept was pioneered by the F-16, with the YF-16’s sidestick not moving at all before changes were made. The flight controls page on the F-22’s multi-function-display is really well described here. The level of automation and simple symbology to describe complex issues is remarkable. The F-22 knows it is about to take off and automatically reconfigures the plane for departure. It does the same upon touchdown. Multiple other automation flight logic modes, in which the flight control system sets to totally different parameters, exist. This is not uncommon on other fly-by-wire aircraft, like airliners, but the F-22’s huge flight envelope makes them far more pronounced. There is a mode for aerial refueling to give the jet the best fine handling behind the tanker. In aerial combat mode, you put pressure on the stick and it locks in a G-rate for a turn and stays there even if you take your hand off the stick. When landing, it goes into a pitch command mode, where the pilot simply directs the pitch of the aircraft and it stays there. A large number of limiters are used to make sure the jet is not capable of being structurally overloaded and it even automatically unloads individual parts of the aircraft during certain maneuvers by using flight control surfaces non-traditionally. When an F-22 drops a weapon, namely a 1,000lb JDAM , fuel automatically sloshes forward to maintain center of gravity. There is no fuel panel on the jet to command this, it is all part of the control logic. Check out the whole video for yourself below: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Evhrk5tY-Yo Although it is not formally talked about in the presentation, as we have discussed in the past , low-observability is also factored into flight control systems on stealthy aircraft. This would be yet another layer to the F-22’s flight control programming. What parts did you find interesting? Let us know in the comments below!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",Veteran Flight Tester On How The YA-7F Strikefighter Was Really A Jet Recycling Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The YA-7F Strikefighter program looked to do something breathtakingly logical: take existing largely surplus A-7 Corsair II attack jets that lacked speed, maneuverability, and more advanced capabilities and turn them into a more agile supersonic night-fighting battlefield interdiction jets for pennies on the dollar compared to what a new airframe would cost. By all accounts, the YA-7F team was successful at doing just that, but they were fighting a losing battle due to a number of factors, the biggest of which was the latest rendition of the F-16, the Block 40/42 F-16CG/DG, and the love of pointy-nosed fighter jets among the Air Force brass. The fact that big defense contractors wouldn’t make a windfall revamping surplus A-7s probably also had something to do with it. In the end, the far more expensive and sexy F-16, which was born a fighter, would be chosen over the utilitarian YA-7F for the nighttime battlefield interdiction mission, but in retrospect, that may not have been the best choice, at least entirely. You can read all about the YA-7F program and its potential in this past piece of mine , but now, thanks to retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell Burnside Clapp, we have an entirely new perspective on this enigmatic initiative from someone who was right there during the test program. According to Clapp, the YA-7F was really an incredibly logical recycling program more than anything else. If it would have been greenlit into production, it probably would have been the most bang for the buck the Air Force had realized in an airframe in decades. It also would have been remarkably suited for the period of turmoil that would come a decade later in the air campaigns that followed the attacks on 9/11. Lt Col Michell Burnside Clapo recounted the following about his time with the YA-7F program and its demise to The War Zone: My first job out of Test Pilot School in 1988 was the YA-7F. The jet was great. The subtle changes in the aerodynamics really improved a lot of things, particularly handling at high angles of attack (AOA). We couldn’t even spin the jet even with adverse control inputs into the heavy wing with an asymmetric load. The avionics were the basic LANA suite (a “Low Altitude Night Attack” package that did pretty much what LANTIRN did later in the rest of the fleet). Some of the things we did during the test program less useful than hoped – loading the GPU-5/A gun pod was a good way to test vibration, but not a good way to actually hit anything on the ground with any accuracy. It was a great year of flying, and the test team hit all the points and demonstrated everything that the jet was supposed to do. Both YA-7F prototypes along with an A-7D chase jet. , Vought.org In the mid-1980s, it became clear that IPEs (Improved Performance Engines) would soon be available for the tactical air forces. These were the -129 and -229 variants of the General Electric and Pratt & Whitney fighter engines, respectively. I’ll talk about the Pratt engines from here onwards since that’s what we flew in the YA-7F, but feel free to assume that it’d apply to the GE engines, as well. The then-current (i.e. -220) versions of the engine produced around 14,000 pounds of thrust in full military power (MIL) and 23,000 in max afterburner. The soon-to-be-available -229s, though, could produce 17,800 pounds in MIL and 29,000 pounds in max afterburner. The tactical fighter fleet was then full of hundreds of F-16 Vipers and F-15 Eagles with perfectly serviceable -220 engines. The -220 was the variant that had the digital engine controller and substantially improved maintenance and uptime over its predecessors, but the -229 would have been a serious improvement in performance. It would have been great to re-engine all the tactical fighters in the ‘90s inventory, but that poses the question, what do you do with all the perfectly serviceable and relatively low-time -220s? A potential answer was the YA-7F Strikefighter. The YA-7F with its F100-220E in full afterburner. , USAF At this point, in the mid-1980s, the only active-duty places still flying the A-7 were Edwards, for test support, chase, education at Test Pilot School, and so on, and at dark grey places in southern Nevada , where it was used to get enough flight time to maintain proficiency for the pilots of airplanes up that way that didn’t generate a lot of sorties. All the other remaining A-7s, D models, were in the Air National Guard. The Navy, the Portuguese, and the Greeks still had theirs, of course, but the Air Force’s A-7 fleet was a guard-only operation, and the guard was the customer, ultimately. The guard wanted F-16s, which, eventually, they got. Edwards AFB A-7 high over Rogers Dry Lake. , USAF Consequently, the YA-7F never lost its “Y” (prototype) prefix and the 200-ish flight tests that took place, mostly in 1990, submitted a stack of technical reports and everybody dispersed. Conversion costs of the jet from D-model to F-model would have been, if memory serves me right, around just $7M per jet in 1990 dollars. The aircraft only went supersonic to calibrate the air data system. There was no point in going that fast tactically. The extra thrust was more useful for shortening takeoff, maintaining speed during maneuvering, particularly during automatic terrain following, and accelerating from around 300 to 500 knots, in the tactical speed range. Mostly the jet was about delivering bombs on target. While the top speed may have theoretically been around 1.6 Mach, it would have taken you all afternoon to get that fast and you were likely to run out of gas on the way. YA-7F in burner. , Vought.org The fuselage was stretched four feet in total. Two and a half feet were in front of the wing and one and a half feet were behind it. Because of the stretch, the aft fuselage had to be canted upwards a little bit to maintain ground clearance. That caused the horizontal tail to get hammered in the wake of the main wing. That problem turned out to be fixable with a change in the dihedral angle to a slightly negative value of about five degrees. It turned out that putting the left horizontal tail on the right side and vice versa managed to solve the problem completely and was only a half-degree off optimum. A-7F alternations to the standard A-7 airframe. , Public Domain The stretch included room for extra gas, which, if you didn’t use the burner, could have improved the endurance of the already-long-legged basic jet. After all, the ‘unaugmented’ thrust was the same for both D and F, around 14,000 pounds of thrust. There was a minor concern at one point that the jet in afterburner could accelerate fast enough on takeoff to overspeed the gear during transition, but I don’t think that particular problem actually manifested in flight. YA-7F., USAF The vertical tail basically had its tip cleaned up and extended a bit, which wasn’t a big change. It probably helped a little at high AoA, though. The big help was from the leading edge extensions. There was a syllabus ride at Test Pilot School to do A-7 departures with a variety of entries and all the F-model pilots repeated it in the A-7K (two-seater standard model) that the program used for chase duties during test flights. You could get the basic A-7 to do some pretty violent things with adverse control inputs, but the F model was very resistant to that. You could keep it heading not-very-pointy end forward with a little attention to the rudder pedals at angles of attack at which you already would have been out of control in the D model. D model recoveries were nearly always “ailerons into the spin,” the F model was the same, but frankly “just grab the mirrors” would have worked just as well. YA-7F with one of Edwards AFB’s A-7 test and chase jets. , Vought.org The engine was great and that was particularly true in formation flight and rejoins. The original turbofan in the D model had a lot of lag and sometimes it felt like you were communicating with the engine by mail. You had to be ahead of the jet to fly in company, which is never a bad thing airmanship-wise, but the new engine was much more responsive. Other mods on the jet were an OBOGS – an onboard oxygen generation system – which filtered compressor bleed air to remove most of the nitrogen. Not all, though – it was still about seven percent N2. That made some of the air start testing a bit challenging because the pilot was still going to have some N2 in his blood, which raised the risk of decompression sickness if there was a loss of cabin pressure, which should be expected if you shut the engine off. YA-7F tail number 344 had a metal piece covering its turkey feathers – the moveable nozzle parts at the exhaust end of the engine. About halfway through the test program that part was removed. It turned out that the turkey feathers were being drawn outwards slightly by suction between the nozzle flaps and the tail cone extension and the engine controller wasn’t reading the position of the flaps accurately. When the part was off, the performance of the jet improved a little and that was the configuration we completed the test program in. The other jet, 039, kept its extension because that was where the spin chute was mounted and that was the jet we used for all the high AoA testing. 344 with its turkey feathers exposed., USAF The basic requirement for the flight tests was “fly no worse than the A-7D” and it was achieved. For test planning purposes, we were in the odd position of having to test with respect to an outdated specification – MIL-F-8785B – Charlie was the current version at the time. The original test report’s lead engineer was… Burt Rutan! He wrote it during his active duty tour in the mid-1960s. All in all, the YA-7F did what it was supposed to do and did it well. The modification team and test team ran a fairly fast, efficient, and comprehensive program, and the transition to production would have resulted in a solid Close Air Support/Battlefield Area Interdiction capability. It was originally called the “A-7 Plus” by LTV, its manufacturer (occasionally some wit would call it the “F-8 Minus”) before it received its official designation. But a fleet of A-7Fs was not to be, because the Guard was holding out for moving up to the F-16, which is inherently far more multi-role capable than the unlovely YA-7F variant of the SLUF (slightly longer ugly fellow).

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 23, 2020",American Surveillance Aircraft Have Been Flooding Into The Airspace South Of Taiwan (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Online flight tracking software has shown a notable uptick in U.S. military aerial activity in the strategic Bashi Channel, which runs from the southern end of Taiwan to the northern tip of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, in recent weeks. A steady stream of U.S. Air Force KC-135 tankers has been seen flying in and out of this general area, which serves the main boundary between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea . Particularly noteworthy, clusters of P-8A Poseidon and P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, and EP-3E Aries II and RC-135V/W Rivet Joint intelligence-gathering planes having also been observed operating there on many occasions over the last month or so. Just today, an RC-135W and a KC-135T were spotted flying in the area. Yesterday, an EP-3E and three separate P-8As flew in and around the channel. The day before that, a P-8A, a P-3C, an EP-3E, and an RC-135W had all been present at various times, with at least one KC-135R flying in support of the activity there. “The US military conducts 3 to 5 sorties to the #SouthChinaSea every day,” the SCS Probing Initiative noted in a Tweet on July 7. China’s Peking University in Beijing hosts the SCS Probing Initiative , which is, perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the most active entities tracking American military aviation activity, as well as that of U.S. military ships, in the South China Sea and elsewhere in the Pacific. The project does also tracks other countries’ military activities in the region, too. Still, there does seem to have been a notable increase in U.S. military aerial activity in this one particular area since the end of June. One of the first major conflagrations came on June 24, when two P-8As, a P-3C, and an RC-135W were tracked in the Bashi Channel. Another major cluster aircraft, including 4 P-8As, an EP-3E, an RC-135W, and at least two KC-135s, also appeared in the area on July 3. In the intervening days, the SCS Probing Initiative watched smaller numbers of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance aircraft regularly move through the region, including one of the Air Force’s two RC-135U Combat Sent electronic intelligence aircraft. It’s not clear what the exact reasons for this might be, but it is likely due to a confluence of factors. Beginning in June, the People’s Liberation Army Navy has conducted a number of significant naval exercises in the region . The PLAN’s newest aircraft carrier, the Shandong , has taken part in at least some of those drills. Then, at the beginning of July, the U.S. Navy sent two of its own Nimitz class aircraft carriers, the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan , into the South China Sea, the first dual-carrier exercise it had held there in some six years. Ticonderoga class cruisers and Arleigh Burke class destroyers escorted the flattops and American submarines would have been in the area keeping watch, as well. The two carriers’ air wings trained together, as well as with a U.S. Air Force B-52 that had flown all the way to the area from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The bomber landed on Guam after the conclusion of its long-range training mission. An Air Force B-52 bomber flies together with Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, and E-2 Hawkeye in the South China Sea in July 2020., USAF The U.S. military has a clear interest in simply monitoring the Chinese drills in the region, as well as looking to gather any kind of intelligence about the technical capabilities of People’s Liberation Army Navy aircraft and ships taking part and their tactics, techniques, and procedures. Similarly, observing how the Chinese military responds to American military maneuvers offers its own opportunities to gather additional intelligence. The U.S. aircraft have been flying in the area in recent weeks are certainly equipped to collect a wide variety of information, from full-motion video via electro-optical and infrared cameras on the P-8As and P-3Cs to a host of signals and electronic intelligence via the sensors suites on the EP-3Es and RC-135s. The P-8As have significant SIGINT capabilities , as well. Depending on their configuration, P-8As and P-3Cs can carry powerful radar imaging systems , too. China’s response to the relatively rare dual-carrier exercise, in particular, was no doubt especially significant and would have provided a unique intelligence-gathering environment. Ensuring that the two carriers were able to operate in the South China Sea unmolested could easily have also driven requirements for additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Wanting to make sure opposing submarines, especially, did not get too close to the carrier strike groups would have called for the dedicated anti-submarine warfare capabilities of the P-8As and the P-3Cs, as well. Beyond these more immediate events in and around the South China Sea, there’s definitely no shortage of potential items of interest for the U.S. military to point those sensors at in this region. The Bashi Channel serves as an important passageway from the South China Sea in the broader Pacific to the East, including for Chinese submarines. Earlier this year, there were reports that the PLAN had deployed two new Type 094 Jin class ballistic missile submarines, which would have brought the total size of the fleet to six subs. The Type 094s are all are based at the sprawling Yulin Naval Base on Hainan Island in the northern end of the South China Sea. In May, a specially-configured P-8A carrying the powerful and secretive AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor radar pod was observed flying around Hainan Island, including in international waters near Yulin. Chinese submarines, especially those packing ballistic missiles, would traverse the greater Luzon Strait after leaving their base on Hainan Island to move into the far less congested Philippine Sea and out into the greater Pacific. As such, this area is a critical submarine-hunting ground and natural choke point. A P-8A equipped with the AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor, as indicated by the red arrow., @cvvhrn The activities of China’s submarine fleets, which are growing in overall size and seeing the introduction of more modern designs , have been a major area of focus for the U.S. military and its allies in recent years. In June, the Japanese government took the unusual step of publicly disclosing that it had tracked a likely Chinese submarine sailing submerged in international waters between Amami-Oshima Island and Yokoate Island, which are situated to the north of Okinawa in the East China Sea. All of this comes as U.S.-Chinese relations are at a particularly low point due to a host of issues, including the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities in Beijing recently imposed a new heavy-handed security law on Hong Kong, which has prompted the U.S. government, among others , to reassess its relationship with that semi-autonomous region. China’s leaders have also taken an increasingly aggressive stance toward Taiwan in recent years, as officials in Taipei have sought to distance the island more from the mainland. Though the United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it nonetheless remains its principal ally and has responded to the pressure from Beijing by stepping its own Freedom of Navigation Patrols (FONOPS) in the Taiwan Strait, with aircraft and warships taking part in those operations. In early June, a Navy C-40A passenger transport took an unusual route over the island itself. Later in the month, the U.S. Army released rare video footage of Green Berets training with their Taiwanese counterparts. There are no clear indications that the overall geopolitical situation in the region is set to take a more positive course in the near future, so it seems probable that we will see more U.S. military activity in this strategic area in the weeks and months to come. Update: 4:45 PM EST— Bloomberg is reporting that President Donald Trump’s Administration is expected to make a major policy announcement regarding tensions with China in the South China Sea next week. “The U.S. has raised concerns over China’s decision to conduct military exercises in the contested waters around the Paracel Islands ,” according to Bloomberg. “The Defense Department last week called the actions “unlawful,” and the U.S. plans to lay out its official position next week, said one of the people who spoke on condition of anonymity.” Contact the author: Joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces Manned ISR Maritime Patrol P-3 P-8 RC-135 U.S. Air Force"
Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jul 31, 2020",How The F-35 Triggered Topgun’s Biggest Syllabus Revamp In Nearly Four Decades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The world-famous U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS) , better known as TOPGUN, has started down the path of one of the biggest evolutions in its esteemed history. The school has graduated its first two F-35C Lightning II pilots, the first fleet aviators to train at this advanced level in the cockpit of a naval stealth fighter. The 13-week Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor (SFTI) course is run by the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC) at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada. TOPGUN is an individual-level syllabus that combines significant amounts of live flying with classroom academics and is designed to teach handpicked fleet aviators the latest advanced tactical skills and how to impart that knowledge onto their fellow pilots. U.S. Marine Corps Major Derek Heinz and U.S. Navy Lieutenant William Goodwin III completed the course in May and have now returned to their units at Naval Air Station Lemoore, in California. Heinz is assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 125 (VFA-125), the “Rough Raiders,” a training unit, while Goodwin is from VFA-147, the “Argonauts,” the Navy’s first F-35C fleet unit. The graduates become ‘patch wearers’ having earned the coveted red and blue TOPGUN patch, versed in the latest tactics and techniques that the schoolhouse has to offer. Then they return to the fleet and spread what they have learned around their ready rooms. Integration exercises between F-35C units and TOPGUN date back to 2015, when this photograph was taken., USN The first two F-35C pilots graduated from Class 02-20. The arrival of Lightning II students marks the first major platform evolution for TOPGUN since Class 05-01 became the first to go through with the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in mid-2001. Even then, the Super Hornet syllabus was a variation of the existing F/A-18A/C/D Hornet program, with early “Rhinos” sharing many of the same systems and tactics. The arrival of the dual-role Hornet triggered a move towards the addition of air-to-ground instruction at TOPGUN. In 1993, it expanded the course from a five-week syllabus to a six-week one with the addition of an air-to-ground phase. Two years later, TOPGUN moved away from the model of training a crew from each squadron as it debuted the SFTI course, which to this day involves aircrews to Fallon and then redistributing some of them between a range of possible fleet assignments. It has since evolved into the current 13-week course structure. So, the arrival of the F-35 is one of the biggest changes for TOPGUN since the ‘Legacy’ Hornet course was first fielded at TOPGUN in the mid-1980s after the type’s introduction into service. The last F-14 Tomcat students passed through TOPGUN in 2003, and the era of the Lightning II represents a major step-change for the Navy as it blends a low-observable (stealthy) aircraft into its esteemed TOPGUN course for the first time. The NFWS is officially a department within NAWDC, led by a department head, although the school’s staff and students respectfully refer to their figurehead as the Commanding Officer or “Skipper.” Navy Commander Timothy ‘Ain’t’ Myers is the current holder of this prestigious position. “Our focus on the students that go through TOPGUN is not limited to teaching them the tactics, techniques and procedures that are required for them to successfully employ their aircraft, integrated into a larger force. We are also in the business of teaching our graduates how to instruct other students, so that when they go back to the fleet, they are able to instruct at a very high level,” Commander Myers, official U.S. Navy media release. For the last few years, NAWDC and TOPGUN staff have been developing the new curriculum for the Navy’s latest fighter, with suitably experienced instructors to train skill sets tailored to the F-35C. The U.S. Navy has stayed tight-lipped about the specifics of its new Lightning II syllabus. A NAWDC media release stated: “While all F-35C tactics instructors have completed the TOPGUN course previously, this is the first time TOPGUN has graduated students who are currently flying the Lightning II, utilizing a syllabus that has been developed, from the ground up, specifically for F-35C integrated operations. This was accomplished by the gradual introduction of F-35C tactics into the training curriculum for previous classes. The result is a cadre of highly trained instructors executing a fully-integrated F-35C syllabus, providing well-rounded “graduate-level” training for the fifth-generation fighter to take back to the fleet.” While the U.S. Air Force’s very loosely equivalent Weapons School , or WPS, at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, has been built upon nearly 40 years of experience in operating low-observable (LO) stealth aircraft, it’s still relatively new for the Navy. In February 2019, the Navy declared that the F-35C was operationally ready to deploy and conduct missions around the world, and VFA-125, the F-35C Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS), graduated its first newly winged F-35C aviators The Navy and Marine Corps have been keen to embed its personnel in exchange programs in order to understand the nuances of operating a 5th generation fighter, but it’s notable that the two organizations operate two different tactics manuals. The Marines use a version of the U.S. Air Force’s “3-1” (three-dash-one), at least with regards to their F-35Bs, whereas the Navy has developed its own concept of operation (CONOPS) for the F-35C, which is now being refined at TOPGUN. The first F-35C class at Fallon is just the start of the story and the TOPGUN staff will already be looking at lessons learned and how to further refine the syllabus for this advanced fighter to best meet the future needs of the Navy. The U.S. Air Force F-22 is renowned for being able to sneak into a fight and deliver a killer blow without being detected. The F-35 will bring some of that same prowess into the TOPGUN arena, which has, until now, been dominated by non-stealthy and less complex platforms. While TOPGUN remains weighted towards air-to-air training, the existing Hornet and Super Hornet syllabus includes an air-to-ground phase. Interestingly, the 13-week course was not extended for the first F-35C class, but the additional complexity of operating a low observable (stealthy) and extremely advanced fighter may require further expansion of the syllabus over time. The length of the course suggests that the F-35C syllabus likely follows that of the Super Hornet in terms of core elements, adjusted to embrace stealth tactics and new techniques. For the Super Hornet, the course is divided into four main phases: basic fighter maneuvering (BFM aka dogfighting); air-to-surface; section air-to-air (two-ship); and division (four-ship). Each runs for between three and three-and-a-half weeks, except for the air-to-surface module, which is only two weeks. A TOPGUN instructor in an F/A-18C waits for students as they taxi to the runway., Jamie Hunter TOPGUN has no F-35Cs assigned. The students fly aircraft from their own unit and many of the Lightning II sorties in Class 02-20 were flown over the Fallon Range Training Complex direct from NAS Lemoore, California, the home station of VFA-125 and VFA-147. This also provided the opportunity for the students to rehearse missions in their resident simulators. Notably, until now, the TOPGUN course has focused on live flying, however, the advent of advanced simulators and higher levels of security classification for the Lightning II means that a portion of events will likely have been completed in a synthetic environment, and this will only grow over time. The Navy is known to have looked at the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Secure Live, Virtual and Constructive Advanced Training Environment (SLATE) program, which could offer the kind of Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) training that will become a core part of TOPGUN and vital to fighter integration. Blending synthetic training in simulators with aviators flying live missions enables a number of important functions. One of the most important elements for the F-35C is the ability to train with the weapons system being “full-up” in a secure environment, away from prying eyes that may be lurking on the training ranges and able to interpret sensitive information that is exhibited in live flying, such as radar and electronic warfare signatures and capabilities. The aircraft’s electronic warfare abilities may also be limited due to the training environment and where that training is happening, as well. A sailor walks in front of a line of eclectically painted Hornets and Super Hornets at Fallon for SFTI. , Tyler Rogoway LVC also allows new capabilities to be blended in and scenarios to be explored without having to bring all the physical elements together. For example, an F-35C pilot in a simulator at Lemoore could theoretically train with a pilot flying a live mission over the Fallon ranges in an F/A-18, at least up until within visual range. Or, threats could be added virtually in order for the pilot to practice the latest prescribed reactions to them. However, live-flown BFM remains a key element of the TOPGUN syllabus, with an emphasis on the physical challenges of fighting in the cockpit. Synthetic training aids will be useful for pilots learning how to transition from beyond visual range (BVR) into the close-in arena. The instructors place high emphasis on how to take advantage of the adversary’s mistakes and turn that into an offensive advantage, something that’s notoriously tough to replicate in the simulator with anywhere near the fidelity of actually flying against an opponent. The BFM phase is designed to refine the student’s skills when maneuvering the aircraft at high G-forces, while maintaining sight on the opponent and beating them up in the proverbial ‘knife fight in a telephone booth.’ Students go head-to-head with TOPGUN instructors, initially in similar types, before the nimble NAWDC F-16A/B “Vipers,” with significantly higher thrust-to-weight ratio, are drafted in to up the ante. The students and instructor pore over these BFM missions in extreme detail during lengthy debriefing sessions after each mission, the importance of which cannot be overemphasized. F-16A and F/A-18C adversary aircraft flown by TOPGUN Instructors., Jamie Hunter The long-range BVR engagements are likely to be where the biggest changes have come to TOPGUN when it comes to the inclusion of the F-35C. Gone are the traditional scenarios of detecting an opponent at range via radar and playing a cat-and-mouse game with AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs). The stealthy F-35 can theoretically operate with some impunity if it is in full low-observable configuration, picking off its foes without ever being seen, or at least without being detected in such a way that an enemy can land a deadly blow first. The traditional transition from long-range into close fighting is another area likely to have presented particular challenges for the TOPGUN staff. The F-35B and C don’t feature an internal gun like the F-35A and must carry the podded GAU-22/A cannon if required for the mission, which also negates the aircraft’s stealth capabilities when fitted. All F-35s also carry their close-range, air-to-air heat-seeking AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles externally, which also degrades the jet’s stealthy radar signature when fitted. This poses a major challenge for any type of F-35 in its ability to transition from long-range stealthy silent attacks, into close-range fights. Basically, the aircraft would be employed very differently in air-to-air combat when its signature is compromised with Sidewinders fitted externally compared to when they are not. Just being limited to the internally carried AIM-120 AMRAAM missile alone is a big difference. It’s very possible that TOPGUN has introduced tactics that focus on using the AMRAAM within visual range, to allow a stealthy-configured F-35C to move between the two regimes. It’s a known tactic that has been used in combat, notably by TOPGUN graduate Navy Lieutenant Commander Michael “Mob” Tremel over Syria in June 2017. Part of TOPGUN’s charter is to address these kinds of issues, to find fixes and to promote best practices. These unique issues with the F-35C are exactly what TOPGUN experts will have scrutinized and fed back into the system in order to evolve the syllabus. VFA-147 is the first fleet F-35C squadron, and is based at NAS Lemoore., USMC NAWDC executed a dry run of the syllabus in late 2019 using just TOPGUN instructors, before the first live course with students started earlier this year. Moreover, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine (VX-9), the “Vampires,” played a major part in building the F-35C into the TOPGUN course, especially given its wide spectrum of operations. The F-35C adds a deep strike into highly contested environments capability to the carrier air wing, but in addition, the aircraft will fly Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (DEAD) alongside its Offensive Counter-Air (OCA) and Defensive Counter-Air (DCA) mission sets. Other changes the F-35C is likely to bring to the existing TOPGUN course include the use of stealth tactics in the BVR arena with the pilot acting as a battle manager, monitoring the 20 x 8-inch touch screen cockpit display, showing data sucked up via a dizzying array of advanced sensors. The F-35 pilot has a distinct advantage due to the aircraft’s extreme degree of sensor fusion. The jet’s AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), Distributed Aperture System (DAS ), and its highly advanced electronic surveillance and electronic warfare suite work together to provide its pilot with unprecedented situational awareness. Altogether, the F-35C represents a significant leap in technology compared to the Navy’s Super Hornets that are currently in service. Being a 13-week course, TOPGUN cannot offer the same levels of detail as say the six-month-long USAF Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) at Nellis. The complexity of the F-35C means that the syllabus that is taught at Fallon may need to expand or otherwise have added elements bolted on. TOPGUN’s focus on air-to-air combat may not ideally lend itself to the kind of advanced mission package leadership that deep strike missions could require. However, TOPGUN’s work with the F-35C will be influential in building the corporate knowledge that is required within the U.S. Navy that leads to successfully employing the full capabilities of the jet. A TOPGUN instructor taxies out at NAS Fallon., Jamie Hunter Commander Myers added in the NAWDC release: “Graduating Strike Fighter Tactics Instructors allows us to accelerate learning by feeding TOPGUN training back to the fleet, elevating the lethality and survivability of both the individual aircraft as well as the Carrier Strike Group. The Lightning II proved its value to the Navy during every phase of the TOPGUN course, and its integration with the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, EA-18G Growler and E-2C/D Hawkeye demonstrated that the powerful combination of 4th and 5th generation fighters, with advanced electronic attack, and command and control, is a force-multiplier against advanced threats.” Since completing the TOPGUN course in May, Heinz and Goodwin have returned to instruct and train their squadronmates, with a particular emphasis on ensuring that pilots will have the requisite skill sets to effectively employ the F-35C during its first operational deployment. In a media release from NAS Lemoore, Lieutenant Goodwin said: “Our focus is on assisting the SFTIs at the operational fleet squadron pushing the big picture tactics and ensuring that everything is ready to go for the first and subsequent F-35C carrier deployments. The idea is that VFA-147 SFTIs can use the standards of tactical execution we provide to train their own people and take that knowledge with them through deployment. We are here to ensure that they are set up for success.” “While my role as an F-35C instructor is still primarily focused on the students at the FRS, my perspective on what I teach and how I teach it most certainly has grown since completing TOPGUN,” added Maj Heinz. “I’m still training students to fly the aircraft, it’s just now I have the additional responsibility as an SFTI to bring that advanced training to the fleet, while helping maintain the TOPGUN training syllabus and ensuring standardization of training for all instructors. We are always working to maintain the highest standards of training.” An F-35C of VFA-147 “Argonauts.”, USN Since the stand up of Commander, Joint Strike Fighter Wing in August 2018 at Lemoore, the program has declared Safe-for-Flight Operations Certification (SFFOC) for both VFA-147 and the USMC’s first F-35C unit, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the “Black Knights.” VFA-147 is now preparing for the first-ever F-35C carrier deployment, as part of Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) aboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) next year. Navy Captain Adan Covarrubias, Commander of Joint Strike Fighter Wing, said in a release: “The tactics that were developed during this first F-35C class are currently being integrated into the carrier air wing’s work-up cycle, truly making them a more lethal carrier and air wing of the future.” Completion of the first F-35C course at TOPGUN was very well-timed. VFA-147 recently arrived en masse at NAS Fallon to begin the squadron’s work-ups for the forthcoming carrier deployment, complete with its new TOPGUN-graduate Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor, who is already setting the pace for the squadron. Considering the unit could find itself called into combat in any of many hotspots around the globe during the type’s very first cruise, having a recent graduate from TOPGUN in its ranks gives the Argonauts a huge advantage. It will greatly help ensure that whatever missions the squadron may be tasked with are successful and that every F-35C pilot comes home alive. Author’s Note: The WarZone reached out to TOPGUN to discuss the specifics of the new F-35 course, but operational security prevented any further comment.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Oct 23, 2020",Approval Of Mega F-35 Sale For Japan Is A Huge Step Towards Its Aircraft Carrier Ambitions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Japan of a jaw-dropping 105 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , plus related equipment. The mega-deal is worth an estimated $23.11 billion. The move cements procurement plans that were first laid out by the Japanese government in late 2018 and heralds the second-largest U.S. Foreign Military Sales deal in history, after the record $29.4-billion sale of Boeing F-15SA Advanced Eagles to Saudi Arabia in 2010. Importantly, the contract includes 42 F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) jets, the first examples of this variant for Japan. This opens the door for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) to conduct fixed-wing operations from Japan’s two Izumo class helicopter carriers . If Japan ends up buying all of these aircraft, it would become the second-biggest operator of the F-35 after the U.S. The official notification from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) reads: “The Government of Japan has requested to buy sixty-three (63) F-35A Conventional Take­Off and Landing (CTOL) aircraft, forty-two (42) F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft, and one hundred ten (110) Pratt and Whitney F135 engines (includes 5 spares).  Also included are Electronic Warfare Systems; Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence/Communications, Navigation and Identification; Autonomic Logistics Global Support System, Autonomic Logistics Information System; Flight Mission Trainer; Weapons Employment Capability, and other Subsystems, Features, and Capabilities; F-35 unique infrared flares; reprogramming center access and F-35 Performance Based Logistics; software development/integration; flight test instrumentation; aircraft ferry and tanker support; spare and repair parts; support equipment, tools and test equipment; technical data and publications; personnel training and training equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services; and other related elements of logistics support.  The estimated total cost is $23.11 billion.” The Japanese government first selected the F-35A as its next-generation fighter in December 2011, placing an initial order for 42 conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) A variants. On Dec. 17, 2018, it laid out plans to expand this to a total of 147 Lightning IIs through the procurement of an additional 105 jets. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga confirmed the approval of Japan’s Medium Term Defence Program, and that it covered 105 F-35As and 42 F-35Bs. A Japan Air Self Defense Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., Japan MoD Last year, Japan formally expressed interest in becoming a full partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program. Japanese officials approached the Pentagon about moving from being a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customer to being a full partner in the program. However, the Pentagon and the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) expressed concern that it would create potential division within the existing international production infrastructure, and lead to other customers demanding similarly expanded roles. Japan had already secured an important stake in industrial participation in the F-35. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) operates a Final Assembly and Check Out (FACO) facility in Nagoya-Komaki, which assembles F-35As for the JASDF from parts that are manufactured internationally. The first four F-35s for the JASDF were built at the Lockheed Martin plant in Fort Worth, Texas. Subsequent examples are being built domestically, but Japan has repeatedly expressed frustration that its FACO has failed to present a sufficiently important role in overall F-35 industrial participation. The Nagoya FACO proved to be more costly than expected and it prompted a decision from Japan to revert to having JASDF jets assembled in Fort Worth, Texas, starting with aircraft ordered in Fiscal Year 2019. However, Mitsubishi Heavy scrambled to reduce costs associated with the plant as the Japanese government threatened to close the FACO by 2022, in favor of taking completed jets straight from the U.S. as a cost-saving measure. Instead, plans were drawn up to use the FACO for F-35 maintenance work. Lockheed Martin received a $25.2 million contract in September 2019 from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to build a maintenance repair and upgrade facility for the F-35 in Nagoya, and according to local reports, as of July 1, the FACO was ready to accept maintenance of JASDF and foreign F-35s, with aircraft 79-8704 (AX-04) being the first aircraft into this new facility. DOD With improving performance from the FACO and gradually reducing assembly costs, Japan has decided to continue with the final assembly of its aircraft at Nagoya, and the remaining jets from the initial order of 42 will all be built here. It’s unclear where the additional F-35s under the new agreement will be assembled. Local reports say they will all be built in Japan, however the DSCA notification notably includes “aircraft ferry and tanker support” costs, which might suggest otherwise. When the plan for these extra jets was first drawn up, it was at a time when the FACO was facing the axe. The JASDF’s 3rd Air Wing at Misawa Air Base, on the northern edge of the country’s main island of Honshu, received its first F-35A, serial 89-8706 (AX-06), on January 26, 2018 to join 302 Hikotai (Squadron). On May 28, 2018, the five aircraft that had been used to train the initial pilot cadre at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, also arrived at Misawa, this included 79-8705 (AX-05), the first aircraft built at the Nagoya FACO, which subsequently crashed on April 9, 2019. The 302 Hikotai was declared operational on March 29, 2019, and it now operates 13 aircraft. The latest delivery to Misawa was aircraft AX-18, with a further six jets scheduled for delivery this year as the build-up of 301 Hikotai, the second squadron, continues. The latest order will increase the overall JASDF complement of F-35As to 104, factoring in the loss of AX-05. The 42 F-35Bs are also expected to be operated by the JASDF, but they will provide Japan with the ability to conduct dispersed operations. Japan plans to operate the aircraft from at least one of its two Izumo class helicopter carriers. This is a critical element of Japan’s ability to maintain a strategic presence in the region amid building tensions in the South China Sea. Japan’s two Izumo class helicopter carriers., Kyodo via AP The War Zone was first to report that the Izumo class ships were built with the F-35B in mind, despite official rejections of such claims. The two ships’ hangar and elevators were built to dimensions that could accommodate the F-35B and the MV-22 Osprey. Even the flight deck can reportedly withstand the heat and pressure generated by the F-35B’s exhaust. Operating F-35Bs from the ships would mark the first time since 1945 that Japan has fielded an operational aircraft carrier capable of conducting fixed-wing operations. As stated by The War Zone in our earlier reporting of this monumental strategic shift, it would be among the most glaring diversions from Article Nine of the country’s constitution that effectively prohibits it from having offensive warfare capabilities. Converting the Izumo class ships to be F-35B-capable will be far less complicated than some have claimed. One likely addition is a ski-jump , which enables the F-35B to get airborne at higher all-up gross weights. The same design has been adopted by the United Kingdom for its two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers , both of which were designed with the F-35B specifically in mind. The first-in-class JS Izumo , which was commissioned in March 2015, is scheduled for a refit and overhaul from this year. Its sister ship JS Kaga , commissioned in March 2017, could similarly start getting upgraded in 2022. The JASDF has approached the U.S. Marine Corps to help it establish fixed-wing STOVL carrier operations, likely following a similar model to the U.K. Lightning Force. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy stood-up initial F-35 training operations in partnership with the Marines at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina. It then split off to establish an independent operation at RAF Marham, in the United Kingdom. The 42 F-35Bs requested by Japan closely matches the 48 examples of the STOVL variant required by the U.K. In March 2019, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke with U.S. Marine Corps commandant General Robert Neller regarding support for Japan’s desire to move into F-35B carrier operations, according to Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun . It reported that USMC F-35Bs could support initial operations from the Izumo class ships. Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 (VMFA-121), the “Green Knights,” is based in Japan, as is the first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA 6). This combination could present an ideal foundation for the Marines to play a major role in assisting the JASDF in its aims to commence STOVL F-35 operations. USS America with 13 Marine Corps F-35Bs visible on the deck., USN Japan follows Italy in operating a mixed fleet of F-35As and Bs. The U.K. is similarly looking at a split buy of variants, with F-35As currently being evaluated to complement the 48 B-models that are on order. South Korea too could procure F-35Bs in order to establish a fixed-wing carrier capability . Australia’s Canberra class landing helicopter docks are also highly suited to taking F-35Bs, essentially being licensed-built versions of Spain’s Juan Carlos Class ships and built with ski-jumps from the outset. However, the Royal Australian Navy maintains that it has no plans for the F-35B, despite obvious conclusions being drawn about the potential to expand upon its current F-35A fleet . Japan’s move to buy additional F-35s coincides with new details about its proposed timeline for developing and fielding its next-generation F-X fighter aircraft. The new stealthy jet will replace the JASDF’s fleet of Mitsubishi F-2 fighters , which will be retired by the mid-2030s. The Japanese Ministry of Defense unveiled a draft plan on July 7 that revealed an ambition to commence full-scale production in 2031. A prime contractor could be selected as early as this October. An artist’s conception of Japan’s future F-X stealth fighter., Japan MoD The Japanese aerospace industry has already invested significant resources in research and development for a new indigenous fighter, including the building and flight-testing of MHI’s X-2 “Shinshin” technology demonstrator. The War Zone also reported how Lockheed Martin had reportedly pitched the idea of a hybrid of the F-22 and F-35 to Japan, and was willing to let companies in Japan handle a significant portion of the research and development and production of the aircraft. However Japan’s F-X program progresses now, the country’s Ministry of Defense clearly remains heavily invested in the F-35 program. The F-35B, in particular, will be the aircraft that enables the country to return to the carrier aviation world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 21, 2020",Meet The Navy’s First Female African American Tactical Jet Pilot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Navy Lieutenant J.G. Madeline Swegle has made history as her service’s first-ever female African American tactical jet pilot. She is set to formally receive her gold wings at a ceremony later this month as a newly minted Naval Aviator. News that Swegle had successfully completed the final stage of her Tactical Air (Strike) aviator training had first emerged on July 7, when a personal friend of the lieutenant, who goes by the Twitter handle @PaigeAlissa, Tweeted out about it. The Chief of Naval Air Training’s (CNATRA) public affairs office has now confirmed that this is the case in its own Tweet. “BZ to Lt. j.g. Madeline Swegle on completing the Tactical Air (Strike) aviator syllabus,” the Tweet from CNATRA reads, using the abbreviation for “Bravo Zulu,” a term the Navy, among others, uses as a way of saying “job well done.” Swegle is the @USNavy’s first known Black female TACAIR pilot and will receive her Wings of Gold later this month.” The Navy has yet to release a detailed official biography of Swegle’s career in the service so far. “So she is married to my room mate [sic]. She’s gonna fly EA-18G Growlers ,” a poster on Reddit wrote earlier this week , but this remains unconfirmed. Graduates of the TACAIR training program primarily go on to fly F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or F-35C Joint Strike Fighters , as well. Swegle’s achievement comes some 46 years after naval aviator Rosemary Mariner became the first woman in the Navy to fly tactical jets in 1974. Mariner, who eventually rose to the rank of captain and also became the first woman to assume command of an aviation squadron anywhere in the U.S. military, retired in 1997 and sadly passed away last year after a battle with cancer. Then-US Navy Commander Rosemary Mariner in the cockpit of an EA-7L Corsair II., USN This also comes 25 years after retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally , now a Republican Senator from Arizona, became the first American woman to fly in combat for any service. This milestone follows struggles within the Navy’s aviation communities at times to address racial discrimination, as well. In 2018, two male African Americas went public with accusations that they had been kicked out of the TACAIR training program because of their race. In 2019, the Navy said it had determined the core allegations were unfounded , but did acknowledge a lack of “appropriate dignity and respect” from instructors and ordered changes, particularly to the process by which callsigns were assigned. As of 2018, just 2.7 percent of Navy pilots were African American and just under two percent were assigned to units flying F/A-18C/D Hornets , F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, E-2 Hawkeyes , and C-2A Greyhounds , according to Military.com . As of July 2019, African Americans made up 13.4 percent of the total U.S. population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau , though this only counts individuals who identified as being only one race. On June 30, 2020, the Navy announced the establishment of Task Force One Navy “to address the issues of racism, sexism and other destructive biases and their impact on naval readiness.” Navy Rear Admiral Alvin Holsey is leading the task force and will now produce a report for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday. “As a Navy – uniform and civilian, active and reserve – we cannot tolerate discrimination or racism of any kind,” Gilday said in a statement announcing the creation of the task force. “We must work to identify and eliminate individual and systemic racism within our force.” Lieutenant J.G. Swegle is certainly a prime example of how the service can progress in this regard. Bravo Zulu to her indeed. Contact the author: Joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Naval Aviation"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain limited, but an Afghan Air Force A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft crashed earlier today, reportedly with a U.S. pilot on board. Reports also say this individual was injured after ejecting, but they have already been rescued. Their exact affiliation, such as whether they are a member of the U.S. military or a private contractor, is unclear as is whether there was also a member of the Afghan Air Force in the aircraft at the time of the accident. The mishap, which was said to have been the result of a technical failure, occurred in the Doshi District of Afghanistan’s northeastern Baghlan Province at approximately 11:30 AM local time on July 9, 2020. The A-29 was assigned to the Kabul Air Wing based at Hamid Karzai International Airport in the country’s capital, Kabul. The single-engine turboprop Super Tucanos are Afghanistan’s primary fixed-wing combat aircraft . They are armed with two .50 caliber machine guns and can carry various types of ordnance, including laser-guided bombs , on four hardpoints under the wings and another one under the center of the fuselage. “The A-29 had an American onboard, unclear if flying the aircraft alone or with an Afghan, according to those familiar with the crash,” New York Times reporter Thomas Gibbons-Neff wrote on Twitter. An unconfirmed video has also appeared on Twitter showing Afghan Air Force Mi-17 Hip helicopters responding to the crash to rescue the pilot. There are also reports that the pilot ejected from the aircraft. The Afghan Air Force presently has 25 A-29s, 10 of which are based in the United States as part of a pilot training program. The sustainment of Afghanistan’s Super Tucano fleet, as well training of new pilots and maintenance personnel, rely heavily on contractor support . The Pentagon’s most recent quarterly report on “Enhancing Security and Stability In Afghanistan” says that Afghan Air Force personnel still perform only 30 percent of all maintenance on the aircraft. “There have been challenges standing up maintenance training in Afghanistan after A-29 maintenance training conducted in the United States,” that report explained. “As a result, a new training contract was awarded in February 2020,” it continued. “Training was set to begin in April but has been delayed due to COVID restrictions.” This could help explain why an American, who may have been a contractor, was flying in the aircraft at the time of the accident in Baghlan Province. Contractors work on an Afghan Air Force A-29., USAF This incident comes just over six months after a highly specialized U.S. Air Force E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft crashed in Afghanistan’s Ghazni Province, also in the northeastern portion of the country, killing the two pilots on board. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 1:25 PM EST— U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has confirmed that an American pilot was flying in the A-29 at the time of the crash and that they were an instructor pilot from the U.S. Air Force. The full statement that The War Zone received is as follows: “An Afghan Air Force A-29 flown by a U.S. Air Force instructor pilot crashed during a training flight.” “The pilot ejected prior to the crash and was safely recovered. The cause is under investigation, however preliminary indications are the aircraft crashed due to mechanical issues.” The U.S. Air Force is in the process of winding down U.S.-based training for Afghan A-29 pilots, with the goal of having Afghan instructor pilots begin training their comrades in Afghanistan by the end of this year. “The first IQT [Initial Qualification Training] class conducted entirely outside the United States is projected to start by September 2020,” according to the latest “Enhancing Security and Stability In Afghanistan” report. “The Afghan A-29 schoolhouse is expected to be fully operational by April 2021 with a total of 25 in-country aircraft,” that report continues. “A-29 advisors and contract instructor pilots are currently supplementing the organic instructor cadre to meet the current training needs.” The U.S. military did notably shut down a U.S.-based program to train Afghan pilots to fly the AC-208 Eliminator aircraft last year, after almost half of the students went absent without leave , or AWOL. Members of the A-29 program had gone AWOL in the past , as well. Contact the author: Joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Americas Around The Globe News & Features U.S. Homeland"
Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2018",This Qatari 747-8i Jumbo Jet For Sale May Be The Worlds Most Lavish Flying Palace (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The government of Qatar has divested two opulently-configured VVIP 747s in recent years, a 747SP model that got sold to CSDS Asset Management in 2018 and a 747-8i Boeing Business Jet , or BBJ, that ended up effectively gifted to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that same year. Now another luxurious Qatari VVIP 747-8i BBJ, with fewer than 1,100 total flight hours on the airframe and under 300 cycles on each of its four GE Aviation GEnx-2B67/P engines , has hit the open market. It is without question among the most, if not the most, expensive and opulent aircraft on the market and one of the most incredible luxury aircraft ever built. UPDATE NOTE: All listing photos have been removed from this article at the request of a party associated with the aircraft’s broker. You can see all of them for yourself in the public listings and associated documents linked here , here , and here . This particular 747-8i, which has the Boeing serial number 37075 and rolled off the assembly line in Everett, Washington in 2012, is presently at AMAC Aerospace Switzerland AG ‘s facility in Basel, Switzerland. AMAC Aerospace was responsible for outfitting the aircraft with its custom interior, which took nearly two years to complete, according to the company’s records . In 2015, this aircraft entered service with the Qatar Amiri Flight, which is technically a division of the country’s flag carrier Qatar Airways that serves the Qatari Royal Families and other top government officials. A 2019 story from FlightGlobal indicates that this particular aircraft, which carried the Qatari registration A7-HBJ, was set aside for “executive” VIPs outside of Qatar’s ruling House of Al Thani. In its primary configuration, this aircraft has a crew of 18 and can carry 89 passengers, a relatively small number compared to the 400 or so people that a 747-8i configured as a typical three-class airliner can accommodate. AMAC also says this aircraft can also fly in a medical configuration with its master bedroom transformed into a Patient Transport Unit, perhaps a more significant selling point in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic . With a master bedroom, guest bedroom, grand staircase, living rooms, private offices and lounges, general lounges, fully stocked galleys, and more, the art deco-inspired and somewhat timeless interior of this aircraft is extremely lavish, to say the least. However, it is a bit more conservative, at least in color palette, than the interior of the ex-Qatari 747-8i BBJ that flew around members of the Qatari Royal Family and is now in service with the Turkish government. Just some of the aircraft’s features and amenities are listed below. You can find a full breakdown of what the plane has to offer as well as additional pictures in the listing brochure linked here . Insulation blankets installed which provides thermal insulation and noise attenuation functions. Zone I and Zone II have 50 dB +/-2dB, Zone III (aft lounge) and Zone IV (upper deck lounge) have 52 dB +/-2dB. Electric Window shades and Roman shades are installed. Portable fire extinguishers are installed throughout in the interior of the aircraft. Anti-intrusion system is installed which provide highly reliable aircraft intrusion monitoring for the unattended aircraft. Water system installed to provide hot and cold portable water to each galley sink, each lavatory sink, bidet, hand sprayer and showers, cold water to the lavatory toilets and cold water to humidification system. Digital IFE system from PGA with Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) / Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Game capability Five (5) GES (Global Entertainment Servers) connected in series via Ethernet, to store and manage the distribution of AVOD audio/video and/or audio only media. Each GES can manage up to 20 AVOD clients. Main sources & components Camera systems (video only) IPod / HD port (audio/video) HDMI/USB/IPod/RCA 13 Blu-ray players (audio/video) AVOD system (audio/video) Airshow Moving map (video only) Live TV/radio (audio/video). Moving Map (Airshow) HD Cameras (FWD CAM, DN ZOOM) and Quad cam in anti-intrusion system Passenger Address (PA) System 55” monitor X 5 46” monitor X 4 40” monitor X 1 32” monitor X 1 17.3” VTS Monitor X 2 15.6” VTS Monitor X 31 IFE speakers Subwoofers Headphone jack plugs Cabin Management System with Five (5) 15.6” CMS VTS GCS Panasonic eXConnect Ku-band system provides broadband internet connectivity as well as eXTV global television service. Honeywell JetWave Ka-band connectivity system is also installed. Honeywell CX900 router makes it possible to provide fall back option in case one of the connectivity system is not available, in sequence of Ka, Ku and SBB system. The Qatari Royal Family’s decision to get rid of the other 747-8i BBJ two years ago was initially unclear. It later became apparent that they had given it to Turkey as a reward of sorts in light of Ankara’s support of the House of Al Thani amid a still-ongoing political spat with a number of other countries, chiefly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It’s not clear why the Qatar Amiri Flight is now getting rid of 37075, though it still has two other 747-8i BBJs in service. The country’s authorities had previously sold another one of the Flight’s 747-8i BBJ to the Moroccan government in 2010. At present, the Qatari Amiri Flight also has a number of widebody Airbus A340s and A330s, as well as narrowbody A319s and A320s. It’s also worth noting that the ex-Qatari 747SP, which CSDS has now put back on the market , as well as the 747-8i BBJ now in service in Turkey, had been registered in Bermuda and were not technically part of the Qatar Amiri Flight, though they did belong to the Qatari Royal Family. In addition, in September 2019, the U.S. government approved the sale of two AN/AAQ-24(V) Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) systems to Qatar, specifically to equip two 747-800-series “Head-of-State aircraft,” indicating that the country’s authorities plan to retain the remaining pair of Jumbo Jets for the foreseeable future. The AN/AAQ-24(V) is a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system intended to defeat incoming heat-seeking missiles, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The listing for 37075 on Controller.com says you have to contact them to negotiate the price. Even for the richest people on earth, an aircraft like this would be a substantial investment. A “green” 747-8i, meaning it’s not outfitted for service of any kind, which may not even be available to buy new from Boeing for much longer , has run roughly $370 million in the past. However, the interior of this particular example, which is one of the most incredible custom jobs we have ever seen, can cost the price of a converted airliner business jet in itself. That’s to say nothing of the annual operating costs that would have to be associated with this flying superyacht . With the 747-8i production line now in terminal status , the last of the Jumbo Jets will become more scarce, especially the few that have been produced as Boeing Business Jets. The 747-8i represents the largest aircraft on earth that has been fully configured for VIP transport. Currently, two 747-8is are being deeply modified to serve as the replacements for the two aging VC-25A Air Force One jets that are based on the 747-200 variant. So, if you are one of the very few people or institutions on earth that can afford to own and operate one of the most incredible of flying palaces ever created, check out AMAC’s listing and give them a ring to see if this rare bird could become yours.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 17, 2024",We Talk Suicide Drones And The Future Of Unmanned Warfare With AeroVironment’s Steve Gitlin,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though AeroVironment’s products, or at least emulations of them, have starred in a number of Hollywood Blockbusters and extremely high-profile video games, few outside the defense community have ever really heard of the company. The reality is that AeroVironment is among the most fascinating and visionary aerospace companies on the planet. They saw the potential in lower-end drones that could be deployed by those on the front lines before pretty much anyone else did, and changed warfare as we know it as a result. Though its hand-launched Raven reconnaissance drone is its most widely distributed product, AeroVironment’s Switchblade, which is launched like a mortar and works as both a reconnaissance drone and a deadly missile, is probably its most intriguing. Often referred to as a ‘suicide drone’ in informal parlance, in so many ways Switchblade was a harbinger of what was to come. Now, with lower-end drones becoming consumer goods and new innovative concepts, like swarming, distributed reconnaissance, and other advanced networking architectures having begun to take center stage, AeroVironment sits with a pedigree like few if any other aerospace firms have to take full advantage of the drone revolution. This means migrating existing products to different launch platforms—like submarines, armored vehicles, and unmanned combat air vehicles—and the invention of totally new products that further break down the cost and temporal barriers of close air support, airborne reconnaissance, and even telecommunications. With all this in mind, The War Zone talked in-depth with AeroVironment’s Chief Marketing Officer, Steve Gitlin, about the company’s storied lineage, its established game-changing product lines, and what is coming on the horizon not just for them, but for the brave new world unmanned warfare in general. Steve Gitlin, AeroVironment Inc. Tyler: Steve, can you just give us an idea of what your position is in the company and how you ended up with the AeroVironment? Steve: So, I’m Chief Marketing Officer and I’m also in charge of our strategic planning at the company and I joined the company actually in 2002… I’ve kind of grown as the company has grown. When I came to the company, we were probably 200 and change people, $25 to $30 million in revenue. Last fiscal year, we were knocking on 800 people and $214 million in revenue… The company was founded, as you probably know, by Dr. Paul MacCready , who was, among other things, known as the father of controlled human-powered flight. He designed the Gossamer Condor , the first human-controlled, human-powered airplane, that’s now in the Smithsonian collection… That led to a DNA of problem solving and innovation that has fortunately stayed in the bloodstream of the company and has powered the innovation that’s driven us to where we are today. We really compete in three main areas, tactical unmanned aircraft systems primarily for reconnaissance and information collection, tactical missile systems for precision surgical strike, and high-altitude pseudo-satellites or high-altitude long-endurance [HALE] systems… We’re active in each one of those areas. We’ve been active really since—well, we’ve been active in tactical missile systems since the early 2000s and in tactical unmanned aircraft systems and high-altitude pseudo-satellites since the 1980s. We believe in each of those spaces and support early adopters ensuring they are successful and then growing as the demand for solutions has grown. We’ve got a group called MacCready Works that’s working on far-reaching stuff that we believe has an opportunity to turn into meaningful new products and markets and capabilities in the future. Tyler: Switchblade is probably your most known of your products, at least in the media, because it’s whatever you wanna call it, a missile system, or suicide drone. Can you describe the system as it exists today? What control concepts does it use? Is it all man-in-the-loop or is there any sort of movement to give it some sort of autonomy, both in terms of flying the aircraft and in the targeting and execution of those targets? Steve: Great question. Let me begin by giving you a little bit of background of how Switchblade evolved. So, when we equipped soldiers and Marines and special forces with our tactical unmanned aircraft systems like Raven, Puma, and Wasp, Raven being the most prolific military drone in the world, they began recognizing the benefits of that on the frontline. Now, for the first time, frontline warfighters had the ability to gain situational awareness and actionable intelligence wherever they were, wherever they were, whatever the conditions at the time, and they didn’t have to depend on some other unit or some other asset to be made available to do that for them or have to send people into harm’s way to find out what’s over the next ridgeline or what’s on the other side of that wall. So, having these portable tools, hand-launchable tools, organic assets, gave them incredible capabilities… But then, as they gained experience with them, they came back to us and said, “Wow, we love this, this is really… It helps us succeed, but what we would really like to do is that now that we can find the threat, we’d like to be able to address that threat, equally, rapidly, accurately.” So, that really led the development of Switchblade, which is the integration of many of the technologies underlying our tactical unmanned aircraft systems, but integrating them into a different architecture that you’ve launched, wing spring open type of an architecture and with a high explosive warhead. As we began showing that to customers, they got really interested in it to the point where they began co-funding our development. Then the Army’s first public announcement that they were being used by the Army was in, I believe, December 2012, when they had been deployed to Afghanistan. Since that time, that’s grown to become a very important part of our business. So, back to your question, what’s the concept of deployment? These are portable assets. They’re transported in the tube that they fire from. The tube is set up like a little mortar on the ground. And using the ground control system, the operator launches it. It exits the tube. Its wings spring open. Its propeller spins up, and it starts flying in the direction the operator wants it to and streaming live video back to that operator, viewable on the screen in the middle of that hand-control unit. Once the operator identifies the threat, be it a sniper or somebody laying wait in ambush, they then designate that target on the control station screen, and the Switchblade then navigates itself in the terminal guidance mode and detonates on to that target. It does so in such a way that if there are non-combatants nearby, they won’t be harmed but the target will obviously be neutralized. So, that concept of operation involves a man-in-the-loop and it could also be GPS designated, for example, if something’s not moving. Because of the way we designed the system, because of the algorithms we developed, if the target moves or starts heading in a different direction, the Switchblade will actually follow that target, which is a very helpful capability. Tyler: It’s a hybrid system with man-in-the-loop and some autonomy at the end there? It does its own end-game solution to kill that target basically? Steve: Yeah, the designation of the target, the operator has to actually arm it. So, there’s a man-in-the-loop in the arming sequence. Tyler: Right, but for it to actually find its way to hit the target really accurately, it’s not relying on a guy to basically fly the thing into the target itself. It does this in an automatic mode, once it’s been cleared to do so? Steve: Similar to the way our tactical unmanned aircraft systems operate, unlike radio-controlled devices, the operator is not flying the aircraft, the operator’s simply indicating what he wants to look at, what he wants the camera to be pointing at, and the onboard computer flies the aircraft to that point and maintains on target. We have a similar capability in our tactical unmanned aircraft systems. You could lock in on a target and the aircraft will basically maintain position on that target, autonomous. Switchblade., Aerovironment Inc. Tyler: Is your team working on any ideas to make it where it’s more autonomous as far as autonomous target recognition? Any of those sorts of ideas moving forward? Steve: We’re working on a number of enabling capabilities that will benefit our entire product line and make them more capable, reduce the cognitive load on the operator, and ultimately result in greater accuracy and operations in denied environments. So, there are a number of capabilities. I can’t really get into details of them, but they’re very much on our roadmap and we look forward to being able to introduce those to customers. One other interesting capability I should mention is the Switchblade could actually be used in tandem with one of our tactical unmanned aircraft systems. For example, if a unit is operating a Puma overhead, circling up a few thousand feet away, zooming in using the incredible i45 sensor that we developed for the Puma system, if the operators at Puma then identify a threat, the information and the geolocation information can be passed digitally directly to the Switchblade, which we then task to that target. Tyler: Is Switchblade reusable at all or is it that once it’s launched, it’s gone? Steve: It’s a single-use. Tyler: Who are the customers today? Can you disclose anybody outside like the U.S. Army that’s using it? Steve: So the Army, and more recently, the Marine Corps in the government fiscal year ’20 budget appropriations, the Marine Corps were in there for a procurement of Switchblade. So, Army and Marine Corps are public. Tyler: I want to move on to Blackwing because it’s something that I think people just have a hard time understanding how big of a deal this is… So, just to start, can you talk a little about it and its development status or deployment status? Steve: We developed Blackwing as one of the variants of Switchblade. As we were demonstrating Switchblade to early customers, some of them would bring other potential customers who got very interested in the capability and said, “We really like this, but we need it to be operated in this slightly different way,” and we began working on some of the variations of Switchblade. One of those variants, the first one we disclosed is Blackwing, which is a Switchblade type of a solution, but instead of a warhead, it carries extra batteries for longer flight endurance. And then, instead of being carried in a rucksack and set up on the ground, it’s actually launched out of existing tubes in submerged submarines, which is then launched in another sort of a device that takes it to the surface, and from the surface, it launches like the regular Switchblade. The way I describe it is a remote-controlled periscope, sort of a remote-controlled periscope that extends the range dramatically for any kind of a submarine operation… And it doesn’t have to launch right away. It could be sent to the surface and set to launch at some later time when no submarine’s in the area. It can be programmed to conduct a mission and because it incorporates the digital data link that AeroVironment developed for all of our tactical unmanned aircraft systems and Switchblade, not only can it collect information and generate situational awareness, but it can also act as a pop-up mesh network in the middle of the ocean to connect surface vessels to undersea vessels to manned vessels to unmanned vessels, and create basically a pop-up mesh network in the ocean. Tyler: So it can act as a connectivity gateway, through via data link once it’s up there? Steve: Yep, exactly. Tyler: How does the submarine stay connected to it? Steve: I would leave that to our customers to answer. Tyler: It has a beyond line of sight capability, generally speaking? Steve: So, it can be programmed to go to wherever you want it to go. Tyler: Right. On autopilot, right? On a pre-disposed, pre-planned course, but they can fly it man-in-the-the loop if they’re within line of sight, correct? Steve: If they maintain line of sight, yes. Tyler: Has it been looked at to carry electronic warfare or decoys payloads, or any other sort of secondary uses? I’m sure you can put different payloads on it, right? Steve: It, like other members of the tactical missile systems family and our small UAS, it really does offer lots of possibilities with the modularity of payloads and interchangeability of payloads and the batteries, for example, but our customers haven’t really gone into that level of detail and we won’t either at this point. Tyler: With Switchblade and Blackwing, because they’re so related, have you looked at using the airframes to create swarms… Disposable swarms of drones that are networked together and work cooperatively? Steve: We actually also developed a multi-pack launcher for Switchblade, which can house up to nine or 12 different Switchblades. Imagine a large box. And that’s really useful, for example, in a forward operating base, where the military forces that are occupying that FOB may not want to expose themselves to enemy fire, but they may be taking fire. So, rather than they all get up and put their selves at risk to try to find, fix, and defeat the enemy, with a multi-pack launcher, they could actually stay in a secure area, launch one or more Switchblades and target them to the threat that they’re facing. So in a way, that’s a kind of an answer to the question you’re providing or you’re asking. It enhances the capability of the warfighter and takes advantage of the capabilities of a Switchblade system. You can watch a short video from Aeroviromant about the multi-pack launcher and how the company’s reconnaissance drones like Puma can work with Switchblade to prosecute targets in the maritime environment here . Tyler: Any way of looking at infusing autonomy into that swarming concept where they can work cooperatively together? That might not be for attacking targets on the ground, but for surveillance of different types, or anything of that nature? Steve: Well, as I mentioned before, we’ve got a good number of people focused almost entirely on underlying technologies that will enable different levels of autonomy. Our systems already have levels of autonomy, basic levels as some would describe. But our road map calls for much higher levels of autonomy that are going to enable multi-domain operations across dynamic battlefields, and some very interesting capabilities that we think our customers are gonna find quite valuable. Tyler: What does the Switchblade cost? Steve: We’ve not disclosed that… It’s a very competitive space. Tyler: So you’re talking about sea launch, like a submarine launch, which is a very challenging environment… Are you looking into an air-launch variant of any of these or other systems? Steve: One of the big differences between our tactical missile systems, Switchblade and Blackwing, for example, and our tactical unmanned aircraft systems is, in the TUAS part of our business, all of our fixed-wing assets are portable and rely upon an individual tossing them in the air to get them into flight. They can land. They do a deep stall landing and they just almost vertically land in a very confined area, so getting them down is not an issue. But once you automate the launch process, the launch sequence, by putting it into a tube and making it a push-button launch mechanism, that launch tube can be installed in a wide variety of platforms. Submarine is one example, a multi-pack launcher is another. We have a TMA agreement with General Dynamics Land Systems, where we’re working with them to integrate Switchblade into a next-generation armored vehicle system for a new Army program. So in that concept, think of it as… where a convoy of armored vehicles are heading into a town. Before they even get there, the commander can actually launch a small UAS to scout the road ahead and see if there are any threats, and if they find a threat, they can then launch a couple of Switchblades to neutralize those threats before the convoy gets in harm’s way. And be able to follow up on it… Tyler: And being able to also ‘look over a wall,’ right? That’s kind of the biggest thing, right? To be able to just look behind things? Steve: Look over a wall, on top of a building, behind obstacles, behind a corner. Well, you name it. The other relationship we’ve developed is with Kratos, whom I suspect you’re familiar with… We’re working with Kratos to equip their unmanned fighter jets with Switchblade systems, so that those Switchblades would effectively be air-launched from that system… Using a flyer, they could be transported a great distance in a short amount of time, and then be deployed to neutralize any number of targets, whether they be human threats or infrastructure, or whatever. Whatever the need is. Tyler: You could just think of the disruption of enemy air defenses. I’m sure you could put an RF Seeker on it… Are you talking about XQ-58? Are you talking about the Valkyrie drone? Steve: It’s that program, yeah. Tyler: We’ve seen sort of the democratization, I don’t know what to call it exactly, of drone technology via it moving to the commercial space. Where you guys were innovative with Switchblade years ago, and now the enemy has figured out, “Well, we can take a commercial drone that we can buy for 1,500 bucks and make it a weapon.” Where do you see that going in the future? Obviously, I’m sure you guys have an eye on it with the Iranian attacks and everything else. Can you comment a bit about that, and where the company sees that space heading in the future, and how is the best way we can defend against such threats? Steve: Let me begin by taking a giant step backwards. If we look ahead five, 10, 15 years in the future, it’s hard to imagine a future where drone technology does not become pervasive in society. And that means delivering goods, delivering people, surveilling borders, scanning pipelines and power lines in remote areas that are difficult to get to, and monitoring traffic, you name it. There are so many applications where drone technology that’s obviously proven to be safe and reliable, combined with regulations in unmanned traffic management schemes, can enable all kinds of benefits for society. Similarly in the military domain, we’ve talked about a number of ways, what we’re working on, that have the potential to dramatically help our warfighters and those of our allies operate more safely, more effectively, and also much more accurately. Because we, our country, cares a lot about the people who are not in the fight, making sure that if possible, we can avoid the collateral damage that is often an unfortunate byproduct of warfare. So, these technologies can find their way into lots of different places. But to your point, that means that Pandora’s Box is open. That means all kinds of people can use drone technology for all kinds of things. And in addition to making sure that what our forces use and what we deploy in the national airspace for commercial operations or war operations are safe and reliable and effective, we have to be very cognizant of how the technology can be used against us. As you know, there’s a lot of investment going into counter-drone technologies and ideas, and we’re tracking mostly with that, we understand that space very well. We haven’t really talked about anything we’re doing there, but let’s just say we understand it well. We believe that that’s going to be an important part of the mix. Being able to defend against adversaries using that against us is important. Tyler: On drones, just the design of them, you look at your team’s products and they’re really different-looking. They have a unique look to them visually. There have been some moves to be able to better mask drones from the enemy and one of them is to make drones look a little bit more like biological lifeforms, birds mainly. Have Aerovironment played around with that, trying to take a Switchblade type of concept and making it look more like something that would just be in an environment that wouldn’t draw so many eyeballs? Steve: Have you ever seen the Nano Hummingbird, robotic hummingbird drone? Tyler: Yeah. Steve: So we invented that. That was a DARPA project, but DARPA came to us with that same question, “We want you to develop a drone that looks and operates like a hummingbird,” and we created that demonstrator in about 2011, we showed it and it generated all kinds of interest. Now, that’s not a product, but it gives a sense for nanoscale, what you could possibly do to develop sort of a drone employing biological mimicry. In terms of disguising any of our existing products to look like any other thing, we’re pretty focused on doing the things you see in front of you, the products you see on our website. There are certainly a number of other things that we do that we can’t talk about. But by and large… I’m not aware of any concerted effort to disguise any of our products to make it look like something they’re not. Tyler: Let’s talk about High-Altitude Pseudo-Satellites… Obviously, there’s a huge commercial side of this, massive potential. But when we look at it from a defense side, is this something that could be used, say, with space being so contested… Could these systems be used to potentially replace certain communication capabilities or other satellite capabilities, like during a time of conflict? Steve: We believe there are a number of potential applications for the technology. We think of it as a near-space asset above the clouds, above most air traffic that basically provides a platform. And on that platform, this platform is capable of carrying a certain amount of weight, size and provide a certain amount of power. So the commercial example is the Hawk30 that we’re developing for our joint venture with SoftBank that’s called HAPS Mobile, Inc that will carry a telecom payload into the stratosphere at about 65,000 feet and dwell there for months, acting as a stratosphere cell phone tower. But you can imagine other kinds of payloads, whether they’d be remote sensing or communication or peering over the horizon types of things, or even looking up into space. There are all kinds of things and ideas out there that really provide a new value position because it’s so high. Command of the Earth below is very, very large. So, for example, the Hawk30 for telecom has a footprint of about 200-kilometer diameter, a circle 200-kilometer diameter. It’s a very big area to operate over. Obviously, depending on the payload, that can either be larger or smaller, depending on what’s needed. So, one example of how a Hawk30 or a solar HAPS system could be deployed would be with a carrier battle group. Imagine it has its own carrier battle group satellite system dwelling overhead, providing network communications and remote observation and sensing over a very large distance. That is one example that would apply to the military. Tyler: Just the networking ability to create an active net over the battlespace without depending on satellites, I mean you can place them anywhere. It’s just massive potential. Steve: That’s right. Tyler: How long can they stay up there? What sort of endurance do those craft have? Steve: Well, what we’ve said is it’s designed to dwell for months in the stratosphere… We haven’t put a specific number on that yet. We’re in the test flight phase, the flight demonstration phase. We announced the first two successful test flights and we’ll look to announce subsequent test flights at the appropriate time. Yeah, you could imagine the applications, the same thing could apply, let’s say there’s an operation in some part of the world where there’s not a great deal of connectivity or satellite availability overhead, simply re-deploying one of these assets over that area for the duration of that operation could be extremely helpful, whether it’s for network comms or for remote observation or other types of payloads. https://youtube.com/watch?v=U4vNwT8Paco Tyler: Are you seeing enhanced interest in it now that the space domain is becoming so openly contested? Steve: Well, so I’m not in a position to speak to how… From renewed interest of space is influencing the reaction to this platform. The benefits of this platform stand alone; incremental bandwidth, remote observation, 24/7 surveillance capability, all those kinds of things are very valuable to a wide variety of customers, whether there’s a lot going on in space or not. So we think that stratosphere is an un-tapped resource and we are aiming to be the ones to unlock that and then be able to deploy the technology in conjunction with our partners for the commercial market, and then on our own or with other partners, as the case may be, in the defense market. Tyler: What type of altitudes are we talking about when it’s up there on station? Steve: 65,000 feet. Tyler: So Global Hawk territory… Definitely is a lot of line of sight up there… Where do you see the industry heading on the defense side? Both in terms of the lower-tier end of the drone space and just in general? Where do you see things heading in this unmanned space that’s become so dominant in our everyday lives? Steve: Well like I said earlier, it’s hard to imagine a future where unmanned systems are not ubiquitous in society. We have been able to pioneer these market segments of tactical unmanned aircraft systems, tactical missile systems, and HAPS, and we believe we’re at the very, very early stages of adoption in those. Obviously that’s the case in HAPS because we’re still in the development stage, but even with the kind of reach we’ve achieved in tactical and aircraft systems, we sell to all branches of the U.S. DOD, 45+ allied customers around the world. We currently only sell the Switchblade to the U.S. government and that’s not yet been approved for export, but we believe at some point that capability is just going be too valuable not to be almost everywhere in every military force around the world, especially because at the tactical end of it, it’s much more affordable than the much larger, much more costly systems like the one you mentioned, at the high-altitude. Not a lot of countries can afford those. So as we introduce more capabilities, we’re constantly developing new innovative systems. We’re really fortunate to be living at the intersection of these four future lining technologies of robotics, sensors, software analytics, and connectivity, and to be able to develop these advanced solutions to integrate those and take advantage of the developments in other industries such as smartphones with batteries and sensors and software development and put those together in very robust and reliable solutions that ultimately, when a warfighter reaches into the rucksack to pull out a Raven system, they’ve gotta know it works, and their lives may very well depend on that. So developing more capabilities that go into those systems like the ones we talked about before, whether it be enabling operations in denied airspace against great peers or delivering specific kinds of payloads to different areas, there’s going be a lot more of that in the future and we’re fortunate to be in a very sweet spot in the market to help create that reality. Tyler: Your company is probably known best for devolving the unmanned aerial capabilities down to the individual warfighter, at least from my perspective. Do you see that becoming maybe even a larger trend in the decade that we’re in now, in the near future?… Basically what I’m saying is are we going to move further away from high-end platforms like say an F-16 that needs to hit a target with a $30,000-$40,000 laser-guided bomb in support of ground troops when you can do it with a Switchblade by a guy right there on the front line. Do you see that as the strategy going forward or where do you see your company in that area? S teve: So you mentioned a term earlier that we use a lot to describe what our innovations have done, the democratization. In our sense, it’s democratizing the access to information and the ability to take action. So if you think about what our small unmanned systems or tactical systems like Raven and Puma, and Wasp have done, those are to, let’s say reconnaissance satellites, what smartphones are to mainframe computers, if you follow the comparison. Mainframes were few and far between, extremely expensive, very limited in access, and someone else controlled them, just like the strategic assets. Smartphones are in your pocket, so any time of the day, if you need to find out who won the 1962 National League Playoffs, you can find that out now. Information is democratized all of a sudden. That’s precisely the way our unmanned aircraft systems are operating on the front line. If we’re a squad somewhere and we come across some obstacle and we wanna know whether we need to go right at the fork or left at the fork, we don’t have to take the chance, we don’t have to wait for some other asset to be made available that may be two hours away and the situation can change dramatically. We can simply deploy a Raven, and in a couple of minutes, we’ll know the answer and we can make the decision, and the outcomes are much better. Similarly, if we come under fire from a sniper somewhere, we’re gonna duck and cover, and we can either call in an Apache from some base if it’s indeed available, and if it is, it’s likely not gonna be there right away, or you can send me out there and put me in harm’s way and I can just see if I can find the threat. Now with Switchblade, you can deploy it, find a threat and neutralize it before the sniper has the ability to blend into the countryside, for example. So, that democratization of the access to situational awareness and actionable intelligence and the ability to respond quickly and accurately with a precision strike is kind of like taking an air squadron from the deck of a carrier and putting it in your rucksack, if you think about it broadly. We’re not saying for a minute that it replaces the other, but it takes airpower and puts it into the rucksack with a very tactical reach. Similarly, integrating these systems as I described into armored personnel carriers or armored vehicles takes an air squadron and puts it on a vehicle. This air squadron is small, it is relatively low-cost compared to other air—actually fraction of the cost of other aircraft. Not anywhere near the same capabilities, but enough capability to dramatically extend what those small teams can do and how they can keep themselves safe on the frontline. https://youtube.com/watch?v=kt7CtJp2Sr0 Tyler: On deploying drones from combat vehicles, are you looking at adapting to this space in any unique ways in the future, such as tailoring capabilities to urban combat? Steve: Well, certainly, we’re very much aware that the COIN [counter insurgency] threat environment that we’ve been facing for the last 19 years will remain. That’s not going away, but in addition to that, we’ve got to be prepared for the next fight which may very well end up being against a peer or near-peer and that could very well involve more urban types of battle and operating environment. So, definitely we are looking at that and planning for that, and investing in the development of capabilities that are going to help our forces succeed in that. I would point out that the investment piece is really important. Unlike many traditional defense companies, we invest a very, very high percentage of our revenue every year in internally funded R&D, typically between 10% and 12%, and we also tend to attract up to 20% in customer-funded R&D. So at any given time, there’s a great deal of research and development going on in our company that’s working on the capability that I’ve been talking about to address the next threat down the road. Tyler: I think that we’re missing the human element in this discussion… A lot of times it’s the guys on the frontline that are controlling these systems. What new technology or maybe even off-the-shelf technology are you looking at or is in development to make that interface between man and unmanned system even better? Is it VR goggles, is it an Xbox controller? Is there anything new that’s coming that will help you make it even easier for a soldier to pull out a Switchblade or a Raven and put it to use? Steve: Oh yeah, absolutely. We’re very much aware that the ground control configuration that we’ve had in place for the last 15 years is not what’s gonna be needed for the next 15 years. And we’re actively involved in defining and developing the next kind of user experience and interface that will make it easier for frontline warfighters to get any information they need or take the actions they need. Because ultimately, that’s what it’s about. We’ve gotta put as little space as possible between the warfighter and the information they need to make better decisions, or the action they need to take to preserve lives and property. And we’re currently looking at ways of doing that… Keep following us, and in the not too distant future, we’ll probably be able to talk more about that. Tyler: Is there anything else you’d like to add that we missed, or anything else you’d like to get across to readers as far as what your company does and what’s on the horizon? Steve: Few people may be aware of our company. It’s hard to know really. Many people I talk to are, a lot of people aren’t. But what we’ve done and the market segments we’ve pioneered and are now leading really make a difference to those warfighters. We get emails and letters all the time from people who said because of our technology, they or their comrades have been able to go home, or they avoided a very bad situation. To be able to deal with the most cutting-edge technologies and from our engineer’s perspective, create these incredible capabilities that ultimately help save lives is really important to us. We believe that what we do is very important, we take it very seriously. We’re very proud of our role supporting the military, our military, and those of our allies. If you think what we’ve done in the past and up-to-date is interesting, wait till you see what’s coming.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 21, 2021",Here Are The Names Space Force Rejected In Favor Of Calling Its New Units “Deltas”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Space Force , America’s newest military branch, is now just over six months old. Already, the fledgling service has been working hard to create its own distinct identity and esprit de corps, especially in relation to the U.S. Air Force, where most of its initial personnel and resources will come from. This has included the creation of new insignias, and flags emblazoned with them, and service-specific uniform items . Just last week, the Space Force took another step forward in this regard when it offered the first concrete details about its new core organizational structure, which will have three main echelons of commands. At the top will be various field commands run by general officers, starting with Space Operations Command (SpOC), Space Systems Command (SSC), and Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM). At the lower level, there will be squadrons, just like in the Air Force. In between, in place of what the Air Force would call wings, Space Force will have newly named “deltas.” However, that wasn’t the only name the service considered. “Deltas … will be organized around a specific function – operations, installation support, training, etc,” an official Space Force statement said. “Within the deltas will be squadrons focused on specific tactics.” Space Force says it named this new tier of units after “the triangular symbol often used in space logos,” according to Air Force Magazine . This decision seemed somewhat curious given that it has no particular claim to the use of deltas as heraldic devices within the U.S. military, which are regularly found in Air Force insignias , as well. This is to say nothing of the name U.S. Army’s extremely famous, if top-secret Delta Force . The seal of the US Space Force, which has a very prominent delta in the center., US Space Force Deltas are very common symbols, especially for space-related organizations, with the national space agencies of China , Russia , India , and Iran , among others, all using them in some fashion. Even NASA’s present logo has a central delta motif . The word “delta” is already used in and outside the U.S. military, as a whole, to refer to a wide variety of things, from statistical deltas to the word in the phonetic alphabet for the letter d, too. With all this in mind, The War Zone reached out to the Space Force to try to get more information about the decision-making process, as well as what names it passed over in favor of deltas. “The organizational structure is just one of many decisions that are being considered as part of the stand-up of the U.S. Space Force,” Lynn Kirby, a Space Force spokesperson explained. “The planning is being done by military and civilian personnel assigned to the Department of the Air Force. “Salaries are paid out of the Military Personnel account (active duty) and Operations and Maintenance account (civilian),” Kirby added when asked about how much it cost in time and resources for Space Force to settle on the name delta. “We do not track funding or manpower by task.” Kirby also provided a list of rejected names, which are as follows: Armada Array Brigade Cohort Cluster Constellation Division Fleet Legion Nebula Orbit Port Sat/Satellite Star Team Vanguard It’s not difficult to understand how some of these got cut. Brigade and division are unit types better associated with ground-based units in the Army and U.S. Marine Corps. Fleet similarly already has a clear association with the U.S. Navy. Team is a term widely used for very small units within the U.S. military. Some of these, such as Array and Port, are just bland. But it is hard not to feel like Space Force missed out with some of these other options. For a service that will have a SpOC (Space Operations Command) – which will be pronounced “spock” like the name of the iconic character from the Star Trek universe , whether its officially sanctioned or not – and a STARCOM, it’s unclear why the more obviously space-themed names got passed over. This is who people are going to think of when they hear Space Force officials talk about the SpOC., CBS Studios Inc. There doesn’t appear to be any particular reason for Space Force not to have picked some of the other options that might have seemed at least inspired by popular media, either. The Air Force already has things like Kessel Run and Kobayashi Maru , software incubators with official nicknames lifted wholesale from Star Wars and Star Trek , respectively. When the Space Force revealed its own insignia in January, people immediately began talking about its similarities to the logo for Star Trek ‘s fictional Starfleet , even though it was clearly repurposed from the one previously used for Air Force Space Command . With unit names like 1st Legion or 10th Vanguard, the service would certainly have set itself very clearly apart from its sister services. From left to right, the insignias of Air Force Space Command, US Space Force, and Star Trek ‘s Starfleet Command. , USAF/US Space Force/Memory Alpha Whatever the exact reasons why Space Force went with delta in the end, it still has important naming left to do. In February, it solicited suggestions from across the U.S. military for what to call personnel assigned to the service, just like the Air Force has airmen, the Army has soldiers, the Navy has sailors, and the Marines have, well, Marines. New names for ranks, including for officers at the O-6 grade – colonels in every service but the Navy and the Coast Guard, where they are called captains – who will command the deltas, are coming, too. The Air Force notably did something similar to help pick the name for the future B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The author was among those responsible for prompting the release through the Freedom of Information Act of the full list of rejected names for that aircraft, which included submissions like Bomber McBombface and Chuck Norris. It will certainly be interesting to see what Space Force ends up calling the personnel assigned to its deltas and other units. In Netflix’s Space Force show , they’re called spacemen. We also now know what could have been when it comes to the name of the service’s middle echelon units. Be sure to let us know what you think of the decision to choose delta and what other terminology you think Space Force should adopt in the future in the comments below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2019",Navy To Add Laser Weapons To At Least Seven More Ships In The Next Three Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy expects to have eight warships, in total, equipped with the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy , or ODIN, a laser directed energy weapon system, within the next three years. One Arleigh Burke class destroyer, the USS Dewey , is already equipped with ODIN, which The War Zone was first to report on last year. Frank Peterkin, the Senior Technologist for Directed Energy at the Office of Naval Research (ONR), disclosed this general schedule for deploying the next seven ODINs across the Navy’s fleets during an online discussion on July 7, 2020. Booz Allen Hamilton hosted the panel discussion as part of a slate of virtual programming in lieu of its annual Directed Energy Summit, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’ve been working hard for the last five to seven years to try to bring directed energy forward in a meaningful sense to the warfighter and the operational community while at the same time advancing the technology,” Peterkin explained. “The warfighters in those communities have to actually be touching these weapons, using them, seeing them work.” ODIN is one of a number of laser directed energy weapons the Navy has in development now as part of its larger Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLFoS) effort. While the service expects to field many of these systems, it also expects them to serve as stepping stones to more powerful laser weapons down the line. A general breakdown of the Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLFoS) effort., USN While its exact power class is unclear, ODIN features a relatively low-powered laser and is designed to work as a dazzler to blind electro-optical and infrared optics. This could be used to confuse optical or imaging infrared seekers on incoming weapons, such as anti-ship cruise missiles, throwing them off course. It could also neutralize cameras used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) purposes on other ships, manned aircraft, and drones. The Navy has actually publicly said that an urgent request from U.S. Pacific Command for a way to shield its ships against the prying eyes of potential adversaries was the main driving force behind the installation of the first ODIN on the Dewey . Pictures first emerged in September 2019 of that destroyer fitted with the dazzler and the service publicly confirmed that the ship was equipped with the system in February 2020. “The Pacific Fleet Commander identified this urgent Counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance need and the Chief of Naval Operations directed us to fill it as quickly as possible,” Navy Commander David Wolfe, head of the directed energy office within the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems. “The NSWC [Naval Surface Warfare Center] Dahlgren Division team did an amazing job addressing challenges and keeping our accelerated schedule on track and moving forward to deliver this capability.” It’s worth noting that, also in February, a post appeared on the Navy’s official Instagram account warning the Chinese military that “you don’t want to play laser tag with us.” This followed the service’s announcement that a People’s Liberation Army Navy destroyer had aimed a laser beam at one of its P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes in the Philippine Sea that same month. This is just one of a string of reported instances of People’s Liberation Army forces shining lasers in potentially dangerous ways at U.S. military aircraft, as well as those belonging to American allies, in the Pacific region and elsewhere . Iran also routinely uses unmanned aircraft to surveil Navy ships, including amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers , in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and the Strait of Hormuz, which links those two bodies of water. ODIN could be useful addition to the service’s ship operating in those areas, among others , as well. As already noted, ODIN is just one of the new laser directed energy weapons the Navy has in the works now. In May, the service announced that the San Antonio class landing platform dock USS Portland had successfully employed its own new Mk 2 Mod 0 Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD), a much more powerful 150-kilowatt class design, to actually shoot down a small drone during a test. Northrop Grumman developed the Mk 2 Mod 0 as part of the Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program. There is also the High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance ( HELIOS ) project, which is working on a 60-kilowatt class laser weapon that will also be capable of knocking down smaller unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as functioning as a dazzler, just like ODIN. Lockheed Martin is developing the HELIOS system. An artist’s conception of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer employing the High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) system., Lockheed Martin The Navy has not said exactly what additional ships it wants to arm with any of these systems, but it has expressed an interest in integrating them on more Arleigh Burke class destroyers, as well as Littoral Combat Ships , in the past. There is a clear desire to add these kinds of directed energy capabilities to a wide variety of other ships, too. “There have been discussions [about] even putting lasers on aircraft carriers,” ONR’s Peterkin said during the recent remote panel discussion. Beyond that, the Navy’s plan to field more ODIN systems and other laser weapons only underscores the progress that the services had continued to make in the directed energy realm, while other services have hit setbacks in their own efforts. “We’re in a little bit of a golden age for collaboration now for directed energy,” Peterkin said. As it stands now, Navy ships leaving for deployments armed with laser weapon systems looks to set to become an increasingly normal affair.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Oct 20, 2020",Sweden’s Saab Launches Gripen Fighter Jet Component Production In Brazil,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Swedish aviation firm Saab has started building parts for its new Gripen E fighter jet in South America. Saab Aeronáutica Montagens (SAM), the firm’s first aerostructures plant outside of Sweden, has started production of key sections of the new fighter. The news represents a welcome boost for the Brazilian aerospace industry, which is experiencing unprecedented hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tail units and front fuselages of the single-seat Gripen E are the first components to enter into production at SAM, which is located in São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. Subsequently, speed brakes as well as wing box and front fuselage sections for the two-seat F model will also be made here. These will then be delivered to the final assembly facilities at the Embraer plant in Gavião Peixoto, São Paulo, Brazil, as well as to Linköping, Sweden. In 2014, Saab signed a contract with Brazil for 36 Gripen E/Fs, which that country has designated as F-39E/Fs with an additional requirement for 72 jets. The Swedish Air Force is also acquiring 60 Gripen Es, which it has designated as JAS-39Es. The first local Brazilian production work comes as Saab continues to make progress with the overall Gripen E/F program. In September 2019, the first Brazilian Gripen E was handed over in Sweden to the customer to begin flight-testing. The prototype two-seat F-model is now getting built in Linköping with Brazilian technicians working alongside Saab employees. Saab won the Brazilian F-X2 competition in December 2013 and is initially supplying 28 single-seat Gripen Es and eight Gripen F two-seaters under a deal worth $4.8 billion. This includes an impressive transfer of technology that fully includes Brazilian defense companies. The project ultimately aims to generate 14,000 direct and indirect jobs. Brazilian test engineers and pilots are currently in Linköping working alongside Saab employees ahead of the first aircraft being ferried to Brazil by the end of this year to join the Gripen Design and Development Network (GDDN). The prototype Gripen F will be delivered to Brazil in 2023 and it is designed to be used as a training platform as well as providing the extra capacity of a weapons systems officer (WSO) for complex mission sets, with both cockpits fitted with a new 19×8 inch touch-screen wide-area display (WAD). Saab is renowned for its technology sharing and strong local industrial participation. Brazilian companies are involved with design and development of hardware and software for the new fighter. As the launch customer for the two-seat Gripen F, Brazil is engaged in a 50-50 split development between Saab in Sweden and the local GDDN. “This is another outcome of the Transfer of Technology [ToT] of the Gripen program. Based on theoretical and practical on-the-job training of Brazilian engineers and assemblers at Saab in Linköping, we were able to establish a highly qualified production line at SAM, following the same standards that we have in our factory in Sweden…” Jonas Hjelm, head of Saab’s Business Area Aeronautics, commented on the start of manufacturing work in Brazil. Next-generation Gripen, now referred to as the Gripen E/F, Saab AB Seven Gripen E test aircraft are now flying, the latest being serial 39-6004, which first flew in Sweden at the end of June. It follows the two-seat JAS 39D aircraft, serial 39-7, which serves as a technology demonstrator. The Gripen E prototype, serial 39-8, made its maiden flight on June 15, 2017, and then serial 39-9 flew on November 26, 2018, with 39-10 flown for the first time on June 10, 2019. Saab flew the first Brazilian Gripen E, serial 39-6001/FAB 4100, on August 26, 2019, at Linköping. The first serial production aircraft, serial 39-6002, flew in November 2019, followed by 39-6004. Aircraft 39-6003 has not yet flown and it recently completed ground-based live-fire testing of the internal 27mm Mauser BK27 cannon. With seven jets now supporting the flight-test program, Mikael Olsson, Saab’s Head of Flight Test and Verification, said the company is engaged in intensive envelope expansion testing in parallel with tactical testing of the Leonardo ES-05 Raven Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, the infrared search and track (IRST) , and electronic warfare system. “We are now preparing to expand the Gripen E test program to include two more test sites,” Olsson added. These are the new Gripen Flight Test Center in Brazil and a joint test facility with the Swedish Air Force and the FMV procurement agency in Sweden, which is set to commence a domestic customer verification and validation program from next year. Sweden currently operates three wings of Gripen C/Ds and it plans to accept the first Gripen E in 2023. Existing Gripen C/Ds are likely to be retained in Swedish service until as late as 2040 to streamline the transition to the Gripen E and also to serve as a stepping-stone between basic fast jet training and the Gripen E on the front line. Sweden recently launched a project to replace its aging Saab Sk60 jet trainers , with a variety of options on the table including the Boeing/Saab T-7A Red Hawk and the Swiss Pilatus PC-21. While the Gripen E has been controversially left out of the competition in Switzerland, and Slovakia has opted for the Lockheed Martin F-16V Viper , Saab is targeting a number of other international customers for export of the new fighter. This includes India, where Gripen E is in competition with a wide array of other fighter jet designs for a huge Indian Air Force contract . Brazil’s F-39 in flight. , Saab AB It is also competing against the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35A in the Canadian Future Fighter Capability Project (FFCP) and it has formed an industrial team that will support its bid for the contract for 88 new fighters to replace its aging CF-18A/B+ Hornets. It includes IMP Aerospace and Defense, CAE, Peraton Canada, and GE Aviation. Public Works and Procurement Canada will select a winner using a formula that assigns 20% to industrial offsets, 20% to cost, and the remaining 60% to the entry’s overall capability. Saab’s head of Gripen business unit Eddy De la Motte said the company’s bid in Canada is “intended to provide not only with NATO-interoperable aircraft, but also [to provide] long-term high-skilled jobs and a made-in-Canada solution”. Meanwhile, Finland’s HX competition is another important target for Saab and its Gripen E/F. The Swedish fighter fits nicely into the Finnish Air Force’s concept of operations for missions from austere road bases, with small conscript teams and minimal infrastructure. Saab has also included its GlobalEye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft in the competition that sees it facing opposing bids from the Lockheed Martin F-35, Boeing F/A-18E/F and EA-18G, Dassault Rafale, and Eurofighter Typhoon. Regardless, Saab has a critical Gripen E/F launch customer and industrial partner with Brazil and there is something to be said that one of the world’s most advanced fighters emanates at least partially from South America.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 1, 2021",Ukraine Cleared To Move Javelin Missiles To Front Lines To Blow Up Russian Tanks “Defensively”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ukrainian troops are now allowed to use their new American-supplied Javelin anti-tank missiles anywhere in the country and against any party, including against Russian tanks in its eastern Donbass region , as long they do so for purposes of defending themselves. This revelation follows the Ukrainian Army’s disclosure that it is preparing to send Javelin-equipped units to the front lines soon. Ukrainian authorities also recently said that they estimate Russia has at least 481 tanks of various types in Donbass, among other heavy weapons. CNN ‘s Ryan Browne Tweeted out about the relatively limited restrictions on how Ukrainian forces can employ the Javelins on July 7, 2020. The Ukrainian Army first received a batch of the missiles, also known as FGM-148s, in 2018. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration delayed the delivery of a second tranche of them until late 2019, which developed into a major scandal and the President’s impeachment. It had been reported in the past that, under the terms of the export agreement with the U.S. government, the Ukrainian Army could only employ these missiles against Russian forces in the event of an overt invasion westward from Donbass. It’s unclear when the current policy took effect. “US officials tell CNN that there are no no [sic] geographic restrictions on where Ukraine can deploy the US-supplied Javelin anti-tank missiles as part of the terms of the agreement under which the US-made Javelins where [sic] provided to Ukraine as long as the weapons are used ‘defensively,'” Browne wrote in his post on Twitter. It’s not clear what the exact definition of “defensively” in this case might mean. The U.S. military’s own definition of what constitutes a defensive action has been shown to be quite flexible on many occasions. For instance, over the years, the Pentagon has described airstrikes in Somalia against Al Shabaab terrorists engaged in firefights with Somali or African Union units, but not Americans troops directly, as being in “ self-defense ” because friendly forces were under attack. The Ukrainian Army could conceivably adopt a similarly broad definition of what constitutes defensive action. For example, a unit in Donbass could conceivably claim to be using Javelins defensively in response to a counter-attack from Russian-backed separatists, or the Russian forces supporting them, after an initial assault. Even if Ukraine adopts a more restrictive definition of defensive use, the missiles will still offer Ukrainian troops on the front lines a major boost in firepower. The Javelin is an extremely capable man-portable anti-tank guided missile that also has a demonstrated capability against troops behind cover and even low and slow-flying aircraft and helicopters. Troops can employ the weapon in one of two modes, one which fires the missile directly at the target and another in which it executes a pop-up maneuver before diving down onto the target. The latter method is particularly valuable for hitting the top of tanks, where they are typically most vulnerable, even with additional defenses, such as active protection systems, as well as other targets tucked away behind hard cover. The complete weapon system also features a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a thermal imaging system capable of 12x magnification, giving it a limited secondary surveillance capability at night, as well as during the day. You can read more about Javelin’s capabilities in this past War Zone piece . The exact parameters for how and when Ukrainian forces in Donbass actually use the Javelins in combat may become more apparent soon. Lieutenant General Ruslan Khomchak, the Chief Commander of Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that the next rotation of Ukrainian Army brigades headed to the region would be equipped with these missiles in an interview that ArmiaInform published on July 2, 2020. “Brigades of the Armed Forces will receive Javelins during the rotation in the combat zone,” he explained. “Currently, one of the brigades is completing training before deployment to the Donbass. I want to make sure that our soldiers can effectively use these ATGMs.” It’s possible that the presence of the missiles, combined with ambiguity over the limitations on the use, might serve as a deterrent to Russia employing its heavy armored forces, at least to some degree. As such, the Javelins could have an impact on the fighting without ever being fired. However Ukrainian troops do or don’t end up using their Javelins in Donbass, the threat of Russian armor is definitely very real. Lieutenant General Leonid Holopatiuk, who is in charge of the Main Directorate for International Cooperation and Verification of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said recently that the Kremlin had deployed approximately 481 tanks of all types to the front in Eastern Ukraine. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7c2LOirOLWI Holopatiuk made those comments during a remote meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Forum for Security Cooperation. The OSCE bloc, headquartered in Vienna Austria, is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Minsk II agreement, which came into effect in 2015 following negotiations involving Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany. Under this deal, Russia is supposed to withdraw all heavy weapons, including tanks and heavy artillery, from Donbass. OSCE officials have documented numerous and clear Kremlin violations of this provision, among others. OSCE Lieutenant General Holopatiuk said that the total Russian force in Donbass, at present, consists of 35,000 personnel spread out among nine brigades, five regiments, and 16 independent battalions. In addition to the tanks, they have around 720 howitzers and an estimated 202 multiple rocket launchers, he added. It’s not clear if Holopatiuk mentioned any other specific capabilities during his remarks, such as Russia’s extensive deployment of electronic warfare assets . OSCE OSCE It’s unclear what the risks might be of the U.S. government getting drawn deeper into the conflict if Ukrainian troops end up killing Russian forces with American-made missiles. Elements of the U.S. military do regularly train with their Ukrainian counterparts , but do so well away from the fighting in Donbass. Regardless, relations between the United States and Russia are cool, at present. Reports emerged recently that a unit of Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, known better by the Russian acronym GRU, offered cash bounties to militants and criminals in Afghanistan to kill American and other coalition troops in that country, though the actual results of the effort remain murky. What is clear is that Ukrainian troops are allowed, at least as far as the U.S. government is concerned, to blow up Russian tanks in Donbass, as long as they do so “defensively” and may have a chance to do so sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 15, 2020",Cognitive Electronic Warfare Could Revolutionize How America Wages War With Radio Waves,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military, like many others around the world, is investing significant time and resources into expanding its electronic warfare capabilities across the board, for offensive and defensive purposes, in the air , at sea , on land , and even in space . Now, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence mean that electronic warfare systems, no matter what their specific function, may all benefit from a new underlying concept known as advanced “Cognitive Electronic Warfare,” or Cognitive EW. The main goal is to be able to increasingly automate and otherwise speed up critical processes, from analyzing electronic intelligence to developing new electronic warfare measures and countermeasures, potentially in real-time and across large swathes of networked platforms. Over the Horizon , an online journal that officers and academics from the U.S. Air Force’s Air Command and Staff College established, published an interesting piece on the principles behind Cognitive EW and the potential benefits of its application on July 3, 2020. The article, which Air Force Major John Casey wrote, is worth reading in full . In addition to presently being a student at the Army Command and General Staff College, Casey has multiple deployments under his belt as an Electronic Warfare Officer on the RC-135U Combat Sent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, giving him a direct operational insight into many electronic warfare issues. The RC-135U, of which the Air Force has just two, is specifically configured to gather electronic and signals intelligence, with a particular focus on collecting data regarding adversaries’ radars. These aircraft scoop up information about electronic signatures to help commanders build so-called “ electronic orders of battle ” detailing the disposition of an opponent’s air defenses. This includes detecting and classifying threat emitters, and pinpointing their locations, among other electronic intelligence-gathering capabilities. A briefing slide explaining the functions of the RC-135U’s crew members, as just one example of the kinds of electronic and signals intelligence that the US military collects on a regular basis. ASE stands for Airborne Systems Engineer., USAF USAF “In the last two decades, the U.S. advantage in the EMS [electromagnetic spectrum] domain faltered due to years of austere budgets resulting in a stagnation of EW systems development. The 17 years of operating in a highly permissive environment inculcated a lack of EMS mindfulness in weapon system development and operational planning,” Casey notes in his piece. “Adversaries, studying how the US fought in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, developed doctrine and weapons to counter the asymmetric advantages in the EMS domain. The US stands now at an EW disadvantage.” The various branches of the U.S. military are mindful of this reality and have all made important strides forward in developing and fielding new electronic warfare systems to conduct electronic attacks , such as jamming enemy radars, communications networks, or incoming threats , as well as those able to defend against those kinds of attacks. Some services, the U.S. Navy in particular , have certainly been more active in this field than others. However, a number of core underlying processes remain unchanged in fundamental ways from how they were carried out at the dawn of modern electronic warfare during the Second World War . While the technology and tactics involved have improved since 1945, various U.S. military assets, such as Casey’s RC-135U, are still charged with probing the capabilities of adversaries and potential adversaries, and grabbing information about signal emitters of all sorts, from radars to radios to data-sharing networks and more. While the crews of the Combat Sents, and other platforms charged with these intelligence-gathering missions, can conduct some initial analysis of this information , or use it for an immediate tactical benefit, such as geolocating enemy forces on the battlefield below, it then typically falls to personnel in specialized facilities to fully exploit that data. A look inside an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, which also has extensive electronic and signals intelligence capabilities., USAF Those analysts and engineers will need to spend time picking apart the intelligence to determine the capabilities of hostile systems and figure out what it might take to counter them. The development of jamming systems on aircraft and ships , for instance, requires knowing things like what radars bands an opponent is using or what signals an incoming missile or some other threat is homing in on. Similarly, this data is necessary to develop new friendly weapon systems that can brush off incoming electronic attacks . The obvious issue is that all of this takes time. In an actual conflict, an opponent may deploy never before seen electronic warfare systems and tactics or use certain types against U.S. forces that might not necessarily have the right weapons or other equipment on hand to mitigate their effects immediately. Those units would remain vulnerable for however long it takes to develop new electronic warfare systems, modify existing ones, or otherwise source the appropriate gear, which might be in short supply, necessary to respond to those emergent challenges. A prime historical example of this is the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile. First employed during the Vietnam War, the seeker head was pre-programmed to home in on a specific radar band or set of radar bands. If a plane was carrying a missile set to zero in on one type of radar, but stumbled upon another, that was just too bad. If the North Vietnamese air defenders were capable of modulating their radars frequencies outside the bandwidth of the seeker, they might be able to escape destruction. In the end, the Navy developed 10 subvariants of the AGM-45A and AGM-45B missiles, each tuned to different bands and with other counter-countermeasures. Planes would fly missions with a mixture of types to give them the best chance of having the one they needed. Needless to say, this was a suboptimal arrangement and subsequent anti-radiation missiles featured broadband seekers and were, as a result, significantly more flexible. An AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile., USAF This is where Cognitive EW comes in. At its most basic, this concept revolves around the idea of being able to detect and categorize the signals that an opponent is using, for whatever purpose, and then use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to help further automate the process of developing countermeasures and counter-countermeasures. A computer system, especially one with an ever-growing library of electronic signature data collected from a wide array of sources, could parse through that information much faster than a human, or even a team of humans depending on the volume of available intelligence, rapidly identifying items of interest for further analysis and exploitation. It may even be able to start doing some of that follow-on work by itself after isolating the important data. “In the near term, proven EW platforms within the land, maritime, air, and space domains would host cognitive EW capabilities as part of their detection and identification suite. Onboard these platforms organically collected and off-board feeds would provide spectrum domain awareness and emitter characterization to these platforms hosting cognitive EW toolkits,” he explains in his article. “Forward and remote operators aided by cognitive EW toolkits would scrutinize the EMS feeds off the sensors to rapidly characterize the spectrum and when necessary, immediately start the development [of] countermeasures.” The basic principles behind Cognitive EW aren’t new, something Major Casey notes himself, but advances in computing, as well as the near-constant miniaturization of that technology, have made it increasingly more practical for use outside of a laboratory environment. As time goes on, the hope is that it will be possible to integrate this technology within electronic warfare systems themselves, allowing them to modulate how they operate automatically and do so extremely fast, even in real-time in the middle of an operation, based on information they’re collecting, as well as receiving from offboard sources via any number of platforms networked together. Casey describes this as the “holy grail” of this capability. “As cognitive EW technology matures, these toolkits would be embedded in forward strike platforms to better sense, identify, attribute, and share the current state of EMS environment between all forces and across all domains,” he continues. “These actions would allow blue forces to rapidly maneuver within the spectrum and denying [sic] the adversary the use of the spectrum that they are not able to recover.” A briefing slide giving a very rudimentary overview of the electromagnetic “domain” as it applies to US Marine Corps operations. This gives a general sense of the areas where Cognitive EW might get applied for both offensive and defensive purposes by the US military broadly., Williams Foundation If one or more branches of the U.S. military isn’t already employing advanced Cognitive EW on some level, there is clear evidence of work that will create a valuable infrastructure to support the concept in the near term. The Navy’s secretive Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors program, or NEMESIS, an effort aimed at developing an entire networked electronic warfare “ecosystem,” sounds particularly well suited for collecting and processing signature information where Cognitive EW systems can start picking them apart and rapidly deploying unified electronic warfare tactics tailored to the situation. This would occur across multi-domains of warfare – air, sea, undersea, and even land -across a diverse array of platforms that are tightly networked together. In effect, creating seamless electronic warfare effects across the battlespace, unlike anything that has come before it. In fact, it is hard to imagine NEMESIS working without some level of advanced Cognitive EW at the center of the architecture. We at The War Zone noted how critical networked EW concepts will be in our exclusive feature on the game-changing NEMESIS program, which you can find here , writing: “As more nations develop and refine their advanced integrated sensor networks, next-generation EW ‘systems of systems’ such as NEMESIS will become more vital to protecting the U.S. and allied assets and for giving them a leg up by being able to directly manipulate what the enemy believes is occurring on the battlespace based on their own sensors’ data. As such, NEMESIS can help level the playing field against increasingly capable sensor networks, whether by blinding certain parts of those networks while spoofing others or by having the enemy fire its treasured weaponry at ghosts in the sea and in the air. Even a formation of what appears to be an incoming bomber force on radar and a puzzling group of bright signatures on infrared sensors could draw the enemy’s attention away from critical parts on a real offensive. … Yes, much of this sounds almost like magic, and it is probably the closest thing the military has to it…” It seems very plausible, if not probable, that some form of advanced Cognitive EW is the engine behind making a concept like NEMESIS a reality. ONR Major Casey also notes that Cognitive EW capabilities could be placed in traditional intelligence processing centers to automate and otherwise help speed up the analysis of new electronic signatures, as well as the creation of new electronic warfare systems or the improvement of existing ones. The increasing use of open-architecture and modular systems that allow for the rapid integration of additional and upgraded capabilities for various pieces of equipment, as well as the introduction of advanced high-bandwidth, long-range communications and data-sharing networks , will make it easier and easier to get those updates to assets in the field on short notice. “Like flakes of gold hidden in a riverbed, the computer would sift the endless flow of signals looking for the signatures of the unknown. These elusive signals are normally flagged by hand with analyst spelunking through the spectrum looking for the traces of the exotic,” Casey says, highlighting how there will still be a need for actual human specialists to support this work. “Eventually, as connectivity between platforms becomes more ubiquitous, detection and countermeasure profiles would be pushed [to operational elements] within minutes and seconds.” The immense potential benefits of Cognitive EW are clear. The entire cycle of developing and fielding countermeasures and counter-countermeasures to hostile electronic warfare capabilities could be dramatically sped up in favor of American forces. It would also help mitigate the sudden appearance of new threats at critical junctures and make it harder for opponents to plan their own warfighting activities in the electromagnetic spectrum. “The EMS knows no limits and the photons do not care about threat envelopes, fire support coordination lines, national interests, or boundaries,” Casey writes in closing his own piece. “Cognitive EW is the first step to create rapid, focused, and unexpected actions within the EMS domain to generate situations in which the enemy cannot react fast enough to overcome the advance.” All told, Cognitive EW holds the exciting promise of being a game-changer for the U.S. military that would revolutionize how American forces operating in the air, at sea, on land, or anywhere else, could exploit the electromagnetic spectrum right in the thick of combat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 23, 2020",The V-22 Osprey Is Perfect For Indonesia And Now They Can Buy Them,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The State Department has approved a Foreign Military Sale of eight MV-22 Block C Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. When the associated support equipment, sustainment, and other items are added up, the total estimated price of the deal is $2B. The sale, if it is executed, will mark the second foreign air arm to purchase the Osprey, with Japan being the first. It would also be a win for the Bell-Boeing consortium that builds the Osprey. The 400th Osprey was just delivered off the 20-year-old production line a month ago. The deal, as it sits now, is pretty much an end-to-end aircraft, support, and training agreement, with the MV-22’s acquisition cost making up just a fraction of the total dollar amount. An MV-22 Osprey costs roughly $75M. Bell According to a State Department Release, the deal includes the following beyond the eight Ospreys themselves: Twenty-four (24) AE 1107C Rolls Royce Engines; twenty (20) AN/AAQ-27 Forward Looking InfraRed Radars; twenty (20) AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning Systems; twenty (20) AN/APR-39 Radar Warning Receivers; twenty (20) AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispenser Systems; twenty (20) AN/APX-117 Identification Friend or Foe Systems (IFF); twenty (20) AN/APN-194 Radar Altimeters; twenty (20) AN/ARN-147 VHF Omni­Directional Range (VOR) Instrument Landing System (ILS) Beacon Navigation Systems; forty (40) ARC-210 629F-23 Multi-Band Radios (Non-COMSEC); twenty (20) AN/ASN-163 Miniature Airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) Receivers (MAGR); twenty (20) AN/ARN-153 Tactical Airborne Navigation Systems; twenty (20) Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS II); twenty (20) M-240-D 7.64mm Machine Guns; twenty (20) GAU-21 Machine Guns; Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS) with unique planning components; publications and technical documentation; aircraft spares and repair parts; repair and return; aircraft ferry services; tanker support; support and test equipment; personnel training and training equipment; software; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, logistics, and technical support services; and other elements of technical and program support. The V-22, although its capabilities don’t come cheap, is particularly well suited for Indonesia, a country that is made up of a whopping 17,000 individual islands spanning thousands of miles. The ability for the V-22 to carry significant loads at turboprop speeds, while still being able to land and take off near vertically will drastically improve the logistics capabilities of the Indonesian military. This is especially true when it comes to natural disasters , which, sadly, the country is no stranger to . Bell The MV-22s will also be a huge boon for supporting operations against radical Islamic groups, such as Jemaah Islamiyah , an offshoot of Al Qaeda, that continue to plague the country. The Osprey will give counter-terror operators far more flexibility when it comes to quickly responding to terror incidents and for executing preemptive counter-terror operations across Indonesia’s highly challenging terrain. The State Department’s announcement continues, stating: “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of an important regional partner that is a force for political stability, and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.  It is vital to U.S. national interest to assist Indonesia in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability. The proposed sale of aircraft and support will enhance Indonesia’s humanitarian and disaster relief capabilities and support amphibious operations. This sale will promote burden-sharing and interoperability with U.S. Forces.” The burden-sharing and interoperability statement in the quote above is key. Having the infrastructure to sustain MV-22 operations in place in Indonesia could come in very handy should the U.S. find itself facing a major crisis in what is already a very tense region . The country’s strategic location between the tense South China Sea and Australia is extremely attractive for obvious reasons. Even Osprey operations that occur in the region today could benefit from such an arrangement. USMC Indonesia has a highly diverse air arm, with aircraft from the U.S., Europe, and Russia filling out its inventory. While the country does have a number of turboprop transports and helicopters of various types on hand, none of them have the Osprey’s unique remote island-hopping over long-distance capabilities. It will be interesting to see if any other countries follow suit when it comes to purchasing the Osprey. The long-awaited Israeli buy doesn’t appear to be in the cards anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean other nations won’t step up. The Royal Navy could really use the V-22 for its two new F-35B equipped carriers , but the funding to see such an acquisition through seems like a long-shot at this point. Bell’s V-280 Valor is also a wildcard. It uses a second-generation tilt-rotor technology and is smaller and potentially more affordable than the V-22, while still offering similar baseline capabilities in some respects. For those that don’t require the Osprey’s rear ramp, heavier load-carrying capability, and hardy maritime attributes, it could potentially bring some nations that had passed on tilt-rotor tech into the fray. This will likely be dependent on the U.S. Army pursuing the type under its own Future Vertical Lift initiative, and the Valor is facing stiff competition for that high stakes program. Bell Other potential Osprey customers exist, but as it sits now, with the USMC , USAF , USN , and Japanese sales, and if this sale to Indonesia goes through, just under 500 Ospreys will be part of the program of record. So, the Bell-Boeing team still has some time to drum up more business before the production line is in serious jeopardy. They are even courting the small head of state transport market with a VVIP variant of the V-22. No, that doesn’t mean a tech tycoon can buy one. The aircraft remains a controlled export through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency and Foreign Military Sale program, so it would be for government executive transport. Then again, there are plenty of countries where the lines between private and government are blurred, especially in the oil-rich kingdoms of the Middle East. Japan’s first V-22 is rolled off a cargo ship. , USMC A ‘VV-22B’ would be the ultimate toy, capable of flying point-to-point, from palace to yacht, in a battle-proven aircraft equipped with the latest communications and defensive countermeasures. But this is also one of the markets the civilian certified AW609 has been trying to target for its long and tortured development , which may finally be coming to an end. While production numbers overall of V-22 aircraft have been remarkably good, foreign adopters of the unique aircraft certainly haven’t been easy to find. The MV-22 remains a highly expensive aircraft to purchase and operate, with less than outstanding readiness figures over its career. These are definitely contributing factors to its lack of international sales, but if you want an aircraft that can land on a dime after flying over 1,000 miles at twice the speed of a normal helicopter, there is still just one choice, at least for now. For missions like search and rescue and some long-range assaults, it is truly a magical machine.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 9, 2021",Here Are Photos Of Two U.S. Navy Carriers In The South China Sea For First Time In Six Years (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time since 2014, the U.S. Navy has two Nimitz class aircraft carriers and elements of their respective strikes groups operating together in the South China Sea . It is a significant show for force in what is arguably the region’s most hotly contested body of water and a clear signal to China, which claims the bulk of it as its sovereign territory. The first-in-class USS Nimitz and her sister ship the USS Ronald Reagan first began conducting exercises together in the South China Sea on July 4, 2020. Carrier Air Wings 17 and 5, aboard the Nimitz and Ronald Reagan , respectively, have also been training together. Ticonderoga class cruisers and Arleigh Burke class destroyers from the two carriers’ strike groups are also present. The Nimitz , which is homeported at Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State, first arrived in the U.S. 7th Fleet’s general area of responsibility in the Western Pacific on June 17. The Ronald Reagan , which is assigned to 7th Fleet, is forward-deployed in Japan. “ Reagan ’s object is ‘Peace Through Strength,’ and that is exactly what her dedicated Sailors bring to this theater,” Navy Captain Pat Hannifin, the commanding officer of the Ronald Reagan , said in a statement . “Committed to our allies and a free and open Indo-Pacific, Reagan brings a flexibility and combat lethality unmatched anywhere in the world. These operations with Nimitz demonstrate that we are but one component of a much larger and equally committed naval force.” USN USN USN USN The last time the Navy sent two supercarriers into the South China Sea was six years ago, when the Nimitz class carriers USS George Washington and USS Carl Vinson , together with portions of their respective strike groups, sailed together there, as well as in the disputed East China Sea further to the north. Dual carrier operations in this region had been relatively rare occurrence even before then, according to the Navy , with the Kitty Hawk class USS Constellation joined the Carl Vinson there in 2001. Having two or more carriers operating alongside each other at once is a major expenditure of resources that makes these kinds of shows of force uncommon, in general. Besides the South China Sea trips, in the past decade, the only other instance of this kind of large-scale exercise in the Western Pacific was in 2017 , when the USS Theodore Roosevelt joined the Ronald Reagan and Nimitz off Guam . Of course, the Navy has had individual carrier strike groups operating regularly throughout the Pacific over the years. That the Navy has two carriers in the South China Sea for the first time since 2014 is also notable since that year the Chinese government’s construction of controversial man-made islands in the region increased significantly. These outposts have grown drastically matured in the interceding seven years and remain a key component of Beijing’s strategy for enforcing its expansive territorial claims in the face of significant international opposition. “Working together with the Ronald Reagan carrier strike group provides advanced, high-end training opportunities that increase our warfighting readiness,” Navy Captain Todd Cimicata, head of Carrier Air Wing 17, said in a statement . “Dual carrier operations demonstrate unique U.S. capabilities, increase carrier strike force command and control experience, and show our commitment to regional allies. Additionally, our operations reinforce the rights, freedoms, and lawful use of the sea and airspace guaranteed by international law.” USN USN USN The U.S. Navy has stepped up so-called Freedom of Navigation patrols , or FONOPs, near China’s outposts in the region, which are intended to challenge Beijing’s claims, in recent years . The service also actively monitored the dispute between Chinese and Malaysian authorities surrounding the operations of the drillship West Capella in the southern end of the South China Sea in May. Malaysia had chartered the ship to conduct explorations of potential undersea oil and natural gas deposits. The activity took part in areas that Vietnam also claims drawing that country into the mix, as well. There has been a number of other notable shows of force aimed squarely at China throughout the Pacific in recent months, as well. This includes the loading of live AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) cruise missiles onto a U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber on Guam during a new short-notice deployment there, part of a new concept of operations for employing that service’s heavy bombers globally , in May. The month before that, U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18C/D Hornets based in Japan had conducted a rare exercise carrying live AGM-48D Harpoon anti-ship missiles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=s3BydbLlF-4 All of this comes amid a particularly low point in U.S.-Chinese relations over a host of issues, including the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Navy has been particularly hard hit by the virus and a major outbreak onboard the Nimitz class carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt raised questions earlier this year about the potential for it to significantly hamper American naval operations, as well as other military activities, in the Pacific and elsewhere. There has also been increasing friction between Chinese and Taiwanese authorities and the tensions emanating from the Chinese government’s imposition of a new draconian security law on Hong Kong . The U.S. military has stepped up FONOPs through the Taiwan Strait, using both warships and aircraft , as well. In June, a Navy C-40A passenger transport actually flew over Taiwan proper , which Beijing considers to be its sovereign airspace, and that same month the U.S. Army released rare video footage of Green Berets training with Taiwanese special operations forces on the island. It’s worth noting that during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis between 1995 and 1996, then U.S. President Bill Clinton dispatched two carrier strike groups to the Western Pacific near that island and had the Nimitz , together with the Tarawa class amphibious assault ship USS Belleau Wood that was also operating in the region, actually sail through the Taiwan Strait. This has been cited as a key factor in the initiation of the Chinese military’s massive buildup and modernization efforts over the last three decades. China’s state-run Global Times newspaper notably ran a piece titled “China has wide selection of anti-aircraft carrier weapons at South China Sea” after Nimitz and Ronald Reagan arrived in the South China Sea on July 4. This focused heavily on the Chinese military’s DF-21D and DF-26 ballistic missiles , which have anti-ship capabilities that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . “The South China Sea is fully within the grasp of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and any U.S. aircraft carrier movement in the region is solely at the pleasure of the PLA,” the story boasted. The presence of the two carriers has now drawn a formal rebuke from the Chinese government, as well. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian decried the exercises, saying the U.S. military conducted them “totally out of ulterior motives” and that they undermined the peace and stability of the region. Of course, authorities in China deny that their own extensive militarization of the region and increasingly aggressive efforts to enforce their territorial claims have any similar impacts. USN China has been stepping up its own naval activity in the Western Pacific in recent months, including exercises involving both of its own aircraft carriers , though not working together like their American counterparts. Just on July 3, the Pentagon had criticized Chinese exercises in the South China Sea as destabilizing. “Conducting military exercises over disputed territory in the South China Sea is counterproductive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability,” a Pentagon statement said . “The PRC’s [People’s Republic of China’s] actions will further destabilize the situation in the South China Sea. Such exercises also violate PRC commitments under the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to avoid activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.” It’s certainly possible that the Navy’s decision to send Nimitz and Ronald Reagan into the South China Sea might now prompt a tit-for-tat response. With all this in mind, it will very interesting to see where the two carriers go after finishing up in the South China Sea and if they head to their next destination together, as well. Update: 4:20 PM EST— An Air Force B-52H bomber also flew a long-range training mission to the South China Sea on July 5, to work alongside the two carrier strike groups. The aircraft from the 2nd Bomb Wing’s 96th Bomb Squadron, based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, subsequently landed at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The entire flight lasted 28 hours. “Bomber Task Force demonstrates U.S. capability to rapidly deploy to a forward operating base and execute long-range strike missions,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Duff, the 96th Bomb Squadron commander, said in a statement. “This sortie demonstrates our ability to reach out from home station, fly anywhere in the world and execute those missions, rapidly regenerate from a forward operating base and continue operations.” “As we operate throughout the Indo-Pacific theater, our Fleet units continue to seek out every opportunity to strengthen our capabilities and proficiency at conducting joint, combined, all-domain operations with our partner teams,” U.S. Navy Commander Joshua Fagan, the Air Operations officer for Task Force 70, U.S. 7th Fleet’s main task force, added.. “Some of the recent events bringing Air Force B-52s and B-1s, Navy aircraft, and our ships at sea together on shared networks in support of integrated missions have been good opportunities for us to exercise the joint mission planning and coordination processes that we depend on to operate safely and effectively out here.” USN USN USN Contact the author: Joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Around The Globe Indo-Pacific News & Features South China Sea"

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Mysterious Military Spy Plane Has Been Flying Circles Over Seattle For Days,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A very unique USAF surveillance aircraft has been flying highly defined circles over Seattle and its various suburbs for nine days now. Nobody at the DoD seems to know who the aircraft belongs to or what exactly it is doing flying so many missions over the Seattle area. But based on its visibly exotic configuration, and information collected by open source flight tracking websites, we can get a good idea of its capabilities and guess as to what it’s up to. The aircraft, which goes by the callsign “SPUD21” and wears a nondescript flat gray paint job with the only visible markings being a USAF serial on its tail, is a CASA CN-235-300 transport aircraft that has been extensively modified for the surveillance mission. You can see more pictures of the aircraft here . SPUD21 has flown roughly a dozen patrols over the Seattle area since arriving there on July 24th. The aircraft still remains at Boeing Field at the time of publishing., Flightaware.com It is covered in a dizzying array of blisters, protrusions, humps and bumps. These include missile approach warning detectors and large fairings on its empennage for buckets of forward-firing decoy flares, as well as both microwave —the dome antenna behind the wing and flat antenna modification in front of the wing—and ultra high-frequency satellite communications —the platter-like antenna behind the dome antenna. A communications intelligence suite also appears to be installed on the aircraft, with the antenna farm on the bottom of its fuselage being a clear indication of such a capability. But what’s most interesting is the aircraft’s apparent visual intelligence gathering installation. It is placed in a fixed position, on the left side of the aircraft, below the plane’s forward emergency door. The rectangle structure has a sliding door that covers the system’s sensors when not in use. On the lower end of the capabilities spectrum, the system installed could be similar to the DB110 reconnaissance system , which can provide very high fidelity imagery of a target area from standoff “slant” ranges. The system, which is popular among F-16 operators in a podded version, can be acquired in varying configurations. Some have multi-spectral fusion capability , where electro-optical and infrared imagery is combined to bring out unique details that neither can see alone. An additional wider angle camera is also available as well, along with an assortment of data-link options that can send the system’s imagery to analysts and “customers” on the ground for rapid exploitation. In this case, the analysts could fly inside the aircraft, eliminating the requirement—or at least the outright need—for such a feature. The DB-110 pod uses a very similar sliding door installation about the same size as the one installed on the CN-235. , UTC Brochure On the higher end of the capability spectrum, the aperture could be filled with a wide area aerial surveillance (WAAS) camera system that can view a large area—the size of a town—continuously at one time. This technology, which allows for tagging of vehicles and other moving objects, and can even be used retroactively to trace someone’s movements over time, is among the biggest surveillance game-changers of our time. You can read all about how it works and its great potential to change everything from how we survey the battlefield to how we solve crimes here at home in this past feature . WAAS camera systems have rapidly evolved over the last decade and have gone from the battlefield to the commercial market here at home. They also now come in all different sizes and capability classes—as well as a variety of interesting sounding names to go with them such as “Gorgon Stare,” “Hawkeye” and “ARGUS” to name a few. In fact, WAAS payloads, which were once the domain of larger aircraft like the MQ-9 Reaper drone and King Air twin turboprop, are now deployable on small tactical drones, such as the “Red Kite” sensor mounted on RQ-21 Blackjack used by Insitu , a Pacific Northwest company that is now owned by Boeing. RQ-21 fitted with WAAS “Red Kite” sensor., INSITU Some WAAS sensors require the aircraft to fly tight overhead orbits, while others work at a slant angle in relation to the ground. Considering the mounting location and aperture size on the CN-235 in question, this kind of “slant” setup would likely be the case. Also, the counterclockwise orbits the aircraft flies, between roughly six and twelve miles across, at altitudes from 17,000 to 22,000 feet, also indicate such a setup. A sampling of tracks from SPUD21 missions around the Seattle area. , Flightaware.com Above all else, these types of surveillance systems are especially good at capturing and monitoring so called “patterns of life” over and around a target area. This is an especially useful tool when collecting intelligence on an enemy target or group of targets over time and can open up new possibilities when it comes to the  process of finding, fixing and finishing the enemy. Simply put, instead of recording a snapshot in time such as what a satellite can furnish, persistent airborne surveillance sensors capture massive amounts of exploitable information over hours and days. So if a picture is akin to a thousand words, this persistent type of wide area aerial surveillance is equivalent to an entire novel or even a series of novels. When paired with communications intelligence gathering, such as intercepting radio communications and mobile and satellite phone chatter, a high fidelity “picture” of a targeted area and how specific targets in that area operate can be compiled in a relatively short period of time, all using a single relatively economical asset. Also, the aircraft’s extensive communications suite can take this information, including streaming video, and send it to a command center around the world or relay it to regional ground stations. As such, it can likely provide high-fidelity overwatch of ongoing special operations mission, and relay that video and/or audio to commanders in real time. Now that we have at least some idea of what this aircraft is likely capable of, the big question is what is it doing over Seattle and its suburbs? And maybe even more important—who is operating it? Aside from what appears to be a weekend off in Portland, Oregon, the aircraft flies its missions out of Boeing Field, and it is operating out of Clay Lacy Aviation, the local fixed based operator (FBO) at Boeing Field, not from Boeing’s military ramp. It is totally common for military aircraft—from fighters to transports—to use local FBOs when traveling away from home. In fact, aircrews often prefer the amenities and ease of access of a high-end private jet center over a nearby military base. Clay Lacy Aviation in relation to the Boeing military flight test ramp at KBFI., Google Maps In Seattle at Boeing Field, Clay Lacy Aviation is famous for its seemingly constant stream of visiting military aircraft—but those aircraft aren’t usually executing highly peculiar surveillance missions over nearby urban areas for days on end. And the fact that the aircraft is not operating from the Boeing military ramp is a very good indication that its mission does not involve the aerospace giant. As such, this also largely eliminates the possibility of Boeing doing some sort of systems integration testing on the aircraft which could have explained some of its strange behavior. As to who sent the aircraft and who even takes ownership of it, those details have turned out to be incredibly tough to pin down. Though it seems indisputable that the aircraft is or at least was U.S. government property at one point based on its Air Force-style serial number, none of the obvious U.S. military organizations claim they are aware of the CN-235 or its activities. Public affairs officers at U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), which oversees American military activities in North America, and its subordinate Joint Task Force-North (JTF-N), both said they weren’t tracking the aircraft or its mission. JTF-N is responsible for handling requests from domestic civilian agencies, such as Customs and Border Patrol, for military support, including contractor-operated surveillance aircraft . The U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) had similarly not been able to determine if the aircraft belonged to one of its units. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) forwarded yet another query on the issue back to AFSOC. In an attempt to simply establish basic ownership, we reached out to the public affairs office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, home of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, which keeps tabs on all of the service’s aircraft. After speaking with a number of individuals by phone and email on the subject, they decided to send our query to the Pentagon’s main public affairs office. The CASA CN-235 is a favorite of militaries and mercenaries around the world. This example was operated in Afghanistan by the US mercenary firm popularly known as Blackwater . , DoD Taken together, these responses would seem to point to what many observers might have already speculated immediately, that this was a mission or training exercise in support of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) or a civilian agency such as the Central Intelligence Agency. This particular CN-235, with the serial 96-6042, is one of six that researchers commonly associated with the Air Force’s top secret 427th Special Operations Squadron. Recent pictures of the other aircraft show they are all in relatively similar configurations at present. The 427th occupies the same space with a host of other “black” U.S. military aviation elements, most of which are affiliated to some degree with JSOC and the Intelligence Community. The War Zone has previously explored what is publicly known about these units in great detail. Of course, the idea of the federal government employing a military aircraft to conduct surveillance within the United States would involve very complex and often controversial legal requirements. Far too complicated to go into detail here, we recommend taking a dive into Lawfare’s extensive writings on the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance activities and related issues, which are tangential and touch on many of the same debates, though are not necessarily directly related to aerial spying. In 2016, BuzzFeed News also wrote an in-depth feature about airborne surveillance programs within the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that gets into many of these questions. In short, if the military placed the aircraft under civilian control to some degree and with an appropriate legal justification, the U.S. military could possibly fly it in support of a domestic operation or one focused on a foreign suspect or organization operating within the United States. SOCOM and JSOC both have had connections to an “alphabet soup” of counter-terrorism elements that may have domestic components since at least 2008 . Official documents refer to organizations like SOCOM-National Capital Region (SOCOM-NCR), the Joint Interagency Task Force-National Capital Region (JIATF-NCR), or simply the Interagency Task Force (IATF), which may or may not be related to each other. Just what these organizations do or whether they are just staffs that coordinate with other U.S. government agencies in Washington or an actual operational headquarters has been unclear—and not just to us. The National Defense Authorization Act for the 2014 fiscal year specifically withheld funding from SOCOM-NCR until the Secretary of Defense submitted a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees that explained, among other things, “the purpose of” and “the activities to be performed by USSOCOM-NCR,” according to a Congressional Research Service report . The official $10 million budget request to establish this particular entity said it would send “liaison officers and Special Operations Support Teams to other federal agencies.” It’s also entirely possible, if not probable, that the aircraft could be involved in a realistic training exercise rather than an actual operation, akin to the annual JADE HELM special operations drill. The special operations community in general has a unique interest in being able to operate in complex urban terrain. Some think these areas will be the primary battlefields of the future . Still, the public is at least tacitly informed about these drills before they begin. NORTHCOM runs its own complex multinational and interagency counter-terrorism exercise each year called Vital Archer. In 2015, the scenario reportedly involved a nuclear or radiological attack . With all this in mind, maybe the CN-235 is part of a secretive set of drills involving terrorists smuggling themselves and their weaponry into the United States via Seattle’s sea or airport facilities. The area could have simply provided a suitable urban area to test existing or new surveillance technologies, too, though this could spark serious privacy concerns if true. Whatever the aircraft has been doing in the Seattle skies, it seems curious that it’s been using civilian airports for the job. But so far, the plane does appear to be doing a good job of hiding in plain sight with no one able to say who even owns it. We will keep you updated if we find out more on this mystery plane and its mission. Update: August 6th, 2017: AFSOC contacted us again stating the aircraft does indeed belong to them and that it is doing “training.” They would not elaborate or did not know what unit the aircraft belonged to specifically or exactly what type of training it was doing and who else was involved.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s seemingly indefinite lease on Guantanamo Bay remains controversial, and the Castro family that continues to rule over Cuba is no fan of its existence. When most people hear the words Guantanamo Bay they probably think of America’s detention center there and the Global War on Terror, but during the Cold War the facility sat at what could have been the edge of World War III. Today the base is still quite active, although no tactical aircraft squadron calls Leeward Point Field at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay home, like VC-10 “Challengers” did up until 1993. The Challengers trace their roots back to World War II, and during the dawn of the Cold War the squadron operated a slew of different aircraft—from flying boat patrol aircraft to jet fighters. Officially, the unit’s permanent tenure at Guantanamo Bay began in 1945 under the designation Utility Squadron 10, or VU-10. Their mission began to morph drastically following the overthrow of the Cuban government by Castro’s communist forces in 1959. Suddenly the unit was on the front lines of the Cold War, and its menagerie of target towing, cargo hauling and sea patrol aircraft was consolidated into a more potent force of F-8 Crusaders and S-2 Trackers. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, VU-10 was the closest American air combat force to what could have been the spark that set off a nuclear inferno. Luckily that spark never flew. VC-10 Challenger F-8K Crusaders high over Guantanamo Bay in the 1960s., DoD By 1965 the squadron was re-designated Composite Squadron Ten, or VC-10, and its roles were multi-fold. They were based in Guantanamo to support nearly constant fleet training exercises in the Caribbean, launching drones, towing targets, acting as targets themselves and as dynamic aggressors for ships’ combat systems operators and other naval aviators to train against. Secondly, they were tasked with the job of keeping an eye on nearby Cuban forces, and if need be, to keep them at bay until aerial reinforcements could arrive—a dubious task at best, a futile one at worst. This mission was executed via regular reconnaissance flights, combat air patrols and air-to-ground training sorties. Close air support and interdiction training often saw VC-10 jets working in conjunction with special operations forces on the ground. At least two aircraft were armed and ready to fly in a matter of minutes at all times should the klaxon sound. During tenser times, many more of the squadrons jets would be on high alert or be in the air patrolling the tight airspace over and around the bay. It was intense stuff to say the least due to the incredibly close proximity to unfriendly forces. VC-10 TA-4J seen in its hi-viz paint scheme. By the mid 1980s this look gave way to an overall light blue-teal aggressor scheme. , USN Eventually the squadron’s F-8 Crusaders and S-2 Trackers gave way to A-4 Skyhawks, namely the TA-4J. This aircraft was the Navy’s advanced jet trainer through the last three decades of Cold War and was not known for its combat prowess, although it was popular with the Navy’s aggressor squadrons. A few other types of A-4s were also mixed into VC-10’s inventory sporadically, including TA-4Fs, and later on, EA-4Fs, the former of which was modified for electronic warfare aggressor duties. VC-10 TA-4J fully armed with Mk20 Rockeye cluster bombs and AIM-9L/M Sidewinders. If a robust incursion into US territory in Cuba were to have occurred, the jets would have flown missions last mere minutes before being quickly rearmed and sent up again. , DoD Even though tensions on the island between the US and the Castro government had subsided a bit by the mid 1970s, VC-10’s secondary defensive mission was still needed. As such, the Challengers’ TA-4Js were somewhat special as they were outfitted for rudimentary combat—able to employ live munitions in combat should they be called upon to do so against marauding Cuban troops who had “jumped the fence.” The Skyhawk flying Challengers executed this mission with 20mm cannon shells, cluster munitions, dumb iron bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinders being their primary arsenal. During the 1980s, under President Reagan’s expansion of the US Navy, VC-10 was in more demand than ever for adversary support duties. The unit’s Skyhawks were constant players during carrier battle group workups and large exercises in the region, alongside their aggressor counterparts VC-8 based at NAS Roosevelt Roads on the island of Puerto Rico. A VC-10 TA-4J gets towed out of the big hangar at Leeward Point Field., DoD Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and as part of the drawdown of US forces across the globe, VC-10 was formally disestablished in 1993.

It also marked the beginning of the last decade of Skyhawk service within the Pentagon’s inventory.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019","Early On, The A-10 Warthog’s Legendary Gun Was Both a Blessing and a Curse","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The A-10 Warthog’s massive 30mm cannon, the GAU-8/A Avenger, is one of the most iconic weapons ever designed and is as famous as the plane that carries it into battle. But as undeniably badass as it is, a closer look at its history reveals that early on, the gun seemed to spend almost as much time trying to kill the aircraft’s pilot as the enemy, producing potentially blinding smoke and fire, fumes that threaten to choke out its engines, and violent vibrations. The Air Force had to find creative solutions to all of these issues in order to make sure the weapon and its flying carriage functioned properly. The Avenger’s story really gets started in 1971 when the U.S. Air Force hired General Electric and Philco-Ford to build competing prototype cannons for a future close air support aircraft then only known as A-X. The two companies would be responsible for building the weapons and ammunition, as well as installing them, along with a linkless feed system and fire control equipment, onto the two A-X prototypes, the Northrop YA-9A and Fairchild Republic YA-10A. “The Air Force understood that the fortunes of the A-X and the GAU-8/A were intertwined, and recognized the importance of the integration effort given four prime contractors, two each for the aircraft and the gun,” retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel David Jacques and Dennis Strouble wrote in an official case study of the A-10’s development. “It was clear by then that aircraft would be designed to accommodate the gun, instead of the gun being chosen to ‘fit’ in the aircraft.” The Northrop YA-9A, USAF As it happened, the prototype GAU-8s were not ready for the fly-off between the YA-9 and YA-10 aircraft. The Air Force provided smaller 20mm M61 Vulcan cannons instead for the fly-off tests to pick the winning airframe, which the Fairchild Republic design ultimately won. As such, Northrop’s entry never actually carried the Avenger. A YA-10A prototype with the smaller M61 Vulcan cannon installed., USAF In 1973, the Air Force picked General Electric as the winner of the separate gun competition with its huge seven-barrel rotary cannon, which weighed in at approximately 700 pounds with its associated components and ammunition feed system. The service briefly considered the single-barrel 30mm Oerlikon 304RK cannon, also known as the KCA, but found it to be substantially less reliable. The sample 304RKs, which received the designation GAU-9/A, suffered, on average, one malfunction for every 900 rounds fired. The Avenger could shoot nearly 10 times as many shots without a stoppage. After settling on the General Electric GAU-8, the firm began the the real work of cramming it into the A-10. Tests on the ground went just fine. It was when test pilots got the first fully-loaded YA-10s into the air in March 1974 that the issues became apparent. The famous shot of General Electric’s GAU-8, along with its ammunition drum and feeding system, next to a Volkswagen Beetle., USAF For context, its important to remember the immense power of the GAU-8. The Avenger spits out nearly 70 rounds every second . Each complete 30mm cartridge is bigger than a typical beer bottle and the projectiles alone – either full of high explosive and an incendiary mixture or an armor piercing design with a depleted uranium core – weigh three quarters of a pound. It takes two hydraulic motors to spin the barrels and work the system. When the pilot pulls the trigger, the gun breathes literal fire and shakes and rattles the airframe. It spews huge clouds of hot gun gas full of particulate matter as it makes its signature “BRRRRT!” sound. There’s a long-standing urban legend that the shooting actually slows the plane down. According to Jacques and Strouble, the most immediate issue was that the muzzle flash simply blinded the pilot, which could be dangerous even in a shallow dive at a relatively slow speed at low altitude. The gasses left dark soot on the windscreen, as well as the fuselage, that eventually blocked their view, too. To deal with the latter issue, the A-10 has a window-washing function. A switch on the right hand side of the cockpit triggers the 30-second wash cycle, according to an official 1988 flight manual . Using cooled bleed air from the auxiliary power unit, the system floods the windshield with cleaning fluid for six seconds, followed by another 24 seconds of just air to “purge” the liquid. The same burst of air can clean rain at low speeds, too. “The windshield wash system should not be used anytime forward vision is essential since forward vision is obsured [sic; obscured] during the wash cycle,” the manual warns in a somewhat ironic twist. This great picture shows just how dirty a Warthog can get from firing its main gun., USAF Repeated firing shook the gun mounts so much that parts galled, a process by which the repeated friction causes separate metal components to adhere together. As one test report noted , this had no impact on the aircraft’s ability to fly or fire the gun, but made it especially difficult to get the GAU-8 out of its compartment for routine maintenance. More worrisome, the gasses, which contained no oxygen, had a tendency to flow up over the aircraft’s wing and into its engines, threatening to choke them out. In addition, the particles in the fumes might contain unburned gunpowder, which could cause flameouts, or would build up in the engine turbines, both potentially serious issues. A photo of an A-10 with the early, angular gas diverter., Keith Svendsen via network54.com One immediate attempt to fix the issue simply involved lengthening the barrels to try and dissipate the blast and disperse the gasses, as well as switching from copper bonding in the ammunition to plastic to make the resulting debris less dangerous. It didn’t work, though the plastic bands turned out to help reduce wear and tear on the barrels and became standard. For more than a decade work continued on other potential solutions. We know that the Air Force designed at least three gun gas deflector concepts, which were supposed to help mitigate the blast and keep the fumes away from critical components. An initial design simply added an angular shield to the end of the nose. A more refined gas diverter nose., Keith Svendsen via network54.com A more polished design extended the overall shape of the nose, entirely encapsulating the cannon’s muzzle and leaving just a slit for the gun to shoot through, also turning the Warthog into more of an ant eater, aesthetically speaking. We don’t know what happened to these configurations, but they could have disrupted the aerodynamics of aircraft, upset its balance, or caused all new vibration issues while the gun was firing. Keith Svendsen via network54.com There was a third and much less involved gas diverter that simply attached to the GAU-8’s muzzle, giving it an even more sinister appearance . Defense contractor Battelle built this piece of equipment, known as the GFU-16/A, which contained two sets of baffles. It caused added stress on the nose, leading to significant cracks. One report from 1986 said the problem wouldn’t necessarily impact flight safety, but presented a significant maintenance burden. The Battelle muzzle device., Corbin H. via network54.com In the end, none of the gas diverter designs made it beyond testing. The Air Force settled, in part, on a revised propellant mixture for the ammunition that helped reduce some of the issues. But according to the documentary Against All Odds: The Story of the A-10 , the ultimate solution was both crude and ingenious. Since the most significant issue is the gasses getting into the engine and causing it to give out, when the pilot in a Warthog pulls the trigger, it continually trips the ignition system. So, even if the engine does stop suddenly, it immediately restarts. All of this work to mitigate the impact of the gun on the A-10’s airframe and engines is an amazing concession of aircraft design to one single component. It’s testament to the fact that the gun was just as important as the plane itself, if not more so. With this in mind, it’s no surprise really there have been attempts, although largely unsuccessful, to work similar capabilities onto other existing tactical aircraft .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",America’s Startling Short Range Air Defense Gap And How To Close It Fast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is no doubt about it, the U.S. military has let its short range air defense (SHORAD) capabilities wither on the vine. It seemed as if America’s air superiority advantage combined with 1990’s battle doctrine just didn’t require much in terms of ground forces being able to defend themselves from aerial attack, especially while on the move. Two wars in permissive aerial environments—Afghanistan and Iraq—didn’t help the SHORAD cause either, nor did the budget cuts of the current decade. But the tactical realities of the modern battlefield have changed, and it turns out that the Army, and the USMC for that matter, do need SHORAD capability and they need it bad. The Pentagon’s combat doctrine has morphed drastically in recent years, with troops on the ground possibly being tasked with operating in contested environments where air superiority is not guaranteed. America’s once large air superiority margin has also shrunk , especially when it comes to expeditionary operations far from home. In addition, the battlefields American forces find themselves on today are so complex and crowded with competing forces, many of which have different agendas, that sanitizing large swathes of airspace isn’t an option—both tactically and geopolitically speaking. Finally, and most importantly, the risk posed by weaponized unmanned aircraft has exploded. So far this threat has been presented largely by ISIS, a irregular force of fighters with varying levels of competence—much of which is poor—not a near peer state competitor with far higher professionalism and much greater resources. The great laser gamble As we have discussed in great depth before , the threat posed even by lowly hobby drones converted for nefarious purposes was clear long ago. The Pentagon as a whole largely eschewed the issue aside from executing some experimental testing and putting on a handful of obscure technological competitions to see how different countermeasures and tactics could be used to deal with these diminutive aerial threats. But above all else, small drones were fodder for the Pentagon’s experimental, costly, relatively low-powered and cumbersome solid-state lasers to roast out of the sky during tests. These systems weren’t powerful enough to take out incoming aircraft or missiles, but small fragile drones would give them a mission to teeth on. There is no doubt that eventually lasers would be the ideal weapon for taking on small drones— eventually . AP In essence, the quiet denial that there was a real possibility US forces and their allies on the ground overseas could face this threat in the near term showed at best a lack of imagination on the part of DoD decision makers, especially considering some of us had been screaming about it for years. At worst it showed that those in charge at the Pentagon were willing to take on the risk posed by small weaponized drones for a period of time in hopes that the threat would not actually metastasize until easily deployable, compact, reliable and powerful solid-state lasers were ready for prime time. That gamble failed miserably. The battle for Mosul made it abundantly clear to the world that these relatively simple, commercially available and cheap weaponized drones weren’t a novelty. A mad search for countermeasures ensued as the headlines about their terrifying existence started hitting the mainstream press. That search continues till this day. Simply put, the enemy doesn’t act on the DoD’s timeline. In the end, the Defense Department had to finally accept the fact that the hobby-like drone threat had arrived, along with its wide ranging implications—not just for wars overseas but also for life here at home. This admission has spurred a cottage industry of sorts over the last year, that has included everything from jamming guns to exotic shotgun shells to sonic weapons —none of which are all that promising on their own. Swatting down incoming mortars, rockets and artillery shells The anti-small drone SHORAD requirement does share quite a bit of capability overlap with counter-rocket, artillery and mortar (C-RAM) defensive needs and capabilities. These traditional indirect fire weapons also pose an increasing threat to friendly forces operating on the ground in or near combat zones. Today, C-RAM systems include everything from the Phalanx-based Centurion gun system to Israel’s Iron Dome surface-to-air interceptor system. The idea behind all these systems is to shoot down or neutralize these weapons as they careen through the air, before arriving at their target. Under certain circumstances, C-RAM systems could also be used to shoot down low-flying helicopters, cruise missiles and aircraft. But you can’t shoot what you can’t see, and these defensive weapons usually have short sensor ranges, and overall low situational awareness. This gives operators less warning and less time to react, if any at all, to successfully engage threats that emerge farther off than rising mortars or short range artillery shells. Like the small drone threat, lasers, with their indefinite magazine depth and fast as light engagement ability, are largely seen as the answer to the C-RAM issue, but they simply are not ready to take on such a threat, especially in a mobile battlefield environment. https://youtube.com/watch?v=w4PXou0aGiE Old threats made new Dangers that require short range air defenses (SHORADs) are not just about small drones carrying improvised explosive devices or incoming artillery, they are also about larger drones, low flying manned helicopters and aircraft, and even cruise missiles. Larger drones in particular will pose a serious danger to friendly forces in the future. Some of these have beyond line of sight control capabilities, and can drop or fire their own guided weapons at troops, vehicles, and material below. Foreign-built remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) are now proliferating at a fast pace, with China’s Predator-like Wing Loong being very popular, among many other international designs. Iran is also producing their own armed Shahed-129 RPAs, and these aircraft have popped up twice near a hot spot where American and allied troops are stationed in Syria, resulting in F-15E Strike Eagles swooping in and blasting them out of the sky. https://youtube.com/watch?v=llCB7YkqyQI Keeping combat air patrols overhead at all times to respond marauding drones is extremely expensive, and those aircraft are needed for other purposes. Not just that, but F-15s are not well designed to take out slow-flying drones with small radar and infrared signatures. Regardless, the shooting down of two Iranian drones, one of which had dropped weapons before being engaged by the Strike Eagles, was a signal that the days of having nearly a monopoly on drone warfare and full-scale air superiority are over for the US. Traditional SHORAD threats, like low-flying fighter aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles are also making a tactical resurgence. Once again, this is mainly due to the Pentagon’s new battle doctrine, the enemy’s investments in anti-access and area denial capabilities, and the erosion of America’s ability to guarantee air superiority, especially over a vast area. All this becomes especially important if the Pentagon were to execute on its multi-domain battle and maneuver warfare plans that it touts today in a contested and large combat environment like the Pacific. This will include thrusting allied troops into the enemy’s backyard, to areas where air superiority will not have been achieved and where sitting still on the ground for more than a few hours could result in losses of entire combat units. In other words, on the battlefields of tomorrow, Marines and Army infantry will have to be able to defend themselves from an aerial onslaught on multiple levels, at least sporadically—and do so on the move. Not just that, but no fighter aircraft or remotely launched long-range surface to air missile is going to take down small drones or rockets that threaten forward operating bases or roving columns of infantry. US Army A good way to visualize this is to imagine a war in Asia where there is a need to grab and hold islands that are inside China’s anti-access/area-denial “buffer zone.” These expeditionary operations that venture into contested territory will require the assets of all the services combined, including intelligence and communications gathered from space, and rapid and highly targeted strikes in the realm of cyberspace. Part of this strategy also includes being able to move so fast that operations outpace the enemy’s decision cycle. Basically, you are gone before they can counter attack, or before that incoming attack has arrived. Otherwise you better have fortified an area fast enough that you can repel an attack on multiple levels. But blitzkrieg operations over long distances, especially those separated by water, are very challenging even for the US military. Fighter aircraft will have their ranges stretched to the max even with tanker support, with very short periods of on station time over friendly forces. Naval surface forces may also have to standoff some distance. As such, ground units will need to be able to provide at least short range point air defense for themselves. Thus the need for a rapid and robust investment in SHORAD capabilities that can counter everything from drones to rockets to cruise missiles, otherwise the Pentagon needs to alter its land and amphibious warfare plans to be far less ambitious. America’s dated and limited capacity SHORAD arsenal Currently the US Army relies entirely on the FIM-92 Stinger missile slinging and .50 bullet caliber firing AN/TWQ-1 Avenger system. That wasn’t always the case. Systems like the Chaparral SAM system , M6 Linebacker , and the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System —the USMC also had the LAV-AD —once populated the Army’s mechanized ranks. Yet even the aging Avengers have decreased in numbers drastically over the years. MIM-72A/M48 Chaparral Self-Propelled Surface-to-Air Missile System., US Army In 2004, there were 26 SHORAD battalions in the Army. Fast forward to today there are just nine. Of these nine, just two of them are active-duty units, the rest are in the National Guard. Now these remaining systems are in huge demand, with a deployment of 50 more Avengers to Europe being announced this week. The Avenger system still mainly rides in the bed of a HUMVEE, but it can also be installed as a fixed emplacement, as it is on the Capital Mall as part of the integrated air defense system around Washington DC , and most notably, near the White House . The Avenger’s FIM-92 Stinger missile, which is best known for in its shoulder-fired man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) format, remains a fairly capable for short-range engagements, and it has just been certified to knock down drones. Avenger doesn’t carry its own radar, but can be linked into a nearby radar or a integrated air defense system for cueing. Even with its merits, far more capable systems exist. In fact, America’s potential enemies make arguably of the best SHORAD systems in the world. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NLBwViz8pqI Russia in particular has taken the SHORAD mission far more seriously than the US, namely because it has not had the luxury of nearly guaranteed air supremacy—or at least it never believed in that idea in the first place. Today, multiple Russian-built mobile point air defense systems are in production. Namely these include the Tunguska , Tor and especially the highly formidable Pantsir-S1 . China has units like the LD-2000 30mm self propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the latest versions of the type also feature missiles. China’s HQ-7 is a clone of the French Crotale point defense SAM system. Other international systems, like the British Rapier and the French Roland are also soldiering on with different militaries around the globe. Pantsir-S1, AP The thing is that Avenger could be easily replaced, or at least drastically upgraded. Boeing has built and tested two variations of a new weapons turret that is capable of firing a larger array of weapons than just Stingers. Its primary air defense weapon would be the AIM-9X Sidewinder, which has a much farther reach than the Stinger, is more maneuverable, and has a better seeker system. Block 2 versions of the AIM-9X Sidewinder also feature lock on after launch capability and a data link, which means a radar can guide it to its target in any conditions, and it can fire without locking onto its target first. In fact, the launcher can be pointed in a totally different direction and the missile will still find its target if it is within its reach. Boeing’s launcher can also sling Stinger, Javelin and Hellfire missiles. The Javelin can strike ground targets and helicopters, while the Hellfire can take out ground-based threats. This means the system can flex to a ground defense capability when there is no aerial threat. The launcher is also configured to accommodate a solid state laser in addiction to multiple missiles, which would be ideal for swatting down small hobby-like drones. The first iteration of Boeing’s Avenger turret appeared in 2010, then again in 2014, although by then the system was much more compact and refined: Boeing’s launcher is such a nice concept because it is modular in nature and new weapons can be added to it over time. Not just that, but the weapons it carries can be tailored depending on the threat. If aircraft, cruise missiles and drones are the threat, it can be outfitted with six AIM-9Xs and eventually a laser. If helicopters and ground vehicles are an equal threat it can be equipped with three Sidewinders and three Javelins. If there is no aerial threat aside from low-end unmanned aircraft, it can pack a full load of Hellfires and still have its laser available for countering small drones. A cannon can also be fitted, as seen on the first iteration. Boeing is now showing off a slew of different vehicle-turret combinations that could be tailored to the Army and the Marine Corps’ unique needs. These include turret equipped Strykers, M-ATVs and Bradley fighting vehicles. Air defense configured Stryker., Boeing/GDLS A laser SHORAD component with enough power to rapidly knock down incoming artillery is still a few years off, but vehicle mounted laser systems are already undergoing tests and they can swat down small drones even with lower powered lasers in many conditions. Still, pairing Boeing’s missile turret with a rapid-fire gun system for C-RAM vigilance, and tying them both to an advanced mobile radar unit, could represent the best of both worlds for now. At the very least it would give the guys on the ground a full spectrum and highly mobile SHORAD umbrella in the near term. Mobile High Energy Laser (MEHEL) has been in testing and has successfully blasted dozens of drones out of the sky., US Army Centurion is a capable and proven system, but it isn’t designed specifically to operate on the move, so a different gun system may be best for this capability or the Centurion could possibly be modified. On the other hand, the Army could just live with the high cost exchange rate of shooting down $400 rockets with missiles that cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Army is also working on a road-mobile containerized launch system that can fire a variety of rounds. Think of it as a more complex, higher capacity system than Boeing’s updated Avenger turret launcher. The so called Multi-Mission Launcher has been developed under the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) program. The launcher can spin 360 degrees and has 15 tubes for weapons, including Iron Dome’s Tamir interceptor, AIM-9X, FIM-92, AGM-114 and Miniature Hit-To-Kill projectiles , the former of which is being developed for the C-RAM mission. It is a much larger system than Boeing’s new Avenger turret, but it could make up the higher-end of a high-low SHORAD mix. The system is built to primarily use a MPQ-64 Sentinel radar , which can be towed or can be vehicle mounted, but it also is intended to be able to leverage a varying network of sensors, which could include other high-mobility radar systems. As we mentioned earlier, eventually, for short-range C-RAM and small drone engagements, directed energy weapons like lasers and microwave emitters will take over for gun, hit-to-kill, and missile systems. But a launcher for short to intermediate range defense against more robust aerial targets, like fighter aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles, will still be needed. It could be possible that the Multi-Mission Launcher could even host Israel’s Stunner hit-to-kill missile , which can make the best use range-wise of a networked SHORAD installation with a powerful radar. This would fill help further fill the gap between the MIM-104 Patriot missile system and more traditional shorter-ranged point defense weapons. Pushing high fidelity air defense sensors to the front Having easy to deploy advanced sensors that can tie various SHORAD weapons platforms, or “shooters,” together is the “special sauce” at the heart of a modern SHORAD system that will keep troops safe from aerial bombardment of many types. In essence, the sensor that spots the target is just as important, if not more important, than the weapon that engages the target. Bringing broader and higher-fidelity airspace situational awareness right inside a convoy or small forward operating base would be game changing when it comes to the SHORAD mission. Enter Northrop Grumman’s Highly Adaptable Multi-Mission Radar , or HAMMR for short, which is a refined version of the Ground Based Fighter Radar (GBFR) concept. This system is incredibly logical—take existing and proven components from active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars already flying on fighter aircraft and adapt them for the SHORAD mission. These systems are already built to be light, robust, and multi-role. By using existing hardware and even some software elements, large sums of money can be saved both in terms of research and development costs and via high-volume acquisition of common components. Money can also be saved when it comes to sustaining the systems and upgrading them over time. HAMMR can be mounted on a vehicle, such as a HUMVEE, a trailer, or it can be arranged to be easily setup at a fixed position—like atop a building. Its powerful and super agile AESA array can detect everything from high-flying fighters, to incoming artillery rounds, to low flying helicopters, cruise missiles and even small drones. This information is data-linked to a command and control interface that is also in contact with various SHORAD weapons platforms nearby, creating a roving air defense network. HAMMR, and other systems being developed like it, can operate in littoral, desert, jungle, or mountainous terrain. They can even work out at sea. This allows for maximum flexibility. For instance, if you want to setup a forward operating base in a town you can stick one of these on the roof of a building and have high-end aerial surveillance and targeting capabilities in a snap. Want to deploy a modular SHORAD system to a sea base ? Plop one of these down on the deck and a missile launcher nearby. Need an air traffic control radar at a remote forward operating field that can also provide SHORAD capabilities? Drop one of these in. The Marines are also working on their own highly mobile radar systems, one of which is proving to be quite capable, albeit more ungainly than HAMMR. This system is called the AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) and it is in integration testing with other systems now. G/ATOR is a larger spinning AESA array that is trailer mounted and capable of providing short and medium range aerial surveillance and weapons cueing in a similar manner as HAMMR, albeit it remains unclear if C-RAM will eventually be part of its menu of capabilities. This highly mobile but powerful new class of road-mobile radar systems can also feed information via data link to aircraft in the air and to other far more advanced missile batteries dozens, or even hundreds of miles away. Using net-centric cooperative-like engagement technology, a HAMMR or G/ATOR radar may pick up an enemy aircraft well beyond its SHORAD weapons’ reach. This information is streamed via data link to an Aegis equipped destroyer floating 75 miles away. The ship immediately fires off one of its SM-2 or SM-6 missiles to knock it out of the sky, saving the forward deployed troops and their SHORAD systems a close encounter. Fighter aircraft could also make similar cooperative engagements. So these systems not only facilitate the SHORAD mission, they also put persistent aerial surveillance forward, at, or beyond the front lines, and other friendly assets can exploit the information they gather. Even nearby forward air controllers can use these radars’ data to build a more accurate “picture” of the airspace around them, which will help for organizing close air support and precision fires. In the end, the Pentagon’s slowly materializing SHORAD solution, which they call “Maneuver SHORAD,” will feature a cocktail of technologies, sensors and weapons platforms, tied together via a common data link and command and control apparatus. But it is also critical that these systems retain their ability to operate independently if need be, with radar and weapons platforms connected directly to one another in a traditional sense. This is especially important in an age of growing cyber and electronic warfare threats. This way, even if communications fail, especially those that require over-the-horizon connectivity, the system will still be able to provide immediate protection for nearby troops and their gear. . Avenger firing a Stinger missile., US Army Better late than never It’s better late than never when it comes to the Pentagon’s seemingly sudden rush for SHORAD capabilities, and none of it comes cheap. The missiles and interceptors used by higher-end systems alone will end up being among the most expensive investments when it comes to building up and sustaining a multi-layered and mobile SHORAD umbrella. But a scalable, flexible, and networked SHORAD concept should now be deemed a critical, high-priority capability if the Pentagon intends to fight the way it says it wants to in the future. Without it, thousands of lives and billions worth of equipment would be put at much greater risk during a time of war. Funding is always a hurdle for any military capability, especially less glamorous ones like SHORAD, but why build a better tank or armored fighting vehicle at great cost if those systems will just be vulnerable to aerial attack? As such, the Army and the USMC need to make SHORAD a top priority and by most indications that is beginning to happen . Fielding an Avenger upgrade/replacement with a highly mobile and more versatile system, along with a radar to make the most out of it, seems like the best first step. A basic self propelled gun system capable of C-RAM tasks would also be logical. A second phase could include building out a larger more robust air defense layer around systems like the Multi-Mission Launcher and its associated radar systems, with an eye on eventually turning over C-RAM duties to lasers and keeping the launchers and their expensive missiles for higher-end engagements. SHORAD comes home The thing is, lower-end SHORAD systems are also needed here at home, something we predicted years ago . The idea that small hobby drones can be fashioned into improvised weapons is not a concept that has boundaries, and a few hundred dollar drone could take out a VIP in transit or even a top of the line fighter jet sitting on the ground. Just this week, it was announced that the Pentagon has cleared its base commanders to down any threatening drone operating near high value assets or critical military infrastructure. This comes after a drone got dangerously close to F-22 Raptor’s parked on the flightline at Langley AFB. Speaking to the Air Force Association at a breakfast earlier in the month, Air Combat Command head honcho James Homes stated: “One day last week I had two small UASs that were interfering with operations… At one base, the gate guard watched one fly over the top of the gate check, tracked it while it flew over the flight line for a little while, and then flew back out and left, and I have no authority given to me by the government to deal with that.” He went on to describe another incident that happened that same day, this time a near collision while an F-22 was landing on the base. Similar concerns over drones operating near nuclear power facilities and other sensitive infrastructure have been well established . AP The reality is that although the DoD’s proclamation allowing base commanders to order the downing of small drones may sound like a powerful move, base security personnel would be nearly powerless in actually executing such a order. The idea that an MP would start firing 5.56 rounds into the air at a tiny drone is unthinkable. That may be ok in a war zone like Mosul, but not at a base in a suburban area. Those rounds travel miles while still packing enough energy to be deadly. Simply put, nobody trained in small arms is going to open fire on something without knowing what’s beyond their intended target. Other battlefield innovations, like the aforementioned radio frequency jamming “guns” and exotic “drone net” ammunition , maybe even shadowy electromagnetic and microwave pulse weapons, could potentially neutralize a malicious drone—but only if that drone is spotted visually first, and those armed with such systems are quick enough to react to it. Really, a whole slew of other variables make these countermeasures rickety at best. Not to mention suddenly executing jamming or microwave pulse operations at an airport is not really a good idea . But once again, the key to having any chance of defending a particular site or asset from small drone attack is detecting the drone early on, before it is nearly overhead. Radar systems like HAMMR are one possibility, and other smaller, more rudimentary mobile radar systems have already been developed for this mission—some of which are fielded today, like Israel’s Drone Guard. Laser weapons will be the best solution for taking down these types of drones even in domestic environments. But being able to reliably differentiate between friend and foe is key to seeing them deployed operationally, as is providing enough automated situational awareness so that the laser does not inadvertently strike any other aircraft passing in its beam’s path. Near and at airports these factors become even more crucial. Once again, the benefit here goes to a system like HAMMR that can paint a bigger situational picture of nearby airspace, and deconflict potential friendly fire incidents automatically. This can include stopping the beam from firing intermittently or not engaging the target at all if it poses a threat to aviation, human life or important infrastructure. AESA radars themselves may have a latent ability to use their high powered and highly focused RF beams to damage small drones’ delicate electronics, or disrupt their two-way communications, especially at close range. With this capability in mind, a modular domestic SHORAD system could include a HAMMR like radar, and a laser turret with an infrared camera attached for target identification. The radar would first detect, classify and track the target. Once it is deemed potentially hostile, it can attempt to jam or disable it using electronic warfare means. If that doesn’t work it can then provide a laser firing solution that doesn’t affect nearby infrastructure or other aircraft that may pass in the beam’s path. Small hobby drones can also be detected by the signals they send back to their users via electronic surveillance measures. But this technology may be better used to help with early warning and detection of an unmanned threat than providing fine telemetry for a laser or microwave emitter. The coming swarm Still, none of this confronts what is an inevitable evolution of the small drone threat—drone swarms. The enemy, either operating from the air or from the ground, will eventually be able to unleash dozens or even hundreds of small drones armed with explosive charges to fly downrange short distances and attack ground units and their material like bees. The Pentagon is already testing such a capability , and a simpler version of it could likely be realized by adapting off the shelf systems. Being networked together, and being autonomous in nature after being loaded with a target area location, along with other mission parameters, these swarms will be extremely hard to defend against using even the best SHORAD systems in development today. It’s the saturation nature of the attack, the size of the attackers, and the fact that they work as a coordinated swarm, employing dynamic tactics to see as many in their company survive long enough to make their suicidal attack, that make them so deadly. They could even drop micro-munitions and be reused for a later attack. Just the knowledge that such an attack is possible would be psychologically stressful and demoralizing for troops on the ground. Similar swarming strikes could be unleashed behind the front lines as well, with hugely expensive and low density/high demand combat aircraft being especially vulnerable to this sort of tactic—something General James Holmes alluded to inadvertently while speaking to the Air Force Association, stating: “Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it.” Actually, it would be even easier to just strike the jets as they sit idle and vulnerable on the flight line. One swarm could see a whole squadron of tightly packed fighters destroyed without even having a chance to fight back. FAA Maybe wide-area electronic warfare could help counter such a threat, at least to some degree. But clearly the best defense of all is to not let the enemy get close enough to launch such an onslaught in the first place. But this is a tough proposition when it comes to defense from such an attack in friendly areas or behind the lines, where even the fastest fighter jets sit stationary on flightlines, the coordinates of which are readily available on Google Earth. Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots. Suffice it to say the SHORAD challenges of the future will be robust and plentiful. But it’s time we start tackling today’s SHORAD challenges head-on so we can adapt quicker to those of tomorrow. Getting America’s military back in the SHORAD game in a serious way would be a good first step in the right direction.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 22, 2021",Making Steam: The Life And Times Of A U.S. Navy Chief Engineer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. David Taylor spent 22 years in the Navy, serving from 1969 to 1991. During that time he rose in rank from an enlisted Seaman Recruit to becoming an officer, and eventually retired as a Lieutenant Commander. The majority of his career was spent in one of the most thankless and hidden but absolutely critical jobs in the US Navy—making the steam that propelled the vast majority of the Navy’s fleet through the high seas. After retiring from the Navy, Taylor worked at Philadelphia Naval Yard, breathing new life into tired old ships and helping to develop the new technologies the Navy set its sights on—for better or worse. In the first of this two part in depth expose, Taylor gives us an incredibly rare insight into what it took to run the Navy’s mightiest vessels during the height of the Cold War, and what it is like to be Chief Engineer, responsible for more than most would care to imagine, aboard a US Navy surface combatant. We will also learn what it takes to refit a supercarrier, and Taylor will deconstruct the feasibility of returning mothballed ships to the fleet, which is a hot topic as of late . David Taylor aboard the USS England while on cruise in 1985. , Courtesy of LCDR(R) David Taylor Arriving as a fresh Engineering Officer aboard the supercarrier USS Kitty Hawk An extended yard period is the most difficult time in the career of any Navy man, officer or enlisted. The yards are seldom in the ship’s home port and frequently the move is not designated a change of home port, so funding is not available to move families. If moves are authorized, housing near the yards are usually substandard and expensive if available at all. It is usually better to adopt geographic bachelorhood anyway because working 12 hour days, seven days a week, with the only holiday observed being Christmas, does not leave much time for momma and the kiddies. Even unaccompanied, off duty life is lousy. You can’t stay on the ship, even if habitability services are available, the industrial clamor is nerve wracking. Did you know that at 0300 a needle gun being used to remove paint on the foreword flight deck can jerk you awake while sleeping in a berthing compartment 900 feet and six decks away? USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) moored at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard., USN There is no time for watchstation or in rate training. There is no equipment to train on. If the Department has enough funds , some sailors may be sent away for advanced technical training, but there is never much money for that, and the candidates for that training are usually your better people, so you end up in that uncomfortable position between a rock and a very hard place. I came aboard as an Ensign. Because of my enlisted background, my degree and a significant lack of more senior officers, I was given a LT billet, P-1 Division, responsible for 1 and 4 MMR: 4 boilers and two main engines on the outboard shafts, two ship’s service turbine generators (SSTGs) and two evaporators, not mention 50 Boiler Technicians and Machinist Mates. I held that position through the yard period. There is tremendous pressure. Workload pressure. Schedule pressure. Sometimes ship’s force milestones and yard milestones are mutually exclusive of each other. Then the big milestone looms on the horizon. The Propulsion Evaluation Board (PEB) is coming to conduct a Light Off Exam (LOE) to determine if a main machinery space is safe to steam. They will be checking training records to ensure that you can field a qualified watch team. They will be conducting review boards and administering written exams to determine if your designated watchstanders are as qualified as records say they are. They will be reviewing admin programs like Electrical Safety and Lube Oil Quality Management. They will  inspecting for material readiness, including system integrity, cleanliness and valve and piping labeling. They are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and they are coming in ten days ! The space to be scrutinized is a madhouse. There is no room for one more body. Laggers are lagging, barely keeping ahead of the painters, who are being pushed by someone with stencils and can of black striping putting identification signs on the pipes. The Main Propulsion Assistant, a Lieutenant Commander, is in his office, assisted by a Warrant and an Ensign as they sort through a shipping crate of stamped metal disks, used for identifying valves, looking for the tag for MS-3. You will never make it on time. And then you run out of time, and miraculously, you are ready. After lighting the boiler, gauges are monitored by a Boilerman Technician in the No. 4 main machinery room aboard the aircraft carrier USS KITTY HAWK, USN So you put a plate of doughnuts on the wardroom table (I do not know if this works, but I have never dared to risk not doing it), put a smile on your face, and welcome the jack booted monsters who are going to ruin your day, your week and maybe your career. After a few canned remarks, they  depart to do their damnedest and you make sure your quick reaction teams and the yard personnel are standing by to quickly rectify any discovered discrepancies. You hope the Ensign in charge of the Electrical Safety Program doesn’t make an ass of himself and you pray that BT3 Smedley, who you really, really need for your Burnerman does not relapse into his idiot mode. And then you wait. Then the inspectors sequester themselves in the wardroom and collate their findings. They finally announce that they are ready to submit their report, first in private to the Commanding Officer (CO) and Chief Engineer (CHENG), and then to the world, all gathered in the wardroom. No one smiles. The senior member reads an almost endless list of discrepancies. Your life flashes before your eyes. Then he says, still not smiling, “the board finds #1 MMR safe to steam,” cracks a small smile and departs. But you can’t afford to celebrate too much. They will be back in six weeks for 4 Main, then 2 and then 3. But you have learned lessons. You get better and more confident. It is still a lot of work, but the anxiety level is lower. Burnerman ignites a boiler aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63)., USN But the tempo is increasing, and steam testing is beginning. That means real steaming, but with different yard shops demanding your attention to support their protocols. Things get more and more hectic and the hours get longer the closer you get to the end of the overhaul. There are not enough bodies to go around. On one occasion we needed to get 2A boiler up to provide steam to support testing aft. We did not have anyone to spare because the day shift had not come on yet. My Boiler Technician Chief and I went down to the space, I stuck the torch in, he took the Control Board and we almost had it up to pressure by the time the day crew took over. Yes, not in accordance with procedures, but remember that “can do!” spirit that is both the sterling quality and the greatest shortcoming of a Naval Officer. Finally the day arrives, you are done, you are going back to San Diego. The flight deck is covered with the personal autos of the crew. That was a blast, up a ramp to a lowered aircraft elevator, ride the elevator to the flight deck, follow the signals of an Aviation Boatswain’s Mate to your parking spot, set the brake and head below to your Sea Detail Station. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Motor vehicles are parked on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) as preparations are made to transport them to San Diego, California, USN Back in San Diego, there was no time to rest. We had to begin our work up for deployment. Carrier quals , Third Fleet exercises, refresher training, and the most terrifying of all, our Operational Propulsion Plant Exam (OPPE). The jack booted villains were coming back, this time to see if we could safely operate the plant. They were going to recheck everything plus observe us conduct Casualty Control drills, a full power run and a crash back (all ahead flank to all astern full). No conventional aircraft carrier had ever passed an OPPE the first time through. They cut us no slack. They went over our admin and our spaces with a fine tooth comb. They figured we had four spaces, so why not impose four casualties at the same time. By the time my turn was over as Engineering Officer of the Watch, I felt like had had been dragged through the mud, then run over by a Greyhound bus. The debrief was the same, but perhaps a bit more somber. After a dead pan recitation of our extensive list of discrepancies, the senior member said, “the board has assigned a grade of satisfactory.” The only possible findings were satisfactory and unsatisfactory. Then, instead of leaving, he said, “I have one initial comment. In terms of overall plant knowledge, understanding of procedures and ability to take quick and correct actions, I have never seen anyone as proficient as Ensign Taylor.” As my head began to swell, from the back of the room came a retort from Lt George Wolfe, an old Limited Duty Officer who was retiring as soon as we got back to port, “and you know, Captain, he’s not even the best we have!” The Engineering Officer of the Watch monitors the ship’s engineering plants in the damage control center aboard the aircraft carrier USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63)., USN Finally, all tests and trials behind us, we settled into the routine of making steam. It was a blissful, low pressure, predictable time, doing what we had been trained to do and doing it well. We headed to the Western Pacific. Then the war broke out. The undeclared war between the Engineering Department and the Air Wing that is. The beauty of it was that the “Airdales” did not even know we were the enemy. We hated those guys. We hated their nicknames—Ripper and Killer etc. We even had a Crash Nash because of a minor mid-air collision—and the way they flew their airplane hands in conversation. You know, “there I was at ten thousand feet…” Before we deployed, we would mock them at social gatherings. I would be “Tubes” Taylor and another engineer “Chloride Corkum.”  We would stand within earshot of them and say things like, “there I was on the Upper Level of #1 Main…” We ratcheted it up after we deployed. We probably would not have done it, but as soon as we were outside of territorial waters, they broke out the “shit hots.” The greatest compliment that could be given a Naval Aviator was that he was “shit hot” in the air. For the uninitiated, “shit hots” are also non regulation casual flightsuits, made of polyester, in vibrant blue and gold festooned with more badges and decorations than a single glance could encompass. They looked like a professional basketball team’s warm ups. If they were not wearing their real flight suits, they were wearing their shit hots. We were pissed. Truth be told, we were a bit jealous, all we had were flame resistant khaki boiler suits. A Boilerman Technician opens the discharge valve to the main feed booster pump in the No. 4 main machinery room aboard the aircraft carrier USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63)., USN Our first plan was to get the aardvark. One of the F-14 squadrons had the anteater from the old “B.C. ” comic strip painted on their vertical stabilizer. They kept a stuffed aardvark in a glass case in their ready room. There was always a junior enlisted man from the squadron on watch in the ready room to protect it. Our plan was simple. We scheduled a fire drill in the passageway outside their ready room. As part of firefighting procedures, a team with a fire hose must set fire boundaries on the opposite side of all bulkheads affected by the fire. Try as hard as they might, our hose team could not get the aardvark watchman to vacate the space. Back to the drawing board. Our machine shop had the only engraving machine aboard. We made up less than complimentary adhesive backed brass label plates and affixed them to the squadron plaques in the lounge outside the wardroom. When noticed by a member of the affected squadron, indignation would ensue, the plaque would be replaced, and we would victimize another squadron. VF-114 “Aardvarks” F-4 landing aboard the USS KITTY HAWK., USN In port, the air wing would put up a wooden partition just inboard of the officer’s brow that displayed all of the squadron plaques. I would come aboard after a night on whatever town we were in, surreptitiously remove one of the plaques (a squadron, never the air wing), stick it under my shirt, walk across the hangar deck to the other sponson, throw the plaque in the drink, climb down the ladder and head to my stateroom to sleep. Soon, we did not have to do anything. Each squadron thought another squadron was the culprit and a virtual prank war broke out. It got so bad that senior officers took notice. I was Officer of the Deck the afternoon when the CO and the CAG (carrier air group commander) had every squadron commander standing tall, braced, being informed that this shit was going to stop now! I had to retreat to the far side of the bridge and gnaw on my knuckles to keep from laughing out loud. We decided we had won and quietly declared peace, just as we had quietly declared war. USS KITTY HAWK underway in 1977., USN We got a good overhaul from Puget Sound. Other than the “20 Khaki Emergency” I discuss later on, we had few mechanical issues, very few sailors returned by the shore patrol and we only lost one plane and no pilots during cruise. After getting six officers qualified for Engineering Officer On The Watch, I went into a watch rotation topside alternating with my watches in Main Control, in affect a four and eight rotation while the rest of the officers were on a six section rotation (4 hours on 20 hours off). I gained qualification as an Officer Of The Deck (OOD) and then Surface Warfare Officer (first ever to get both SWO and EOOW on a carrier). I asked for and received a split tour to a small surface combatant and shortly after returning from WESTPAC in 1977, I left for a seemingly endless series of schools intended to transform a Hole Snipe into an operations puke, then on to the USS David R. Ray —once again in the yards! Life as Chief Engineer aboard the USS Henry B. Wilson (DDG-7) and USS England (CG-22) Perhaps a bit of compare and contrast would be enlightening. On the surface it would seem that there would be a great similarity between the two classes of ships, at least from the standpoint of a Chief Engineer. Two engine rooms, two fire rooms, all similar auxiliaries. But there was a world of difference between the two. I received orders to the Henry B. Wilson in early 1983 after Department Head School, chiefly because of the direct intervention of my previous CO at Surface Warfare Officers School. I think it was because he thought I was up to the job and because he wanted to challenge me (I hope it was not because he wanted to consign me to two years on a mankiller). One of the benefits of the job was that it was a Lieutenant Commander billet that was normally filled by a Lieutenant, which triggered a fairly obscure regulation—a spot promotion that was permanent as long as I completed the tour successfully. The Charles F. Adams class guided missile destroyer USS HENRY B. WILSON (DDG-7)., USN The Chief Engineer is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the propulsion boilers, turbines and shafting, 60 Hz electrical generation and distribution, potable water distillation and distribution, air condition and ventilation, chill water for electronics, and interior communications systems. These included telephones, sound powered phones, announcing systems, wind speed and direction sensors, ship’s speed sensors and indicators, alarm systems and 400 Hz generation and distribution. Systems from the keel to the masthead, bow to stern. Also included was responsibility for the engines of the small boats, anchor windlass and hydraulic underway replenishment gear. The Chief Engineer was also the Damage Control Officer, with responsibility for training all damage control parties, maintaining fire and flushing pumps and piping, sewage disposal systems and ships welders. But bottom line, the primary responsibility of the Chief Engineer was to ensure that, when the Captain said  “…I intend to go in harms’ way” he could. The Charles F. Adams class was quite a ship for its time. It had 5”/54 caliber guns forward and aft, dual armed Tartar missile launcher aft (a hydraulic nightmare, our Fire Control Technicians called it “Christine” after Stephen King’s eponymous novel), ASROC, even a rudimentary range finding sonar, using a passive dome about a third of the way aft. The propulsion plant was the second generation of 1200 psi, uncontrolled superheat boilers put in service. A truly beautiful ship, it looked like a warship, as opposed to, say, today’s DDG-1000 stealth destroyer. But it was no longer its time. They were old and worn out. Pacific Fleet destroyers were in constant demand because of their double 5 inch mounts for Naval Gunfire Support in Vietnam. Born before the disastrous incident on the Buchanan , which led eventually to the birth of the Propulsion Examining Board, they were poorly maintained, manned by second tier crew and “rode hard and put away wet.” Designers had not quite figured out how to effectively contain the beast that lay at the heart of the propulsion boilers. It seemed that every drain line had at least one low spot which accumulated water and rotted through, revealing itself only when it started spray steam upon the next light off. These problems were exacerbated on Wilson because while participating in an operation to extract the SS Mayaguez from Vietnamese possession, (well before I was aboard) she took a hit from a shore based battery at the base of the after stack. The only damage that could not be repaired was warping of the deck on the upper level of the aft fireroom—right where the main feed pumps were located. The end result was that, no matter how hard we, SRF Yokusuka, SRF Guam, SRF Subic, Pacific Northwest Iron Works (Portland OR) or SUPSHIPS San Diego tried, we could never keep 2A Main Feed Pump from leaking around the shaft seals. I assumed the duties of Chief Engineer as the ship was finishing up a long overhaul at the aforementioned Willamette River yard in early Spring 1983. I took her through work up to deployment, including a successful Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE) and a six month deployment. My chiefs had just made chief. My E-6s had just sewn on the third chevron. My Limited Duty Officer (LDO) maintenance officer had just come from “Knife and Fork” school. My officers, without exception were Officer Candidate School grads on their first tours. The Navy had a real hard time attracting young officers at that time and standards had been lowered. When I was teaching at Surface Warfare Officers School (SWOS), my students included theatre arts majors and a graduate of a seminary, who was not going to become a chaplain. The Navy was also suffering an acute shortage of Boiler Technicians (BT). The only way I was able to man a three section watch underway was for every single BT to be qualified in at least three watches, and that was only by the end of the deployment. I came to the position much better prepared than my peers. Not only did I have my experience on Kitty Hawk , but I had a degree in Electrical Engineering, and had also profited from my year amongst the Nukes—the only major difference being the way water was boiled. I had also taken leave on two occasions while an instructor at SWOS to complete courses that were pre-requisites for the Steam Generating Plant Inspector (SGPI) course. After receiving orders to Wilson near the end of Department Head School, I sent a letter to my prospective CO, outlining that I had completed all prereqs for the Steam Generating Plant Inspectors (SGPI) course that was convening at the same time as a firefighting school to which all prospective Chief Engineers were ordered. I noted in my letter that attendance at firefighting might be redundant because I taught the course as part of my duties at SWOS. He sent a letter to Bureau Of Navy Personnel and I received an orders modification for me to attend SGPI in San Diego (where I had a home and family) rather that firefighting school in Great Lakes. Did I mention it was in February and that in firefighting school one got doused in cold firefighting water quite regularly? I made a good early impression on my snipes . The first time we got underway, enroute to Hood Canal to pick up missiles after completing overhaul, we had a problem with excessive water usage. One feed tank would be lined up to receive water from the evaporators, and then quickly overflow from the sounding tube to indicate it was full. When it would be lined up to make up feed levels as determined by sounding, the tank began to immediately drop. No one could figure out why. I told the chief in charge of the space that as soon as we shut down in port, I wanted the tank pumped out, gas freed and inspected by someone wearing khaki. The chief looked at me rather skeptically, but accustomed to dealing with young officers who thought that the billet imparted wisdom, said “aye, aye” and complied. USS HENRY B. WILSON underway. , USN Sure enough, they found a rag blocking a vent, which prevented air from escaping as the tank filled, giving the impression the tank was topped off. It did not take long for the story to filter through the Chiefs’ Mess to the First Class Mess to the berthing compartments.  They were my snipes from that point on, although the Boiler Inspector qualification and the fact that I was an E-6 before I was an O-1, didn’t hurt either. True confession time. I had encountered a similar situation while conducting steam testing on Kitty Hawk while in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The Main Propulsion Assistant, who lived across the street from me and I beat our brains out trying to determine the cause of massive feed water usage. We talked about it in the car to and from work, we crawled through the uptakes looking for leaks—a six story hot, dark labyrinth. We went hand over hand over all of the piping systems. We were nearing the end of our rope, and sanity, when one morning as we were walking through the passageway on the way to our offices, we were accosted by an irate first class Dental Technician, who upon ascertaining that we were snipes, ranted that he got so tired of mopping up the water that gushed from the pipe on the bulkhead that he drove a damage control plug into it. Mystery solved. Evidently the Boiler Technicians had been filling till it flooded, rather than sounding it as it filled. Perhaps it was cheating to use that experience to impress my new snipes, but what is wisdom but applied experience? I alluded to the opinion that these ships were man killers—or at least Chief Engineer killers. One of my classmates at Department Head School had a nervous breakdown not long after assuming the duties of Chief Engineer on an East Coast DDG. Every time we shut down and the plant went cold, we knew we would have to fix something the next time we had to light off to get underway. It was always arranged to have a tender on alert for emergency repairs two days before underway for this class of ships. Failing to get underway on time is the most shameful event in a Chief Engineer’s (CHENG) career. For a Monday morning sortie, we would start the light off process on Friday night, because we knew that something would go wrong. On one memorable occasion, one of the tachometers on a forced draft blower (forced combustion air through the outer casing and through the burner vortexes ) was inoperable. Upon investigation, we determined that the shaft on a magnetic rotating element within the tach had bent. Because this particular part never fails, it was not carried in the supply system, nor were there any drawings available. We tore down a tac from another blower and we hustled it over to the tender for them to fabricate a duplicate. As it was going to take a few hours, after they took measurements and determined the particular alloy of which it was made, we brought the example back and re-installed it. When the tender called and told us the part was ready I sent my Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA) over to get it as I wanted the most reliable person possible to retrieve it. About 30 minutes later, I got a phone call. It was my MPA. He said, “I dropped it. I was leaving the tender and it fell out of my hands and into the water.” After another hour and a very unpleasant phone call from the Repair Officer on the tender, we had the tach back together and continued with light off.  Underway on time, too. And this was not even an unusual light off. Boiler Technician reassembles the upper ball valve into the fire safe fuel oil strainer aboard a destroyer. , USN I remember another occasion when the packing on an unisolable high pressure drain valve failed. The only way to safely repair it was to cool down the boiler so there was absolutely no pressure and then commence repairs. We did not have that much time. I kicked everyone but the Boiler Technician Senior Chief Petty Officers out of the space and using welding gloves and a welding jacket to cover the valve. We repacked it, violating more than a few safety regulations. If I had caught one of my officers doing that, I would have had their buns for breakfast, but we got underway on time. That Navy can do spirit, right? My relief met the ship in Pearl Harbor as we were coming home from deployment. I chose to ride the ship home to allow for a more thorough turnover rather that a quick “you’re it, I quit” and a flight home. That allowed for a nice orderly transition, but it was a mistake from a personal standpoint. Halfway between Pearl Harbor and San Diego, with the letter signed, I had to sit back and watch him undo all of the innovations and procedures that I had instituted. The department went from a semi-unorthodox group that worked extremely well to a standard Navy organization that might also have worked, but left a bunch of sailors thoroughly confused and disgruntled. The Leahy class cruisers (CGs), born destroyers (DLGs), were an example of forward looking bureaucrats stumbling over reality. When authorized, the strategic thinkers knew that missiles had superseded guns, so they did not give the class any guns. Then Vietnam happened and suddenly expensive guided missile cruisers were vulnerable to junks with 40mm Bofors cannons mounted on their forecastle. The solution was to go into the mothball fleet, salvage some open mount 3 inch/50 caliber anti-aircraft guns, bolt them on the 01 level aft port and starboard areas of the ship and pop rivet a woefully small ready-service magazine on the bulkhead behind them. The Gunner’s Mates called them “boom, boom, click” which should give you an idea of how well they performed. The Leahy class guided missile cruiser USS ENGLAD (CG-22)., USN Notwithstanding the gun question, the difference between the Wilson and England was astounding. Although Wilson was designed only about ten years earlier, many hard lessons learned had been applied to England’s propulsion plant. The cruisers had not been used as hard as the gun ships and it was evident in the material condition of England that greater investments in maintenance had been made. This was especially obvious because she had not just come out of overhaul as had Wilson . Technological maintenance improvements had started to show benefits, also. Anti-corrosion flame spray treatment of valves, carbon ribbon packing and the removal of “bar stock” valves greatly decreased hours formerly dedicated to valve maintenance. Improved calibration and on line “flexing” of boiler controls through a On Line Verification (OLV) increased reliability, fuel economy and performance. A gradual evolution away from time-based to condition-based maintenance was also having a positive impact. Tearing down a piece of equipment to inspect and then replace a perfectly good bearing never made sense to me, even as an Electrician’s Mate Fireman earlier in my career. The effects of huge recruitment and retention bonuses and advanced maintenance training offered to Boiler Technicians was also beginning to be felt. I now had almost as many BTs as the Ship’s Manning Document said I was supposed to have and they were, in the main, good techs, even the young 6YO (six year obligation) sailors coming out of the beefed up training pipeline. My officers were more experienced, and frankly, better. I had two salty Warrant Machinist’s instead of one green Limited Duty Officer. The line officers were more motivated and had a better handle on the technical and leadership/management issues. My Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA) was dedicated, tireless and took an aggressive attitude of ownership of the plant. I may have been the Chief Engineer, but they were his boilers, turbines and reduction gears. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Another pleasant surprise was the recent re-organization of warships, moving from the traditional Weapons/Operations/Engineering arrangement to a Combat Systems/Operations/Engineering setup. There was a little shuffling of the top side divisions, but the one that meant the most to me was that Interior Communications Electricians (IC) now worked for the Combat Systems Officer. IC problems had been the things that caused me the greatest lack of sleep on Wilson , so when in my first meeting with the Combat Systems Officer, he made it clear that the only way I was going to take the IC gang away from him was to jerk them from his cold, dead fingers, I felt like Br’er Rabbit, wanting to shout “throw me in that briar patch!” All in all, it was a bit of a culture shock to me. The first time the MPA brought light off orders to me to approve I almost snorted a mouthful of coffee. With an underway time of 0800 on Monday morning, his intention was to stick the first torch in at 2300 Sunday night. This instigated a somewhat heated discussion along the lines of “no way in hell” from me to “but we have had no problems before” from him. We reached a compromise. We would start light-off at noon on Sunday and if we got underway on time without me suffering a heart attack or nervous breakdown or both, I would allow him to delay light off one hour after each success in the future. As our work up to deployment progressed, we quickly made it back to 2300. In fact, I was so confident in his plant and his people, that by the time we got to Pearl Harbor enroute to a WESTPAC deployment, I shut down and put the snipes on liberty the whole time in Pearl, something I could not have conceived of while assigned to Wilson . USS ENGLAND (CG-22) at rest in the Persian Gulf. , USN My MPA and I gradually established a great working relationship. I noted above, his attitude of total ownership of the plant. I am equally obsessive about getting underway on time. On Sundays, prior to Monday underway, he would be onboard getting ready and I would be at home, pacing and worrying and driving my wife crazy. I would regularly call him for status, not being the type to assume that no news is good news. Of course this was decades before cell phones, so every time I called, he would have to drop what he was doing and come to the quarterdeck to answer. I realized that none of us (including my wife) was happy about the situation. In a stroke of inspiration, I found a solution. I told the Senior Watch Officer that I would be Command Duty Officer one day before we were ordered underway, making the other departments heads and their wives and kids happy, my wife able to retain her sanity, my MPA less irritated and I could sit in the wardroom or my stateroom, doing Command Duty Officer or Chief Engineer things, and able to know what was going on by monitoring space comms and listening to changes in machinery noise. I mentioned in passing some things that I had done that were a bit unorthodox on Wilson , only to see them undone in the space of half a transit of the Eastern Pacific. While I have never been one to change things just to change things, unwilling to fix what ain’t broke, I gradually applied the methods and procedures that worked on Wilson to England . In port emergency firefighting teams were generally made up of the hull technicians, damage control men and engineering ratings, with a few of the topsiders mixed in. This was problematic when steaming in port, because a great number of the team’s core members were either on watch in the plant on a port and starboard rotation, or sleeping before going on watch. A drill or actual emergency was at very least annoying to off-watch team members and at the very worst disastrous if the whole team could not form quickly enough. With the authority inherent in my other title as Damage Control Officer, I instituted an aggressive watch section training program that eventually lead to three duty section teams fully manned without a single hole snipe. The Captain helped with this effort by a adding an additional requirement for an Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialists in at least one of the firefighting team positions. When most ships are steaming in a liberty port, they relieve the duty section—composed of two or three, if they were lucky, watch standing teams—at 0800. This led to the frequent occurrence of sailors coming back from a night on the town at about 0700, grabbing breakfast and relieving the watch at 0745. Hung over and tired operators standing watch on a high pressure steam plant was not my conception of a good idea. I made a minor schedule change that benefitted both the ship and crew. By relieving the duty section at noon instead of 0800, the liberty party had a chance to get some sleep, recover from whatever noxious fluids they had ingested and maybe even take care of some personal housekeeping tasks. This change, although greeted with initial skepticism by the Goat Locker , proved to be greatly appreciated by all. Crewmen on the bridge of the guided missile cruiser USS ENGLAND (CG-22) perform their duties during a transit from Sasebo, Japan, to Hong Kong. , USN No crew member of a steam ship works harder or longer than the guys in M and B division. They come in early for light off, go home well after everybody else upon returning to port, and by the nature and location of their work, have a tougher time than any sailor on the ship. They are generally under appreciated for their contributions. Within the structure of the Navy, there is very little an officer can do to recognize their efforts and contributions besides words of praise, and those tend to ring hollow after going six and six for three weeks on the doorstep to Hades. Promotions are determined by the calendar and an exam, pay is determined by Congress. The only reward a CHENG can offer is the gift of time. Time off. Liberty. After I had a chance to take the measure of my khaki subordinates, and liking what I saw, I established an unofficial liberty policy on England . As long as scheduled and corrective maintenance was up to date, personal watch qualification goals accomplished and spaces and berthing areas clean (as determined by khaki inspection), liberty was in effect. There were long periods of time after we returned from WESTPAC that the only time I saw the Boiler Technicians, other than the duty section, was at quarters in the morning, or when a small group would come in at night to light off, bring the boiler up to pressure and shut down just to renew the steam blanket. I left the USS England in the Spring of 1986 with orders to Naval Postgraduate School Monterey as part of my transition to the Engineering Duty Officer community. It was the last time I went to sea. I miss it every damn day. The differences between keeping a surface combatant and supercarrier running It is a question of scale. More people to fill the watch bill. More storerooms to hold spares. More redundancy in systems and equipment. We had a Boiler Repair Chief, an almost mythical creature, and a workshop for him to direct depot level repairs. We even had a yeoman for each division rather that just one for the whole department, which was a gift from above, considering the mountain of paperwork associated with a 50 man division. More money for parts and fuel, because the squadrons have to fly and trap and launch and fly at night to keep their quals (qualifications). So you went to sea a lot, for longer periods of time. After two or three weeks at sea, keeping the “airdales” happy, we used to speculate about how nice it would be to be on a destroyer, conducting weekly ops, steaming Monday through Friday, and getting home every weekend. Then I went to one; arriving late Friday night, in Sunday for underway on Monday, duty Saturday or Sunday. The grass was not as green as it appeared from the flight deck of a carrier. There is a saying, source unknown to me, that “quantity has a quality all of its own.” That certainly applies to an aircraft carrier. A-7E Corsair II launched from the USS KITTY HAWK’s waist catapult. , USN The CO of a carrier, as mandated by law, must be a Naval Aviator. Even though they may have gone through the Senior Officer Ships’ Material Readiness Course (SOSMRC)—a very rigorous syllabus of propulsion engineering (I think nuclear carrier skippers attend a watered down Nuke school). It is a rare carrier CO that understands the plant and appreciates what it takes to keep 32 knots over the flight deck. Most of the department heads are aviators and the CHENG and the rest of the Engineering  Department play second fiddle, almost being treated like second class citizens. As an example, upon returning from WESTPAC, the ship would not provide a working party to rig shore power cables to let us shut down (wives and kids were on the pier) until the working party that was unloading the air wing’s WESTPAC goodies—they were stacked on the hangar deck in such a great quantity that it looked like a warehouse—were done. Another example: There were two wardrooms on Kitty Hawk . The large one on the main deck was primary, where all normal rules of etiquette applied, with normal meal hours. At midrats (midnight rations), each item chosen was paid for out of pocket, rather than included in our mess bill. The other was up forward, just under the bow catapults. It was a “dirty shirt” wardroom, serving round the clock to accommodate the flight plan. Midrats were not charged extra. Only aviators and the Grumman tech reps onboard to support the initiation of the S-3 into the Fleet were allowed, yet, all officers were charged the same amount in their monthly mess bill. Another great difference between a carrier and a smaller combatant was the way information was shared. On the destroyer, every officer, through briefings and wardroom conversation, was kept abreast of what was going on. The carrier was much more compartmentalized. In a wardroom that could seat almost 100 officers at a time, you usually sat with your fellows, so there was not a lot of interchange. The hangar bay aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) after dark., USN Other than the boiler configuration required for flight ops, we were not really affected by aircraft evolutions. We had a video monitor from cameras on the flight deck in Main Control, so we could monitor launches  and we obviously did not “blow tubes” (cleaning soot off of the fireside of boiler tubes with steam from installed soot blowers) during flight ops. One exception—there were restrictions on moving aircraft on the flight deck if there was too great a degree of list on the ship (we are talking one to two degrees of list). The Flight Deck Officer would be constantly calling Damage Control Central demanding that we flood or pump out floodable voids to restore the ship to even keel, unaware or perhaps uncaring that it would take eight or nine people at least an hour of lining up and pumping to move the list a half of degree. Finally the Engineer had his fill and got the CO to let him demonstrate to the Air Boss and the Flight Deck Officer that moving one aircraft to the opposite side of the flight deck could change list two degrees in about ten minutes. One time, while engaged in the big training battle problem during Refresher Training (REFTRA), the final wicket for certification as ready to deploy, with Condition Zebra set throughout the ship and fires and missile strikes being fought by damage control teams, one of the fighter pilots was seen jogging on the flight deck. When brought to the bridge, to face an angry CO and even an angry CAG, still wearing his Nikes and tank top, his explanation was “but I have already seen the movie being shown in the ready room!” Aircraft carriers usually were assigned second or third tier blackshoe officers. No one at Service Selection Day at Annapolis put carrier engineering at the top of their wish list. The Navy recognized the problem and established the Carrier Readiness Improvement Program, which, among other things, brought hot running Lieutenant (junior grade) and Lieutenants who had achieved their Surface Warfare Officer quals into conventional carrier engineering departments. As an incentive, they were granted follow on orders of their choice. Their arrival had an almost immediate impact. In my defense, I did not consider myself second or third tier. When I was in college, I doubled up my course work to graduate almost a year early. I went from being evaluated by the sophomore class advisor to being evaluated by the senior class advisor a week before pre-commissioning ratings were due for submission. He did not know me and did not take the time to find out. He rated me last in my class and sent it off. A crew member monitors boiler activity in the control booth of the No. 4 main machinery room aboard the aircraft carrier USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63). , USN I was, frankly, devastated. I yearned to be on one of the “Greyhounds of the Pacific” that I had worked on when I was serving on the tender as an enlisted man. But, in the end, it was for the best. The officers in the Engineering Department formed a tight knit group. We worked hard together and we played hard together. We respected each other and helped each other out. Although most of the Ensigns were from that second or third tier, daily interaction with the outstanding engineering crews led to a significant improvement in their performance. Department cohesion aboard the Kitty Hawk was enhanced by the CHENG, a Limited Duty Officer Commander, laid back and approachable, with a marvelously dry sense of humor. Prior to assuming duties as CHENG he was the AIRPAC Maintenance Officer, so he knew how things worked at the shipyard and we benefitted greatly from his connections. As an aside, he was also the one who discovered the semi-mythical lost machine shop on USS Enterprise . Both my wife and I agreed that from the standpoint of the people I worked with, and their wives, it was the best tour we had. , USN Returning to gut and refit the supercarrier Kitty Hawk The intent of the CV Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was to ensure we had enough big deck carriers to meet the Navy’s strategic and tactical mission goals until enough nuclear powered carriers came on-line to replace them. It was absolutely necessary because, like the Adams class DDG and the Leahy class CG, they were becoming extremely expensive to maintain and their combat systems outdated to the point of obsolescence—in Navy terms, obsolescence means no more parts are available and no one plans on making any more. The CV SLEP program accomplished that goal, and even though there were schedule slippages and cost overruns, each iteration was cheaper and faster as the yard applied lessons learned from previous hulls. In the end, the ships came out quicker and cost less money to refurb than to build a new construction nuclear powered carrier (CVN). Only the government’s desire to reap the “peace dividend” kept them from fulfilling their planned operating lifetime. The carriers were brought to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard principally due to dry dock capacity and a projected lack of work in the yard without them. When they left, they were essentially a new ship, with the obvious exception of the hull and most of the tanks and voids. Electronic systems throughout the ship were replaced or upgraded. New computer networks were installed. Point defense systems were improved. Berthing and other habitability spaces were renovated—actually they were gutted and re-installed. The capacity of air conditioning and chill water systems was increased. I think they even fixed the escalator from the hangar deck to the bridge. One of the perks of Officer Of the Deck quals was that you got to use it, otherwise it was a 12 deck marathon to get to the bridge. These upgrades paled in comparison to two other areas—propulsion and the flight deck. All eight boilers were completely rebuilt. This included 100% re-tubing, new fire brick, new casings, and new burners. Force draft blowers were replaced. The most advanced combustion controls were installed. All valves  1 1/2″ or larger were completely replaced or reworked. All steam driven pumps were replaced or renovated at both the turbine and pump end. Electric motors were rewound or replaced and the pumps they drove refurbished. In effect the ship got a brand new plant. Safety aside, the intent of any mods to the flight deck is to decrease cycle time—the time delay between launches from an individual catapult. To accomplish that in SLEP, virtually all of the flight deck systems were upgraded. Flight deck lighting and communications systems were upgraded from the ‘60s era. Landing aids were improved. The rotary retract engines (the device that returns the catapult shuttle to the starting position) we redesigned to bring the shuttle back as fast as it went out. The catapult troughs were replaced with a harder, tougher alloy that decreased warping and was aligned using lasers. USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) pulls out of Philadelphia Naval Shipyard after going through its SLEP in 1991., USN New arresting gear engines were installed that had a higher stopping capacity, less of a jerk when setting the tail hook and faster recovery. Catapult receivers—the reservoirs that held steam pressure before the launch valve opened to admit steam to the rear of the shuttles— were redesigned to spray water into the receiver after launch which flashed to steam and increased pressure quicker than admitting steam alone. A new, longer lasting non-skid compound was applied to the flight deck itself. It was a tremendous effort. As I watched the Kitty Hawk leave Philly for the final time, my mind returned to the last time I experienced that ship leave the yards. It was kind of sad to not be leaving with her, but the last time I was in Main Control, at least the view was much better this time. The tough transition from sea to shore What makes going out to the sea in ships so special to me is the unity of purpose—the cohesion of officers and crew that occurs on a good ship with good leaders. You have a mission, the work is hard, the environment dangerous, the family separation sometimes tortuous. There is always the possibility lurking in the back of your mind that suddenly, without warning, you may face a very hazardous situation—combat, weather or rocks and shoals. But the rewards, although seldom concrete, either in recognition or financially, are tremendous. The feeling of working together, as a division, a department or as a whole ship’s crew to accomplish a difficult task, especially one that is in defense of your nation, is hard to describe—just as hard as describing to someone who has never faced the rigors of Navy life at sea the meaning of the word “shipmate.” Taylor also served aboard the USS TALYOR R. RAY (CG-871) a Spruance class destroyer during the late 1970s., USN There were no shipmates in the shipyard. There was no wardroom, only a boardroom. There was no real sense of working together for a goal. The only goals that were stressed were cost and schedule, but it seemed that that was only a gauze mask over the real goal—get a star for one of the four Captains assigned to the yard. Although quality was stressed as propaganda (the yard had adopted Deming’s Total Quality Management for the SLEP program), the definition of quality was the cost of rework, not making sure that the ship left with the best possible overhaul. The mission was so nebulous and the goals so poorly defined, that it was hard to commit to them. I confess that I am fond of sailors. The courser, more profane, the dirtier the better. During my time of service, our recruit training did a marvelous job of breaking down a disparate group of individuals to the lowest common denominator and building them back up into members of a team. If you could get them to a ship fast enough that spirit remained and they melding into the crew. Sailors are resourceful, show dogged determination and have a genius for problem solving—as long as you keep them informed and motivated, and let them know they are appreciated. Other than those assigned to the ship, there were very few sailors at the shipyard. The Engineering Duty Officers assigned there generally had only a tour or two at sea and were not interested in going back. I felt, the entire time I was in Philly that I really was not in the Navy anymore. It was time to retire. The feasibility of returning Kitty Hawk to service as part of the Navy’s 355 ship, 12 aircraft carrier goal Author’s note, you can read background on this issue here . I am certain, regardless of the quality of layup upon decommissioning and the maintenance since, that the Kitty Hawk’s propulsion system can be brought back up. There may be an issue of repair parts, one that will dog the ship for however long her re-incarnation lasts, but there is enough expertise left in the Boiler Code at NAVSEA Philadelphia that the system can be restored. But this won’t last for long as funding and retirements have taken their toll. Foster Wheeler (boiler OEM) is still in business, although owned by foreign concerns now, and some remnants of General Regulator (combustion controls) and Hagan (feed pump controls) must exist as well. I am certain that communications and computers can be upgraded and A/C and chill water systems can be beefed up to support the new electronics. I am certain that the flight deck can be re-certified. I am certain that berthing compartments can be rehabbed and altered to accommodate a mixed crew. I am certain that all of this can be accomplished in less time and for a lower cost than building a new big deck aircraft carrier. USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) stored in reserve in Bremerton, Washington. , Quillc/wikicommons I am equally certain that, if this all happens, the ship will never be able to operate safely for any period of time. There are no Boiler Technicians left. There are no Automatic Combustion Control Operator and Maintenance courses established and factory courses may suffice for a while, but they are very expensive. There are no 1200 PSI Maintenance Courses left either, and the associated training equipment has probably been cannibalized or salvaged. There are at least seven Boiler Technician watch stations per fire room, even with a port and starboard watch rotation, that requires 56 watch standers from grades E-3 to E-6. That does not account for maintenance and supervisory personnel, or the Oil & Fuel lab or the Catapult Shop. Finding and training and qualifying, either by recall, rate conversion or recruitment, that many BTs is a nearly impossible task. And, ironically, although it is a large number of techs to find to support this one ship, it is not nearly enough of a trainee load to justify the cost of standing up the aforementioned schools. Oh, yeah, you need BTs for instructors there too. Nothing is impossible with enough time, money and effort. But I submit that there are better solutions to the “carrier gap” than throwing money at a 56 year old carrier. The first thing that comes to mind is to rethink our policies regarding the necessities for, and use of, an aircraft carrier. Let capabilities drive our operations for a while, rather than the other way around. It is time for long term sustainability planning vice short term strategic thinking. Regenerating other ships in the Navy’s mothball fleet The out of service Ticonderoga class cruisers have been hanger queens for NAVSEA Philadelphia for so long that I don’t think there is much left of their propulsion systems. They were always overloaded and had very little excess buoyancy remaining. Remember how old they are. They are based on the Spruance class hull (hence the buoyancy problem) and their technology is very old. Even if you could upgrade their Aegis combat system to current levels, you would still have to install new propulsion and electrical generating turbines. Then you would have to completely overhaul the missile handling and launching system or find a way to install a Vertical Launch System. None of this is going to address the buoyancy issue. In a word, I do not think it’s feasible. The sorry state of the USS TICONDEROGA (CG-47) at the naval yards in Philadelphia., BIGBIRD78/Wikicommons If you are looking to boost ship numbers quickly, the Perry class might make you look twice, but they are also old. They are a mélange of foreign systems—NATO frigate, remember. That Otto Melara gun mounted on the O-4 level midships is a popgun and the fire control system (of Dutch origin) is not much better. Same missile launcher issues as the Ticos, they are about the same age, but the FFGs did not have Aegis. Probably have to severely upgrade the A/C and chill water systems to handle the electronics heat load if the combat systems were upgraded. The sonar is pitiful, in either mode. They do have the capacity to house two ASW helicopters, but we never had enough helicopters to give them two—the other hangar made a great gym and weight room—and I don’t think we do now. Here’s at least one barrier to bringing the battleships back and one barrier to operate them. As far as bringing them back, boiler makers are almost extinct. Navy and civilian shipyards no longer maintain boiler repair shops. As far as operating them, they have very few automated systems, and those they have were kludged from the first time we brought the ships back under Reagan, or the second time in the case of the USS New Jersey . USS NEW JERSEY (BB-62) before her retirement. Today the Iowa class battleships all serve as museums, but the possibility of bringing them back into service is always a hotly debated, if not far-fetched topic. , USN Anybody still living who remembers how to operate their boilers, or their guns for that matter, is too old to get down the ladders. Frankly, with the improvement of the accuracy of air or missile delivered munitions, I can find no rationale for trying to resurrect a ship whose sole purpose in life was to hurl a shell the size of a VW Bug halfway to China. The retirement of the USS Enterprise and the Navy’s seemingly non-existent plan on how to dispose of it Author’s note, you can read background on this issue here . No matter what the official word was, that ship was unsafe to steam. It was designed in the ’50s and has been worked hard ever since being commissioned in the early ’60s. Through my contacts in the last company for whom I worked before retirement, I have some fairly intimate knowledge of the material condition of that ship. Without going into specifics, or revealing anything classified, I cannot say any more other than the fact it was a major accident, but not a nuclear one, waiting to happen. There is no bigger picture. Any carrier gap would have only gotten bigger, quite suddenly, if the Big E wasn’t tied up. As far as dismantling the ship, the cores and irradiated structural and mechanical components in the reactor compartments are an issue. The Navy used to operate an Expended Core Facility in Idaho Falls which was just a big swimming pool keeping exhausted cores cool until all the fissionable material had fissioned to non-existence—half life of radioactive Cesium anyone? I am sure it is still there, but I do not know how much room is left. We would not have that problem—or the one with the waste from municipal reactors—if Jimmy Carter had not, by executive order, prohibited the construction and use of breeder reactors to turn the expended fuel cells into useable reactor fuel. His argument was that he wanted to keep radioactive cobalt out of the hands of rogue states. He was a Nuclear trained man, too. Decommissioned USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) is in limbo as the Navy isn’t sure how to dispose of its first nuclear supercarrier., USN There is a certain unwarranted paranoia about all things nuclear. I had the distinct honor of having lunch with Dr. Edward Teller after he had addressed the assembled staff and faculty at NPGS Monterey. He asserted that that paranoia had its roots in the terrible destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that we should have just dropped a demonstration weapon on one of the outlying islands. Great physicist but lousy historian. Regardless, the precautionary measures that are federally mandated for handling of irradiated materials make it too expensive for maritime salvage operators, who work on a very thin margin which is very vulnerable to market fluctuations, to make any money on salvaging Enterprise . I have no knowledge of what they did with Long Beach. In the mid ‘90s, I led a team that did an analysis of the possibility of scrapping former Soviet warships at the recently closed Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. One of the roadblocks we encountered was an Environmental Protection Agency advisory that we would have to keep the ships on blocks above the 100 year tide mark for at least ten years because of the PCBs in the paint! If there is that much of a reaction to a rather mundane organic compound, I can only guess at the panic that nuclear waste might cause at a shipyard in the tidewater region. As part of our study, I sent one of my engineers, a former Soviet Navy warrant officer, with a Congressional delegation to look at some of the possible victims for dismemberment in Philly.  You do not want to know how they are caring for their mothballed nuclear surface ships. Getting more service life out of the ships the Navy already has Author’s note, you can read background on this issue here . One word. Maintenance. Budgets have shrunk funds available for maintenance at all levels, at O (organizational, I (intermediate) and D (depot). Yard worthy items are deferred and deferred and deferred. Operational tempo has impacted proper maintenance and training does not support the execution of O level maintenance, either preventive or corrective. The DDGs ( Arleigh Burke class destroyers) are well designed, mature weapons systems. Regular good maintenance and regular tech refreshes can keep them going for a long time. We have enough of them that our sailors can gain experience at all levels in the command structure as they progress through their careers, ensuring a robust corporate knowledge. One of the greatest dangers to older ships is tank and void corrosion and hull thinning, but NAVSEA has taken some rigorous steps recently to handle those problems. It is, I think, a better idea to spend the little money available on maintaining the goods ships you have rather than the billions sunk into R&D, design and procurement of a new class of ships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 19, 2020",Is The United States Firing Off “Electricity Bombs” in Syria?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It sounds like something straight out of Call of Duty video game sequel, James Bond movie, or Batman comic. Troops call in an air strike, but instead of high explosives , the pilots employ a weapon that screws with the enemy’s electronics, disabling them or making them catch fire or even explode, becoming little bombs in of themselves. But it’s not a plot device from a Hollywood blockbuster or video game. It’s a detail passed along from a journalist in Syria – and what’s more, some part of the report might be true. We’ve seen at least one similar rumor emanating from a modern battlefield in the past. The new report emerged on July 7, 2017, when Jenan Moussa, a “roving reporter Arabic Al Aan TV,” an Arabic-language satellite television network with its headquarters in the United Arab Emirates, wrote on Twitter that members of the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces told her American warplanes sometimes dropped an “electricity bomb.” The SDF fighters added that when the weapon went off, anyone carrying metallic items would “burn.” “They call it electricity bomb here bcz [because] they don’t know real name,” Moussa wrote in a string of Tweets that included video and pictures from the city of Raqqa , ISIS’ de facto capital. “When plane wants to drop electricity bomb, we are told to drop anything metal that we carry. Otherwise we also burn like ISIS fighters.” Right from the start it sound like a conspiracy theory and many are likely to quickly dismiss it as such. To be sure, the idea that a “bomb” would cause metal objects to become so hot as to burn anyone carrying them, or any similar effect sounds like an easy recipe for a civilian casualty nightmare with the potential for innocent people to get burned at the dinner table by their own silverware and children to get injured by their metal toys. But what if it wasn’t a bomb or a missile, at least in the traditional sense? What if the weapon described by fighters to Moussa was actually focused microwave beam, highly localized electromagnetic pulse munition, or even some sort of pinpoint cyber attack? Maybe the SDF fighters saw the aftermath of any one of these types strikes and assumed the metal parts had burned up because they were the target of such weapon rather than just secondary effect from its use. Or maybe people’s cell phones are catching fire or exploding and it isn’t clear why, which is hardly an unheard of concept. The idea of a weapon that could fit on an unmanned aircraft and stop cars using a pulse of energy or ignite cellphones at the flip of a switch would definitely be a desirable new capability if engineers could get it to work. It is hardly the most outlandish concept the U.S. military or American intelligence agencies have ever pursued. What we do know is this sounds an awful lot like another strange report we’d heard of before and it seems possible, at least in part, based on weapons and other equipment that already exists, or that could potentially exist clandestinely, that some kernal of truth could be behind them. If anything else, these rumors can act as a jumping off point for us to brainstorm how the weapons of tomorrow could obtain such tactical effects, regardless of if they actually exist today or not. An airmen prepares to load a 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B onto a B-1 bomber ahead of a strike on targets in Libya in 2011., USAF An old rumor Moussa’s report from Syria fits loosely with at least one other equally vague report dating back more than five years. The common theme between the two is the broad description of some sort of electronics-busting weapons that hamper enemy activities rather than necessarily killing them outright. In November 2011, the international wire service AFP ran a story about secret American teams guarding chemical weapons stockpiles in Libya. With the help of a NATO-led air campaign, rebels overran these sites as they overthrew the regime of long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Fearing these weapons of mass destruction could fall into terrorist hands in the ensuing chaos , the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. military , swooped in to guard the chemical-filled bunkers. Commercial chemical containers sit out in the open in Libya in 2011., AP “Stun bombs had also already been used against other fighters roaming on the site some days earlier, recalled Safi ad-Din,” according to AFP’s report. “All the curious ones risk an air strike if they get closer than 50 meters (yards) to the chemical bunkers.” It was unclear whether ad-Din, a Libyan chemical weapons “expert” who was working with the American personnel, was referring to an air-dropped weapon of some description or a more mundane weapon like a flashbang or stun-ball hand grenade. However, Ahmed Misrati, who AFP described simply as a “fighter,” separately added that an airstrike had previously “destroyed” a car with two occupants “without anybody even being hurt.” This would have been quite a feat for a specialized high-explosive weapon like the BLU-129/B Very Low Collateral Damage Bomb or even an inert, concrete-filled type. Purpose-built designs like these are still very lethal, as we saw when something similar killed Abu Khayr al Masri, then Al Qaeda’s number two man, in Syria in February 2017. Instead, what ad-Din and and Misrati seemed to be describing was some sort of airborne or air-dropped less than lethal weapon that could stun personnel or cripple a car’s operating electronics. As fanciful as that idea sounds, this would be in line with technology the U.S. military has been working on and demonstrated in laboratory settings since before the intervention in Libya. A truck-mounted Active Denial System “pain ray.”, USAF Very real weapons The desire for weapons that provide “scalable” effects ranging from disrupting to destroying electronics and associated power infrastructure already make perfect sense. Electronics have become essential to modern military operations, from navigation to targeting and more . On top of that, concerns about civilian casualties have become an increasing important issue, especially in limited conflicts against terrorists and insurgents where air strikes are very likely to occur in densely packed urban environments full of innocent bystanders – like Raqqa. In 1991, the U.S. Navy fired so-called “ Kit-2 ” Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles into Iraq. These dropped spools of highly-conductive carbon fiber wire over power stations causing short circuits. Though there are few other available details about this configuration, the missiles were reportedly responsible for decimating Iraqi power generation during the conflict. In 1999, F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters did the same thing in Serbia, but this time using special cluster bombs full of BLU-114/B submunitions . The press quickly dubbed these previously undisclosed weapons, each full of graphite filament, “soft bombs” and “ blackout bombs .” Unfortunately, carbon fiber and graphite payloads only work on uninsulated power lines, which greatly limits their overall usefulness. Since then, the U.S. military has publicly pushed to develop directed energy weapons – a broad category that includes both lasers and high power microwave beams – to produce more consistent effects, as well as narrowing the focus of an attack closer to the target itself and otherwise limit any collateral impact. In 2012, one such design emerged as part of a project known as the Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project, or CHAMP . Unlike the earlier weapons, this design, tucked away inside a stand-off cruise missile, featured a powerful microwave emitter that could knock out electronics with its pulsing beam. An artist’s conception of the CHAMP weapon., Boeing capture In a test, the U.S. Air Force and prime contractor Boeing had successfully used prototype unit, inside a modified AGM-86 air-launched cruise missile, to knock out a number of target computers in a mock, two-story office building. The missile went on to attack other targets at a test range in Utah before crashing at a predetermined location. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0mjua2e8Y7k Two years later, the U.S. Air Force claimed it would have a working “counter-electronics weapon” prototype by the end of the decade. As of 2015, the Air Force was still actively working on the CHAMP concept, with plans to install the device on the stealthy Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) cruise missile. However, the service has been especially secretive about the progress of the program or whether it has experimented with installing the equipment itself in manned or unmanned aircraft. There is also the possibility that properly configured and suitably powerful electronically scanned array radar arrays might be able to create similar damage by shooting out narrow beams of high power electromagnetic energy at certain targets types. At the same time, the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps have experimented with ground-based, less than lethal “ pain-rays ” for crowd control and other purposes, including a large vehicle-mounted arrangement known as the Active Denial System (ADS). The Air Force has talked about possibility installing this sort of equipment on AC-130 gunships and other aircraft in the past, too. These systems use a high power microwave beam to make subjects feel as if “their skin is on fire,” but it leaves no lasting wounds. There remains perpetual concerns, however, that ADS and other related devices could do real damage if someone turned the power up high enough or tuned the system to the wrong frequency. The potential fear, justified or not , of injuring or even killing someone with an officially “non-lethal” weapon has been one explanation as to why the U.S. military deployed one prototype ADS to Afghanistan, but never used it . But maybe most importantly, the U.S. Navy has been hard at work on radio-frequency disruptors than can zap the engine in a car or boat and bring them to a halt. One potential scenario would be bringing car or truck bombs to a halt before they can reach their target. If that doesn’t work, the same system might be able to trigger the explosives early, away from friendly forces. Engineers were already testing a prototype “RF Vehicle Stopper” during the 2008 fiscal year, according to a Naval Surface Warfare Center – Dahlgren Division presentation the author previously obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. USN via FOIA The same 2016 briefing said the hope was that the systems would be ready for field use by the 2017 or 2018 fiscal years. “Reduced size and weight will allow integration into multiple platforms,” one of the Powerpoint slides explained, which again could conceivably include manned aircraft or drones. A spin-off concept, the Pre-emplaced Electrical Vehicle Stopper (PEVS) was also in the works at that time. The equipment would act as an “electric, direct injection ‘speed-bump’ system [that] employs high voltage pulse to disrupt vehicle’s ECU [engine control unit],” another part of the briefing said. As such it “selectively stops single or multiple threat vehicles.” USN via FOIA The basic underlying technology has only been getting smaller and more portable, too. Raytheon, which manufactures both active electronically scanned array radars and the ADS, has found that gallium-nitritde makes for compact, highly efficient solid state emitters in radars. It’s latest Aegis and Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) systems are built around groups of smaller units that fit neatly inside uniform two foot cubes. The firm hopes to ultimately translate some of these same principles to a new, smaller and more mobile active denial arrangement. Raytheon is also responsible for the compact laser weapon that the U.S. Army tested on an AH-64 Apache gunship helicopter in June 2017, proving that a functional airborne laser weapon was no longer required a massive aircraft to haul it around, something that will only push other services to continue pursuing their own offensive and defensive directed energy projects. In addition, the U.S. military has seized on both miniaturized lasers and lightweight jammers as a key way of countering the emerging threat of small enemy drones, which will likely promote the development of other new directed energy technologies. There are always cyber weapons, which the U.S. military has referred to as “ cyber bombs ” in the past, too. BAE Systems has already created a secretive computer program known as Suter that reportedly can trick radars into pointing the wrong direction or possibly crash military air defense networks altogether. Depending on how it breaches an opposing system, it could theoretically disable power regulating functions on various electronic equipment, causing them to overheat and either shut down or “burn” and destroy themselves. What little information available about Suter says it is almost entirely focused on countering air defense systems, but the same concept could apply to other networks electronic components as well. We already know that the U.S. Intelligence Community did something similar in principle on a much more localized level in Iran. The famous Stuxnet worm crippled Iran’s nuclear enrichment program for a time by screwing with the industrial control software controlling the centrifuges, causing them to spin out of control and tear themselves apart. There was also reportedly a follow-on plan for a series of much more ambitious and widespread cyber attacks, known collectively as “ Nitro Zeus ,” in the event the Iran Deal failed. In April 2017, the U.S. Army publicly disclosed it was working on a concept that envisioned a future where troops could call in cyber attacks like artillery fire. The service had tested a mobile system simply known as “Killer” that had the ability to use on board gear and unspecified space-based assets to disrupt nearby enemy networks. A separate “Hunter” vehicle was focused purely on knocking out small drones. The U.S. Army’s Hunter and Killer on the move during an experimental exercise in April 2017., U.S. Army This is just what we know about , too. A 2012 U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which we also obtained via FOIA, outlines eight electronic warfare missions , including one that is classified secret. CENTCOM is the U.S. military’s top warfighting command for the Middle East and much of Central Asia, including overseeing the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. “Military action involving the use of [directed energy] weapons, devices, and countermeasures to incapacitate, cause direct damage or destruction of adversary equipment, facilities, and/or personnel or to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the [electromagnetic spectrum] through damage, destruction, and disruption,” is how the regulation describes directed energy warfare. The redacted mission could involve other kinds of distributed attacks that might be able to create similar effects. CENTCOM via FOIA It is very possible, if almost a certainty, that, just like still secret manned aircraft and drones, there are exotic payloads and weapons that have yet to make it out into the light. The U.S. military, including the NSA, and the CIA already track targets for more conventional air strikes via their cellphone signals alone . It’s not hard to imagine a podded microwave beam and one small enough to fit on an unmanned vehicle that could be flying over Raqqa zapping terrorist electronics. A malware toting cyber weapon, or a drone carrying a directed energy weapon capable of turning that phone into a searing hot iron that injures or maims the individual carrying it on the spot sounds like the sort of thing the CIA would be interested in if it was at all feasible. It would help explain why the SDF told Moussa they had to drop everything rather than just power down any electronic devices until the threat had passed by the group. When it comes to clandestine flying directed energy weapons, and even the ability to deliver a cyber weapon to certain networks directly, those are the kind of exotic payloads that engineers might be able to keep hidden at a number secretive test sites, such as the one at the edge of Yucca Dry Lake near Area 51. This testing facility, sometimes called Area Six , reportedly has ties to the CIA’s own unmanned aircraft programs and associated equipment. Marines gather together weapons captured from insurgents in Iraq., USMC Confusion, disinformation, and tall tales Now, there is still the distinct possibility that this latest story from Syria is a misinterpretations of first- or second-hand accounts or outright fabrication on the part of the SDF. Their claims could be a part or the product of active disinformation campaigns or other psychological warfare. On battlefield story may simply have taken on a life of its own. There is always a certain fear of the unknown in warfare and this would be especially true for irregular groups fighting against larger, more technologically superior foreign opponents. Maybe rumors of almost absurdly advanced weaponry is how fighters are inclined to frame their disadvantages. However it happens, we’ve seen these sorts of stories develop organically many times before. Notably, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. military found that insurgents had somehow come to the conclusion that the orange air identification panels on M1 Abrams tanks and other armored vehicles, there to help prevent friendly fire incidents, were actually force field generators . As a result, American forces began to find RPG warheads covered in electrical tape or with plastic bags, which militants also thought was enough to break through this barrier. A child soldier in Liberia in 1996 wears a diving vest, likely with supposed magical properties, for protection., AP Another popular example is of Liberian rebels in the 1990s and 2000s who wore orange life jackets and other mismatched clothing items imbued with magic to make them impervious to bullets. There are countless similar stories from conflicts the world over, often with few obvious explanations as to how the specific battlefield superstition came about. The “electricity bombs” in Syria and the “stun bombs” of Libya could very easily be bogus, too. But at the same time, we do know that the U.S. military is working to make a broad selection of weapons with similar sounding capabilities a reality. So, just perhaps, the SDF fighters in Raqqa weren’t as crazy as they seemed at first glance.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",China’s Base in the Horn of African Has a Huge Underground Bunker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fresh satellite imagery of China’s new military base in Djibouti shows it is significantly more complex, with a large underground component, and an expansive defensive perimeter, than originally thought. The new details only underscore the importance of the facilities and the likelihood that they will serve as more than just a logistics hub for future Chinese operations. Geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor published the images , which it obtained though another partner, AllSource Analysis, which showed the site in the Horn of Africa as it existed on April 2 and July 4, 2017. The annotated images specifically highlighted new 25 foot wide walls, as well as guard posts and fences. For what is ostensibly a naval facility, there’s a notable lack of docks directly adjacent to any of the facilities. But the most impressive feature by far is a massive underground complex covering an estimated area of nearly 250,000 square feet. “The underground entrance connects to other underground facilities at the base as well,” according to Stratfor’s own analysis. “Besides the large underground structure, several smaller tunnels and bunkers were built throughout the base. This type of construction is in line with known Chinese practices in hardening military bases.” China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is definitely no stranger to large subterranean construction. The PLA’s Second Artillery Corps, the name of the country’s land-based nuclear forces, operates a single network of more than 3,000 miles of tunnels, which state media has dubbed the “ Underground Great Wall .” There’s also the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) extensive network of underground facilities, including a submarine pen , on Hainan Island. The underground projects make sense. They afford added protection against attacks and destructive environmental hazards, like sand and severe weather. As Stratfor noted, Chinese personnel could use the space to conduct a variety of activities discreetly, too. If nothing else, it adds significantly more storage room to what might otherwise be a cramped enclave. A portion of the underground part of the base likely includes hardened bunker areas for a command post and other sensitive operations spaces. With entrances that look large enough to drive vehicles in and out of, the PLA might be able to keep a portion of the base’s motor pool or other equipment safely stored away from the elements. It would be an ideal way of finding room for reserves of fuel, lubricants, and water, too. The landing platform dock Jingangshan and semi-submersible logistics ship Donghaidao set sail for Djibouti earlier in July 2017., Xinhua The base needs these and other resources to both to perform its day to day functions, whatever they may be, and support PLAN task forces as they move in and out the area. If China hopes to make the base a regular port of call for larger groups of ships, including future carrier battle groups , it will need to have significant reserves of a number of items on hand. It’s also worth noting that the largest area of underground construction at China’s Djibouti base sits under what otherwise appears to be a series of hangars and an attached aircraft apron that does not appear big enough at present to handle fixed wing aircraft, like fighter jets, surveillance planes, cargo aircraft, or even larger drones, but could support either helicopters or smaller drones. It is possible that fuel storage underneath could feed into pump stations or hydrants above ground. Having all this on hand would give the base the ability to operate independently from local suppliers for at least a short period of time if necessary, too. Maybe part of the underground complex will contain a generating station to provide a separate and secure power supply, as well. Whatever the purpose of this underground complex is, it’s definitely an important development and one that highlights many of the points we at The War Zone made earlier in July 2017 when we took an in depth look at China’s plans: But these official missions are just one piece of the larger picture. Beyond regional security concerns, the facility in Djibouti can only help China obvious desire to expand its military presence well beyond its borders. The African country is strategically located near the Suez Canal, providing a stable, Chinese-controlled stop-over point for military fleets heading to Europe and beyond. Its especially well positioned to both protect the transport of Middle Eastern and African energy and mineral resources critical to China’s overall economic development, as well as provide storage space for the fuel and other supplies the PLA needs to conduct operations in Africa and Europe. Having these port facilities will be essential if the country wants to conduct far-flung carrier battle group operations. It seems almost guaranteed that once the base in fully operational the country’s first operational carrier, the Liaoning , and its escorts will make it a regular port of call. A J-15 fighter jet lands on board the PLAN carrier Liaoning during a training exercise., AP There’s likely to be more construction to come, as well. As Stratfor’s analysis pointed out, without its own docks in Djibouti, the PLAN will have to continue using the country’s commercial port facilities. Helicopters could ferry small loads back and forth from ships off shore, but it would be much less efficient than loading and unloading pier side. When and if the Chinese decide to build these dock works, the final configuration of the base could be considerably larger. To accommodate the carrier Liaoning at its naval complex on Hainan Island, the PLAN built a new pier nearly 2,300 feet long , which made it the largest in the world. The Djibouti facility would need something similar if the flattop ever intended to tie up at the base proper. But it’s already clear that the Chinese are definitely serious about their new base. The new construction shows they are looking to get as much out of it as they can. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 18, 2019",Rogoway’s Reviews: Christopher Nolan’s War Epic Dunkirk,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There’s no doubt that Dunkirk is a hit. One of Hollywood’s hottest directors and creative minds, Christopher Nolan ( The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar ) delivered what is surely a unique war epic, and a highly entertaining one at that. But even though the film may succeed in the most obvious of and loudest of ways, it fails in smaller, more subdued but still critical aspects. In the end we are left with a relatively thrilling experience, but one filled with seemingly odd and somewhat distracting creative choices, which work to keep the film from rising to the top of the genre. Spoilers ahead, turn back now if that type of thing ruins your day! Let’s be clear, Dunkirk is an action thriller. It literally starts with a bang and builds in momentum and tension until its final intertwined crescendo. Above all else, the film reminds you that Nolan is an absolute master of blending sound, cinematography, and often times temporally complex editing to make a picture more than the sum of its parts. When it comes to those merits, and they are substantial, the movie was brilliant. Nolan also took some risks by throwing out the usual tropes that have populated these types of movies in the past. Namely, there is no love story. In fact, there is very little character development of any kind. This will leave some viewers feeling chilly when walking out into the light of the concession stands after the film’s relatively tidy 106 minute run time is up, but I found it refreshing. Additionally, in Dunkirk the audience never sees a single German soldier. Instead the movie’s nemesis is the passage of time. This is truly unorthodox storytelling for the genre, and works quite well. It also highlights the unique dynamics of the situation many allied troops found themselves in. But some viewers who don’t know the Dunkirk story going in may feel let down by the lack of running gun battles and Panzer tanks. Yes this film depicts the origins of the term the “Dunkirk Spirit,” which will play much better contextually in the UK than in the US. The evacuation of Dunkirk, and the battles that proceeded it, are a major source of national pride in Great Britain—something akin to their Apollo 13 moment, albeit with much grander stakes. But the historical accuracy of the movie as well as some of its rickety set pieces were disappointing, and not just for this defense writer who has heard the story many times before, but also for friends who had a much looser handle of the source material. Nolan on the set of Dunkirk . , AP My biggest gripe with Nolan’s Dunkirk was that it stumbled when it came to depicting the sheer scale of the event. This sounds preposterous considering the director’s ability to turn huge concepts into readily consumable cinema. And maybe the high hopes that go along with his talent being attached to a film are part of this disappointment. It also sounds ironic considering the movie was shot on the largest mainstream “film” format around—70mm. With Dunkirk it almost seems as if everything was grand in scale but the depiction of the evacuation itself. This served to undermine the impact of the film’s complex finale and maybe the point of the movie as a whole. Nolan relied heavily on practical effects when making Dunkirk instead of gobs of CGI or green screen wizardly. I applaud that, and greatly enjoyed seeing real Spitfires buzzing around over the English Channel, and real actors pulling off real stunts in choppy water. But there is a time and place for CGI, and when the movie needed it most, and still in a very sparingly manner—for the widest of shots—it failed to produce. Instead we were left with the impression that the evacuation of Dunkirk involved dozens of ships and thousands of men, not hundreds of ships—close to a thousands—and hundreds of thousands of men—nearly half a million. More simply put, the vacant feel of the sandy beaches and bodies of water depicted in the film removed me from the world Nolan was trying to create. It was a contradictory distraction, and a totally puzzling one. In some ways, it felt like you were watching a film from the 1960s shot on some magically high quality film for the era. It all seemed like a relatively small affair considering its source material, which created an odd tension between dialogue describing the scale of what we should be seeing and what we see with our own eyes. Nolan used cardboard cutouts to up the numbers of “troops” on Dunkirk beach, but it really wasn’t enough., AP Once again, this discrepancy could have been overlooked 30 years ago, but today, when television shows can afford believable CGI enhanced wide shots of great battles, it’s inexcusable. There were also small areas where CGI could have cleaned up or enhanced production mistakes and the limitations of superficial set dressings over modern buildings, and out of timeframe objects left in frame. Other issues, like the use of more modern naval ships as set pieces, seemed beneath this level of filmmaking too, but that type of thing could have been overlooked if the other issues were cleaned up in post production. One particular setting choice was the most puzzling, and really jolted me out of the moment at the worst possible time. The main characters are seen in a train car at the end of the film. The train car was clearly from decades after the war, like the late 1970s or 1980s. It was a bizarre and undermining moment in the film. I have no clue how this was overlooked, but it underlined to the larger issues I mentioned earlier. Obviously most of this was a conscious choice, but a logical or a creatively justified one? One would have a hard time arguing how. One would be advised not to look closely at the background while enjoying Dunkirk, bad set dressings and production choices could really remove you from the moment. Here the Dunkirk beachfront is being modified sparingly for the film., AP Then there was the orderly and overtly sanitary depiction of the event itself. Yes the British and allied forces showed stoic restraint during their seemingly futile wait for transport across the channel, but it wasn’t nearly as orderly or as sterile as what is depicted in the film. In fact, most of the soldiers looked like they just stepped out of the costuming trailers in fresh uniforms, a far cry from what the allied forces would have looked like after being on the run for days or even weeks prior to entering a siege-like state along Dunkirk’s shores. The Royal Air Force was the real star of the movie, almost to a strange degree. The depiction of aerial engagements were pretty much standard movie affair—relatively undynamic close formation flying at low altitude. But the 70mm format the movie was shot in does capture the Spitfires beautifully at times, and the in-cockpit shots and sound didn’t glamorize the “nuts and bolts” reality of piston engined fighters of the era, which was nice. Still, the Spitfire’s almost laughably endless ammunition magazine that only Hollywood can provide hurt the movie’s hardcore cred. A Spitfire had about a dozen or so seconds of firing time if I remember correctly, but these Spitfires might as well have been X-Wings considering their seemingly endless ammunition reserves. Aerial scenes were captured traditionally, by actually filming historic aircraft near the French coastlines. , AP Pilots’ inability to hit stationary targets at point-blank range was also an annoying lapse in authenticity, although filmmakers have traditionally sacrificed realism for narrative ease when it comes to dogfights. But maybe the ending scenes, where the hero Spitfire pilot, played by Tom Hardy, seems to glide for hours at low level—even doing a flyby and taking out another aircraft—before making a needless beach landing in enemy held territory at sunset, was the most eye roll inducing and needless feat of all. Then again there was even a scene where a heavily laden private catch, only capable of a handful of knots at flank speed, literally dodged a strafing run by a BF-109. Once again, most of these sequences seemed like childish distractions, not a glorious example of artistic license. Another strange choice was how the French were depicted in the film—largely as cowards that couldn’t save themselves. This was simply not representative of the big historical picture. The French not only helped with their own boats during the evacuation, but their soldiers held off the Germans so that British and other allied troops could escape. Many were killed or taken prisoner after standing their ground even though they knew that doing so was likely to be a death sentence. Nolan is able to largely cover up Dunkirk’s misfires with his incredible knack for pacing and the use of sound and score to keep viewers engaged. But the existence of these issues in a film that clearly attempts to set itself apart from other war films via chilly realism makes them more damning in retrospect. A good portion of the film takes place inside Supermarine Spitfires. , AP Without hardcore adhesion to accuracy, and without any deep character development, and relatively little dialogue for that matter, the story that was depicted could have occurred on a far away moon in a science fiction setting and it would have paid off in a similar manner. None of this makes Dunkirk a bad movie per se, far from it in fact. It is a good film, one that I recommend seeing in IMAX during its silver screen run. In fact, if action and suspense is all you’re looking for it is probably a great movie. But its blatant errors and odd creative choices keep it from rising to the top of its genre. And above all else, its inability to depict the grand scale of the historical event it is supposed to portray, meant the payoff was less than it could have been in the end.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In this the second and final part of our “Making Steam” series about the incredible experiences and career insights of US Navy Chief Engineer David Taylor— make sure to read the first part here —we talk memorable adventures and tense close calls on the high seas and what makes a good commanding officer. We also delve into some of the Navy’s most pressing and controversial issues. These include a mix of the service’s top procurement programs—some of which Taylor worked on directly—such as the electromagnetic aircraft launch systems (EMALS) and the DDG-1000 stealth destroyer—during his tenure as a civilian official at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. From near friendly fire incidents, to horrendous storms, to how to fix the Navy’s core problems, to the questionable need for Littoral Combat Ships, we cover it all. And just as you probably imagine any salty Navy Chief Engineer should be, Taylor’s commentary is blunt, bold and unafraid. Trepidation and tension on the high seas USS David R. Ray, Late 1979, Indian Ocean: The first few months in the Indian Ocean were hectic times. There were two battle groups there, the Midway’s and the Kitty Hawk’s , to which we were attached. We were there (I believe) to get the Iranians to attack us so that we could introduce them to the potentialities inherent in naval aviation. We were vectoring fighters to visually identify every aircraft that came anywhere close to the airspace above us. One such intercept was of a large, slow patrol craft heading westward from Karachi along the coast. As the pilot saw the F-4s from Midway approaching him, we heard him exclaim over the Military Air Distress frequency, in a very British accent, “don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! I am Pakistani” He must not have trusted his Identification Friend of Fore (IFF) system that much. During this period of operations I held the Tactical Action Officer watch. The Tactical Action Officer (TAO) is a position that recognizes that crews may not have time to wake and brief the CO before a Soviet SSN-7 missile flies up your stern, so, after a rigorous school and shipboard qualification, limited weapons release authority was granted to the TAO without the CO’s permission. General quarters on the bridge of a Spruance class destroyer. , USN A pair of F-14s were vectored out to identify an aircraft flying from the Arabian mainland, heading directly over us to the Kitty Hawk . One of the pilots called a “tally ho!” and identified the plane as a camouflaged F-4. The correlation circuitry in my forebrain went into overdrive. Midway has F-4s. There are the F-4s we gave the Iranians at Bandar Abbas. Midway’s are grey. The Iranians are… maybe camouflaged? I hit the General Quarters alarm. I had never seen us get to battle stations quicker. It was the real thing. Now, the Spruance class destroyer was not, in anyone’s imagination, an anti-air warfare (AAW) platform. We had a pretty good gun, with a good fire control system and Sea Sparrow missiles, good only for targets coming right at you. And this one was. In AAW, because of the high speed nature of planes and missiles, a philosophy of “command by negation” was frequently invoked. That meant, if you had a shot at a hostile aircraft, you did not wait for direction or permission to shoot. You merely announced over the AAW net that you were going to shoot and with what weapon. If Alfa Whiskey, the AAW commander, did not tell you to hold fire, you shot. The bogie continued down our throat. The Captain had just made it to CIC and I had picked up the radio mic and had drawn breath to say “taking vampire delta with guns and missiles” when our fighter jock came back over the control circuit and said, “wait, wait, it’s an Omani Jaguar!” I don’t know when I had a bigger pucker factor, just before I almost released weapons or later when we were told that the plane was piloted by a Royal Air Force major, seconded to the Sultan of Oman, flying the nephew of said Sultan out to look at the “big ships.” USS DAVID R. RAY (DD-971) being serviced at a very busy Subic Naval Base., USN USS David R. Ray, September 1979, somewhere northwest of of Midway Island in the Pacific: We were caught in a typhoon that blew up out of nowhere. My roommate and I were the only Deck Officers physically capable of standing a watch. I slept in Combat Information Center while he had the deck and vice versa. The seas were so high that the entire forecastle up to the break would disappear into an oncoming wave and then lift clear out of the water exposing our rather large sonar dome as the wave passed down the length of the ship. Remember that the Spruance class was the size of a WWII cruiser. During the storm, as Officer On Duty, I was amidships on the bridge, hanging desperately on to the cable that was strung from port to starboard especially for that purpose. An extremely heavy roll to port caused me to lose my right hand grip, spinning me around with my left hand as the pivot point until I was facing aft. As the roll eased, my eye caught the inclinometer mounted on the aft bulkhead. It showed a 50 degree roll , meaning that we had rolled beyond that. Makes you appreciate naval architects! Waves crashing over the bow of the USS DAVID R. RAY (DD-971), Courtesy of David Taylor The worst things about heavy weather are exhaustion and starvation. Exhaustion because you are constantly bracing against pitch and roll and even in the rack it is almost impossible to get any rest. Starvation because the galley is shut down in severe weather and even though the cooks lay out sandwich making materials, you can’t sit down to eat it. Oh, and the Operations Specialists had clear plastic trash bags tucked under the belt to be used as barf bags; some of them obviously used. Various ships, various times, various locations in the Western Pacific: I hate helicopters. They are loud and ugly and inherently un-flight worthy. The USS Sacramento , a replenishment ship, was assigned to the Kitty Hawk Battle Group. They were scheduled for a Operational Propulsion Plant Examination in the very near future and their Chief Engineer felt he needed some assistance in training his crew in Engineering Casualty Control. The battle group was about a week from Subic Bay, so I was volunteered to take our training team over to them and run drills until we hit port. They sent one of their CH-46s over to pick us up. I was sitting on the port side of the bird as we made our approach to the flight deck of Sacramento , which is aft, overhanging the fantail. As we were just about to land, I looked over my shoulder, out the window and saw, about two feet away, the name of the ship on the fantail. That meant the rotors were above the flight deck and the rest of the bird was below it. The pilot quickly lifted and set us down safely. He did not indicate whether that was standard operating procedure or not, but I have my own opinion on that. CH-46 Sea Knights aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63)., USN On another occasion, the David R. Ray was joining the Kitty Hawk Battle Group, with a rendezvous just north of Luzon. Prior to meeting we ran an exercise with the air wing, where they were to try to locate us while we hid among the small islands that define the Luzon Strait. They couldn’t, and as the carrier entered the engagement window of our Harpoon missile battery, we let them know by radio code that eight of them (simulated) were enroute. At exercise completion, the CO and I were requested to come aboard for a debrief and to pick up classified instructions and codes related to the battle group. They sent an SH-3 to pick us up. David R. Ray was the first Spruance Class destroyer to deploy to the 7th Fleet, thus we were somewhat of an unknown entity. Even though our flight deck was certified to land every rotating wing craft in the Navy’s inventory, the pilot flatly refused to believe us and balked at landing. He dropped the horse collar instead, and true to naval tradition, I, being the junior in the group, was the first up to be winched aboard the hovering helicopter. I was a stereotypical engineer. I wore coveralls, khaki of course, as often as possible. I like the smell of 2190 TEP (gear oil). I am terrified of heights. When I climbed the ladder outside the aft stack of the Henry B. Wilson to inspect it, I got a nose bleed. I believe I have properly set the stage here. I was winched up and when I got level with the craft, the crewman had to literally peal the collar off of me and drag me to my seat. Thankfully they landed and took off from the carrier’s flight deck to return us after the meeting. On the way back to David R. Ray , I convinced myself that it was not that bad and that I was now experienced and I would have no troubles going down. Whether it was an accident, a sudden gust of wind, or malice on the part of the flight crew, they turned me into a pendulum on the way down. Unbiased observers swear that I only swung back and forth twice, but I was there, I know for a fact that if that cable had parted, I would have been slung to Manila! I hate helicopters! Hot steam, cool memories USS David R. Ray, November-December 1979, enroute and in and around the Indian Ocean to join the Kitty Hawk Battle Group moving in response to the invasion of our embassy in Teheran, Iran: My Operations Specialists’s were children of the ’70s. Bright, but a little laid back. They knew their stuff but they were mostly first crew, so they spent a lot of time in schools waiting for the ship to be finished. A little lax in grooming, a little flippant at times, but never disrespectful. Laid back. Cool. It was like a switch was thrown when we entered the Indian Ocean. The prospect of combat was real. To a man, they became steely eyed professionals. The horse play in the Combat Information Center stopped. The bitching stopped. Through almost three months of Condition II watches (one step down from battle stations), they never wavered. When the tocsin sounded, they went from tie dyed disco monsters to American sailors. That was cool. USS Kitty Hawk, sometime in 1977, off Singapore, just before midnight: The skipper of Kitty Hawk was a cautious man. There was no way he was going to lose an airplane on this deployment. Consequently, he insisted that we have 6 of 8 boilers online every time planes were in the air. We were falling behind on boiler maintenance because we could not shut them down long enough for them to cool down. The Chief Engineer finally convinced the skipper to let us conduct flight ops with less boilers lit. The last plane to come down had a problem. It needed more wind over the deck than we could make with four boilers and it was getting light on fuel. The skipper ordered us to quickly bring up two more boilers and simultaneously ordered up our max speed for the four boiler configuration. As an aside, “Monday morning” CAGs (carrier air group commander) noted we could have kept the aircraft in question tanked with KA-6Ds for a long time, but who knows. Night Ops aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63)., USN As we were pushing to bring up two additional boilers in 2 and 4 main, we lost control air (pneumatic boiler controls) in 1 main. Normally we could have handled the boiler manually, but the steaming rate was so high that the watch lost control and we had to shut down because of a low water level. Normal procedure in that case is to cross connect main steam from 4 main, but it was firing high and also in the process of assisting in bringing a second boiler online. In the end, this sucked 4 main offline. The Engineer Officer of the Watch should have cut his losses there but in a semi panic, he tried to get steam from the after plants and they cascaded into failure. Making matters worse, as the Kitty Hawk’s whole primary plant failed, the emergency diesel engines did not start. We were hot, dark and quiet—with a plane running out of fuel. Luckily, the pilot had enough gas to get to Singapore. Unluckily the military airfield shut down at dark and he had to land at a municipal airport—with real missiles under the wings of his jet and with their arming wires pulled.  It was an international incident in the making. Lieutenant Doug Crowder (he made two stars last I heard), and I were sitting in the Engineering log room when we heard the sounds of the world crashing down around us. We immediately dropped down to main control—a very large space that encompassed damage control central as well as propulsion and auxiliary supervisory watchstanders. He got on the sound powered communications circuit with the Machinists Mates and I grabbed the Boiler Technicians. Between us, we began to put the world back together. One of the design features of most steam plants is system redundancy, not only in number of redundant pumps, but also in the types. Each function in the steam cycle can be performed by either a steam driven or electric pump. In cases like this, you can bootstrap a start up by bleeding steam off of a recently secured boiler, but you have to be careful, very careful. Not only is there an inherent possibility of machinery damage, but you don’t get many chances before you run out of steam pressure entirely. Doug was talking to four different machinery topwatches and I had four boiler technician topwatches to work with. Each space had flawlessly performed immediate emergency shutdown procedures and it was time to start bringing the plant back online. Doug and I knew we were pushing the envelope and cutting corners a bit because we did not know the aircraft had already gone “Bingo” (minimum fuel to return to a recovery point) to Singapore. USN When we would order an action not in accordance with procedures, the top watches would verbally note that it was not correct and then immediately comply when we reiterated. In due course we brought the plant back up, lights on and ready to answer all bells. Sweat soaked and exhausted, we were finally able to take off our headsets and look around. What we saw was what looked like every officer on board above the rank of O-4 (LCDR), many of them wearing wings, standing in the back of main control, watching the show. From then on, we referred to this incident as the “20 Khaki Emergency.” But our snipes had done exactly as they were trained to do, in the order they were supposed to do it, with absolutely no equipment damage or personnel injuries. All in spaces illuminated just by battery powered battle lanterns and with no ventilation in absurd heat (Singapore is almost on the Equator). Now that was cool. An interesting postscript. Of course an investigation had to be held and the Air Wing Chief of Staff was designated to conduct it. Except he had little or no knowledge of steam plants, so I had to give him a private lesson on high pressure steam propulsion systems— on a white board. This was well before Power Point. USS Henry B. Wilson 1984, somewhere in the South China Sea: Fresh (potable) and boiler feed water is distilled from seawater on these ships by a three stage flash evaporator. It is a very complicated system but just about every component can be jury rigged in case of failure, except one; the inter stage distillate pump. There are two distilling plants on this class of ship, one in each engine room. If you run a tight plant, their capacity is sufficient to feed the boiler, wash clothes and dishes and provide regular, reasonable showers for all hands. The inter stage distillate pump had just failed on #1 Evaporator. We were a long way from any repair facility and a replacement was not carried on board. Fortunately, we were scheduled for a refueling replenishment the next day. I cannot describe the humiliation I felt when I had to go to the ops officer and ask him to request feed water as well as a replacement distillate pump for the next scheduled replenishment. The oiler had good water and were glad to provide it us. Only one problem. Tank levels on this class of ship are determined by dropping a graduated measuring tape down a sounding tube, then pulling it up to determine the level in the tank. These levels are reported by sound powered phone to the Oil Lab, where the Oil King has a table that correlates level to tank capacity. He is in communication with not only the men on the sounding tapes, but also those standing by at the valve manifolds who open or close valves as necessary to direct the fluid to the proper tank. The same procedure applies to feed water tanks. The problem? There is only one sound powered phone circuit for both water and fuel tanks. The Oil King took the fuel on-load and I took charge of taking on the water, because if I screwed up, water is much easier to clean up than diesel. We took on a full load of fuel and topped off our feed bottoms without spilling a drop of either liquid. The men maintained perfect circuit discipline and never missed a sounding or a call to redirect to a new tank. Humiliation and pride, what a combination. That was cool. USS England Spring 1986, pierside Naval Station San Diego: I always maintained a very good relationship with the crew, regardless of whether they worked for me a not. They knew that I appreciated what they did and how hard it was. It may have been partially due to the years I wore a white hat (enlisted sailor) but mostly it was a feeling of mutual respect. I did not knock down the wall between officer and enlisted men, but we certainly leaned on the fence and had conversations. On Friday nights underway, I would relieve the junior officer responsible for sampling the crew’s mess of his duties and would get behind the serving line. As each sailor came by to get his portion of whatever I was dishing out, I would offer some sort of comment or greeting. After the initial surprise wore off, most of them came to look forward to the interaction, asking me where I had been on those nights when other duties interfered. USS ENGLAD (CG-22) being buzzed by a Russian “May” maritime patrol aircraft., USN I have said many times that one of the toughest jobs in the Navy was being my Auxiliary Officer—the man responsible for things like galley and scullery equipment. It was well known that I considered the mess decks the most important space on the ship because a well fed sailor, while not necessary a happy sailor, is certainly a nourished sailor. I would go out of my way to traverse the mess decks regularly and it was the first space I visited when I came aboard mornings in port, even before I had changed into my uniform. If the trash cans were full of paper plates (scullery down) or there were big jars of peanut butter and loaves of bread out (ovens or coppers down), then the next thing you heard over the 1MC was “Aux Officer, report to the Chief Engineer”. I did not however have as cordial a relationship with the commanding officer. He demanded personal loyalty, I offered only loyalty to the Commanding Officer, USS England .  There is a difference. The only time I failed to get underway on time was when he authorized, over my objection, major high pressure piping repairs. I knew that it would not get done in time. His buddy, the CO of the tender, needed work for his high pressure welders. We passed every engineering inspection, we got kudos for our maintenance coordination with WESTPAC repair facilities and we kept the lights on and the Combat Systems energized and cool for 18 months. But I would not sign on to his attempt to railroad a young officer nor would I direct my warrant officer to go on the pier and fix his car. The XO warned me that he could kill me with a bad fitness report, but I had already been selected for Engineering Duty Officer, and as I told the XO, I was already four pay grades higher than I ever thought I would be and the only way he could hurt me with a FITREP was to roll it in a cone and poke me in the eye with it. When I was relieved, with orders to postgraduate school, he called me into his in-port cabin, gave me a lousy FITREP, and rushed me off the ship. My officers and chiefs hardly had time to get to the quarterdeck to see my off. I left the ship feeling a bit down, but as I walked down the pier, I looked up at the forecastle of the ship and saw that the 1st Class Boatswain’s Mate had all of First Division in formation, rendered a salute and piped me down the pier. Now that was very cool. But above all else, going to sea and making steam is just cool. The trappings of a good commanding officer Most commanding officers (COs) were nothing more than politically astute bureaucrats, each hoping that their sea tour would not interfere with their hoped for shore tour that would lead them to a star (becoming an admiral). I will not address them further. But there were two that were the exception. Nuke (nuclear) officers are seen as technocrats with no imagination, tackling problems with their nose to the grindstone and an eye on the plant manuals. Kind of hard to have any long term vision in that position, no? Rickover’s mantra of “you get what you inspect, not what you expect” does not lead to very much leadership development in your subordinates. Although, perhaps it is warranted—the old Navy nuke saying “more people have died in a car driven by Ted Kennedy than in any U.S. Navy nuclear power accident” still applies. Both of the COs to whom I refer were surface nukes, auditioning, as it were, for command of a nuclear powered surface combatant. There were so few nuclear powered surface ships then, or ever for that matter, that conventional surface ships served to weed out those that were not up to a major command. CVN (nuclear carriers) COs had a different criteria, one reserved for Naval Aviators. Commander Tom Gilmartin was my second CO on Henry B. Wilson . He was a solid, quiet man who utilized his department heads to the fullest, did not pretend to know the weapons (WEPS) and operations (OPS) officers’ business better than they did, but was smart enough to ask the right questions and not be buffaloed. Except for the boilers, he may have known my business as well as I did. Well, almost, but not quite. I got off on the right foot with him from the very start, I think. Less than a week after he took command, we got underway for local operations. As soon as the word was passed, “underway, shift colors,” I got on the 21MC (an internal voice communication system) to the bridge and asked the Boatswain’s Mate of the watch to pass to the CO, “underway on fossil fuel.” It was a Rickover requirement, which became a tradition, that anytime a nuclear powered ship got underway, from the days of USS Nautilus , a radio message was sent to the Chief of Naval Reactors, “underway on nuclear power.” I believe he enjoyed it. Commander Fred Triggs was my second CO on USS David R. Ray. The man he relieved drove a BMW. CDR Triggs drove a Volkswagen Thing. Orange. No roof. Ever. Fred Triggs was the first and only man under whom I served for whom I would have willingly strapped on a steel helmet and “gone over the top” for. In the decades since, I have spent many hours thinking about what made him so special. Each attempt at analysis only results in a series of memories, a few of which I will share in the hopes that the sum of their parts will lead to an appreciation of the whole. If I were to describe him in two words, those two words would be unflappable and consistent. He was a tall, thin, balding man with a prominent hawk like nose. From years of ducking through water tight doors, he was slightly stoop shouldered, but that only tended to enhance his position as “Captain and Commander” when he loomed over you, asking probing questions. Captain Fredrick Triggs, USN As the Combat Information Center (CIC) officer, I wrote a lot of Naval messages, which had to be walked through the chain of command and “chopped” for release. I recall carrying a routine message through that gauntlet one evening after dinner to the Captain in his sea cabin, where I found him engaged in intense study of the Propulsion Plant Manual. He turned to me with an upright index finger in front of his mouth in the “keep quiet” gesture, winked, and said “don’t tell the Chief Engineer!” We were deployed with the Kitty Hawk Battle Group to the Western Pacific at the end of 1979 and ended up supporting the aborted rescue attempts of the Tehran embassy personnel. In those operations we were underway from the week before Thanksgiving until just about Valentine’s Day, with only a short respite at Diego Garcia to change out an engine. The Chagos Archipelago , which Diego Garcia is a part of, does not count as a liberty port. Unlike Adak, Alaska which is rumored to have a girl behind every tree (no trees on Adak), Diego Garcia has a coconut crab behind every lump of coral. Around Christmas time, when we had finally stood down from some pretty tense periods boring holes in the water just south of Iran, my Operations Specialists (OS) decided to make CIC a bit more reflective of the season and put up a lot a homemade decorations around the space. Captain Triggs came through the space enroute to the bridge, stopped, surveyed  the situation with storm clouds forming on his brow, then with the facial weather clearing, nodded slightly as if to say to himself that the decorations did not get in the way of the performance of duty and certainly helped morale, and went on his way. On New Year’s Day, he once again came through on his way up to the bridge and without slowing down, said in a conversational tone to no one in particular, “Christmas is over” and continued up the ladder. All decorations were gone within fifteen minutes with nary a gripe from any of my men. On the other hand, he saw a Playboy pin up underneath the glass on our chart table before I did and he made it clear to all concerned that it was not acceptable. It was removed even quicker than the decorations, with no muttering this time either. During the same time, my wife got together with the rest of the Officers’ Wives Club and put together small Christmas gifts for the entire wardroom. She sent the package to Captain Triggs and on Christmas Eve, he got the stateroom master keys from the Chief Steward and delivered all of the gifts personally. A small thing perhaps, but something that cemented the bond between a good skipper and his officers. Captain Triggs loved airplanes. If we were controlling any aircraft, either for anti-submarine operations or air intercept control of fighters, he was monitoring the circuit on a headset. In the late ‘70s, the Air Force was desperately looking for missions for their B-52s. Someone decided that they might be good for open ocean surveillance of surface craft and developed an exercise called Sea Crow, where a mission of three B-52s from Hawaii would search for naval vessels transiting from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. We were nominated to be the target of one such exercise and after they finally found us—I don’t think the Air Force realized just how big the Pacific Ocean is and how small a destroyer is, in relation to it—the mission commander requested permission to make a “low pass” before heading back to Hickam AFB on Oahu. Everybody on the bridge knew how Captain Triggs would respond to that! The first visual we got of the bombers was a black smudge on the horizon from about 295° to 055° relative.  The smudge got bigger and wider until we saw three of those behemoths, almost wingtip to wingtip, flying straight at us, seemingly 50 feet off the surface of the water. As they flew overhead, the roar of their engines was overwhelming and I happened to glance at the Captain just as they left us astern. I have never seen a happier man. B-52 crews have a penchant for making low flybys on US Navy ships. , USN I had the deck on the midwatch in the South China Sea. We were in a very loose formation, the Kitty Haw k had been flying night quals (qualifications) earlier, but things had settled down. The aft lookout reported a strobe light in our wake, which was most likely from a life ring, indicating a possible man over board.  We quickly initiated all of the actions drilled into us since we first started thinking about driving ships—man overboard announced on the 1MC, alert all ships in company, hard right rudder to immediately take the reciprocal course, then another hard right after passing the point where the light was first sighted as input into the navigation computer, then returning on the original course to hopefully locate the ring or man overboard. I was mentally patting myself on the back as I stopped the ship upwind and within 5 feet of the ring, allowing the Chief Boatswain’s Mate to retrieve the ring—a quick muster revealed that all hands were accounted for—when I heard a voice, seemingly from the overhead. Remember I said Captain Triggs was tall and I top out at five foot six. “Would someone please tell the Commanding Officer just what the hell is going on here?” It seems the Boatswain’s Mate of the watch had neglected to switch on the circuit of the 1MC that sounded in the Captain’s sea cabin and I had been too busy to call the Captain on his phone, or to tell the Junior Officer On Duty (JOOD) to do so. I think the fact that we did not lose anyone, we had followed (almost) all of the correct procedures and, if I do say so myself, it was a handsome bit of ship handling, saved me from too much of an ass chewing. The Junior Officer Of The Deck (JOOD) told me that the skipper had been there for quite some time and had seen the whole recovery—the exclamation was simply for effect. We had been detached from the Kitty Hawk Battle Group and were proceeding independently to Subic Bay, then Pearl Harbor, then home. We were steaming along the northwest coast of Palawan Island, a long narrow island between Borneo and the Philippines, an area with a significant amount of local traffic. I had the midwatch as Officer Of The Deck. The Captain was in his chair on the starboard side of the bridge. We had been ducking around fishing boats and tramp steamers for quite a while but we had few options. To starboard was Palawan and to port was a chain of small islands and shallows. For about an hour we had been tracking a medium sized target that appeared to be on a reciprocal course. Because its Closest Point of Approach (CPA) was tracking to be much closer than any of us were comfortable with, we had been trying to contact them on the commercial UHF bridge to bridge radio, but had received no response. As they were almost abreast of us, they made a sharp turn to port, right in front of us. I immediately ordered hard left rudder and we narrowly avoided a stern to stern collision. After we were clear, the freighter finally contacted us on bridge to bridge radio with a barely understandable message that basically boiled down to “oops, so sorry.” Captain Triggs picked up the mic, and in a stern voice, quoted chapter and verse from applicable maritime law and regulation, pointing out the error of their ways, finishing up with “you have embarrassed me mightily!” and hung up the mic. No screaming, no curse words. A true professional. Perhaps the distillation of the type of leader Fred Triggs was can be displayed from the last time I saw him. We transited home from the Philippines independently. No other ships in sight for most of the transit. Same course and speed for days. We used to beg the Senior Watch Officer for a chance to take the watch when we made a course change. It was tough keeping the lookouts and other enlisted watchstanders on the bridge awake during the night time watches. To keep their attention I tried to engage them in non-naval conversations. We eventually got around to movies, then musicals. One of the trivia questions we were unable to answer was the name of the woman who co-starred with Yul Brynner in The King and I. When we returned home, I received orders to be an instructor at Surface Warfare Officer’s School. At my hail and farewell, after my department head said nice things and I had received my ship’s plaque from Captain Triggs, he shook my hand, drew me in close and whispered in my ear “Deborah Kerr.” He understood what I had done and why. He monitored to ensure it did not interfere with the safe navigation of the ship and left me to execute my duties and responsibilities effectively, if in an unorthodox manner. USS DAVID R. RAY (DD-971), USN Five things the Navy can do today to make it a more effective fighting force 1.) Do what they did in 1942—fire the politicians and promote the warriors. Reduce the number of admirals. Find a way to re-emphasize that the duty of a Naval Officer was keeping the best trained, best equipped, best maintained vessels at sea. And it wouldn’t hurt if the non-uniformed politicians had a more consistent, achievable and responsible definition of the Navy’s mission. I urge them to refer back to A.T. Mahan —keep the sea lanes open and protect American shipping. Nation building and the spreading of democracy to disjointed peoples who have no concept above the organizational level of the clan is not the job of the US Navy. Nor is it a testbed for the tree huggers. Budgets are tight enough without spending inordinate amounts of money on bio fuels and considering the environmental impacts of every exercise. The Navy exists to protect this nation, not save the world, which any rational individual would agree, does not need saving. I refer you to Bjorn Lundberg’s “Skeptical Environmentalist ” for affirmation. 2.) Get the experienced technicians back in front of the classroom. The Naval training establishment has been hypnotized by the flashing lights and glitter of computer based training. Yes, I know that personnel costs are the biggest driver in any operation, especially training, but you cannot create a maintainer/operator by sitting him down in front of a computer and letting him mash keys, no matter how animated and interactive the training module is. Tell that sailor that he could go on liberty after he finished three modules and you will see Einstein invalidated. I went to EM “A”  School in 1970 and I still remember many of the things that the crusty old EM1 standing in front of the classroom, with jokes penciled in on his lesson plan, taught us. Not only did we learn about our rate, but we learned a lot more about what it meant to be in the US Navy. After I retired, I had a job managing three contracts with NAVSEALOGCEN to install, update and logistically support all of the Navy’s Technical Training Equipment. TTE is classified as actual systems or subsystems installed in a training facility to allow hands on training opportunities. Very little TTE exists anymore. I do have to note that this may be changing. A few years ago a retired Admiral was asked to analyze root causes of the poor state of maintenance in ships and he zeroed in on computer based training as a prime factor. Changing this would upset a plethora of rice bowls, so I am not sure if anything has happened subsequent to his report. 3.) Re-establish Surface Warfare Officer’s School (SWOS). This was eliminated in the SWO pipeline as a cost saving measure. At the risk of sounding parochial, I went on board many newly commissioned vessels in the course of my responsibilities representing NAVSEA Philly for new acquisition logistics. With no exceptions, I found the Ensigns and Lieutenants Junior Grade Officers woefully uninformed about their jobs and responsibilities. They did not know what or how to fill the role of Division Officer, which was the mission of SWOS. USN 4.) I barely survived the Zumwalt years. The campaign to restore pride and professionalism saved the US Navy. Seemingly simple things like re-establishing grooming standards and restoring some of the myth and lore of the mariner rippled positively throughout the entire fleet. Putting dungarees back on the sailors and calling it the mess decks instead of the Enlisted Dining Facility may seem trivial, but things like that are part of what makes a hard profession worthwhile. Over the past few years, I have seen a similar erosion of professionalism, seemingly starting at the top of the force. I was in Bath, Maine for a logistics review on the USS Zumwalt DDG-1000 construction. At lunch in a local chain restaurant, I saw a young man walk in wearing a combination of blue, khaki and white, with a 3rd class crow on his arm. I was certain he was one of those people who tried to steal some glory, but a quick internet search showed it was a real uniform. And I am aware that the brass in the Pentagon is jealous of the generals and colonels running around in the desert cammies and had to have something similar so they could look like warriors, too. But, if you were to fall over board, would you really want to blend in to the surroundings? Carrying this argument forward, on the theme of restoring the Navy to a military organization, not “Google with uniforms”—that loud klaxon you hear in the background is the politically correct alarm going off. Here are some thoughts: ships at sea can be thought of as emotional thermos bottles. There is no home, or bar, or club to go to after work to release those emotions. The average age of a sailor is still around 19 or 20 years old, I think. They epitomize emotional creatures. I will not get into any discussions about the physical disparities between men and women in combat, the Marines seem to have that one covered. But anyone who denies that young men and women, or young women and old men, sealed up in that emotional thermos bottle will become emotionally or physically entangled has no understanding of human nature. Chiefs  and officers will treat young women differently, young women will use their looks and sex to influence their superiors. Sailors will fall into and out of love. Other sailors will be jealous because they can’t. Life underway is tough enough without adding those kind of volatile situations. The purpose of the United States Navy is to protect our shores and our interests on foreign shores, not to provide a vehicle for advancement and self fulfillment to any one person—male, female, transsexual, transgender, or homosexual. The inclusion of any of the latter four on a warship degrades readiness and the ability to achieve the mission. 5.) Decrease the civilian shore establishment. Re-designate those functions to sailors. It will give them some reduced stress shore duty where they can spend time with family and decompress. Yes, I know about personnel costs, but I think this would really help retention and improve accountability and productivity. Incorporating untested technologies into the supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford Evolution is far more affordable (and less risky) than revolution. The object of any aircraft launch and recovery innovation is reduced cycle times. That was the driving force behind both the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). USS GERALD R. FORD (CVN-78) during sea trials. , USN An additional factor arguing in favor of EMALS is that high pressure steam is no longer involved. That removes the significant weight of the catapult steam receivers, usually located above metacentric height, thus increasing stability. By not using steam pressure as the motive force, you reduce the need to generate steam, thus improving total plant economy. Quite frequently, condensate from steam catapults was contaminated and thus the cat drains had to be cut out from the condensate system. Not using steam reduces losses, thus increasing efficiency. Sometimes bright ideas are so fascinating that they assume a life of their own. They attract adherents that become disciples rather than advocates. The major acquisition cycle is so long that by the time that signs are starting to appear that cost and schedule goals are in jeopardy, it is too late. The earlier proponents of the system have already been awarded their Legions of Merit and have moved on to bigger and better things. Current managers are faced with a dilemma: redesign, with all of the associated cost and delays, or push ahead in an attempt to overcome all obstacles. The “can do” spirit has knocked down many barriers in the past. Perhaps by the time the next carrier in line is ready for installation, the bugs will be worked out. How many very expensive aircraft end up in the water before that happens is hard to predict. But, I do not think it is appropriate to assign a right or wrong to the decision to go forward. There may have been early signs that the projects were in trouble and no one noticed or they were hidden, but I cannot say one way or another. The Navy has run with many unproven systems before and has overcome some mighty big growing pains. The story of the first ship with superheated steam boilers is informative in that regard. My biggest issue with EMALS was concerning future sustainability. Some of the components were naturally the responsibility of NAWC Lakehurst, the aircraft launch and recovery equipment In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA). Others components, because of their similarity to those developed for the propulsion system on Zumwalt by NAVSEA Philadelphia, were under the technical authority of the engineers in Philly. It was obvious to me, and my NAVSEA Philadelphia sponsor (Acquisition ILS Program Manager) that someone needed to be responsible for the entire system. Repeated requests to both the NAVAIR and NAVSEA senior management for official designation of such a responsible entity were treated with a response that indicated a major lack of concern. It has been my experience that if a system does not have a single responsible entity charged with life cycle sustainment, it falls victim to neglect or competing agendas. The Navy’s DDG-1000 Zumwalt class stealth destroyer The fever dream to design and build the most technologically advanced surface combatant has entranced Navy planners for decades. The DDG-1000 program , originally called the 21st Century Cruiser back in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, is the embodiment of that dream. The program had two goals, reduced observability—acoustic, electromagnetic and visual—and reduced manning—which evolved to Optimal Manning and now they don’t talk about it much as that goal became more elusive.These goals were to be accomplished using the most gee-whiz electronics and computers they could get their hands on. Technological advancements in the mid ‘90s gave a boost to planners’ imagination. The development  of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Convertor (IGBT) opened up a whole world of possibilities. It was already determined that the new ship would not have a standard propulsion system. A great vulnerability of conventional shipboard power transmission systems was the shafting connecting propulsion systems to the propeller. Battle damage to the shaft, which generally runs at least half the length of the hull, reduces maneuverability by half, with no bypasses or workarounds available. Using electric propulsion motors located far aft, this vulnerability is greatly reduced as the severing of one power line can be overcome by re-routing power, either through temporary or installed, fixed cabling. USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), USN The speed of an alternating current motor is determined by the number of electromagnetic pole pairs fabricated in the design and the frequency of the electrical current applied. Since the number of pole pairs is fixed and there has been no way to alter the frequency of high voltage electricity, an alternating current propulsion motor was not possible. Direct current motors were feasible—they had been used for decades in battery powered motor generator sets and propulsion motors on diesel submarines—but they were a maintenance nightmare, particularly because electrical energy had to be applied to the rotor by carbon “brushes” riding on a rotating ring. The carbon dust arising from that contact and the frequent requirement to replace brushes and to ensure the slip rings maintained a smooth and regular surface created a significant cost in time and manpower. Enter the IGBT. It had been possible to alternate the frequency of very low output voltage transistors for decades. The IGBT could handle megawatts at tremendously high voltage. Now it was possible to design and build a AC propulsion motor. Actualizing that potential took years and millions of dollars. The engineering spaces of the DDG-1000, instead of pipes and valves and pumps, now has rows and rows of electronics enclosures. There is so much potential danger from high voltage arcing that personnel are not allowed in the space during times of restricted maneuvering without special arc suits and face shields. But that was not the only radical innovation the planners envisioned. Most new classes of ships employ one or two innovations in their design. The DDG-1000 program has nineteen or twenty, depending how you count. There might have been more but early development and design issues eliminated some . For example, at one time the idea was to include a maintenance planning and scheduling system. A system would have a problem and diagnostics—either automatic or human—would determine the cause. The work item would be entered into a computer console and immediately the computer would order the part, schedule the work at the appropriate maintenance level and info the tactical computer of the operational limitations the fault imposed. Needless to say, Navy infrastructure was not ready for that. Of course, with a new ship, you had to have a new gun. To get the support of the Marine Corps, it had to be big. To achieve the goal of low observability, you had to hide it. And to justify all of that cost, it had to be able to launch a projectile halfway around the world that would find its own target and broadcast “have a nice day” to its intended victim before plunging into its superstructure. To meet their goals and to satisfy their lust for innovation, they violated many written and unwritten nautical rules. “We don’t need windows on the bridge! Let’s install flat panel monitors everywhere and feed images to them from cameras mounted all over the weather decks!” That would be cool, besides power fluctuations never harm solid state devices and electronics never suffer from exposure to salt spray and camera lenses never fog, which is good because we have mounted them where no one can reach them to clean them. And that old saw about visually checking that you are clear from shipping by stepping out on the bridge wings before ordering a turn is so passé, we don’t need bridge wings and besides, we got those cameras! USS ZUMWALT’s highly unorthodox bridge layout., USN To meet their manning goals it was absolutely necessary that every crew member was qualified to stand the watch associated with his billet. That meant they had to be qualified before they came on board . This was to be accomplished by a crew support facility in the home port where, through Computer Based Training, each prospective crew member was to be certified for their designated watchstation. Notwithstanding the obvious cost of this plan, and the doubtful success of qualifying a watchstander without actually standing a watch, I can think of nothing more de-motivating than to realize that you were going to stand the same watch, with the same duties, for the entire time you were on the ship. You could not move up or laterally because there was no one there to take your place. I mentioned the floating manpower definition. Every time a manpower analysis was done, either because the maintenance requirements became better known as the design matured or because somebody pointed out something had been forgotten, the manning levels had to increase. Soon they realized they would have to institute a “hot bunking” protocol or expand the berthing compartments. There were not enough non-rated sailors to accomplish routine tasks like sweep down and mess cooking. As you could probably surmise, the plan to have no watchstanders in the engineering spaces during normal underway ops had me climbing the walls. As an aside, the Spruance class was one of the first attempts at reducing crew size. The ships were filthy and always showed running rust because there were not enough non-rates assigned to perform basic duties. The DDG-1000’s rapid cost escalation should surprise no one. When program costs are initially estimated, the costs of research and development, production facility establishment and the purchase of bulk and long lead time materials is spread out over the original number of hulls. When that number is reduced from 15 to just three, of course the price per hull is going to skyrocket. The same can be said for the ship’s Advanced Gun System’s LRAP rounds .  When you amortize your production line start up costs over 30 magazines, plus 15 ships worth of stores ashore and then your production requirements are drastically reduced, of course the cost per round is going to go through the roof. You may think from reading the above that I think the entire program was a waste of time and money. If the Navy does not learn some valuable lessons from the program perhaps it will be. But if some good comes out of the technologies as they mature or if we stop trying to make such giant leaps forward, then at least something positive will have been achieved. Forgive my skepticism when I say that I have my doubts. There was nothing I liked about the program from the shape of the hull to the name of the first ship. Although that choice was somewhat prophetic, in my mind. CNO, Elmo Zumwalt pushed many innovations, most of which had a negative impact on my Navy. Sailor conducts routine maintenance aboard USS ZUMWALT., USN As an epilogue, the fascination with technology has infected more than just the DDG-1000 community. There are a multitude of synchronous AC motors in the fleet happily driving centrifugal pumps. This type of pump will never pump against a shut off head, meaning it will never over pressurize. They sit there happily spinning at constant speed, providing the desired pressure. But now, we are installing IGBT based drive units on all these motors at great cost, both in terms of their installation and their life cycle costs. Not because we need to but just because we can. Littoral Combat Ship and the Navy’s need for an actual frigate The LCS is not a frigate. In fact, I am not sure what it is. It seems to me to be a ship looking for a mission. Or perhaps only a means to keep mid size shipyards at opposite ends of the nation in business. The fact that the Navy can’t decide whether they want a one hulled or multi-hulled ship design confirms the latter, as well as recent statements from the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) to Congress regarding the minimum number of future hulls needed to keep the doors open at Marinette and Austal—the two shipyards that build Littoral Combat Ships. I was just a high pressure steam engineer, but I read a lot of history, and I do not recall very many times when we needed a special ship just to fight in a littoral somewhere. If we have to defend our own littoral, we have already lost that battle and likely the war. If we need to conduct combat operations in other littorals, then I would suggest that standoff weapons like the Tomahawk or a carrier alpha strike would be more appropriate, at least until the floating enemy is eliminated, and then we can send in the Marines. USS CORONADO (LCS-4)., USN Years ago, I was at a Fisher Maritime conference where I had a chance to hear the Dutch equivalent of the CNO speak. In part of his address, he spoke of the LCS, which was still in the planning stages at the time. While he allowed that the idea of having a ship made super versatile by multiple mission modules was attractive from the tactical standpoint, it would take a very big nation, with a very big budget, to afford to have all but one of those modules, and the trained people to operate and maintain them, sitting on the beach while one was deployed on its specific mission. By the time I retired for the final time, I do not think any of those modules, of any kind, had been successfully deployed. What is a frigate?  What is its role?  To me, the frigate is intended to be an escort for a Carrier Battle Group, or Amphibious Ready Group, or a replenishment ship. They can rarely operate alone. Even with a good anti-air warfare radar and missile system they need cooperative air cover from a cruiser or another frigate. With a better sonar than the “Helen Keller” the Perry class had, they could do anti-submarine warfare, but then again not alone. They are half a destroyer. Commissioning of USS DETROIT (LCS-7)., USN We have a very successful class of destroyers now, with more being built and constant upgrades ongoing on existing hulls. The bones and engines are mature and sound and most improvements are made in the electronics and software realm. One obvious exception being the Auxiliary Propulsion Motor (APS), which has probably completed its trials by now. It seems to me that the programmatic costs of developing a new class of ship are far greater than continuing with the Burke class, a ship that can do all of the things a frigate is supposed to do, as well as use less than half of its installed propulsion plant for economic steaming, or the APS, if it works out. Building smaller aircraft carriers The biggest advantage of a carrier battle group is that it can do just about anything you need it to.  You want anti-submarine warfare (ASW)? They got the aircraft for that. You want to bomb a shore installation to dust and gravel? They can whistle up an alpha strike. You want to make some rookie pilot from a third world country flying a 20 year old 2nd generation former Soviet fighter wish he had never seen a flight suit? Our pleasure, thank you very much for the opportunity! Some tin pot dictator is rattling his sword? Just the news that a carrier battle ground is leaving port early and heading in that direction is usually enough to quiet things down. Perhaps their greatest value is their potential to do all those things and more. No one else has them. No one else can conduct continuous flight ops the way we can, and it is going to be a long time before the Chinese can. Big deck carrier aviation and underway replenishment are the two things that set us apart from any Navy, anywhere. However, they are expensive to build and operate and take forever to hit the fleet. I can see a class of ships, built along the lines of LHD-8 —absent the well deck and other assorted landing force systems—powered by a diesel and gas turbine combination . A combination of F-35s, Ospreys and helicopters could be a good tactical mix for specific missions. You would be restricted to VTOL or STOVL aircraft, because it takes a long flight deck to launch and recover the others. Air wings could be tailored to the mission and any major ops may require multiple decks of that size to ensure that large and frequent enough sorties can be maintained. As I review the above, I am flashing back to the “Jeep” carriers of the Second World War. I guess if we went that way, we would have no trouble thinking up names. Editors note: This ship and concept already exists under the USMC’s “Lightning Carrier” concept. The USS Fitzgerald mishap One should wait to draw any conclusions until all of the computer data, logs and voice recordings are analyzed. If the Navy is not forthcoming with that data, then we may begin to suspect that there is something rotten in the Tokyo Wan. I do have two concerns, based upon what has been reported rather than speculated. The only place in the world with which I am familiar that has more traffic than the area in question are the Straits of Malacca, between Singapore and Sumatra. The difference being that most of the traffic in the Straits of Malacca is, with the exception of small coastal and fishing vessels, going either into or out of the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, traffic leaving or entering the area leading to Yokohama and Tokyo is moving on courses virtually around the compass. Damage from the collision could be seen more easily once the ship entered drydock., USN So, my questions are these: Why, with all this traffic, in the middle of the night, was the skipper in the rack? And an even bigger question, what the hell were they doing there in the first place at that time of night? A more forehanded—the greatest virtue of a Naval officer—skipper, regardless of when he was scheduled pier side at Yokosuka, would have cleared the area for safe nighttime steaming, had the navigator plan a course to head for port after sunrise and then hit the rack so as to be rested for the transit through traffic. And that’s all I have to say about Fitzgerald until we see the tapes. A huge thanks to LCDR(R) David Taylor for taking so much time to share his thoughts and experiences with us. I think it is safe to say we all have a better appreciation of all the hard work that goes on deep below the decks of US Navy ships after reading this two part series.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 10, 2020",Unusual High-Altitude Spy Plane Appears at Special Operations Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military, including the U.S. Coast Guard, has a long history of operating high-flying surveillance aircraft based on or otherwise derived from powered gliders. Recent pictures show U.S. special operators are at least training with one particularly rare type, the Grob G 520. On July 12, 2017, Indiana’s North Vernon Municipal Airport posted a series of pictures on its official Facebook page of U.S. Air Force and Army special operations aircraft on their way to an exercise. The photographs showed what appeared to be C-130H Hercules and an MH-47G Chinook , as well as what looked like stock photos of a CV-22B Osprey , an AH-6M Little Bird, and multiple MH-60M Black Hawks. There was also a picture of an odd looking white-and-gray aircraft and someone had blacked out its only apparent marking. We have been unable to confirm the exact model or owner conclusively. However, this plane is most likely the Grob G 520 EGRETT II, which Bear Defense currently owns. The defense contractor, based in Tampa, Florida , home of U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), refers to the plane as the “NYX ISR” on their website. At the time of writing, the company had not responded to a request to confirm they had participated in any recent U.S. military exercise in Indiana or provide additional information about their aircraft, which carries the registration N520DM and has subdued shark mouth art on the nose. SOCOM had similarly not returned a request for more information on the drill, which was called Total Force Exercise (TFX) 17-3. From the image on their website, Bear Defense’s NYX ISR has a large sensor turret, which almost certainly contains a full-motion video and a forward-looking infrared system. For some reason, this appears to be missing on the aircraft at North Vernon Municipal Airport. It could be that the crew planned to install it once they arrived or had otherwise removed it for servicing. It is also possible that the U.S. military opted for another particular sensor package for the exercise that would be fitted once the aircraft arrived or that is mounted internally, such as a radar system. The aircraft spotted at North Vernon Municipal Airport in July 2017., North Vernon Municipal Airport Bear Defense aircraft appears to have a satellite communications antenna on the dorsal spine, which would allow for sharing video footage or other data in near real time with troops on the ground. In 2015, Bear Defense reportedly installed the SCOTTY Communication Platform-Air on the aircraft, allowing for fast, encrypted streaming of the video feed to internet-enabled terminals .  The rear portion of the aircraft’s ventral gondola would be perfect for a side-looking airborne radar with synthetic aperture and/or ground moving target indicator modes, or some combination of those capabilities. The history of the slim-winged aircraft is somewhat nebulous itself. The design reportedly originated from a late Cold War joint U.S.-German requirement for a relatively low-cost, high-altitude surveillance plane. In response, in the 1980s, Germany’s Grob Aircraft , which still builds powered and unpowered gliders, as well as other aircraft, teamed up with E-Systems and Garrett AiResearch, both in the United States. The name EGRETT comes from a combination of the three companies’ names. Bear Defense’s NYX ISR aircraft, a Grob G 520 EGRETT II., Bear Defense According to the publicly available accounts , the official purpose of the program, which the U.S. Air Force reportedly nicknamed Senior Guardian, was to provide a cheaper alternative to the U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane for both treaty verification and environmental monitoring purposes. In the 1980s, the United States and the Soviet Union were negotiating the terms of what would become the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE). INF entered force in 1988, while CFE did not go into effect until 1990. Both required robust verification methods. However, “although the mission of the Senior Guardian project is publicly portrayed as focused environmental monitoring and treaty verification, a similar cover story was used during the early years of the U-2 program,” defense information website GlobalSecurity.org ’s entry on the aircraft notes. Early on in the Dragon Lady’s development, the Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency claimed the aircraft was focused on “weather reconnaissance,” referring to the aircraft WU-2s to try and hide their true function. https://youtube.com/watch?v=22d7Jd8b-iM The involvement of E-Systems could only have fueled conspiracy theories and the belief that the EGRETT’s official job description was a cover for something else. The Greenville, Texas-based electronics company had previously worked on a number of secretive Air Force programs in the 1960s and 1970s, including the NC/AC-123K Black Spot “gunship.” In addition, the word “ Senior ” is reserved for Headquarters, Air Force projects and is widely associated with spy planes and associated equipment, such as the “ Senior Year ” U-2 and the “ Senior Crown ” SR-71 Blackbird. Grob and the rest of the team ultimately built total of five aircraft in various versions, starting with the prototype D 450 EGRETT, followed two more D 500 EGRETT II aircraft. The contractors then modified the D 500s into the final G 520 configuration before building a third of these pre-production planes. Finally, Grob produced a two-seat G 520T trainer version. Whatever, the original impetus, the aircraft with its composite airframe did boast impressive performance characteristics. It was able to carry more than 2,000 pounds of sensors and equipment in any of 12 separate, modular bays, five of which lined the bottom of the fuselage. There was enough room there for turreted day- and night-vision cameras, as well as synthetic aperture radars and other gear, similar to what we see on the aircraft at North Vernon Municipal Airport and on Bear Defense’s stock picture of their NYX ISR. A schematic of the payload bays on the latest G 520NG, similar to those in the original G 520., Grob Aircraft The G 520 could fly this equipment to an altitude of 50,000 feet. This can’t match the service ceiling of the Dragon Lady, but begins to approach that of the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone . The aircraft has a very narrow cord wing with a span of just more than 108 feet – close in overall length to that of a 737 airliner – another feature it shares with the Global Hawk. Depending on the exact load out and flight profile, the plane reportedly could have a range of more than 1,500 miles or loiter over a particular area for up to eight hours. While it has single turboprop engine and a slender fuselage, it is not clear if the G 520’s design included any features to make it particularly physically stealthy or acoustically quiet, unlike the Vietnam-era Lockheed YO-3A Quiet Star or the late Cold War Schweizer RG-8A Condor . On its website, Grob does say that its latest version, which it calls the G 520NG, has a “reduced footprint, very low probability of intercept.” The composite structure would help reduce the aircraft’s radar cross section and all of the known versions of the aircraft have large exhaust mufflers that could reduce both infrared and acoustic signatures. Though the INF and CFE treaties remain in force, the end of the Cold War seems to have killed the official requirement for the Senior Guardian aircraft. Neither the United States nor the Germans officially adopted the aircraft in any capacity. Germany formally cancelled its portion, known as the Luftgestutztes Abstandsfahiges Primar Aufklarungssystem (LAPAS), translating to airborne, long distance primary reconnaissance system, in 1993. At that time, the German government’s expected nine aircraft order had an estimated price tag of $800 million. The Grob G 520 EGRETT II N520DM while still flying with Raytheon in 2010., Mark Harkin via Wikimedia The Air Force may have briefly reconsidered the concept in the 1990s. David Kier, the deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office from May 1997 to August 2001, described a “minimalist design” he referred to as the “TR-3,” which “he derisively called ‘a Cessna 172 compared to a 747,’” according to official historical monograph Air Force UAVs: The Secret History . The nomenclature TR-3 is itself the subject of wide speculation. “A likely candidate for a program fitting Kier’s description was a moderately stealthy (all-composite) high altitude German airframe called Egrett that was built in cooperation with a major American electronics firm,” the history’s author Dr. Thomas Ehrhard wrote in a separate footnote. Interestingly, Ehrhard says the aircraft was “optionally piloted,” a detail not found in other accounts . In the end, the existing prototypes filtered out onto the open market through the original partners. In 1995, Raytheon bought E-Systems, ultimately renaming it as their Intelligence, Information and Services division. The company’s flight test outfit continued flying at least one EGRETT II for some time afterward, providing support to NASA’s Airborne Science Program . According to the Federal Aviation Administration , this aircraft, N520DM, apparently passed to Bear Defense circa 2012. The D 450 EGRETT aircraft is also still in the U.S. civil registry, listed as N520EG , and property of a company called Gentran Corporation. This Omaha, Nebraska-based “ trucking company ” has one employee, according to publicly available records. Spotters caught this all-white aircraft in California in 2012 and it does not appear to match the one flying in Indiana earlier in July 2017. The two-seat Grob G 520T., Grob Aircraft Grob continues to offer the updated single and two-seat G 520NG variants , though these aircraft do not appear to be in active production. The company brought the demonstrator to the 2014 Farnborough Airshow in the United Kingdom, claiming it could start series production of the type by 2016. The G 520T appeared at the 2015 iteration of the event, but there is still no word about potential sales. We do not know if the U.S. military is actively considering adopting the plane again. During TFX 17-3, it could have simply provided a cheap surrogate for a high-altitude system such as the U-2, RQ-4, or even a much more rare aircraft such as the RQ-170 Sentinel , as well as more common aircraft such as the unmanned MQ-9 Reaper or MQ-1C Gray Eagle . Grob claims its G 520NG has the “lowest operational cost in class.” Regardless, the G 520 series would be able to offer roughly comparable capabilities for training purposes, but be significantly simpler and cheaper to operate and maintain than either the Dragon Lady or Global Hawk. On top of that, those aircraft are already in high demand for actual missions around the world. In addition, the modular nature of the Grob 520 would make it particularly well suited for cost effective, rapid testing of new sensors or equipment. At the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference in Tampa, Florida in May 2017, U.S. Air Force Colonel Eric Forsyth, head of SOCOM’s Program Executive Office-Fixed Wing, said his organization was actively working on color night vision video cameras, as well as looking into the possibility of color three-dimensional imaging technology, improved radars, and other systems. No matter the reason why, its still impressive to see this essentially experimental plane still in active use after all these years. You can be sure we’ll be keeping a look out for more information on this particular exercise and we’ll be sure to follow-up if the Grob G 520 makes any more notable appearances.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 16, 2019",Unmasking The S-92 Mystery Helicopter In Syria Which Was Spotted Again Near Raqqa,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new video has surfaced that shows the same unmarked, gray S-92 Helibus that we identified last March in northern Syria, but this time it was seen supposedly flying over or very near the Islamic State’s defacto capital of al Raqqa. Similar helicopters were originally spotted in Djibouti in 2015, adding to the mystery of who owns and operates them, especially considering the type is not officially in the Pentagon’s active inventory. The video, which was posted on social media, cuts to V-22 Ospreys, which are also known to be highly active in the region . The Ospreys ferry US special operations forces, US Marines, and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters, which are primarily made up of Kurds, around eastern Syria to battle zones and forward operating bases . With the offensive to rout ISIS from al Raqqa finally underway, it only makes sense that the Ospreys are now flying along the outskirts of the the besieged city. As to the exact mission of the shadowy S-92, we still don’t know. After our last posting pinpointing the aircraft in Northern Syria, near the Syrian-Turkish border, numerous reports came in with photographic evidence showing the same aircraft, or another with the identical configuration and paint job, flying around the southeast United States. In particular, the aircraft was spotted at Lafayette Regional Airport in Louisiana in early March, and a couple weeks later at Raleigh-Durham International, North Carolina. In both sightings, there were no discernible markings on the aircraft, but it turns out that an identical S-92 was photographed around the same time with a registration temporarily applied . That registration number is N992SK . This same number was worn by a blue and white S-92 that operated out of Malta from around 2012, while the US was still embroiled in the Libyan conflict, before it was spotted without the tail number in Erbil, Iraq in 2015. Since then the helicopter appears to have been repainted in the gray tactical scheme we recognize today. Before and after the paint job, the aircraft’s registration was and still is assigned to Leasing Source LLC, which once had its address in Helena, Montana, but is now listed in New Iberia, Louisiana. The company shares its address and an office building with a hangar and helipad attached with Helicopter Management LLC. The building is set near Acadiana Regional Airport in Louisiana, and right by a large Halliburton campus and the home of Bristow Helicopters US—a major S-92 operator. Both of these companies—Helicopter Management LLC and Leasing Source LLC—and roughly a dozen others are owned by PHI Inc. we discovered through a SEC filing from 2010. PHI Inc., which is a well established helicopter services provider, describes itself on its website as “the total helicopter company,” and details its history and current operations as follows: “PHI, Inc. is one of the world’s leading helicopter services companies. Known industry wide for the relentless pursuit of safe, reliable helicopter transportation, PHI offers services to the offshore Oil and Gas, onshore mining, International, Air Medical, and Technical Services industries. The Company’s core business consists of offshore operations in the energy basins around the world. The highly skilled staff of pilots and maintenance technicians gives the company great depth in all areas of operation. The PHI team is composed of highly skilled, dedicated, hardworking and loyal employees. PHI has a long history of operating in the Global Marketplace. In addition to operations in the United States, the company has operated in 43 foreign countries and continues to operate for customers across the globe. PHI helicopters fly 250 miles into the Gulf of Mexico and to locations 200 miles offshore in international waters. PHI’s Headquarters are in Lafayette, Louisiana USA. PHI provides service to the Healthcare industry through its Air Medical Group. Since its inception in 1981, PHI Air Medical Group has grown from one medically equipped helicopter to over 60 helicopters with state of the art medical interiors designed. The current customer list spans the United States and includes many premier health care organizations. The company is considered to be an industry leader in maintenance, technology, and overall operations. The overhaul and maintenance facility based in Lafayette, Louisiana is considered by many to be the premier facility in the world because of its technology and experienced staff. PHI employees conduct routine maintenance and repair work; completely overhaul engines and airframes; operate a state-of-the-art painting facility; study and engineer new parts and lubricants; research new procedures and develop new techniques. As the offshore oil and gas industry moves further out into the Gulf of Mexico, the air medical industry gets more advanced and as international arenas open, PHI plans to be able to meet the needs of customers in any location. PHI provides customers with the safest, most reliable helicopter transportation in the world. As the industry progresses into the 21st century, PHI is primed for any challenge.” Considering one of its handful of S-92 helicopters is flying in a chaotic and excessively dangerous war zone, the “primed for any challenge” mantra seems to be quite accurate. Also note that the company’s major maintenance facility is at the same airport where the gray S-92 was recently spotted. Apparently employees at the airport were told not to photograph it when it arrived according to one spotter. A PHI helicopters S-92 with the exact same configuration as seen on the gray example., PHI Inc public website But just because we know who owns the helicopter, or helicopters, we still don’t know exactly who is using them, or even flying them. It could very well be that PHI Inc. leases these helicopters to an agency or to the military, and those governmental institutions fly and operate them. On the other hand, PHI Inc. could be providing “end-to-end” services with the lease, which would include maintenance and crews, including pilots. Considering the massive helicopter capacity of the US military, contracting out a single or handful of S-92s sounds odd. But for an intelligence agency or the State Department, or even for another country’s military that has far less helicopter capacity than the US military does, outsourcing such a capability set may make more sense than not. Maybe the US government contracted the helicopter on behalf of the SDF, which have zero airlift capabilities of their own—not even for their most elite commanders. Even through the mysterious S-92 may seem a little less mysterious now, it still hasn’t given up all its secrets. But considering that the battle for Raqqa has just begun, and what comes after could be more perilous than what came before, it won’t likely be the last we will see of the shadowy chopper.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 5, 2020",People Are Freaking Out Over Video Of Su-35 Practicing For Moscow Air Show,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s biannual marquee air show and weapons expo (referred to a MAKS) is about to kick off outside of Moscow and it never disappoints when it comes to aerial acts. In recent years, the star of the show has been the Su-35, Russia top-of-the-line Flanker derivative that features a digital fly-by-wire flight control system, three dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles and uprated AL-41F1S engines pumping out roughly 32,000 pounds of thrust each. All this adds up to an aircraft capable of astonishing aerial feats, regardless of their relevancy in most modern air combat scenarios. In 2015, the Su-35S did some awesome maneuvers at MAKS as well. I posted on the jet’s unique flying abilities at the time and the gif I made went viral. People were just amazed a fighter aircraft could accomplish such maneuvers, and especially an operational one as big as the Su-35, which weighs over 40,000 pounds with its tanks empty and stores stations vacant. Those are some amazing maneuvers that seem to defy the laws of physics at times, and you have to give it to the Russians, they make the best air show aircraft around bar none. But not that much of the Su-35’s acrobatic capability is relevant when it comes to modern air combat. Being able to maneuver at the post-stall end of the envelope may be an attractive capability when taking on a single aerial opponent within visual range—one that is willing join in a dwindling speed, “groveling” knife fight. But many just won’t, as they are trained to engage in a “rate fight” not “radius fight” to maximize the positive attributes of their aircraft and minimize the negative ones. But either way, an advanced Flanker pulling off post-stall tricks turns into one big vulnerable target hanging out in a highly depleted energy state when other enemy fighters are present. This type of extreme super-maneuverability holds less value than it did a decade or so ago when many western fighter aircraft still lacked a high-off boresight (HOBS) short-range air-to-air missiles and a helmet mounted sight for cueing those missile towards aerial targets far off the aircraft’s centerline. Today most of these aircraft now have these systems, and the best HOBS missiles, like the latest iterations of the AIM-9X, are able to engage the enemy even when they are located over the pilot’s shoulder. The pilot turns their head, and the missile’s seeker turns too. When their eye is pointed at the target, the missile will lock on if it can and the pilot can then fire the missile and take evasive action. The latest variants don’t even require the missile’s seeker to be locked on before launch, instead a data-link guides the missile towards the target and then the seeker locks on once pointed at it. In other words, who wins and who loses during within visual range combat is no longer dictated by who can “point their nose” at the enemy first. And of course, air show performances must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. Once you add a practical fuel load and some weapons to any combat aircraft, its agility quickly erodes. Also, the routines performed are full of carefully tested and choreographed “edge of the envelope” sequences, many of which are flown by highly experienced pilots. So it’s not like the guy or gal up there has 200 hours in the jet and is chasing down another aircraft over a war zone and pulling these maneuvers off on the fly to make a kill. An impressive lineup of Russian hardware at MAKS 2017., AP Still, the Su-35, and many other Russian aircraft, are incredible crowd pleasers, but they are far from being just dancing bears. When paired with experienced aircrews and the right tactics , and considering that roughly 2.5 Su-35s can be bought for the price of a single F-35A, not to mention that they are already being actively exported, the type is a threat to be concerned with. Video of the Su-30MKM, which uses a similar 3D thrust vectoring setup as the Su-35: But regardless of what you see on youtube or on some Flanker obsessed websites, these aircraft stand little chance of surviving an encounter with similar numbers of F-22s or F-35s. And comparing them to 5th generation western fighters really isn’t fair to begin with. But rules of engagement in some scenarios, or when fighting over a tightly compacted battlefield, mean that there is no absolute guarantee that these types of aircraft will never make it to the merge with the F-35 or F-22. Su-35S is currently the most advanced operational fighter in the Russia’s inventory. , AP The F-35 in particular may be vulnerable. Considering the Lightning’s limited internal missile carriage capability, just four air-to-air missiles at this time , a formation of F-35s could become overwhelmed with targets, especially during long-range expeditionary operations against a near peer state foe. Running or standing their ground is not as good an option as it is for the F-22 as the F-35 lacks the rear-hemisphere low-observability that the F-22 possesses, nor its agility or ability to supercruise at high speed out of the combat arena. When it comes to other 4th generation fighters, but less so for ones equipped with modern active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, the Su-35S is a much larger threat even in the beyond visual range combat environment. Within visual range the jet should be feared, but once again, its super maneuverability is not highly relevant in a multi-aircraft engagement, and tactics are developed to degrade its slow-speed performance advantage. Above all else, when any US or allied aircraft are operating in networked battlespace backed by various strategic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and command and control assets, as well as other “force multipliers,” their lethality and survivability improves exponentially no matter what opponents they face. But there are also vulnerabilities in relying too heavily on lumbering support assets or complex communications networks to win the day. AP With this in mind, for current fighters, a good degree of maneuverability is still a good thing to have, but new designs would likely be better off with trading it for other key advantages. In fact, dropping the whole fighter moniker and mission set altogether seems like a good idea. I have been a proponent of throwing maneuverability requirements out the door entirely for future manned assets. The ability to carry far more fuel and thus more range, have lower observability (better, wider-band stealth), larger and more capable internal electronic warfare systems, more expansive missile magazines (especially being able to carry missiles with far longer ranges than what is available today ) and in some cases enhanced supercruise capability would be far more advantageous than the ability to turn harder or to tumble around at zero forward airspeed. Additionally, the coming age of air-to-air lasers , which will be defensive in their application at first, is also likely to make slow-speed super maneuverability irrelevant and being able to avoid initial detection will have greater importance than ever. The truth is, manned platforms, for many missions, including some counter air ones, are increasingly irrelevant for high-end combat environments. As many of our readers know, I would immediately take the pilot out of the equation totally for many mission sets and unleash a quantum leap in air combat capability altogether via fielding scores of advanced unmanned combat air vehicles. Agility and speed come very low on the list of capability priorities for such a system, with long-range, modular adaptability, affordability, broadband stealth and especially the ability to act as a networked and highly redundant autonomous swarm filing out the top of the list. X-47B, Northrop Grumman The great F-35 agility debate may also come to mind here. The F-35’s ability to maneuver as good (if not better) as a 4th generation fighter is an issue because it was something that was promised and repeatedly touted by the aircraft’s manufacturer throughout the aircraft’s development, and that goal impacted its design and overall capabilities. Considering its magazine size, stealth and speed limitations, it needs a certain degree of agility to survive in the within visual range environment for the missions that will be thrust upon it. As for the F-35’s own performance at the Paris Air Show this year, something the aviation press seemed to swoon blindly over, I thought it looked about right for what we knew about the aircraft previously. Some claims from raving reviews seemed to be accurate and some claims from harsh critiques also seemed to be accurate. In the end the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. And once again, this was a canned air show performance flown by a Lockheed test pilot, not a real-world combat simulation of any type. What was certain of the F-35’s showing in Paris was that Lockheed’s PR blitz worked, with mainstream press quoting contractors’ soaring claims with unabated glee—never seeming to contemplate the fact that these were the same people who stand to make literally hundreds of billions in revenue from the aircraft. In the end I really wasn’t too disappointed with the jet from the videos I saw, it was clearly operating at the very edge of its capabilities and if anything else, it was a ballsy move by Lockheed. But I was let down many reporters who should have challenged contractors’ claims and unabashed hyperbole, or at least invited other voices to chime in with contradictory perspectives. On a personal note, I have heard directly from crews from both branches that have flown against the F-35 in training maneuvers or are close (as in very) to the program. Their comments have ranged from “good enough I think” to “she’s a pig but who cares I don’t plan on seeing the enemy up close in it” to “we need new jets OK, and this is what they are giving us.” I have never heard a rave review directly from anyone about the F-35’s kinematic performance or agility. On the brighter side, by all accounts the pilots say the airplane is easy to fly generally speaking, which is great because it allows them to concentrate on the tactical aspects of the mission and not on aviating. The avionics are all also impressive, some more than others, when they operate properly. Back to Russia and their super maneuverable jets. The Kremlin claims it is going to be designing and testing multiple new tactical fixed wing aircraft in the not so distant future. If this is fiscally even possible is a debate worth having, but regardless of this aspect of Russian officials’ claims, if they do indeed test even one new tactical jet in the foreseeable future, it will be interesting to see if they stick to their super maneuverability playbook or go for a much more balanced design approach. The Su-35S and the T-50., AP We have begun to see such a philosophy in the Sukhoi T-50, where some stealth elements and advanced sensors are mixed with thrust vectoring and high-maneuverability, but the aircraft cannot move around the sky like the Su-35. China has gone for range and low observability over raw agility as well with its J-20 stealth fighter/interceptor, and the country’s smaller J-31 doesn’t feature thrust vectoring or hyper agility either. If the US moves forward with a 6th generation fighter, by all accounts it will likely also put a major premium on range and low observability over nimbleness. If these trends are any indication, it is likely that we have reached peak manned fighter low-speed agility with the Su-35.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 19, 2020",US Navy Aircraft Carriers Had Escalators Just Like At The Mall,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you think of escalators, shopping malls, department stores, airports, office buildings, and even President Trump come to mind—not US Navy aircraft carriers. But the technology was introduced aboard these ships at the dawn of the jet age as a way to get gear-laden aircrews from their ready rooms buried deep in the bowels of the ship, up to the flight deck without severely winding them before their missions even started. Although we call anything that acts like an escalator an escalator today, at the time the name actually belonged to the OTIS elevator company. The units installed aboard aircraft carriers during the late 1940s and 1950s were technically “Electric Stairways” built by Westinghouse. USS Hornet’s flight deck elevator photographed in 1992 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. , USN Over a dozen Essex and Ticonderoga class carriers were deeply refitted after World War II to handle heavier and higher performing aircraft, including jets, and to make them more survivable based on lessons learned the hard way during combat operations. Part of these extensive refits included moving squadron ready rooms from just under the carriers’ relatively unarmored teak flight decks to deep in the ships’ hulls, underneath their fortified hangar bays. The escalators were installed as a relatively high-tech solution that was supposed to solve the logistical nightmare of getting crews to their aircraft after being suited up for flight. And they did just that, albeit only when they were functioning. When they didn’t work they became 100 foot long staircases for weighted down pilots to struggle up, and as the ships aged, they became less and less reliable. The much larger Kitty Hawk class was also built with this feature, albeit with two escalators, one forward and one aft, to accommodate its much larger size and expanded air wing. There are even some reports that a third escalator was also built into the Kitty Hawk initially to move high ranking officers from lower decks up to the ship’s bridge. It remains unclear if the Forrestal class also had escalators, but it seems as if they did, at least for a period of time. After the Kitty Hawk class, ready rooms were moved closer to the flight deck once again, and Enterprise and later the Nimitz class omitted the feature entirely. One can only imagine how these escalators must have added to the drama for flight crews as they slowly rose their way through the escalator’s dim tunnel to the flight deck before launching off into the night for air missions over Vietnam, or later on, over Iraq, Afghanistan and other dangerous locales.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 21, 2018",Perry Class Frigates Had These Crazy Pop-Out Auxiliary Propulsion Pods,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7) class has made news lately as the Navy looks to potentially bring the handful of FFG-7 ships it still has in mothballs back out of retirement as part of a larger initiative to field a 355 ship Navy. The hardy FFG-7s were always in the public eye, making up the lower-end of the Navy’s major surface combatant cadre, and their capabilities are well known. But one largely unrecognized, but very innovative feature was present on newer ships in the class—a pair of drop-down, swiveling auxiliary propulsion pods. The feature is so obscure in fact, that the Naval History And Heritage Command nor the Navy Sea Systems Command could dig up a single picture or video of the system. In fact, the only photos we could find anywhere were posted by user “Shifter3” some seven years ago in a radio-controlled model forum called RCgroups.com . Shifter3 via RCgroups.com Referred to officially as Auxiliary Power Pods (APPs), these sci-fi looking units could be extended to propel the ship at speeds of up to roughly six knots without the main screw providing any thrust and even without the ship’s gas turbines running at all. The APPs run off electrical power from the ship’s diesel generators and are located roughly below the front of the ship’s forecastle. Seeing that they can rotate through 360 degrees, these secondary drive units were used in conjunction with the ship’s main propulsion and rudder to get in and out of tight berths and harbor areas with little assistance. But above all else, they could work as super-sized trolling motors or sorts, and in an emergency, they could provide a secondary form of propulsion to get the ship out of harm’s way and into safe waters or port. Their inclusion later on in the FFG-7 design made the type’s single shaft and single screw configuration less of a liability. They also may have had some acoustic signature benefits while in use as opposed to the ship’s primary propulsion system. Oliver Hazard Perry class USS Carr (FFG-52) looking sharp off the coast of Monrovia in 2006. The last of the type was retired from US service in 2015. , USN An official response from our friends at NAVSEA described the system as such: The Auxiliary Power Pods (APP) installed on Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates had two purposes. Because FFGs only had one main propulsion engine ( one prop and shaft ), these pods could be used to maneuver the ship should a casualty be suffered. These pods were also used to help the ship navigate in and out of ports as they provided excellent steering capability. APPs were included on the ships as part of the new construction program and were not back-fitted.” In many ways, these azimuth thrusters were precursors to the Azipods that serve as many ships’ primary form of propulsion today, including some military vessels. Their hybrid-like propulsion was also ahead of its time for surface combatants, as the concept is something the U.S. Navy is just deploying en masse on its surface fleet today, albeit on a far grander and more powerful scale. USS Ingraham (FFG 61) displays a huge American flag as it arrives at Naval Station Everett following a deployment. It looks like you can see the ship’s APPs kicking up a little disturbance just aft of stream of water coming from the ship’s bilge system.  , USN The amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island was the first US Navy ship to feature the hybrid-electric propulsion concept when it was commissioned in 2009. Fast forward to today and even older Arleigh Burke class destroyers are being back-fitted with similar systems, and the stealthy Zumwalt class destroyer takes the whole concept to a far more exotic level. APPs, along with the Oliver Hazard Perry class ships that house them, are still in service with many navies around the world today. Allied countries have taken America’s unwanted frigates and have upgraded them with modern capabilities, like vertical launch systems, advanced sensors, updated combat systems, and even enlarged hangar bays. Many of these vessels will serve for decades to come. We’ll have to wait and see if the FFG-7s and their quirky Auxiliary Power Pods are regenerated and receive similar capabilities for use once again with the US Navy, but they seem to be by far the most likely type to be returned to service under the 355 ship Navy initiative.

We have talked about the highly diverse and numerous mix of aircraft that made up carrier air wings in decades past , and we have highlighted Battle Group Echo , the Battleship toting super flotilla that USS Ranger was a part of in 1987, but around that same time Ranger sported a unique air wing of its own. Dubbed unofficially the “Grumman Air Wing,” Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) deployed aboard the Ranger in mid 1986 with mostly Grumman-built aircraft, and no light attack squadrons whatsoever. An impressive view of Ranger brandishing its unique air wing. , USN At the time, light attack and fighter attack squadrons were either made up of the LTV A-7 Corsair IIs or the still very young McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets. Instead, Ranger sported only two all weather attack squadrons made up of Grumman A-6 Intruders. One of these squadrons was augmented for the aerial refueling mission with KA-6D tankers. The carrier also embarked two fighter squadrons made up of Grumman F-14 Tomcats. The air wing’s electronic attack role was fulfilled by a squadron made up of another Grumman product, that being EA-6B Prowler. A E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and control squadron was part of the air wing as well and detachments of C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft called on the ship regularly. Both the E-2 and C-2 are also Grumman aircraft. The rest of the air wing was comprised of non Grumman aircraft, but these consisted of only two types—the Lockheed S-3 Viking and the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King.

Tomcats of CVW-2 refuel from a KA-6D., USN For comparison, USS Forrestal (CV-59), the same class of ship as Ranger , was deployed at the same time in 1987 but had a much more common air wing configuration. This included two F-14 Squadrons, two A-7 squadrons, one A-6/KA-6 squadron, one S-3 squadron, one EA-6B squadron, one E-2 squadron and a SH-3 squadron. Around this same time, Nimitz class supercarriers were sporting two F-14, two F/A-18, two A-6 and one EA-6B squadrons, as well as the same number of support squadrons as seen on the Forrestal class ships. Smaller Midway class carriers were deploying with three F/A-18 Squadrons, two A-6 squadrons—one of which had KA-6s—one E-2C squadron, one EA-6B squadron, and one SH-3 squadron. The hangar bay of Ranger looked like the Grumman factory. , USN It seems that the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) may have actually established the “Grumman Air Wing” concept before Ranger, but for just one year, between mid 1983 and 1984, with one major difference being there was a detachment of EA-3D Skywarriors that also flew from the boat. What made Ranger’s incarnation of the concept so interesting is that from mid 1986 on through Desert Storm and till its retirement in 1993, the ship kept with the Grumman Air Wing configuration, and CVW-2’s makeup largely stayed the same. F-14 Tomcat launches off the waist catapult of the USS Ranger in the late 1980s., USN It’s not entirely clear where the Grumman Air Wing concept came from, but it likely was a result of a number of factors. First being it was a simpler configuration to sustain as less aircraft types were embarked aboard the ship. In fact, the air wing’s inventory is somewhat similar to the current super carrier air wings of today, which have Hornets, Super Hornets, and Growlers that make up the fixed-wing tactical core of the air wing. The Super Hornets and Growlers share direct commonality, much like the A-6, KA-6 and EA-6B. The Super Hornet and the Hornet less so, but still there are synergies between the two fleets. Sadly and stupidly , the S-3 Viking has been removed from carrier decks for the better part of the decade, and the tiny handful that were serving in other roles were retired in early 2016. Another shot of Ranger and her “Grumman Air Wing.”, USN Aircraft availability at the time was likely also a factor as fleet management led to some unique air wing configurations. Each carrier’s capabilities, intended use and deployment area were also variables. Still, without a light attack or strike fighter squadron or two, Ranger’s air wing had some limitations. The A-6E TRAM upgrade packed a powerful and modern punch, and was able to drop precision guided munitions under certain conditions, but the omission of light attack squadrons and their crews that train more for close air support than their strike-focused Intruder crew counterparts would have limited the carrier’s ability to support ground operations, and a handful of other missions to some degree. VF-2 Bounty Hunters F-14 flying by Ranger ., USN Today “Grumman Iron” has largely vanished from the decks of America’s supercarriers, with only the E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound being of Grumman heritage. The C-2 will slowly be retired in the coming decade, with a poor replacement in the CMV-22 Osprey taking its place. But Grumman’s proud naval aviation heritage may be on the verge of a resurgence of sorts. The Navy is actively working to field its first operational advanced unmanned air vehicle from the decks of its carriers. The program is known as the Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System, or CBARS for short, and the type has now gained the designation MQ-25 Stingray . Although the Navy should have reached farther when it came to fielding a semi-autonomous carrier based drone, including deep strike and penetrating reconnaissance in its mission portfolio, the MQ-25 is still what is likely the beginning of a slow end for carrier-borne manned aircraft systems. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B made history operating from a supercarrier. , USN Northrop Grumman is uniquely well poised to win the MQ-25 contract and others that will follow for more advanced and capable drones. The company pioneered the technology with it s X-47B demonstrators and continues to be a leader in the unmanned space. There will still be very stiff competition from Lockheed, Boeing, General Atomics and possibly others, but who knows, maybe the Grumman’s Air Wing will return to carriers in the form of a hive of swarming advanced unmanned combat air vehicles in the decades to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",The U.S. Coast Guard May Be Flying a Unique Stealthy Spy Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you think of U.S. military and stealth aircraft what probably springs to mind is the U.S. Air Force and planes such as the F-117 Nighthawk, F-22 Raptor, and B-2 Spirit. But low-observable technology isn’t limited just to cutting an aircraft’s radar signature and can involve other factors, such reducing aircraft’s infrared or visual profiles or cutting how much noise it makes in flight. As it turns out, the U.S. Coast Guard – which is technically a uniformed military service, despite not being part of the Department of Defense – has actually been a pretty serious operator of acoustically stealthy designs based on powered gliders, culminating in its most recent project, the Manned Covert Surveillance Aircraft (MCSA). On July 30, 2013, Sikorsky Aviation completed the first MSCA prototype after years of delays and technical difficulties. The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) budget for the 2005 fiscal year had first spelled out this requirement for a “covert surveillance aircraft.” We know very little about this aircraft, how many there are or were, what sort of sensors or other equipment it might have, or the status of the program in general at the time of writing. DHS’ original $8 million budget line item, which called for a joint project between Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection, described the MCSA as a “medium to short range, fixed wing surveillance aircraft” with “the capability to operate quietly and surreptitiously enough to enable the surveillance, detection, classification and identification of a maritime target without the target’s inhabitants becoming aware of the aircraft’s presence.” Subsequent plans called for at least three aircraft, with the first flying at least 1,000 hours annually from the Coast Guard station in Miami, Florida. We do know that Sikorsky put everything on hold between October 2012 and March 2013 as it tried to determine why there were “significant discrepancies” in both wings on the first prototype – a clue that it has a traditional layout – and moved the project as a whole from a plant in Elmira, New York to one in Fort Worth, Texas. An undated image of a Schweizer RU-38B, which may be the basis for the new MCSA., via airwar.ru “Aeronautical analysis subsequently revealed that the non-conformed wings were safe to fly,” according to a historical note about the work of the U.S. Air Force’s 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, better known as Big Safari, for the 2013 fiscal year. “However, the ongoing technical issues and Sikorsky’s repeated failure to meet milestones led program managers to pursue options with Sikorsky, including termination,” the overview of Big Safari’s activities during the next fiscal year explained. USAF via FOIA DHS, on behalf of the Coast Guard, had turned to the 645th to oversee the work. For decades, the Big Safari office has run numerous special aircraft projects, focusing primarily on spy planes, for American military and federal law enforcement customers and foreign allies. We obtained these historical entries via the Freedom of Information Act. But despite this general lack of information, we actually have a pretty good idea of what Sikorsky’s design looks like. Since the Vietnam War, the U.S. military developed and fielded a number of these “quiet airplanes,” taking the inherent qualities of gliders and turning them into stealthy surveillance planes. The Coast Guard itself has flown some of these types, which seem offer many of the features outlined in the MCSA’s basic description. An unmodified U.S. Navy SGS 2-32 glider., USN Powered gliders over South Vietnam The first requirement for such an aircraft came from U.S. Army commanders in South Vietnam, who wanted a way to snoop on Viet Cong insurgents and their North Vietnamese benefactors after dark. At the time, the service was limited to traditional fixed wing aircraft and helicopters for this job, both of which made sufficient noise as to alert enemy personnel on the ground that they were under surveillance. The subsequent classified Quiet Aircraft Program called for a plane that could persistently spy on targets below at night without giving away that it was there at all. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), now known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), led the program, which involved personnel from both the U.S. Navy and Army. With a budget of $250,000, ARPA reached out to the Navy in order to quickly obtain a pair of unpowered Schweizer Aircraft Corporation SGS 2-32 gliders. These were situated at the U.S. Navy Test Pilot School to give students “experience with yaw-roll coupling,” according to a DARPA history . An X-26 powered glider, which served as the basis for the QT-2PC., via the San Diego Air and Space Museum ARPA then turned over the aircraft to Lockheed and its Skunk Works special projects office, who had already proposed a conversion of the powered version of the glider, known as the X-26, for the Army requirement. Skunk works is perhaps best known for developing larger spy planes like the U-2 Dragon Lady and the SR-71 Blackbird. The final product was known as the QT-2PC, with the last two letters standing for the project’s official nickname, Prize Crew. “The major modifications included an acoustically insulated and muffled Volkswagen air-cooled engine, connected to a large, low-speed, high-efficiency propeller by a long line shaft, together with an up-to-date sensor suite,” according to the DARPA historical review. “Extensive use of radar-absorbing paints and other materials was also proposed to reduce radar signature.” With the main focus being on reducing the aircraft’s noise, ARPA never followed through with the modifications to reduce the plane’s radar signature. The pair of QT-2PCs arrived in January 1968, just in time to be thrown into action in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive, tracking enemy movements at night using handheld “Starlight” image-enhancing scopes. In April 1968, the Army sent the Prize Crew aircraft back to Lockheed for additional modifications based on this operational experience. “In particular, the tests had revealed the need for a quieter propeller, expanded view ports, and greater strength in the wing structure,” according to one annual Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) report . The planes were back flying over South Vietnam two months later. They made such an impression that MACV issued its own contract for another 40 improved “quiet airplanes” or QT-3s, which it planned to distribute between the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps throughout the country. These purchases never materialized. However, with the lessons it had learned from the Prize Crew program, Lockheed set to work on a revised design that, while still derived from the SGS 2-32, looked much more like a traditional aircraft. A low quality diagram of the YO-3A’s noise reduction features., USAF “The results led to design and construction of a new Lockheed surveillance aircraft, the YO-3A, which had new wing sections, new landing gear, a modified fuselage, and improved engine and drive system,” according to DARPA’s historical overview. “The sensor technology in the YO-3A was largely determined by lessons learned using the QT-2PC’s in Vietnam.” The sensor upgrade was significant, replacing the hand-held optics with a turreted night vision camera, a precursor to the designs that are nearly ubiquitous today on surveillance aircraft, spy planes, and drones. YO-3As flew with three- and six-bladed propellers, with a slow-turning, variable pitch three-blade design being the most consistently quiet configuration, even during landing and takeoff, according to U.S. Air Force tests . On top of that, the planes had other noise reduction features, including a long exhaust system that cooled the gasses and then passed them through a muffler in the tail, as well as various other “acoustic absorption treatments.” via Western Museum Of Flight The company finished the design for these aircraft, also known as the “Quiet Star” or “Q/Star,” in 1969 and had the first prototypes ready for operations in Southeast Asia by the next year. The original Prize Crew powered gliders ultimately went back to the Navy Test Pilot School to resume their previous training role. Lockheed built a total of 11 YO-3As, all of which went to the Army. The service only lost one, but in an accident rather than to the enemy.  With a cruising speed of just 80 miles per hour, the aircraft continued to gather valuable intelligence at night in South Vietnam until the United States formally ended its participation in the conflict in 1973. One of the YO-3As NASA subsequently obtained for search purposes., NASA Coast Guard takes the lead on “quiet aircraft” After the end of the Vietnam War, the Army steadily retired the YO-3As, turning them over to agencies as varied as NASA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Louisiana Department of Fish and Game for research and law enforcement purposes. Still, the service never fully abandoned the idea and revived the concept in the 1980s as part of a new airborne surveillance program nicknamed Grisly Hunter. This project was focused on developing a discreet aircraft to carry an improved, turreted electro-optical sensor system. The Army tested the proposed system on a variety of different planes, including twin-engine CASA 212 and four-engine De Havilland Canada DHC-7 light cargo aircraft, as well as the mysterious UV-23A and at least one test involving a Short C-23C Sherpa. In addition, they mounted the camera on yet another powered glider, the Schweizer 2-37A, designating the resulting aircraft the RG-8A. One of the prototypes crashed during tests in Arizona in 1986. The Army ultimately chose DHC-7s with civilian-style paint jobs for what evolved into the Airborne Reconnaissance Low program, losing interest in the much stealthier RG-8A. Secretive activities in Latin America, especially American support to the government of El Salvador and Contra rebels in Nicaragua, appear to have been major drivers of the Grisly Hunter program, so there are reports that the Central Intelligence Agency subsequently operated some RG-8As or similarly modified 2-37 aircraft on covert operations. There are also reports that, as with the YO-3A, similar aircraft flew with agencies under the Department of Justice, possibly the FBI or DEA. A low quality scan of the C-23C test aircraft used during the Airborne Reconnaissance Low program., US Army via FOIA Sensors turrets underneath the C-23C test plane., US Army via FOIA But this is also where the Coast Guard comes into the picture and things start sounding very familiar. With the War on Drugs in full swing, the service had the job of trying to intercept smugglers using small speed boats, popularly known as “go-fasts,” and light aircraft, generally at night. “They were transferred from the Air Force which developed the RG-8 after the Army, which originated the project, decided not to continue the aircraft’s development,” according to the Coast Guard’s own official history of the program. It “first took notice of the aircraft during a counter-narcotics program sponsored by … ‘Big Safari.’” In 1988, the two “Condors” began flying missions from Coast Guard Air Station Miami, with planned sorties equivalent to 2,500 flights hours per year. With a cruise speed of approximately 115 miles per hour, each RG-8A could keep aloft for 8 hours while still covering a 500 mile range. After four years of operation, they had aided in saving 10 lives, helped seize almost 8,600 pounds of cocaine and approximately 19,000 pounds of marijuana, and steered other personnel to 21 smuggling vessels, leading to the conviction of 33 individuals for drug-related crimes. By that time, the aircraft were also flying off the coast New York State. The Coast Guard even put them to work spotting illegal fishing and oil dumping activities. The Coast Guard was pleased with the planes, but wanted to expand their capabilities. The single-engine 2-37A was sensitive to the weather, unable to take-off in high winds and could be dangerous to ditch at sea if the motor gave out. The latter issue was a major concern, since the motors in the two planes had failed a number of times, though the pilots in each case had been able to make it back safely to base. An enlarged, more powerful design would also mean more range and greater payload capacity for improved or additional sensors. One of the Coast Guard’s RG-8A Condors., RuthAS via Wikimedia An inglorious end? In the early 1990s, Congress approved plans for a $450,000 program to convert the existing RG-8As into new, twin-engine aircraft, as well as build a third from spare parts. Schweizer would perform the work at its Elmira, New York facility. Unfortunately, the Air Force decided it was no longer interested in supporting the project and there appears to have been a falling out between the service and the Coast Guard over the entire affair. This is particularly apparent in a passive-aggressive message regarding the new plane’s official nomenclature. For unknown reasons, the Coast Guard had already begun using the designation RU-38A and the nickname Twin Condor for the revised design, which featured a twin-boom tail and a pusher-puller engine configuration reminiscent of the Cessna O-2A observation plane. The Air Force, which is in charge of approving all new aircraft and missile designations, was incensed that the service had been using these without its consent. The improved RU-38A Twin Condor, USCG On top of that, RU-38A moniker was wildly out of sequence with other utility aircraft in the “U” series. Though they ultimately approved the RU-38A designation, Air Force officials made the relatively petty decision not to make the Twin Condor name official and said they were putting the Coast Guard effectively “on notice” over the incident. “Our records … indicate that the next ‘U’ designator available for assignment is 28 vice the request 38,” Air Force Major General John Handy, then head of the service’s Directorate of Programs and Evaluation, wrote in a 1995 memorandum. “However, the costs and manpower associated with changing the documentation to reflect a different number outweigh the benefits in this case. Unauthorized use of the RU-38A designator will be included on the metric prescribed by [Air Force Policy Directive] 16-4 for tracking compliance with … designator policy since the designator was used by the Coast Guard prior to approval.” Despite this admonishment and without Air Force support, the Coast Guard pushed ahead with the conversion program. Schweizer ultimately only converted one of the RG-8As, with the other crashing in December 1995. It did also build the additional RU-38A from spares as planned, finish the program completely in 1997. The new aircraft had an AN/APN-215 weather radar in one of their tail booms, as well as a sensor turret with both day- and infrared cameras. Capable of longer flights, there was room for an additional crew member to help with increased pilot fatigue, too. Unfortunately, though we don’t know why, the Coast Guard decided in 2000 that the RU-38A did not meet the mission requirements. The fate of both planes is unclear, but it is entirely possible that they served as the basis for the new MCSAs. In 2004, none other than Sikorsky bought Schweizer and its Elmira, New York site. This is undoubtedly the same location in Elmira where it designed and built the MCSA prototype before moving that program to Texas in 2012. Schweizer had never given up the quiet aircraft concept, either, having delivered modified 2-37Bs to the Colombian and Mexican Air Forces, in the late 1990s. These were single-engine planes visually similar to the RG-8A, which the Colombians dubbed “ Vampiros ,” or vampires. One of the Mexican Air Force’s modified 2-37B surveillance aircraft., Zahpo75 via Wikimedia The company did design a further improved “ RU-38B ” aircraft, as well, reportedly delivering two the U.S. Department of Justice between 2004 and 2005. This new variant had two Rolls Royce Allison 250-B17F turboprops, which greatly improved the aircraft’s overall performance. The aircraft had a modular payload bay, able to accept palletized sensor packages weighing up to 800 pounds. According to the manufacturer, the B model could quietly cruise over a target area on just one propeller running at an especially low 1000 revolutions per minute. The final MCSA design may have leveraged some or all of these developments, or simply used the basic concept as a jumping off point. There have been significant advancements in lightweight composite airframes, efficient multi-blade propellers, and small engines since the Coast Guard and Schweizer first conceived of the Twin Condor. All in all, it seems safe to say that the Coast Guard’s MCSA was or is related in some way to these earlier designs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",Australia Set To Become One Of The World’s Top Aerial Electronic Warfare Powers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Australian Air Force is going from an air arm whose electronic warfare capability has largely been made up of off-the-shelf defensive jamming pods to one with some of the most potent and cutting-edge aerial jamming and electronic attack capabilities in the world. In addition to the country’s 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets ordered as a “stop-gap” measure to bridge between the retirement of the much beloved F-111 and the introduction of the F-35A, a dozen EA-18G Growlers were also ordered by Canberra. The RAAF is the first export customer of the EA-18G, and the inclusion of the type into the force’s order of battle represents a massive leap in capability for Australia and for its allies in the region. https://youtube.com/watch?v=AuEe1Y0MOi0 Procuring the Growler also opens up new tactical possibilities for the RAAF and makes their existing fleet of Hornets and Super Hornets far more survivable over a modern battlefield than they would be without such a potent organic jamming and electronic attack capability. Australia could expand its Growler force even further as the F-35A comes online without having to procure any more airframes, as the last 12 of the service’s F/A-18Fs were built with the wiring needed for conversion to Growler configuration already installed. As such, these aircraft can be “back-fitted” to the latest EA-18G configuration if the RAAF choses to do so in the future. EA-18G Growler components., rAAF The RAAF is also partnering with the USN on the next generation jamming pod program that is currently well underway. The announcement that the RAAF will spend $192M to be part of the development program was made by Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne at this year’s Avalon Air Show in February. The so called Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) will replace both types of long-serving ALQ-99 pods that the Growler, and its predecessor the EA-6B Prowler , tote around today. The NGJ ditches the directional emitters and uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology to drastically increase the flexibility, range, focus and power output that a jamming pod can provide. New tricks, such as the ability to deploy cyber attacks on air defense and command and control nodes, highly-precise enemy transmitter frying electronic strikes, and even the potential to use the pods for advanced communications capabilities as well as acting as independent radars and signals intelligence collection arrays may be possible with this new system. More plainly stated, adding these new pods to the Growler doesn’t just give the aircraft more jamming capacity and strength, it also gives the Growler new roles which can be evolved over time. The NGJ pod seen rendered on the Growler and the real thing aboard Raytheon’s test airframe. , USN/Raytheon As if this weren’t enough, the RAAF is now moving to order five of what are likely to be the most advanced electronic warfare aircraft in the world—a specialized variant of the Gulfstream G550 outfitted primarily for high-end and long-range electronic warfare and intelligence gathering purposes. The sale, which includes the modified jets and their specialized systems, along with total lifetime end-to-end support, which includes training, ground control interfaces and other infrastructure and services, is said to cost $1.3B, or roughly $260M per aircraft. These aircraft will also have other roles, including working as communications and networking “hubs,” as well as electronic reconnaissance aircraft. This way they can build up a real-time “picture” of an enemy’s electronic order of battle and pass that information to other combat aircraft in the battlespace. It is likely they will also eventually act as a “gateway” translator between the F-35’s stealthy MADL data-link system and MIDS/Link 16 used by RAAF tactical aircraft and other combat aircraft, like the service’s E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft. The RAAF’s E-7 fleet is also about to start a major upgrade worth $443M, which will expand its radar coverage and fidelity, processing power, communications and networking ability, among other improvements. Israel uses a similar concept of operations with its G550 “Eitam” AEW&C aircraft and its G500 “Shavit” electronic intelligence/warfare aircraft. These are some of Israel’s most prized low-density, high-demand assets, and are known to enable its fighter aircraft to make deep strikes into contested territory and come out unharmed time and time again. G550 “Eitam” AEW&C aircraft and its G500 “Shavit” electronic intelligence/warfare aircraft, IAI All these capabilities—Growlers, Next Generation Jammer, G550 EW and ELINT aircraft, E-7 upgrade—are slated to mature to an operational form around 2022. At that time Australia will have a electronic warfare capability only second to the US. America may even follow Australia’s lead by fielding a similar Gulfstream-based replacement for their EC-130 Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft. The tender is underway now with multiple systems integrators having paired with various aircraft builders in hopes of creating the winning team that will take the contract into production. The USAF has also shown interest in fielding an electronic attack version of the Conformal Airborne Early Warning aircraft, which is based on the G550 Eitam flown by Israel, Italy and Singapore. The aircraft has also been ordered by the Navy to replace its NP-3D “Billboard” range surveillance and telemetry aircraft. If this comes to pass, either via the competition to replace the EC-130 or as side procurement initiative, Australia and the US may be able to leverage commonality between the two systems. The G550 Conformal Airborne Early Warning aircraft packs massive EL/W-2085 AESA radar arrays. They are capable of wide-area airborne surveillance, but with some software and hardware changes, they could likely deliver devastating and highly agile long-range electronic attacks., IAI Australia’s F-35A fleet, which will possesses some exciting electronic surveillance and attack capabilities of its own, will also benefit greatly from the RAAF’s dedicated aerial electronic warfare assets. When paired with broadband jamming and electronic attack support, as well as with a communications relay and gateway, the F-35 force will be at its most potent, interoperable and survivable state. NAVAIR NAVAIR Since the F-35 will penetrate deeper into enemy territory than any other aircraft, the electronic information it gathers will be incredibly important to exploit on a large scale. With this in mind, if the G550 ELINT and jamming aircraft can “talk” to the F-35s digitally using their own MADL waveform, they can share electronic intelligence in real time and even coordinate electronic and kinetic attacks. If the G550 reprocesses and rebroadcasts this information to aircraft equipped with Link 16 modems, such as Australia’s Super Hornets, Hornets and Growlers, it will only add to the lethality and survivability of those aircraft as well. All this electronic warfare capability, although not cheap, is also something that is highly prized when it comes to coalition air operations. In past coalition air wars, US aircraft have had to take on the brunt of almost all the electronic warfare roles. These missions sets have even proven to be devastatingly effective , against insurgent groups like ISIS. With Australia gaining this capability, the island nation can provide “non-kinetic” capabilities to a composite force of coalition aircraft, and it is almost a certainty that these assets will be more highly prized during a conflict than the most capable strike fighters.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During large-scale exercises in Russia’s southern military district, some of the country’s most advanced versions of the iconic Hind attack helicopter showed off their true multi-role capabilities—which includes going from close air support platform to troop transport seamlessly. The video below shows a Mi-35M , which is upgraded in almost every way compared to earlier Hind variants, including a modern “glass” cockpit with night vision goggle compatibility. This, along with upgraded sensors, makes the Mi-35M especially well suited for nighttime operations. Upgraded engines, rotors and transmissions also give the helicopter increased performance in nearly every category and especially in “hot and high” environments. Russian MoD Like pretty much all Hinds, the Mi-35 retains its small passenger compartment , which is capable of lugging around up to eight fully equipped troops, or four stretchers. This allows the Hind to deliver small units to forward areas on the battlefield, and to immediately provide overwatch and close air support for those troops once they have disembarked. The helicopter can also exfiltrate those troops back out of the combat zone or work as a medevac platform in a pinch. Even quickly transporting supplies, such as small arms ammunition, to the front is within the Hind’s repertoire. Having a cabin is really an awesome and unique capability for an attack helicopter, especially in an age when such a premium is put on utilizing small special operations teams to achieve large effects on the battlefield. Check out the hind’s transport capabilities in action: The Mi-35’s human transport capability has even been extrapolated into what has to be the most exotic VIP transport helicopter in the world— the Mi-35MS . This shadowy and de-armed Hind derivative is thought to work as a continuity of government aircraft of sorts, whisking top MoD and Kremlin leaders from their high-profile Moscow strongholds off to hardened bunkers while still allowing them to maintain connectivity with their forces during a national emergency. During less dire times, the small Mi-35MS fleet likely works as a military VIP taxi, used by Defense Minister Shoigu and other top military officials. Putin still prefers his far roomier Mi-8MTVs. The special mission helicopter is outfitted with a defensive countermeasures suite, radar, and an elaborate communications system, which includes a Raduga-MB satellite communications installation. Mi-35MS seen over Moscow. , Chortos/wikicommons The closest thing the US has to a gunship with some transport capability is a concept that leverages a transport helicopter design and adapts it into a gunship, and not the other way around. The 160th Special Operations Air Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers , have a small fleet of highly customized MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) gunships that have been adapted from the stock H-60L Black Hawk design. But the cabin is usually stuffed with ammunition magazines and a large external fuel tank, so it is uncertain if it could lug even a small team of troops into combat, but it is unlikely. Usually a standard special operations modified MH-60 would just carry the force alongside the DAP. Maybe the USMC’s UH-1Y Venom could be compared to the Mi-35, but once again, it is a utility helicopter that has evolved into a transport-gunship over time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 15, 2021",Navy Presents Revealing F-35 Helmet Display Videos And Flight Test Dangers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video from Flight Test Safety Committee’ s conference early last May offers a fascinating insight into the F-35 test program. A talk put on by NAVAIR and presented by the F-35 Government Flight Test Director, Lt. Col. D. Tom Fields, goes into detail about a couple of challenges the program has faced over the last 12 months, and it’s is presented in a totally frank and unafraid manner. The open tone of the address is downright refreshing considering the usual one-sided spin we get from the F-35 Program Office and its corporate partners. In particular, two separate testing events are discussed during the talk: The two specific tests the Colonel Fields discusses during his presentation., Screen Cap from seminar video During the presentation, never seen before nighttime video recorded by the aircraft’s helmet mounted display (HMD) is shown. As we have discussed many times before , the F-35’s helmet uses footage from the aircraft’s Distributed Aperture System, as well as a camera mounted on the helmet itself , to seamlessly project a monochromatic picture of the environment around the pilot. In the videos we get a much better idea of what exactly the pilot sees at night while flying the F-35 and how they get to see it. What the F-35B pilot sees in their HMD during bright nighttime deck and moon conditions. You can see the layover from the front facing fixed camera to the helmet’s camera as the pilot pans their head and the canopy bow becomes visible. Notice how the virtually HUD snaps over to the right as the pilot turns their head. , Gif from linked video What the pilot sees in their HMD during dark nighttime deck and moon conditions., Gif from linked video Not only does the Colonel’s presentation give a clear picture of just a few of the intricacies of integrating the F-35B with “Gator Navy” flattops , but a display malfunction nearly caused disaster during one of the nighttime shipboard landing tests. Fields makes it clear: “We got real lucky that night.” We also get to see a weapons laden F-35B struggle to refuel behind a KC-135R, and eventually its refueling probe’s tip gets snapped off in the tanker’s “iron maiden” receptacle basket. The test’s goal was to see if the F-35B could use its afterburner to go “higher, heavier, and slower” while refueling. Normal tanking recorded by the HMD during daytime operations. The helmet camera sits inches above the pilot’s eyes and is not usually used during day operations. , Gif from linked video The  KC-135R’s “iron maiden” basket breaks away, snapping off the F-35C’s refueling probe during aerial refueling envelope tests., Gif from linked video We also learn other interesting details from the presentation, like how the F-35’s canopy bow perfectly blocks the pilot’s line of sight with the refueling probe, so that the pilot has to move their head around to see it. We also get a full run down on the HMD’s virtual heads up display (HUD) symbology. Beyond those and other F-35 specific details, the video is just stuffed full of interesting tidbits of information that pertains to modern flight testing and aircraft operating envelope expansion trials. You can watch the video in its entirety by clicking this link. After watching this video, it’s hard not feel that if the F-35 program would have just consistently published this type of information as the program advanced, for better or worse, it probably would have gone a long way to help—not hurt—the controversial aircraft’s plight. One of the major criticisms of the F-35 program has been the fog surrounding its delayed development. Massive swathes of issues would periodically emerge through leaks, congressional hearings, and watchdog or pentagon test and evaluation reports. At the same time, straight answers from the aircraft’s manufacturer or the F-35 program office were seemingly few and far between. Instead, we got glitzy videos with idealized snippets of the jet in action and those involved with the program singing its praises, which seemed totally tone deaf, especially as the aircraft’s development was clearly headed towards the edge of the abyss. Being proactive instead of reactive, and as open and straight with the public as possible, when it comes to developmental issues and challenges would be a far better, or at least a more appreciated strategy going forward for the F-35 and other big-ticket defense programs that will follow it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The Crazy Aircraft Carrier Hangar Catapults Of World War II,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Naval aviation blossomed rapidly during World War II, a time when the aircraft carrier became the centerpiece of naval strategy. As a result of the aircraft carrier’s rise in prominence, carrier design and technology advanced quickly through the war years, leading to some pretty awesome and long-lived technical revelations, and, well, others that were less so. One of these evolutionary dead-ends was the hangar catapult. It sounds nuts to begin with right? But before the angled deck was introduced, aircraft carrier designers had to figure out how they could quickly launch a scout aircraft even when the straight deck flattop was a chaotic mess or undergoing recovery operations. So the idea was to put a catapult that ran across the beam of the ship down in the hangar bay, with big doors on each side. This way, a scout plane or two could be launched in a pinch when the top deck was fouled. An F6F Hellcat launches off USS Hornet’s (CV-12) hangar catapult, USN Details are less than plentiful on this obscure topic, but as we understand it, the hangar catapult was installed on at least the first six Essex class ships, aside from Essex which was rushed into service. The aircraft launched out of the forward area of the hangar bay in either direction through two massive hangar bay doors. Sponson extensions that resembled bridle catchers (which came later) jutted out from either side of the open hangar bay when the catapult was in use. USN Keep in mind, these catapults were shorter and offered a quicker stroke than the upper deck systems, and the aircraft did not have the benefit of the wind blowing over deck for help to become airborne either. Even a cross wind was more usual than not. As such, it was a wild ride for crews tasked with getting airborne from the hangar deck. F6F belonging to VF-1 seen on the USS Yorktown (CV-10) main deck, below the ship’s hangar catapult is clearly visible. , USN At first the hangar catapult feature was deemed so important that when it was shown that it threw off the ship’s weight distribution, the port side top deck catapult was omitted to compensate. The novel design element was short lived though. By 1944 they were removed entirely during ship refits—aside from one ship, the USS Hornet —and both deck catapults were installed instead. TBF-1 Avenger of Torpedo Squadron 5 (VT-5) is launched from the hangar catapult on USS Yorktown (CV-10)., USN Some of the reasons for the demise of the hangar catapult were because it came at the expense of a deck catapult and the hangar bay had to be clear in the area of the catapult when an aircraft was on alert or to be launched. The Navy also found out that it could manage without the odd device via targeted training, careful planning and close coordination with other carriers in the flotilla—when they were present. But above all else, the advent of radar made scout planes far less important for early warning, and thus the hangar catapult was more of a liability than anything else.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 4, 2021",China’s Type 055 Super Destroyer Is A Reality Check For The US And Its Allies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s launched its first Type 055 destroyer today—the most advanced surface combatant Beijing has ever designed and fielded. Pictures of the visually striking ship whipped around the internet, with many people being surprised that China was producing such an impressive warship. The truth is, the Type 055 is the J-20 stealth fighter/interceptor of the high-seas, and it not only is a showcase of China’s rapidly evolving surface warfare and weapons development capabilities, but also a sign of what Beijing’s overall maritime strategy will be in the not so distant future. When it comes to the Chinese Navy, the Type 055 is very roughly analogous to something between the American Ticonderoga class cruiser a Zumwalt class destroyer, in that it has similar capabilities and size to the Ticonderoga class, but it also packs new technologies that will impact the future of Chinese surface combatant design like the Zumwalt class does. The ship’s stealthy exterior and its enclosed sensor mast are situated in between the latest Arleigh Burke class destroyers and the Zumwalt class developmentally speaking. The Type 055 could just as easily be classified as a cruiser than as a destroyer. It’s 590 feet long and displaces between 10,000 and 12,000 tons. That is 81 feet longer and up to nearly 2,500 tons greater than America’s latest Arleigh Burke class destroyers, making it closer in size to the US Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruisers than anything else. It also packs a Ticonderoga class’s magazine size, with 128 vertical launch cells available. The Arleigh Burke class has 96. These cells will be stuffed with land attack (YJ-18), and anti-ship missiles (YJ-12), as well as anti-submarine rockets (CY series). Yet, just like America’s Ticonderoga class cruisers, area air defense and slinging surface-to-air missiles will likely be this ship’s overwhelming mission set and it’s specially outfitted with a high-end sensor package that will exceed in this role. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IcDQGWW07YA This new ship relies on a dual-band radar system similar in concept to the one that was supposed to be deployed on the DDG-1000 Zumwalt class and that is currently equipping the USS Gerald R. Ford . Two sets of active phased array radars, one being the larger S-band arrays on the vessel’s super structure and the other being the smaller set of X-band arrays in the ship’s enclosed sensor mast, equip the ship. The S-Band system is used for long range search and track, while the much more sensitive X-band system is used for tracking smaller, stealthier and high-speed objects with greater fidelity at lesser ranges. There are cross-over in capabilities between the two sensor arrays, which also adds to redundancy. No other ship in China’s inventory possesses such a high-end radar system. The ship is likely to be primarily armed with a sea-going version of the HQ-9 long-range surface-to-air missile, as well as the HQ-16 medium-range SAM, and possibly quad-packed DK-10As. The DK-10A is based on the PL-12 air-to-air missile, and would act as a intermediate-range air defense missile roughly similar to the U.S. Navy’s RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM). As time goes on, these ships will likely field other air defense missiles, like weapons capable of swatting down endoatmospheric hypersonic vehicles or China’s own mid-course ballistic missile defense interceptors. These more exotic missiles could make good use of the ship’s dual-band radar, advanced combat system, and plentiful VLS farm. The ship’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities will also surpass the capacity of other Chinese warships, including space for two helicopters (eventually likely ASW variants of the Z-18 ) in its rear hangar and an expanded flight deck size. The ship will also likely use towed and variable depth sonar for hunting submarines, and will have its own torpedoes and rocket assisted torpedoes to prosecute marauding underwater threats. A H/PJ-38 130mm main gun and a H/PJ-11 30mm close-in weapon system (CIWS) round out the ship’s major armaments. It will also likely receive China’s “ FL-3000N ” version of the RIM-116 rolling-airframe missile system mounted in a turreted canister on the rear of the ship’s superstructure. This combined with the 30mm CIWS will give the big surface combatant a strong close-in defensive capability against sea-skimming missiles, low-flying aircraft, and small boats. These ships are rumored to be equipped with integrated electric powerplants , whereby the ship’s turbines provide electricity to drive electric motors that then turn the ship’s screws—a major advancement in Chinese warship design if confirmed. They also feature the latest in electronic warfare capabilities and the most advanced mission systems deployed by the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to date. Artist rendering of the Type 055 at sea. , 果壳军事-wikicommons Regardless of the Type 055’s multi-mission capabilities, these ships are being built to be the preeminent escort for the Chinese carrier battle group, acting in a similar role as the Ticonderoga class cruiser does today. This will include being the command and control hub for the battle group’s anti-air warfare operations. In this role the Type 055 will fulfill something of a missing link within the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s order of battle, with the Type 052D destroyer being the most capable surface combatant before it—but one that is far more limited in capability and weapons capacity than the Type 055. With the PLAN slated to field a fleet of at least four aircraft carriers in the coming decade, the reason for building four of these ships at this time is clear. There will be at least one for each carrier battle group, and when the carriers are not sailing, these ships will be able to show the flag by themselves far from home, and bringing high-end multi-mission and command and control capabilities to smaller PLAN task forces. It is also likely that another four Type 055s will be built at some time following the initial batch, as China’s aircraft carrier fleet expands. In the end, China’s new Type 055 destroyers are another indication of the amazing strides the country has made in their attempt to reach some sort of parity in multiple domains of warfare with the U.S. and especially its regional allies. That’s not to say these ships and their weapons are as capable as their American counterparts, because in many ways they are not. Even China’s shipbuilding capabilities are rumored to be lacking, especially in terms of quality, when compared to their American counterparts. The level of integration between their ship’s sensors and weapons, the reliability of their missiles—especially when countermeasures are present—and their missile’s overall performance abilities remain a question mark as well. But that’s not really the point. The point is that China is preparing for a future of major naval power projection, with this vessel class sailing closely alongside their aircraft carriers—two of which are built . Together they are the most visible centerpieces of a much more aggressive and farther reaching naval strategy. This may not leave the US Navy shaking in its boots, but when it comes to regional powers such as India and Japan, that is a different story. These ships and the carriers they will support will likely end up having a persistent presence in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, Indian Ocean, and East China Sea—all places where tensions are high and territorial issues are top of mind. Got to hand it to China, they sure know how to launch a warship don’t they?, AP The Type 055 is also another signal that China can no longer be viewed as a potential adversary living in a perpetual “catch-up mode” technologically speaking. The Chinese are increasingly doing things their own way and even tacking big independent technological risks, such as incorporating a dual-band radar into a picket ship before the US does. So the Chinese military, and the industry that supports it, still be copycats when it comes to defense concepts , but increasingly less so in terms of discreet hardware and integrated weapons systems themselves. As time goes on, this change will leave the US and its allies reacting to Chinese military developments more than in the past. And China’s weapons developments, which were largely based on questionable facsimiles of US or Russian systems in the past, are now becoming far less predictable and as a result are more concerning.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 6, 2024",The AGM-122 “Sidearm” Came To Be From A Novel Missile Recycling Scheme,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AGM-122 “Sidearm” anti-radiation missile (ARM) is one of the more obscure operational missile systems within the annals of air combat history, but how it came to be was pretty creative and we probably could use something very similar to it today. The history of the legendary Sidewinder air-to-air missile reads like alphabet soup, with dozens of variants carrying different letter designations, all of which were designed, tested, and in many cases deployed operationally over the last six decades. These have included a surface-to-air variant, the MIM-72, that equipped the M48 Chaparral short-range mobile air defense system, the air-to-ground AGM-87 Focus, and even a variant intended to defend submarines trying to hide from the prying eyes and ears of maritime patrol aircraft and anti-submarine warfare helicopters. But the AGM-122 version of the Sidewinder is maybe the most novel, and its genesis is actually a tail of two Sidewinder types, the other being the short-lived AIM-9C. In the late 1970s, it was becoming clear that the Pentagon needed a light-weight anti-radiation missile capable of being deployed on attack helicopters—namely the upcoming AH-64 Apache and battle tested AH-1 Cobra. These helicopters could find themselves operating near or being threatened by enemy radar guided air defenses. Because of its size, the missile could also theoretically be deployed aboard attack jets that provide close air support in the place of short-range air-to-air missiles. Adapting the hugely popular AIM-9 Sidewinder’s basic design for this requirement made the most sense as doing so would save on development and production costs, and ease aircraft integration. But building new AGM-122 “Sidearm” derivatives of the Sidewinder was not to be. Instead the program came up with a novel idea to reutilize an existing defunct Sidewinder variant to satisfy its lightweight anti-radiation missile requirements. The AIM-9C Sidewinder, sometimes referred to as the “radar Sidewinder,” was built specifically for the F-8 Crusader in the early 1960s. The missile was the same as the AIM-9D in many ways, but instead of an infrared seeker it utilized a semi-active radar homing (SARH) seeker that could engage targets “painted” by the F-8’s radar. The main advantage of using SARH over infrared guidance was that the missiles could be used to make head-on “face shots” on enemy aircraft, something the Sidewinders of that era could not do. Instead they would require the F-8 to maneuver to the rear aspect of its target in order for the infrared seeker to acquire the enemy aircraft’s hot exhaust. Radar guided Sidewinders could also be more easily employed in all weather environments and at night. An F-8 carrying AIM-9Cs., USN About 1,000 AIM-9Cs were built but the concept was short lived due to limitations of the F-8’s radar and fire control system. As a result, large stocks of the missiles existed two decades later, long after the F-8 had ceased fighter operations, and at a time when the AGM-122 program was coming to fruition. The Sidearm conversion basically saw the fitment of a wide-band passive electromagnetic radiation homing seeker in place of the AIM-9C’s existing narrow-band SARH seeker, as well as overhauling the missiles other components, and the fitting of a new fuse section and updated rocket motor used by the AIM-9L/M. Think of it as a ingenious missile recycling program of sorts. The general configuration was tested at NAWS China Lake in 1981 and was deemed a success. By that time the Army had lost interest in the program, but the USMC pushed on in an initiative to deploy the lightweight anti-radiation missile on their AV8 Harriers, A-4 Skyhawks and AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters. AGM-122 about to blow apart that radar emitter while testing a NAWS China Lake range., USN A contract to convert the remaining AIM-9C stocks to the AGM-122A configuration was won by Motorola in 1984 and the conversions began in 1986. By 1990, the last of roughly 700 AIM-9Cs became AGM-122As. The missile could lock on to a wide variety of enemy radar systems and chase them down even if they are on the move, albeit at relatively close ranges of around nine miles on paper, but often far shorter ranges in reality since the weapon was to be fired from low altitudes. Anti-aircraft artillery and short-range air defense systems (SHORADS), such as point defense SAM emplacements and mobile vehicle mounted anti-air systems were the missile’s primary targets, but it could also be used to attack enemy vessels that were emitting threatening radar energy. It was an incredibly simple but effective weapon. A AV-8A Harrier at NAWS China Lake equipped with a AGM-122 Sidearm. , USN Once fired, the missile was programmed to enact a “pop-up” maneuver so that it could make a diving terminal attack on the emitter being targeting. Although it lacked the standoff range, speed or advanced processing power of AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), it was still relevant. The one caveat being that the aircraft carrying it would have to get comparatively “down and dirty” with the threat in order to kill it. Also it should be noted that the Sidearm was intended to destroy the radar emitter—the antenna basically—and not the armored vehicle or the surrounding infrastructure it is mounted on. In other words, it’s a suppression of enemy air defenses weapon intended to exact a “mission kill” on an enemy air defense system, not obliterate it and its controllers entirely. The same continuous rod fragmentation warhead was used in the AGM-122 as the AIM-9C, which gave it limited destructive ability, but a high probability of causing a fatal impact on the emitter itself. In the end, the Sidearm was primary fielded by the USMC on its Cobra attack helicopters and AV8 Harrier jump-jets. Over the years the missiles were slowly  fired off or went out of service as their expiration dates were reached. A much more capable and reprogrammable successor was planned to be built from scratch, dubbed the AGM-122B, after all the AIM-9Cs were converted, but funding from the services for this extension of the program never materialized. A AGM-122 mounted on a Cobra during testing in 1981. , USN The Sidearm story is a relevant one not just because it showed how repurposing an existing platform can be a viable proposition and economically beneficial, but also that a light-weight ARM is really more relevant today than it was 30 years ago. Today’s modern ground-based air defense systems are increasingly mobile and lethal. Systems like Russia’s Pantsir S1 , 2k22 Tungusta and Tor short-range mobile air defense systems, and many others from other countries, both friendly and not so friendly, have proliferated around the globe dramatically. These systems are hard to pinpoint and destroy using conventional suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) tactics and can “pop up” virtually anywhere. Advanced helicopters with capable radar warning and homing receivers may be able to detect the presence of these systems, after which they can try to avoid or attack them, but having the option to suppress them without having to mount a traditional strike on them would be beneficial. An updated version of the Sidearm, that can pop-up from low-level and detect, and then home in on and destroy an enemy emitter, without putting the helicopter at direct risk, could be a very useful tool on the anti-access battlefields of tomorrow. The USAF’s A-10 Warthog fleet, which is supposed to serve at least to 2030 now, could also benefit from such a weapon, as could a light attack turboprop aircraft should the USAF actually field one once and for all. Basing such a design on the newest version of the Sidewinder, the AIM-9X, would make a lot of sense, and would offer enhanced kinematic performance over the AGM-122, but one short-range missile already has the capability to home-in on emissions from enemy radars—that being the small but highly agile RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). This missile is used as the primary point-defense weapon for US Navy and many NATO ships. Like the AGM-122, it uses components of the Sidewinder for its basic platform, but has a dual-mode seeker that rapidly homes in on enemy missile radar emissions as well as incorporating the infrared seeker from a FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) . It uses both these systems to reliably lock onto and engage incoming enemy anti-ship cruise missiles, some of which can crest the horizon at supersonic speeds. RIM-116 being test fired. , AP A simplified version of this missile omitting the infrared seeker and with specialized autopilot programing could give American helicopters and low-flying attack aircraft the rapid-reaction enemy air defenses killing capability they need. Not just that, but they could likely be programmed to sniff out and kill other emissions, such as radio signals and data-link emissions. If the infrared seeker was left on, they could be able to work as a dual-role missile, able to smash enemy radar emitters and take out other helicopters and low flying aircraft, as well as drones, at short ranges. The AT-6 is one of the aircraft the USAF is eyeing as a possible light attack and surveillance aircraft., Beechcraft So in some ways, the AGM-122 can be seen as almost as a proof of concept program, a forerunner to a much more capable, but also relatively off-the-shelf missile that can be adapted for similar and expanded uses. Think of it as the Sidearm II. But it all comes down to there being a will in the services to back such a project. At this time there doesn’t seem to be, which seems odd. Heavy reliance on electronic warfare and enhances situational awareness may be to blame for this. But now that the A-10 will be around for a long time to come, and a fleet of light air support aircraft may begin doing the duty of fighter aircraft for lower intensity conflicts, not to mention the growing threat of drones, maybe the Sidearm concept’s time has finally come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020","Study On Restarting F-22 Production Has Finally Arrived, Here’s The Verdict","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Back in April on 2016, congress ordered a formal study on the costs and feasibility of restarting F-22 production. The order came amid deteriorating relations with a militarily resurgent Russia and decaying technology supremacy over China’s growing military apparatus, and over half a decade after the Raptor line was originally shuttered. The move made big news, and it stood as yet an another indication that what some of us had been saying for years was finally becoming  the consensus inside and outside the USAF—that production of the world’s first 5th generation super fighter was terminated far too early. As time went by, and the political winds in Washington changed direction, the possibility of a Raptor reprise faded into background as did the pending report. But now, six months after it was due, the study has quietly materialized—and nobody gets to read its findings but certain members of congress. But some details are emerging and they aren’t really surprising or too encouraging. Unofficial estimates have varied drastically, from relatively affordable to horrendously expensive, on how much it would take to start building F-22s again. Also, false rumors have been rampant that the tooling for the jets, which is supposed to be carefully stored away along with videos on how each part of the Raptor construction process was executed, had been junked. There has also been much speculation as to what a new “F-22B” would look like and what the jet would be equipped with, but the question of how much money it would take to just get any form of Raptor back into production remained a mystery. Lockheed Martin Now that mystery is likely solved, yet the USAF won’t let the American people see the details. This really isn’t too surprising as The USAF and industry will do seemingly anything to keep competition for the ultra lucrative F-35 program at bay, so deep sixing the F-22 study could very well be just another in a long line of moves to protect the Lockheed’s true “golden goose.” But even with the secrecy, here’s what we are finding out, with both Military.com and the Washington Examiner posting similar figures: -Approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s -Total includes an estimate of approximately $7 billion to $10 billion for non-recurring start-up costs and $40.4 billion for aircraft procurement costs -An estimated cost of $206 million to $216 million per aircraft (the last F-22 produced had a unit cost of $137 million) In many ways this actually beats some cost estimates as far as restarting the production line. And at roughly $200 million per jet, the USAF could buy two F-35s for a single new F-22. But comparing the two is troublesome, as with both jets are in inventory and you don’t need anywhere near the numbers of Raptors as you do F-35s. Additionally, buying more F-22s could (and should) mean less F-35s would be required depending on how you look at the USAF’s overall force structure. Not just that, but involving other countries in the restart , notably Japan and possibly Australia, these costs to the USAF alone can come down. Lockheed Martin The big question as we highlighted before is what is a “new” F-22? Does it have an avionics system based on the F-35? Is it tailless and stretched to increase its stealthiness, range and weapons payload? Or is it a F-22 as we have today with basic upgrades to its computers and materials where necessary to accommodate modern production lines and techniques? The former is likely what the numbers above depict. But the F-22 remains the undisputed air supremacy fighter the world over, it has proven itself invaluable in Syria , and even the USAF has admitted the F-35 is no match for the jet’s extreme capabilities for certain key missions sets. But with a new bomber in the works, the need to upgrade or totally replace rapidly aging legacy fighters, as well as a whole other avalanche of priorities that are battling it out over the Pentagon’s unpredictably sized piggybank, realizing a Raptor production reprise remains just as doubtful as ever. Even the F-22 force the USAF already has is lacking key capabilities due to poor priorities and funding shortfalls. Above all else, not even the manufacturer is interested in executing such a plan as their sights are laser focused on the much larger and far more lucrative F-35 pie. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fYEx9BiJNfE After delivering the report to the House Armed Services Committee, the Trump Administration’s new Secretary of Air Force Heather Wilson made it clear that the USAF has no interest in building more “very expensive” F-22s. “The startup costs are significant and very expensive… The chief has assigned a fighter roadmap. Our plan is to put any resources we have into that roadmap and not into restarting a line from an older aircraft.” This was likely the outcome no matter what the study found, and in all honesty, the USAF would be better off at this point pouring big bucks into advanced unmanned air combat vehicles—the same kind of drones technology the force acts as if doesn’t exist —than an already shuttered manned fighter program. As such, the F-22 will live on as a silver bullet force of around 181 jets, of which only roughly 125 are combat coded, and only about two thirds of those are ready to fly actual missions at any given time. The aircraft has really become a somewhat depressing, cautionary tail of how clumsy, spastic and nearsighted the Pentagon procurement process can be.

When the A-10 Warthog first entered service, its primary job was standing ready to blow up hordes of tanks if the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies ever invaded Western Europe or if a similar major conflict erupted on the Korean Peninsula. Decades later, after years of flying the jets in a broader close air support role, the U.S. Air Force looked into what it would take to rent a fleet of the blunt-nosed attack jets to Colombia, where they would’ve blasted leftist guerrillas and drug smugglers. In early November 2003, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Randall Schmidt, then the dual-hatted commander of U.S. Air Forces Southern and 12th Air Force, traveled to Bogota, Colombia to meet with the head of that country’s air force. During their meetings, the Colombian officer broached the subject of leasing 18 A-10s for a period of between three to five years. The American flag officer relayed the message back to his superiors, who determined immediately that Colombia was not presently cleared to purchase A-10s, regardless of any other issues, according to a backgrounder on the issue the service crafted sometime in the next three months. Undeterred, he asked the Air Force’s International Affairs office to look into the feasibility of the request. The bullet background paper on the matter made it into a packet of materials the Pentagon put together for U.S. Marine Corps General Peter Pace, then the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before a trip in February 2004 that would take him first to U.S. Southern Command’s headquarters in Miami, Florida, then on to Colombia, and finally to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on the way back. The Department of Defense released the full collection of documents, many of which it heavily redacted, in response to another individual’s Freedom of Information Act request. The records are now publicly available online. DOD via FOIA At the time, Colombia was still heavily engaged in a long-running civil war with a collection of leftist rebels, most notably the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by their Spanish acronym FARC. On top of that, the country’s security forces were battling drug cartels that had taken advantage of the conflict to establish their operations in areas with little or no government control. In the early 2000s, to support government operations against both of these groups, the Colombian Air Force relied on American A-37 Dragonfly and OV-10 Bronco light strike aircraft, as well as Israeli Kfir fighter jets. Colombia had also upgraded a number of aging C-47 transports into turboprop gunships, which it called AC-47T Fantasmas , or “ghosts.” In 1993, the United States reportedly rejected a request to buy a number of larger and more capable AC-130 gunships . Armed helicopters provided additional firepower for mobile operations in the country’s remote jungles. But FARC rebels had access to heavy weapons, including large caliber machine guns, and were finding ways to obtain man-portable shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles . These weapons, combined with the rugged terrain and dense foliage, which helped hide insurgent and criminal movements and base camps, posed a significant threat to the country’s aircraft. Already combat proven over the skies of Kuwait and Iraq and able withstand an amazing amount of punishment and weave precision fire through dense jungle canopy, the venerable A-10 would have been a welcome addition. And after an American-led coalition invaded Iraq in March 2003 to unseat dictator Saddam Hussein, the Warthogs again became a star of a major U.S. military operation. Colombian Air Force officials would have undoubtedly seen the routinely glowing public reports about the aircraft’s performance in the Middle East. A heavily laden A-10., USAF Schmidt found that there was tentative support for the rental idea from both the Air Force’s top leadership and the head of Air Combat Command (ACC), which controlled the bulk of the service’s combat-coded aircraft, including all of the active duty A-10s. “Regenerating a limited number of (about 12) A-10s for lease is feasible and does have benefits,” the bullet background paper noted. Unfortunately, there were significant bureaucratic hurdles in the way. The most immediate issue was that ACC, perhaps surprisingly given its relationship with the low- and slow flying Warthogs, was not interested in giving up a squadron of its own aircraft to Colombia. With the straight-wing, twin-engine jets long out of production, Air Force officials asked about what was baking in the sun out at the famous boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. What they heard back was that 198 A-10s were sitting the desert in various states of disrepair and none that were coded “XT” or “released for security assistance.” A total of 151 were set aside as parts sources to help sustain the Air Force and Air National Guard fleets, as well as any other project that might require Warthog parts. The other 47 were “XS” or in “inviolate storage.” Also known as Type 1000 storage, planes in this category are ready to return to duty with a minimum amount of effort. The Warthogs in this condition at the Boneyard were specifically on hand as a reserve in case there was a sudden need for replacement aircraft or a surge in demand for spare parts. USAF Still in relatively good shape and with most of their pieces still in place, they were also the best candidates for rehabilitation and transfer to Colombia. The Air Force’s top brass and ACC refused to commit to letting any of those aircraft out of storage until there was a clear understanding and commitment on the part of the Colombians with regards to “required configuration, timeline for modification]/delivery, sustainment and training requirements, funding mechanism, and guarantees the aircraft will be returned and placed back to XT status,” the backgrounder explained. The last stipulation appears to be a typo. The Air Force would almost undoubtedly have wanted the jets to go back into XS storage and not get a new XT status after coming back from their Latin American tour of duty. In addition, the Air Force worried that the effort required to get these A-10s combat ready again would compete with separate upgrade work on its own Warthogs. At the time, the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis-Monthan –  now known as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) – had the only facility with the necessary tooling to do depot-level maintenance on the jets. The only way to adequately support both efforts would be to “incur exorbitant costs to set up new facility or expand AMARC capability,” the Air Force complained. It would already take between $7 and $8 million to just regenerate each aircraft bound for Colombia. In addition, someone would have to pay for other tasks such as training Colombian pilots to fly them and sustaining the planes in country. An armored crop duster sprays herbicides in Colombia in 2003., DOS On top of all that, there was one last impediment to the plan that no amount of money would have been able to solve. The Air Force was deathly worried about getting into a fight with the State Department, and not over export restrictions or human rights concerns – though American diplomats would certainly have needed to do a certain amount of finessing on both those issues. No, the big problem was that in 2001, State had asked the Pentagon for 11 A-10s to support its own counter-narcotics programs in Latin America, including Colombia. Faced with many of the same dangers as the Colombian Air Force, the Department had similarly come to the conclusion that it needed more rugged planes to spray herbicides on illicit drug crops. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, better known by its acronym INL, had already bought armored crop dusters and modified OV-10 Broncos that offered better protection against enemy fire. They had even considered purchasing armed versions to escort the spray aircraft. But the A-10 would have dramatically increased the capability of the Bureau’s Air Wing . The Air Force balked at the idea, saying every one of the A-10s in the Boneyard was essential to maintaining its own fleet of aircraft. “Potential fight with DoS [Department of State] if A-10s are now released to Colombia as attack aircraft,” the background paper warned. Ultimately, the service’s top leadership went back to Schmidt with at least two recommendations. The first one was that “regeneration and lease of about 12 A-10s is theoretically feasible but potentially comes with a high cost.” The other recommendation or recommendations are redacted. This is the only portion of the one-page document government censors blacked out. A Colombian Air Force Super Tucano flies with two U.S. Air Force A-10s during Green Flag East in August 2016., USAF We may never know what the other reasons were, or whether they argued for or against sending the A-10s to Colombia. We do know the lease plan never materialized. Instead, Colombia subsequently purchased a fleet of Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano light attack aircraft. In 2013, The Washington Post reported that the Central Intelligence Agency and other members of the U.S. Intelligence Community were actively supporting Colombian targeted strikes against FARC leaders and other rebels. The project reportedly included integrating the GBU-12/B laser-guided bomb onto older Colombian A-37B Dragonfly light attack jets. In general, these single-engine turboprops have become popular with small air forces around the world for surveillance and counterinsurgency missions, as well as basic training. The United States itself has facilitated their sale to Afghanistan and Lebanon and the Air Force is planning to include them in an experimental light attack fly-off later in 2017. And in an interesting twist of fate, in August 2016, Colombian pilots brought some of their Super Tucanos to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana to take part in a Green Flag East training exercise. During the practice sessions, they flew with Air Force A-10s from Moody Air Force Base.  We don’t know if any of those Colombian aviators were aware of the discussions more than a decade earlier that might’ve had them flying the Warthogs themselves.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 17, 2020",This Syria-Bound Super Hornet Is Carrying A Uniquely Massive Bomb Load,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This F/A-18F Super Hornet, belonging to VFA-213 “Blacklions” and operating aboard the USS George H.W. Bush in the eastern Mediterranean, is equipped with one uniquely massive and highly destructive payload. No less than ten 1,000lb GBU-32 JDAMs are slung under its wings. In addition, a pair of 188lb AIM-9X Sidewinders adorn its wingtips. A 400lb ATFLIR targeting pod is attached on its left intake station, and a 480 gallon centerline fuel tank rounds out its external stores list. Add in the four multiple ejector racks and the pylons, not to mention 412 rounds of 20mm ammo, and this “Rhino’s” stores load-out grosses out at roughly 16,750lbs. This does not count the expendable decoys the jet is carrying and there may also be an AIM-120 AMRAAM on the other intake station, but since we can’t be sure, we will leave it off the list. USN The Super Hornet, which weighs roughly 32,000lbs empty, and has a max takeoff weight of 66,000lbs, in this configuration still has 17,250lbs of payload available. Add a full internal fuel load of 13,500lbs, and the jet is left with roughly 3,750lbs of lifting capacity before hitting its max takeoff weight. Such a heavy load is very unusual for the types of missions the F/A-18E/F has flown over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Syria since its combat debut in 2003. It is similar in weight to the type’s “Five Wet” tanker configuration, which puts the aircraft very near its max gross takeoff weight. In either configuration, the strike fighter will fly far more sluggishly, with a much narrower operating envelope than when in more common combat configurations. F/A-18F in the “Five Wet” tanker configuration., USN At the same time, this single aircraft in this configuration can obliterate ten separate relatively large and somewhat resilient targets during a single mission, or even on a single pass. Its targets could be an entire enemy base, or multiple separated buildings in a city, or a number of pillboxes and fortified revetments in a certain area, or a fleet of parked armor. These weapons could even be used to crater of a strategic roadway with pinpoint accuracy in ten separate places. In comparison, before precision guided munitions, and especially the JDAM were commonplace, it would have taken an entire carrier air wing to accomplish such a mission, and even then the chances of destroying all ten targets within the target set would have been relatively low. This reality underscores just how powerful the modern carrier air wing has become. Whereas during Vietnam dozens of Navy strike aircraft, supported by fighters, tankers, electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defenses, and command and control aircraft may have attacked a single bridge with a questionable chance of success, now one Navy strike fighter alone can attack multiple bridges with near certainty of success on a single sortie. A much more normal F/A-18F weapons load for missions over Iran and Syria., USN Although back in the pre-precision guided munition age, large bomb loads were common on Navy strike aircraft. It was a matter of the volume of fire needed to overcome limitations in precision. The A-6 Intruder in particular was the carrier’s heavy hitter, often times being photographed laden with tons and tons of munitions. One of the primary load-outs for the Intruder was no less than 24 500lb Mk82 bombs on multiple ejector racks as well as a 300 gallon centerline fuel tank. This amounts to over 14,000lbs without the pylons, ejector racks or the weight of the empty external fuel tank included. In comparison, B-17 Flying Fortresses would carry a bomb load of around 4,000lbs for missions over Germany during World War II. A-6E Intruder from Attack Squadron 176 (VA-176) “Thunderbolts” is launched from the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal (CV-59), USN Now the Intruder would have had to drop a good portion of its ordnance before being able to land aboard the boat. The Super Hornet can land at a gross weight of 44,000lbs. That means that F/A-18E/F crews have roughly 12,000lbs of fuel or weapons to retain for future missions. So there is no way the bombed-up Super Hornet featured in this post would have been able to land with all its stores, and nothing hanging on that aircraft is cheap. Each JDAM costs roughly $15,000 to $20,000 depending on which source you check, and dropping an empty centerline tank alone won’t get the jet to its weight goal alone either. Regardless, that is a lot of precision firepower being carted off a carrier by one fighter in this day in age, and ISIS surely weren’t happy campers once all those GBU-32s detonated. Well done Blacklions, well done.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Air Force Aggressor Squadron Has A Surprising Secondary Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In maybe the ultimate form of irony, during a national security crisis, or even an attack on the homeland, the airliner you are flying on could be intercepted by a foreign-looking fighter jet adorned in Russian camouflage with bright red bort numbers on its sides, and in some cases, even big red stars on their wings. That’s because the 64th Aggressor Squadron (64th AGRS), the same unit that provides adversary support training out of Nellis AFB in Las Vegas, Nevada, for exercises like Red Flag , was tasked in 2013 with the air defense mission, according to documents obtained by The War Zone through the Freedom of Information Act and corroborated by officials at Nellis AFB. Here’s the excerpt from the Nellis AFB 2013-2014 Annual history which describes the establishment of the mission: Nellis AFB was designated as a site for Operation NOBLE EAGLE Aerospace Control Alert function in mid-late 2013. While the actual mission fell to the 57th Wing’s 64th Aggressor Squadron, 99 ABW was an integral part of the preparation and mission support to include 99 CS, 99 SFS, 99 FSSW and the Base Command Post (99 ABW/CP). This mission had been envisioned under NAFB Plan 7, Air Defense Plan. 2013 and early 2014 saw identification of required facilities and assets needed to execute the mission; by 11 September 2014, First Air Force (I AF), and Continental United States NORAD Region (CONR) Air Forces Northern (AFNORTH) had defined the infrastructure standards and requirements; “for use during the initial planning, project programming, and Site Action Task Force (SATAF) convened to establish or modify tighter alert facilities in support of Operation NOBLE EAGLE (ONE) and Aerospace Control Alert (ACA) homeland defense. Use this document as a starting point to select potential sites and aid in identifying unique site-specific equipment and training requirements.” By 11 March 2014, all the known requirements and Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPR) were identified and where possible, monetary costs were estimated to procure or modify the facility or equipment needed. AIl parties were working towards a training day on 17 March 2014 to see how the process worked and what “unknown unknowns” were still unidentified; this was followed by a “full-up demo activation” on 27-29 March 2014. Command Post responsibilities for ONE were defined as well, which included “1500 hours’ worth of North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD) Emergency Action (EA) Procedure training, directly contributing to Nellis AFB being the first of nine units to report initial operational capability (IOC) to HQ ACC”; this on top of their already significant workload. On 30 June – 2 July 2014, the 57th Wing conducted an exercise under the USAF’s new inspection system. On 8-9 September, a Site Assistance Visit Team from 1 AF (CONR) AFNORTH visited Nellis AFB for a Provisional Alert Site inspection; while 99 ABW/CP limitations such as lack of some equipment or an Alternate Command Post (see Chapter 4), the team wrote “The Nellis Command Post has a strong ACA program with thorough scenario based training and well developed procedures.” On 14 October 2014, just after the end of this reporting period, the USAF Warfare Center published USAFWC Instruction 10-203, “Alert Operating Procedures,” which laid out “guidance, establishes procedures and defines responsibilities of the base organizations in order to conduct Aerospace Control Alert (ACA) and Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) for the United States Air Warfare Center, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in support of the Commander, NORAO/NORTHCOM,” This instruction superseded NAFB Plan 7.10. Here is a scan of the same excerpt from the official document: USAF via FOIA USAF Even though Nellis AFB houses every fighter type in the USAF’s inventory, there are no front-line “operational” fighter squadrons based there. The 64th Aggressor Squadron, with their fleet of Block 32 F-16Cs may not seem like an ideal fit for the air sovereignty mission, but it is the logical choice as there are really no alternatives. Also, the unit has been significantly augmented since its sister squadron, the F-15C/D Eagle flying 65th Aggressor Squadron, was shuttered as part of rampant budget cuts that occurred earlier in the decade. Still, the idea that the unit’s eclectic looking jets would be flying air patrols over America’s southwest seems odd to say the least. The War Zone reached out to Nellis AFB for more information on the 64th AGRS’s secretive “other” mission. We got very little elaboration on our questions, but the unique squadron’s association with the air defense mission did become a bit clearer. The 64th AGRS does not sit continuous alert, and has not had to take up an alert posture since acquiring the mission a few years ago, although according to base officials “they could be tasked to support this activity, as required by higher headquarters.” When asked about the unit’s capacity to do so, the only reply we received was that “tasking specifics are classified.” The unit was chosen for the mission because “aircraft availability and capability met the requirements for mission.” In addition they added that “typically Nellis provides facilities as an alert location and other units from outside Nellis deploy here to support the requirements. The 64th AGRS only support when other units are not available or tasking requires more aircraft than can be provided by the deployed unit.” USAF So it seems that the 64th AGRS stands ready to support the air sovereignty mission, but doesn’t do it on a regular basis. What is a bit puzzling is that Nellis really doesn’t seem to have a dedicated alert facility per se. And in recent decades the base has not been known, at least publicly, to support rotating fighter contingents tasked with providing air defense capabilities. Also, it really isn’t clear if this alert duty could include remote alert sites at other nearby bases that fall under Nellis AFB’s control or are directly affiliated with the base in other ways. For instance, alert aircraft could be positioned at Creech AFB, just 40 miles northwest of Nellis AFB. And we do know that F-16s are omnipresent at Area 51. Nobody knows exactly what all the purposes of these aircraft are, but flying chase for test sorties seems to be one function, and defending the Nellis Range Complex and especially high-security “box” around Area 51 from intruders could be another. The base has HH-60G Pave Hawks that perform perimeter security functions as well. Even shadowy Tonopah Test Range Airport , located at the northern reaches of the range complex, could be a site where F-16s can be temporarily deployed for the air defense mission, although we have no proof that fighters frequent the field for that purpose. F-16s are regularly seen in satellite imagery of Area 51. , Google Earth Regardless of the fine details, at least we now know that the USAF’s highly touted Nellis Aggressors do have a secondary set of responsibilities—sweeping the skies for hostile aircraft during a real-world national emergency. And although their aircraft are the most dated and least capable F-16s in the inventory, their pilots are the very best of the best. Still, their paint jobs may be a little confusing, if not downright startling for any errant aircraft they intercept. On the other hand, in a fantastical Red Dawn like scenario, those same paint jobs may confuse the enemy just long enough to get the kill.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 10, 2020",Nightstalkers Show Off For the Public With a Dramatic Urban Air Assault,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that U.S. special operations forces regularly conduct a wide array of operations , including heli-borne raids into enemy-controlled towns or other well defended facilities. But America’s “silent professionals” are often called upon to perform these tasks discreetly, so it’s not every day the public gets to actually see the full force of such a mission, even in training. Earlier in June 2017, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command invited a number of civilians from the surrounding community to come to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the hub of the service’s special operations community, to watch some of the service’s elite forces run through a capabilities exercise, or CAPEX. Though American special operations forces put on these displays for various different groups , the events involving members of the public are an opportunity to engage with civilians and explain special operations missions, skill sets, and their value to the U.S. military. This particular demonstration included MH-60M Black Hawk and MH-47G Chinook helicopters from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), nicknamed The Nightstalkers, inserting special operators during a mock air assault into a simulated urban area. Army special operations aviation “training is one of the most rigorous, technical forms of training in the world,” an official manual from 2000 explains. “It produces some of the most professional and highly trained soldiers who demonstrate superior performance in small groups or as part of an integrated U.S. response with other military forces, as well as non- Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies.” US Army The 160th in particular has a long and storied history since the Army first began forming the unique unit from existing aviation elements in 1981. Since then it has become well known for supporting daring raids and other critical operations during American military interventions in Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf region, the Balkans, Somalia, and more recently Iraq and Afghanistan. Most notably, Nightstalkers, likely working with even more shadowy aviation units , flew specially modified stealthy helicopters during the raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. US Army The two MH-60s and three MH-47s on display during the demonstration at Fort Bragg may not be as advanced, but are still impressive. Operations in an urban training area can be complicated and potentially hazardous, too. Here is a video of a similar exercise that included cross training with Poland’s elite special operations forces: In an urban area, “aircraft are at high risk from small arms fire, complicated by the proximity of noncombatants,” the old Army manual notes. “Blowing debris increases foreign object damage and can make landing areas unusable.” US Army The 160th’s MH-60Ms conduct many of the same duties as their regular Army counterparts, moving troops and supplies around, evacuating casualties, performing command and control functions, and even psychological warfare duties if necessary. But the pilots are expected to perform these tasks under much more demanding circumstances, almost exclusively at night during actual operations, and often far removed from traditional logistics pipelines. US Army As such, these specialized Black Hawks have terrain-following radars to aid with blacked-out, low-level flying, day and infrared full motion cameras, enhanced communications systems, advanced warning sensors and defensive countermeasures, as well as the ability to refuel in mid-air. The basic MH-60M configuration carries two M134 miniguns for self-defense, but a so-called Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) setup adds stub wings and other fire control equipment, turning the helicopters into gunships armed with missiles, unguided rockets , or forward-firing machine guns or automatic cannons. US Army The MH-47Gs have many similar modifications, including the same terrain following radar, and feature larger fuel tanks compared to the standard Army CH-47Fs, giving them a more portly appearance. The long in-flight refueling probe and the hoist at the front main cabin door are other dead giveaways of the special operations variant. Instead of the three M240H 7.62mm machine guns on basic F models – two near the front and one on the helicopter’s rear ramp – the G variant has two M134 miniguns in the forward, side-firing positions, as well as two M240s mounted in the main cabin’s rear emergency exit windows. US Army Given their payload capacity and range, with the ability to carry around 40 troops depending on various environmental factors, the special operations Chinooks often play a supporting role during operations, rushing quick reaction forces to a target area or arriving later on to extract special operations forces, along with prisoners, hostages, or other precious cargo. They also work as tankers for forward refueling points, allowing shorter-ranged assets to land at a remote location, take of fuel from the Chinooks and then get back into the action, or safely back to base. 160th Chinooks were used in this role during the Bin Laden raid. US Army During the 2017 CAPEX, the two MH-60M, miniguns blazing, deposited teams onto the roofs of buildings, as additional elite troops moved in on the ground. The three MH-47s landed in a nearby field, ready to pick up the entire force. US Army The U.S. Army expects to fly these helicopters for the foreseeable future, but continually upgrade them to increase their capabilities, including work to increase range, fuel efficiency, payload capacity, and survivability. A plan is underway to eventually add a “degraded visual environments” equipment to both helicopters, which would help aviators see through dust clouds, swirling sand, smoke, and other similar hazards. US Army By 2030, the service’s goal is to be close to fielding an all-new family of aircraft , which could be either advanced helicopters or tilt-rotors, to replace existing choppers or all types across regular and special operations units. In the meantime, CAPEX will continue to feature the 160th and its existing fleet of iconic black helicopters.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 20, 2020",Missile Defense Agency Seeking A High-Flying Drone For “Airborne Laser 2.0”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was one of the most awesome failures of the 2000s. The giant 747-400-based YAL-1 Airborne Laser sure looked the part of a future weapon system, but in the end it was a miserable and money chugging failure. In all, the program took a decade and half—add another decade more if you count earlier test platforms—and over $5 billion to develop, with very little readily applicable war fighting capability to show for it. By the time the jet was retired in 2011, it could indeed shoot down ballistic missiles during their boost phase, but at far too short of ranges and under too narrow of conditions to make the system combat effective. But now the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) wants a second go at the concept—this time leveraging recent and undeniably major advances in solid-state laser technology and unmanned aircraft systems that could very well see the concept finally come of age. The YAL-1 used a huge, complex, fuel-hungry chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) to do its missile murdering business. The size of a 747-400 was required to house the huge complex system and all its chemicals, and even then the YAL-1 could only provide about 20 full power shots on a single sortie. Operationally, there were issues as well. A fleet of AL-1s would have been extremely expensive to procure and operate. Especially when providing continuous coverage of an enemy area. Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, who was adamant about cancelling the YAL-1 program, said that a fleet 10 to 20 AL-1s, would cost a billion and a half dollars apiece, and each would demand $100 million a year to operate. Gates concluded before the budget axe fell on the program that “there’s nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept.” Even if such a AL-1 force was fielded, enemy countries could just move their ballistic missiles beyond the relatively short range of the AL-1’s laser. Also, it was pretty clear how to defeat such a system overall. Just shooting down the Airborne Laser before a surprise launch would negate its capability entirely, and a 747 flying continuous figure-eight patters along an enemy’s border is not a hard to target to acquire to say the least. As such, operational AL-1s would have required constant fighter coverage and electronic jamming and even suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) support. The whole concept was simply unrealistic, but using a flying laser of some type to solve the boost-phase intercept challenge still seemed like the only way to go. YAL-1, stripped of it engines and sensors, now sits idle at AMARG., Soracat/wikicommons Between the YAL-1’s short life and today there have been major leaps in directed energy. Much smaller and lighter solid-state laser technologies that use electricity instead of chemicals for energy are all the rage in the defense worlds. In fact, the strides made in the solid state laser space are so profound that arming not just ground vehicles , but combat aircraft, such as gunships , high-performance fighters and attack helicopters , with highly dynamic tactic laser systems are very much concepts under development and testing today. At the same time, unmanned aircraft technologies have continued to evolve, as have the optical and radar payloads they are capable of carrying over or near the battlefield. The high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) RQ-4 Global Hawk in particular has finally come into its own as an operational intelligence gathering system that can rival its manned competitor, the U-2 Dragon Lady. These two technologies, specifically HALE unmanned aircraft and solid state lasers, are what the Missile Defense Agency wants to combine into a Airborne Laser 2.0 of sorts—a networked system capable of loitering very high over or near enemy airspace, ready to knock down theatre ballistic missiles, and possibly even fast-flying ICBMs, during their most vulnerable phase of the flight. This of course is the missile’s boost phase, when it ascends at its lowest flying speeds atop a bright plume of hot gas. Using a HALE platform, based around a semi-autonomous concept of operations , would be much more affordable to fly for long periods than a quad-engined 747, and its magazine depth would only be limited by the amount of electricity it can generate. Also, it would operate roughly 20,000 feet higher than the YAL-1 could, giving it much longer lines-of-sight and lower beam distortion through a thinner atmosphere, but also the ability to fly above the vast majority of weather. This would also help its infrared tracking systems acquire its targets at greater range. In a business solicitation posted over at FedBizOpps.gov on June 13th, the Missile Defense Agency clearly defines the criteria for a test system they want to field in the near future based around this very concept. The posting reads: The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Advanced Technology Directorate is interested in industry’s capability to provide a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft in the 2023 timeframe.  A HALE aircraft with greater payload capacity is needed to carry a high energy laser system payload to high altitudes to mature Boost Phase Intercept (BPI).  The results of this RFI will inform future program options for maturing BPI technology and capability following the current Low Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) effort. Proposed aircraft should be able to maintain continuous positive ground control and are expected to operate from the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii and Edwards AFB in California.  Unmanned platforms are highly desired; however, manned concepts will be considered with appropriate justification. In parallel with ongoing BPI technology maturation and demonstration projects, BMDS capability requirements for an airborne high energy laser BPI capability are being developed.  Based on analysis to date, Paragraph 2.a below describes the ideal platform characteristics to enable robust BPI capability.  MDA is interested in far-term platform approaches to meet the full performance of Paragraph 2.a and mid-term solutions that demonstrate significant progress toward achieving these performance parameters.  Concepts that do not meet these parameters are requested to include future options for improving performance, where applicable. Under this BAA/RFI, multiple White Papers and/or proposals at differing levels of capability and/or risk are acceptable.  Contractors are encouraged to include information on alternate uses and potential commercialization for proposed aircraft designs along with potential Government and/or non-Government co-sponsors.  Areas such as cost, life-cycle affordability, and further commercialization will be important considerations in evaluating future concepts and for any forthcoming acquisitions. Performance Parameters • On-station altitude of greater than 63,000 ft • Flight endurance of greater than 36 hrs on-station (plus flight time for notional 3,000 km transit to station) • Flight cruise speed of less than Mach 0.45 at on-station altitude • Payload capacity of at least 5,000 lbs and as much as 12,500 lbs • Power available for the payload of at least 140 kW and as much as 280 kW for greater than 30 minutes with no loss in platform altitude • Support a 1 to 2 meter aperture optical payload • Low vibration at altitude: angular displacements of less than 50 µrad • Maintain continuous positive ground control At first glance, these requirements look most suited for the Q-4 Global Hawk, or more specifically an enhanced performance derivative of it. By using this aircraft, it would offer the MDA as close to an “off the shelf” and proven HALE solution as any. One that is also already in service—a fact that could help see such a capability turn from experimental to operational with minimal timelines and expenditure. RQ-4B is a large and proven HALE solution, although it may need to be enhanced to meet all the MDA’s requirements. , USAF There is also the possibility that a firm like Scaled Composites could offer an updated and unmanned aircraft based on their successful manned Proteus aircraft. Proteus worked as a testbed for many high-altitude sensors—including those found on the Global Hawk family of aircraft today. The company has scaled up the design multiple times, in one case drastically, for space-faring projects. On the other hand, in an operational form, a penetrating HALE capability would be ideal as it could allow for such a laser system to get closer to its potential targets during a time of conflict or heightened tensions. The Global Hawk’s Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program radar slung underneath Proteus. , DoD Lockheed has pushed the USAF on its unmanned “TR-X” HALE concept that has low observable features and uses many of U-2 Dragon Lady’s components. Originally this aircraft was to be an alternative option to unseat the RQ-4, and in doing so, keeping Lockheed’s lock on a mission set they have owned since the dawn of the jet age. But this same concept could be adapted to the Missile Defense Agency’s needs, and if the U-2 were to be retired in the coming decade, which is very possible, the MDA could likely obtain these surplus aircraft and transform them for their needs around a TR-X like configuration. Doing so could save money and lower risk compared to fielding a “clean sheet” design. TR-X concept art., Lockheed Skunk Works In the meantime, a single U-2S could be converted for the test initiative and the aircraft already has a superior altitude and payload hauling capability compared to the RQ-4. The Skunk Works has also already looked at making an optionally manned U-2 variant . This could act as a bridge between a test program’s optionally manned or unmanned U-2S and a full-on reconfigured TR-X like operational fleet down the road. Maybe most enticing, at least for an end-game platform solution, would be the USAF’s secretive HALE stealth flying wing aircraft dubbed the RQ-180. The existence of this Northrop Grumman aircraft, which is loosely akin to the high-flying strategic reconnaissance counterpart to the medium-altitude and far smaller, but also stealthy, tactical reconnaissance oriented RQ-170 Sentine l, has been all but outright confirmed by the USAF. It is likely in service today in very small numbers. The difference between it and all the other options discussed here is that its high degree of low observability, both on the radio and infrared spectrum, and its extreme operating altitudes, allow it to penetrate and loiter deep over enemy airspace while remaining undetected for long periods of time. Adapting such a platform for the MDA’s boost-phase intercept mission would be attractive as the system could make the best of today’s limited laser power and range by being able to get closer to its potential targets. It would also be able to provide far better area coverage than a standoff system that has to fly along a border. Additionally, fielding such a system on an RQ-180-like platform makes it far more survivable during a time of conflict and it could even be potentially used against enemy aircraft operating over their own territory. By all accounts, the RQ-180, or whatever its official name may be, is still a highly compartmentalized program, so the idea that the MDA would be able to integrate an experimental laser with it at this early stage is highly doubtful, unless this is also done under a cloak of secrecy. But eventually, migrating this type of capability to specifically this type of aerial asset is likely where the MDA’s laser technology will end up. Whatever the MDA ends up with for their HALE platform, it sounds like they are  on an exciting track to realizing it. Boost-phase intercept/kill has always been the “holy grail” of missile defense. Being able to shower your enemy with the remnants of their own ballistic missiles is a strong strategic deterrent. When mixed with existing midcourse intercept ( SM-3 and the ground-based missile defense interceptors ) and terminal intercept ( THAAD , Patriot PAC-3, SM-6) capabilities, it would complete an “end-to-end” series of missile defense layers that could be deployed regionally against rogue states. Such a system could be especially useful today, as it would provide a capability of knocking down Kim Jong Un’s test missiles before valuable flight test data can be gained, and even if the missiles are shot at steep trajectories over North Korea’s own territory. It could also allow for such an engagement to take place without actually firing any sort of projectile at the missile itself. So after many decades of development, it looks like the Airborne Laser concept may finally be coming of age. And don’t be surprised if these “Airborne Laser 2.0” drones become a constantly airborne fixture over the world’s most troublesome hotspots.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 13, 2019",Israel Is Testing An Air-To-Air Variant Of Its Dolphin-Nosed Stunner Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel is known to go its own way when it comes to its air combat capabilities. In the past, this has included making dramatic modifications to imported air warfare assets , and also developing its own unique weapons and sub-systems. The country’s guided munitions and missile development and manufacturing abilities are especially strong, and US assistance in the form of cross-corporate cooperation and foreign aid have allowed the Israeli defense industry to field extremely high-tech systems that are tailored to the country’s specific needs. One of these systems is the Stunner missile. The Stunner is the pointy-end of Israel’s David’s Sling air defense system , which just went operational last April . Designed by both Israel’s Rafael and America’s Raytheon, David’s Sling makes up the center layer of the multilayered pie that is Israel’s complex integrated air defense system. It sits above the Iron Dome anti-rocket and artillery system, and below the Arrow ballistic missile defense system , and overlaps in capability with older Patriot missile batteries which it is intends to replace. It can be used to shoot down short-range ballistic missiles, aircraft, drones, cruise missiles and large artillery rockets. Stunner interceptor and booster, Rafael The missile is very fast, operating at hypersonic speeds as high as mach 7.5, and covers long ranges, up to about 175 miles depending on the engagement dynamics. But this is when the Stunnder is configured as a surface-to-air missile, where it uses a large booster to get it to altitude and high speed. An air-to-air version would not have the benefit of an ungainly booster, but it will benefit at launch from an aircraft’s speed and altitude. Stunner has a three-pulse motor that outputs different thrust levels during different portions of its flight profile. In particular, it provides added acceleration and maneuverability during the missile’s terminal attack phase. The Stunner carries no warhead, instead it is a hit-to-kill system, so the missile can be built more compact and lighter, and more of its internal space can be used for fuel than a traditional anti-air missile that carries a heavy blast fragmentation warhead. Above all else, the Stunner is unique because of its guidance system. The missile uses three major sensors to guide it toward its target and to pulverize it. A data-link provides the missile with mid-course updates so that it can come within range of activating its novel dual-mode seeker. The missile has a unique, canted “dolphin nose,” which came to be as the result of the demands of fitting both an electro-optical/imaging infrared sensor and a active radar sensor in the compact nose section of the missile. The combination of these sensors make the Stunner extremely deadly and unsusceptible to jamming and countermeasures. If the radar sensor is jammed, the missile’s optical seeker can continue to guide it during its terminal phase of an attack. If active countermeasures attempt to confuse the missile’s optical seeker, the radar seeker will still remain locked onto the target. Basically the configuration offers a higher kill probability and better target discrimination than its single seeker progenitors, and its imaging infrared seeker can likely be programmed to recognize and hit specific parts of a target , like where a fighter is most vulnerable, or to impact a rocket’s warhead section and so on. In comparison, nearly all modern western medium and long-range air-to-air missiles use a data-link and active radar homing alone. You can read all about the latest in western air-to-air missile capabilities in this past feature linked here. There has been talk that Stunner might be migrated from the ground to the air, and could be a far more capable successor to the Derby air-to-air missile, as well as possibly challenging the AIM-120 AMRAAM for longer-range engagements. Adapting SAMs into other forms of missiles, and visa-versa, is nothing new. Today the US Capital is guarded by an internationalized ground-based version of the AIM-120 AMRAAM, known as the Norwegian (or Networked) Advanced Surface to Air Missile System, or NASAMS for short. The FIM-92 Stinger shoulder-fired SAM has been adapted to arm helicopters with a light-weight and short-range air-to-air missile. The AIM-9 Sidewinder was used for the MIM-72 Chaparral SAM system , and the RIM-66 Standard missile airframe was adapted to become the AGM-78 air-launched anti-radiation missile . And these are just a few examples. F-105 with a AGM-78 and AGM-45 under its wing heading out for a Iron Hand mission over Vietnam., USAF Considering its speed, maneuverability, seekers, and hit-to-kill configuration, it sounds like the Stunner would be a near ideal missile for modern air-to-air warfare. One thing that comes to mind is that an air-to-air Stunner could be especially useful for the IAF’s F-35I fleet. Modifications to the F-35’s internal weapons mounts could allow for more than four Stunners to be carried internally at one time, as is currently the case for the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The Stunner is a slimmer, smaller missile overall than the AIM-120. As such it may be possible to field six or eight of these missile inside the F-35I’s weapons bays, giving the jet a substantial counter-air capability increase. A mix of two AIM-120s and four or six Stunners may actually be the optimal loadout if modifications to the F-35’s internal racks can be made. Israel already plans to make significant modifications to their F-35Is , and they also intend to outfit the fleet with indigenous air-to-ground weapons, so integrating the Stunner onto the new jet seems like it would be a highly logical move. Stunner is already a fully networked missile design, with lock-on-after launch capability even for short-range engagements—a capability that is necessary for deployment from the F-35’s internal weapons stations. Expanding the F-35’s air-to-air magazine has been long a sticking point with customers for the jet, and there are some other notional solutions being floated, like Lockheed’s Cuda , but that missile is likely shorter-ranged and will not have the dual-mode seeker or blistering speed that the Stunner has. F-35I, IAF Turning Stunner into an air-to-air missile for the IAF could also lead to export sales to other F-35 users. Even those air arms who don’t operate the F-35 could have a high interest in the Stunner’s unique capabilities, and there isn’t another western missile that currently includes a data-link and both an imaging infrared and radar seeker together on the missile at the same time, not to mention some of the missile’s other unique selling points. What remains an unknown is what type of range the air-to-air Stunner would possess. But even if it can achieve only intermediate-to medium ranges, that is still enough to make it an attractive new option for air arms around the world, and especially for stealthy fighters that can get in closer to enemy aircraft before attacking compared to their more vulnerable 4th generation counterparts. Now as tests proceed, we’ll just have to wait and see if the Stunner can truly stun the air combat universe.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 14, 2017",The Future of Naval Warfare Will Have a Lot More Spy Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the threat of advanced air and coastal defense networks increases, especially with regards to the rapid spread of long-range and fast-flying surface-to-air and anti-ship cruise missiles, the innate intelligence collecting qualities of submarines are likely to become even more important. At least one defense company seems poised to capitalize on this potential trend. German firm PLATH , which builds radio direction finding gear and communications intelligence (COMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) equipment, has been steadily working to expand its product line to include systems intended for subs. In an interview with Shephard Media in May 2017, Torsten Düsing, who acts as both the company’s technical marketing manager and business case manager for naval solutions, specifically highlighted the spying potential of underwater vessels. PLATH’s particular system, which it unveiled in November 2016, “provides tactically relevant information with minimal mast exposure, listening for communications signals from [anti-submarine warfare] aircraft” when the boat is in danger, Düsing explained. “When not under ASW threat, the task involves building operational intelligence and fundamental knowledge by collecting, recording and direction finding signals.” Effectively the equipment performs an important defensive electronic counter-measures function, helping crew hide the submarine from enemy forces, as well as acting as a general intelligence gathering tool. PLATH’s complete system includes software package to analyze the signals the sensors receive. It can use the information to map out “emitters” such as radio transmitters, radars, or other electronic systems to give the sailors a better understanding of their surroundings and potential threats. Garnering this electronic order of battle on the fly could also be valuable for building a broad picture of an enemy coastline in preparation for larger operations or for gathering strategic intelligence, such as flight data telemetry from missile tests. The sail of the USS Annapolis pokes through the ice during an exercise in 2009. One of the masts may have the Radiant Gemstone antenna., USN “The geographic focus is on urbanized littorals in crisis regions, harbors, shipping routes and military test, training and maneuver areas,” Düsing noted. “The need to establish a line of sight to adversary tactical [very high frequency] sources between 30 and 88 MHz and at the lower end of the [ultra high frequency] band means that only submarines can get close enough.” Of course, depending on the relative strength of the equipment, this need for a “line of sight” to the target could be a serious issue, even for a submarine. In addition, while PLATH’s system can start to work below the surface, but only actually begins to scan and collect information when the boat reaches periscope depth and raises its appropriate antennas, according to Shephard . The system’s relatively small size – at least according to the German defense contractor – and ability to use existing antennas already on a sub might make up for these limitations. Combining the gear with underwater drones or sub-launched unmanned aerial vehicles, either as antennas, signal relays, or both, could help extend its overall range. Regardless, Düsing isn’t wrong about navies recognizing the value of having such equipment on submarines, as well as their inherent abilities to sneak in and out of sensitive areas without detection. The basic idea of a radio direction finding and SIGINT kit for sub-surface vessels is probably old news to many larger naval forces around the world. The United States in particular is a pretty prolific operator of spy subs, even if it hasn’t officially acknowledged it as of yet. USS Jimmy Carter., USN As of 2017, the U.S. Navy had at least one dedicated spy submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter , also known as SSN-23. The third and last Seawolf -class nuclear attack submarine, SSN-23 has a unique 100-foot-long, 2,500-ton “Multi-Mission Platform” addition to its hull, as well as small, auxiliary devices for precision maneuvering.  The boat is so secretive that an annual history of the ship’s goings on during 2013, which the author obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, only described its main activity as “ Mission 7 .” But this duty was important enough to earn the sub a Presidential Unit Citation, which rewards “extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy.” Though the service is especially tight-lipped about Jimmy Carter and what she does when she goes out to sea, it has publicly acknowledged that this section can house underwater drones, SEAL special operations divers, and more. It is widely believed this section contained equipment necessary to tap undersea communications cables, a mission that other spy subs, such as the USS Parche , reportedly performed during the Cold War. An official schematic of the unique modifications to USS Jimmy Carter., USN But the Navy has also given other submarines SIGINT gear that seems much more in line with what PLATH is now offering. In 2015, Phase Zero, a now defunct section of Gawker Media, published a detailed breakdown of how the National Security Agency (NSA) employed Los Angeles -class nuclear attack submarines to scoop up cell phone signals and other communications chatter, based on documents obtained via former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. Like the equipment Düsing described to Shephard Media, these modified boats could use their new gear to both track signals for intelligence purposes or spot incoming threats, according to a separate briefing that Phase Zero located from Pennsylvania State University Applied Research Laboratory. After receiving the data via satellite, NSA would run it all through a software fusion program codenamed BLINDDATE. As of 2008, at least two Los Angeles boats, the USS Annapolis and USS Montpelier , had the requisite antennas and collection gear, which the Navy nicknamed Radiant Gemstone. A cursory Google Search turns up Navy budget requests for additional Radiant Gemstone equipment in 2009 and 2010, as well as information on an associated naval data link and fusion system called Radiant Mercury (RADMERC). “The RADMERC program facilitates sharing of critical information across security domains and among allied, coalition and inter-agency partners,” according to an official list of the Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command’s (SPAWAR) programs. “The Radiant Mercury product provides cross-domain information sharing capabilities from Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) to General Service (GENSER) and GENSER to Unclassified.” Penn State University via Phase Zero The Russians have had a number of spy submarines similar to the Jimmy Carter , including the shadowy Project 10831 Losharik , but there is little publicly available information on their exact designs and capabilities. Given Russia’s fondness for electronic warfare , it seems likely that the Kremlin’s more conventional submarines have at least some system that can perform basic electronic intelligence functions. As of May 2017, Moscow had reportedly ordered work on a new, massive “research” submarine . If PLATH’s system is as small and easy to install as they claim, it’s entirely possible that other navies with advanced submarine forces, such as China , Israel , Japan , South Korea , Sweden , and the United Kingdom , already have similar equipment. However, the company’s add-on kit, or something close to it, would be ideal for smaller navies on tighter budgets. It could readily turn even older or compact submarines into covert spies, giving them renewed life and making them able to spy on ports or other coastal points of interest that might be otherwise off limits to those countries. Beyond submarines of some description, the only other way to get a line-of-sight SIGINT setup into these sensitive regions without immediate detection would be with an advanced, high-flying or stealthy spy plane or drone . Few countries have the resources to operate those kind of systems. The Russian Oscar -class submarine Orel ., Andrei Luzik via Wikimedia Of course, if submarine spies become any more common, it’s equally likely that military forces around the world will simply respond by developing even more new and improved anti-submarine defenses. China is already reportedly building an underwater sensor network that might be able to detect underwater craft trying move discreetly through the contested South China Sea and East Seas. In turn, navies are working on quieter and otherwise stealthier submarines . It’s a long-standing game of undersea cat-and-mouse. What seems clear, both from PLATH’s new developments and existing systems, is that the submarine as an intelligence tool is an idea that can only gain more traction as time goes on, even with smaller navies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 7, 2020",Here’s How Hypersonic Weapons Could Completely Change the Face of Warfare,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Imagine an enemy deciding to attack from 1,000 miles away. Now, imagine you have less than 15 minutes to react and may not even see their missile coming in the first place. This is the potential threat posed by so-called “hypersonic weapons,” which can fly as fast as a mile a second and low enough to evade many existing defenses. Though there is much attention given to the expanding threat of ballistic missiles, especially from countries such as Iran and North Korea, American military officials are increasingly concerned about hypersonic weapons. Though the basic concept isn’t by any means new, technological advancements have made the notion of gliders and air-breathing vehicles flying at Mach 5 or faster significantly viable, with the United States, Russia, and China all actively experimenting with such designs. “Hypersonic glide vehicles are threats both Russia and China are building now,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, in charge of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told American lawmakers at a recent hearing, according to The Washington Examiner . “They are very, very significant in terms of our ability to see them and provide warning.” To put things in comparison, a hypersonic missile flying at between five and 10 times the speed of sound is fast, but still just on par, if not slower than many ballistic missiles. Though missile powers are understandably tight lipped about what their intercontinental ballistic missiles can do, it is widely accepted that they can reach a point of impact more than 6,000 miles away in between 30 to 35 minutes. This equates to approximately three miles per second. A Ground-based Mid-course Defense (GMD) interceptor blasts off during a test in May 2017., MDA But these weapons have predictable signatures and flight trajectories. As the name suggests, these missiles largely follow a ballistic arc, boosting very high up before falling back down on their target. The United States has a constellation of powerful early warning satellites, including the modern Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), which look for the tell-tale signs of one of these rockets blasting off from a launch pad or silo. Their sensors may even be sensitive enough to detect and track much smaller rocket-powered munitions, like large artillery rockets and surface-to-air missiles. In addition, the relatively uniform flight means that the Pentagon has been able to develop interceptors that, at least in theory , should be able to knock out these missiles during their mid-course and terminal phases of their flight—as they fly toward their target, or as they come screaming back to earth. On May 30, 2017, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) tested its Ground-based Mid-course Defense (GMD) defense system against a surrogate for the very first time. Though there are still questions about the exact structure of the test, U.S. officials said it successfully demonstrated this portion of America’s ballistic missile defense infrastructure. A hypersonic weapon, able to carry a nuclear or a conventional warhead could upend this calculus entirely. The most common design involves a booster of some sort, often a rocket motor, which gets the craft going fast enough for an air-breathing high-speed jet engine to take over. Once at its cruising speed, these powerplants becomes highly efficient. But more importantly, this air-breathing engine generates a very different signature from a rocket motor, meaning space-based surveillance assets might not be able to spot one as quickly or keep tracking it during flight, or even spot it at all for that matter. On top of that, prototype designs look much more like super-fast flying cruise missiles or drones, able to fly in more erratic ways well within the atmosphere, maybe even changing course in mid-flight relatively rapidly. This could make any such weapon more accurate, since it could make more corrections before impact, as well. A projectile flying at a mile a second would be too much to process in general for even the most fast-scanning surface- and airborne radars that exist at present, and even if they could be tracked, engaging something going that speed within the atmosphere represents a huge set of problems of its own. A B-52H bomber carrying the experimental X-51 Waverider experimental vehicle., USAF All of these features have made the concept attractive within the Pentagon, as potential opponents field increasingly more powerful radars, surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles, and other weapons that could deny existing, more conventional American military forces from getting close to their objective in the first place. The U.S. military has collectively dubbed these threats as “Anti-Access/Area Denial,” or A2AD. Hypersonic weapons could be the key to breaking through these protective layers, including knocking down an enemy’s integrated air defense system (IADS) , during a crisis, maintaining America’s ability to hold its enemies under threat. A hypersonic system would have significant benefits in a time-sensitive strike scenario, whether it be taking out a terrorist at a particular location or quickly knocking out vital enemy weapons or installations during a larger conflict. The immense speed of one of these craft could dramatically shrink the time it takes to go from first identifying any target to actually hitting it with a weapon, which in turns gives opponents significantly less time to notice they’ve been spotted and attempt to reposition, get into cover, or otherwise improve their defenses. The U.S. military has long been interested in the idea of conducting short- or no-notice strikes, initially as a method of ensuring the country maintained a credible deterrent even in the event of a sneak attack. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Pentagon became even more interested in the concept of “prompt global strike” to respond conventionally with relatively little risk to so-called “rogue” states that might have weapons of mass destruction, such as Iran and North Korea, and the ability to deliver them across appreciably long distances. “Air speed makes them much more survivable and hard to shoot down,” Geoffrey Zacharias, who holds the title of Air Force Chief Scientist, told Scout Warrior in May 2017. “You are going roughly a mile a second so if you put in 1,000 seconds of fuel you can go 1,000 miles – so that gives you lots of standoff capability.” This means that in addition to defeating defenses and being able to hit targets promptly, hypersonics could potentially give new life to legacy launch platforms. Since crews can launch the weapons well away from dangerous areas, the aircraft or ship carrying the weapons may not need the latest protective features, like a low-observable design. In a series of flight tests between 2010 and 2013, the U.S. Air Force launched Boeing’s X-51 Waverider experimental hypersonic aircraft from a decidedly dated and non-stealthy B-52H bomber. Other experiments with an unpowered glider , known variously as the Hypersonic Test Vehicle (HTV) or Falcon, used a convention rocket to boost the craft to an appropriate speed and altitude. The speed and range also opens up the possibility for reusable spy drones or other manned or unmanned aircraft. Any design that can travel 1,000 miles in as many seconds can go 500 miles and back in the same amount of time, taking conventional pictures, scanning target areas with radar, or maybe even dropping bombs or firing missiles of its own. In 2016, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) was studying the potential of U.K.-based Reaction Engines Ltd’s Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE) as a way of powering a “mothership” that could carry a variety of payloads, possibly including air-to-ground munitions. In May 2017, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hired Boeing to build what will likely be a solely rocket-powered hypersonic, reusable spacecraft, known as the XS-1. The Pentagon wants to test this design as a way of rapidly putting satellites into orbit, with an eye toward other roles in the future. The U.S. military’s goal is a space plane that can fly 10 missions in as many days while carrying a 3,000 pound load. There’s nothing to say this couldn’t potentially be sensors or weapons rather than more benign objects. Though widely dismissed by experts, one of the more persistent conspiracy theories about the existing super-secretive X-37B space plane is that it is a test bed of sorts for an orbital space bomber. Still, there isn’t anything to say that the XS-1, or more likely a production craft that springs from it, couldn’t be used for deploying suborbital hypersonic payloads, possibly on short notice. An artist’s conception of the proposed SR-72., Lockheed Martin There’s already publicly known work on hypersonic spy plane. In 2013, Aviation Week and Space Technology ’s Guy Norris had first reported the existence of a Lockheed Martin proposal that the company referred to as the SR-72 – a reference to the aircraft being a successor to its legendary SR-71 Blackbird . Later reports suggested the design, which came from Lockheed’s equally legendary Skunk Works advanced projects office, would use a combination of a traditional turbine engine and a dual-mode ramjet, dubbed a “combine cycle engine,” to get up to speeds of at least Mach 6. Lockheed Martin’s CEO Marillyn Hewson stated the following about the status of their combined cycle engine technology:  “Most importantly, we’re proving a hypersonic aircraft can be produced at an affordable price. We estimate it will cost less than $1 billion to develop, build and fly a demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22.” On June 5, 2017, Norris reported that Skunk Works head Rob Weiss had declared hypersonic technology “mature” in comments at the 2017 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum in Denver, Colorado. The only problem is that if that’s true for the United States it’s also true for any potential opponents. “I’m concerned about Chinese and Russian hypersonic weapons development, and I expressed those concerns in the right places,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, told American legislators in May 2017. “What we can do is to develop our own hypersonic weapons and improve our defenses against theirs.” An artist’s rendering of the DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle., Via Wikimedia Harris is right to be concerned. A study the Air Force published earlier that month confirmed what many observers already knew, that Russian and Chinese engineers were moving ahead with their own hypersonic research, threatening to overtake U.S. efforts. Between January 2014 and April 2016, China conducted six flight tests of its own DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle . Though unpowered, like the American Falcon, the prototype was still seen as a serious development that could challenge or defeat ballistic missile defenses in the United States or its Pacific allies such as Japan and South Korea. There were also concerns that it could easily defeat the layered defenses of a U.S. carrier battle group. The same concern exists with regards to Russia’s shadowy 3M22 Zircon hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile. At a claimed speed of Mach five and with a range of approximately 250 miles, American warships might have less than 5 minutes to react with weapons or other countermeasures, and they might simply be too slow or technological incapable of intercepting the incoming weapon. If the enemy missile is flying low over the water, and the ships are relying on surface-based radar alone, they could have just a handful of seconds to react. On June 3, 2017, multiple reports, citing Russian state media, said that the Kremlin’s forces had tested a 3M22 prototype a year ahead of schedule . “These weapons present an entirely new capability we must counter as they are specifically designed to exploit the gaps and the seams in our existing missile defense architecture, thus defeating the systems we currently have in place,” Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican said in March 2017. “These new weapons are capable of traveling more than a mile per second and fly at flat or non-ballistic trajectories to prevent our missile defense systems from tracking them.” A low quality image purportedly of a flight test of the 3M22 Zircon., KRSK.kp.ru via Wikimedia With the results of things like the Air Force study in May 2017, the Pentagon is well aware of the potential threat and is looking to take concrete steps toward mitigating it. In its budget request for the 2018 fiscal year, the U.S. military included just over $75 million for what it called “hypersonic defense” within the larger pool of money for MDA. But this relatively small amount of funding only covers “completion of a Defense against Hypersonic Threats [analysis of alternatives], capability roadmap development, and initial investment in sensor technology demonstrations and weapon concepts to address the advanced threat,” according to the official budget description . “MDA will leverage existing sensors and ground infrastructure/Command and Control to quickly demonstrate and deploy a three-phase limited contingency capability to provide realtime warning over the majority of the hypersonic threat profile by 2019.” In short, it’s mainly a plan to begin crafting a plan and that may not be enough. In the end it could cost many tens of billions of dollars to craft new defenses that are uniquely capable at countering the threat posed by hypersonic weapons, and these solutions would have to be integrated into ships and bases around the globe. “We must push the boundaries of technology in every area,” Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in May 2017. “Our adversaries aren’t standing still. They are looking for every advantage they can get.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air-Launched Hypersonic Missiles Land Land-Based Conventional Hypersonic Weapons Nuclear"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",America’s Electronic Attackers May Have a Secret Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that the American-led coalition fighting ISIS have made good use of electronic warfare, scrambling terrorists’ communications and potentially neutralizing their improvised explosive devices (IED). An official U.S. military guide on the subject suggests electronic attackers in Iraq, Syria, and beyond may have another, secret mission. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has a regulation covering electronic warfare that outlines basic policies, capabilities, and responsibilities for forces performing the role throughout its so-called “area of responsibility,” which stretches from Egypt through the Middle East and into Central Asia. Though many sections talk in general terms, using established Pentagon-wide definitions, the document includes notes specifically for the Command’s staff and the units they oversee, including functions labeled as either confidential or secret. The War Zone obtained a partial and still heavily redacted copy of the record, officially known as USCENTCOM Regulation 525-18, Electronic Warfare, dated 2012, via the Freedom of Information Act. The document’s overall classification is secret and American officials can only release its full contents to anyone besides other U.S. units, or relevant authorities from Australia, Canada, or Great Britain – a grouping commonly known by the acronym ACGU or the nickname “Four Eyes.” “Effective EW [electronic warfare] operations will benefit USCENTCOM operations by,” one section begins, before listing eight specific mission profiles. The seven unclassified ones are not surprising, including tasks such as disrupting enemy command and control networks and knocking out hostile air defenses. There is also mention of protecting friendly forces, which could involve jamming a remote control for an IED or helping spot an ambush, as well as intelligence gathering as important roles for electronic warfare forces. CENTCOM via FOIA But the third “benefit” is marked secret. CENTCOM’s censors scrubbed the entire entry, citing national security , specifically information that might negatively impact American “military plans, weapons systems, or operations.” There are no obvious contextual clues as to what this activity or activities might be, especially given what isn’t redacted. On the other hand, we know a lot about what it’s not. An EC-130H Compass Call starts its engines in preparation for a mission against ISIS., USAF In addition to established tactics such as the suppression of enemy air defenses, the regulation describes less well known electronic warfare missions such as “ navigation warfare ,” whereby jammers on the ground or in the air would attack an opponent’s ability to use GPS or other electronic navigational aids, as well as “ information operations ,” which could include jobs such as breaking up propaganda broadcasts or injecting friendly messaging on the airwaves. On the latter front, the Pennsylvania Air National Guard does operate a small number of unique EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft, which can act as flying radio and television stations. There are even descriptions of how CENTCOM might use electronic warfare techniques in space, cyberspace, and with regards to directed energy weapons . CENTCOM via FOIA Electronic attack “may be used to deny an adversary freedom of action in space by preventing the [command and control] of space assets or by preventing or negating the ability to use space systems and services for purposes hostile to the U.S.,” one section of the regulation explains. “Cyberspace operations may be used to force an adversary from wired to wireless networks that are vulnerable” to electronic attack, another passage notes. The basic definition of directed energy warfare is “military action involving the use of [directed energy] weapons, devices, and countermeasures to incapacitate, cause direct damage or destruction of adversary equipment, facilities, and/or personnel or to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the [electromagnetic spectrum] through damage, destruction, and disruption,” according to the guide. CENTCOM via FOIA So, if the classified electronic warfare mission is none of the above, then what is it? One possibility is that this could involve distributed attacks on computer systems that run air defense networks, communications systems, or equipment that performs other sensitive military functions. BAE Systems is known to have already developed and produced a shadowy computer program called Suter that could do all this and possibly more, from turning radars in the wrong direction to just crashing air defense network-related software altogether. This might not be useful against a low-tech opponent like ISIS, but could give American forces a critical edge against an opponent with more established defensive networks, such as Iran or Syria. There is an entire separate section in the regulation that is also marked confidential and redacted in its entirety for the same national security reasons. It is possible this portion contains details on these functions. Regardless, the unclassified types of missions mentioned in the document have already been particularly important against ISIS, which has increasingly turned to IEDs and guerrilla tactics in the face of overwhelming American firepower. As Iraqi and Kurdish forces pushed into cities such as Ramadi and Mosul, it became apparent that the terrorists had rigged up entire houses to explode and set up other obstacles to hinder the offensives. American electronic warfare assets hampered the terrorists’ ability to respond to new developments on the ground, coordinate among themselves, and set off deadly boobytraps. “We are inducing massive confusion and friction into their operations,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Josh Koslov, head of the 43rd Expeditionary Electronic Attack Squadron, part of the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, told the service’s reporters in 2016. “If you can’t talk, you can’t fight.” On June 6, 2017, the Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Arab and Kurdish rebels , began the long awaited offensive into Raqqa, ISIS’ de facto capital in Syria. It seems reasonable to assume that electronic warfare will be just as critical to this operation as the other efforts to liberate major cities in Iraq and Syria from the terrorist group. The U.S. military has a variety of aerial and ground-based systems that can perform these missions. The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps all have jamming planes, such as the EC-130H Compass Call and EA-18G Growler . The Marines has almost completely phased out the older EA-6B Prowler electronic attackers , but has continued to send them to bases in Kuwait and Turkey to fight ISIS in the meantime.  The Navy and Marines are also fielding a podded electronic warfare system known as Intrepid Tiger II , which could give similar, if reduced capabilities to other types of aircraft including KC-130J Harvest Hawk gunships, MV-22B tilt-rotor transports, and ground attack and fighter aircraft such as the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. “We’re here to jam signals and blow stuff up, I guess,” a member of Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron Three (VMAQ-3) proudly told the American Forces Network in May 2017. At that time, the unit and its EA-6Bs were deployed to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, technically part of U.S. European Command, but were flying missions from there against ISIS for CENTCOM. A U.S. Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler in action against ISIS., USAF On the ground, U.S. Army and Marine units have access to both vehicle and man-portable electronic warfare and signal-snooping equipment that can also be essential for both protecting against roadside bombs or locating enemy forces before they attack. For years now, localized jamming systems have been standard on many American vehicles in hotspots like Afghanistan and Iraq where there is a pervasive danger of IEDs. On top of these more traditional electronic warfare tools, there have been multiple reports that the coalition’s has been looking at new ways to strike ISIS indirectly electronically, including through cyber warfare. “We are dropping cyber bombs,” Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work said in April 2016 . “I’ve got to tell you right now it sucks to be ISIL,” he added, using another acronym for the brutal terrorist group. In May 2017, Defense One reported that the Pentagon tasked its brand new Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team with helping hunt ISIS by finding ways to put machine learning and other technology to use in sifting through intelligence data. It seems reasonable to assume that the same systems could potentially be turned around to exploit information from electronic warfare systems, or maybe even coordinate cyber attacks. So, the seven unclassified functions, combined with these previous reports, make it clear that electronic warfare has already been vital in the fight against ISIS. But America’s electronic warriors may be able to take it one step further in the fight against the terrorists or any other potential opponents in the Middle East.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 5, 2021",What’s The Deal With Lockheed’s Gabbing About The Secretive Hypersonic SR-72?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a followup to his widely distributed 2013 piece about Lockheed Skunk Works’s “SR-72” hypersonic plane concept, Guy Norris puts some interesting new quotes into print from a top exec at the legendary “bleeding-edge” aerospace weapons development firm. Rob Weiss, Lockheed Martin’s executive vice president and general manager for Advanced Development Programs told Norris the following recently: “We’ve been saying hypersonics is two years away for the last 20 years, but all I can say is the technology is mature and we, along with DARPA and the services, are working hard to get that capability into the hands of our warfighters as soon as possible… I can’t give you any timelines or any specifics on the capabilities. It is all very sensitive. Some of our adversaries are moving along these lines pretty quickly and it is important we stay quiet about what is going on. We can acknowledge the general capability that’s out there, but any program specifics are off limits.” What Weiss is referring to as far as enemy capabilities currently in development are thoroughly described in The War Zone’s recent feature on hypersonic weapons. Basically both Russia and China are actively pursuing hypersonic capabilities to varying degrees, and some argue America is falling behind both in fielding our own similar systems and defending against the enemy’s emerging capabilties. Weiss’s comments, and ones made earlier by Lockheed’s CEO Marillyn Hewson, have pointed toward the next step in the SR-72’s development being integrating the “combined cycle” engine and other technologies associated with hypersonic flight into a flying technology demonstrator roughly the size of an F-22. Such an endeavor would be “affordable” according to Hewson, carrying less than a one billion dollar price tag. Lockheed Martin All things considered, we are, and have been hearing a tremendous amount of information about what is clearly a highly classified program, coming from the contractor directly no less. This is highly peculiar. And parts of this technology have been in the works for decades. The “combined cycle” propulsion system capable of taking an aircraft from sitting on the runway well through mach five has been in development since at least the mid 2000s by Lockheed and its partner on the project Aerojet Rocketdyne. Additionally, past hypersonic vehicle tests by the USAF have also garnered valuable insights into this extreme flight environment, and there are likely many other major breakthroughs gained over the years from programs we know nothing about. So why are we getting bread crumb trails dropped to Aviation Week periodically as to the maturity of the technology and the program? Doing so seems like a very strange move considering we don’t even hear a peep about far less exotic technological developments—like the existence of advanced unmanned combat air vehicles for instance. I would posit that it is very possible the Skunk Works and its USAF partners are actually farther along in the SR-72’s development than they let on. Possibly even past the point of a small demonstrator, and already fielding a full-size prototype, or even an operational capability. In other words, what we may be hearing about are post-dated echoes of the program’s past. The only other reason as to why Lockheed would be so willing to blabber about their hypersonic flying unicorn is that they need money from Uncle Sam to fund it. But that seems unlikely as it is highly doubtful the company has funded the concept’s development for over a decade on its own, beyond a relatively small amount of money granted by NASA to explore the technology. In fact, Weiss says that Lockheed is not alone on the project in any way in his latest statement, noting that “DARPA and the services” are directly involved. Lockheed Martin None of this directly address the very valid question as to why the Pentagon even needs a super high-end hypersonic space plane in the first place? Certainly the service doesn’t need it for reconnaissance primarily—which also puts the whole “SR” moniker for the jet highly in doubt and likely a marketing tool more than anything else. Brad Leland, Lockheed’s program manager for Hypersonics makes the case for the jet on the company’s website, stating: “Hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour… Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater, similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today.” Regardless of whether an “SR-72” is a good investment or not, considering how competent Lockheed and their Air Force colleagues are at keeping secrets , the SR-72’s strange “gray world” existence makes little sense. And hey, something has to live in that huge new remote hangar at Area 51 right? Maybe that facility’s tenant is the aircraft being described still as a “paper concept” here today. In the end, I would suggest being open to taking SR-72 related news as more of an indication of what is, instead of what could be.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 15, 2020",Raven Rock Author Tells Us How Our Government Plans For Its Own Annihilation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone had a long discussion with Garrett Graff , the author of the fascinating new book, Raven Rock: The U.S. Government’s Secret Plan To Save Itself While The Rest Of Us Die . We talked about everything from secret bunkers to how nukes spawned that development of modern communications, and of course all about government after America as we know it has been turned to ashes. It was a lively, eye opening, and bizarre discussion to say the least—just as one should expect when discussing the fine details of America’s shadowy continuity of government plans. Starting in the mid 1940s, a change swept across America and the world that catalyzed the growth of a massive and unprecedented security apparatus. Can you explain a bit about what continuity government is and where it springs from? It’s the term of art for a whole series of plans that grew up over the course of the Cold War, beginning during the Truman years that focused on how nuclear war would unfold, who would be involved, and then what would happen to America in the hours, days and weeks afterwards. And these plans focused not just on, you know, the officials and how they would be evacuated, and where they would be evacuated, but also what parts of the US government would continue, and how the country would try to rebuild and reconstruct and sort of reconnect with whatever citizenry and whatever was left of the country after a nuclear war. DOE This came about after the first atomic bomb was dropped, and the onset of the realities of the atomic age. Before that, as you describe in your book, Truman could just walk across the street without a security detail. And then the atomic bomb became a reality, and things began to change. Really, this book is the story of an unfolding technology revolution, and how nuclear weapons reshaped and created the modern presidency. Because they did two things. First was the president and other government officials needed to be in command and control and communication at all times. You couldn’t have people lose touch for an hour or two, or even a day or two at a time. And that was a huge transition for the presidency, where in the 1800s and early 1900s you would have presidents take off from Washington for weeks or months at a time to travel around the country with very little command and control back in Washington. Then once nuclear weapons arrived and then got stronger and then more plentiful, you had the beginning of the idea that entire cities could be wiped off the face of the planet with just a few hours notice at first, and then, by the end of the Cold War, with just a few minutes notice. Truman’s VC-54C “Sacred Cow” airplane awaits at Washington National Airport in December of 1945. , National Archives Over the course of the Cold War, the U.S. government built a massive crescent of continuity of government facilities or sorts. These included elaborate communication sites, personnel bunkers, and command and control posts, ranging from southern Pennsylvania all the way to North Carolina. What are some of these shadowy facilities and how does Raven Rock, which is also the name of your book, fit into this invisible constellation of fortresses that dot America’s east. Raven Rock, the name of the book, comes from the government’s main bunker, just over the Pennsylvania state line, near Camp David. That was going to be the alternate Pentagon, the place where the US military would have relocated in the event of an attack, or the threat of an attack, on Washington. But Raven Rock, which is this enormous city within a mountain, could hold about five thousand people and is still in operation today, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It is just one of scores of these bunkers in relocation facilities scattered around, as you say, what was known as the “relocation arc,” this large stretch from Pennsylvania on down through Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and then even down into North Carolina. And it included lots of bunkers, but also some more unhardened nuclear relocation facilities. The state department set up its operations at a large farm. A beef cattle research farm in Virginia. And the US Information Agency built a massive radio transmitter facility down in North Carolina. The Supreme Court would have actually relocated to a mountain resort in Asheville, North Carolina, where they would’ve held court sessions in one of the reception halls. And the bunkers, there were more than a hundred of them at the peak, one for almost every key government agency, and one for almost every cabinet department, with the big ones at Raven Rock, and then Mount Weather, which is where the president and his cabinet officials would have gone. Mount Weather is also still in operation today. And then the Greenbrier in West Virginia, which is where congress would have gone to a bunker that was hidden under a luxury resort in White Sulphur Springs. We know some of these facilities still exist today, and that some of them don’t. Are there other ones that are out there that we still have no idea about, such as where they are or what they do? Absolutely. Many of these facilities were shut down in the wake of the Cold War, but many still exist in all corners of the country. FEMA runs all of these continuity government programs—many people don’t know that—and has a whole series of regional command bunkers around the country in places like Texas, Maryland, and Massachusetts. And then there are bunkers like NORAD, which was made famous by the movie War Games in the 1980s. That bunker was originally shut down in the early 2000s and has actually been re-opened and re-activated in recent years in order to combat the possibility of a cyber attack, or an attack by a rogue nation. FEMA’s Mount Weather facility. A small city lays deep below carved into large granite caverns. , FEMA Beyond the secret bunkers and Cold War intrigue , your book is really as much a story of about the development of modern communications as anything else. The ability to reliably communicate was probably more important than any other factor when it came to building a credible nuclear deterrent, and pursuing t he idea of continuity government. How did the nuclear age spawn great leaps in communications? This is part of what I found really fascinating in researching this book, is understanding how nuclear war, which obviously, at least yet, has never happened, in many ways created the modern world that we interact with on a daily basis. I mean, the Interstate Highway System was in many ways a creation of the Eisenhower era’s needs to try to ensure an easy evacuation from the center of urban areas, and the ability to speed war materiel around the country in the event of an attack. And then the internet itself grew out of the Pentagon’s desire to have a decentralized communication system that could survive a nuclear war. This sort of fundamental tool of modern life really grew out of doomsday planning. In fact, the very technology we use whenever we go online to book an airplane ticket through Kayak or Orbitz, actually is just a descendant of the original air defense system built to track Soviet bombers coming towards the United States. And every chat program that we use in daily life—from Slack to Facebook Messenger—is a descendant of the first chat program which was used to help these emergency bunkers communicate during a national crisis. Inside an EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft in 1979. For over 29 years, a Looking Glass aircraft was airborne at all times. Major revolutions in communications technology occurred out of a need to maintain command and control during and after a nuclear exchange.  , USAF Some of the continuity of government and civil defense plans you describe are totally bizarre, like harvesting pets for protein. What are some of the wildest parts of this type of planning you’ve found? Every government agency had its own post nuclear functions. The post office was in charge of registering the dead and figuring out who was still alive. The National Park Service would help run the refugee camps, because the thinking was the national parks wouldn’t have been targeted in a nuclear strike. When you begin to talk about how to preserve the US government, you ask this very existential question of W hat is American ? Are you trying to preserve the presidency? Are you trying to preserve the three branches of government? Or are you trying to preserve the historical totems and artifacts of our that sort of unite our country? The National Archives sat down and decided that they were going to save the Declaration of Independence before they save the Constitution. The Library of Congress sat down and decided that they were going to save the Gettysburg Address before they save the George Washington Military Commission. There was even a specially trained team of park rangers in Philadelphia whose job it was, during the Cold War, to evacuate The Liberty Bell in the event of a Soviet attack. And so this question about how do you save and preserve and restart America ends up being a deeply philosophical one, in addition to the very basic question of, you know, how do you actually just save and preserve the individual elected officials who lead the country? https://youtube.com/watch?v=lsHUIxt1iMw Is there a continuity of government scenario following a massive nuclear attack that won’t lead to some sort of dictatorship, even if it’s a temporary one? Part of what’s striking is the extent to which the people who really got involved in this planning, effectively said, during the Cold War—and even after 9/11—that to the extent that the US government actually implemented any of these plans, it would generally involve suspending normal peacetime civil liberties, and it would generally involve effectively declaring some form of martial law. There was the nuclear bomber age, where we had hours of warning before an attack. It seemed almost survivable as there was time to prepare, and even a credible air defense system in place to deal with some of those aircraft. Then we hit the advent of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and everything changed. How did continuity of government planning change once the ICBM came on the scene? In the early years, atomic war was something that seemed potentially survivable, that you would have a long warning time before bombers could arrive. The first atomic bombs were powerful, but not unthinkably powerful, and then they’re also just weren’t that many atomic bombs in the early years of the Cold War. Then all three of those things changed over the course of the Cold War, where you have ICBMs introduced, which cut that warning time down from about eight hours to 15 to 30 minutes. You have the arrival of thermonuclear bombs built to deliver unimaginable destruction on an urban area. And then just the sheer volume and plentifulness of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons reach a point where the idea of war was just insane, which is how you got to the eventual theory of mutually assured destruction. So over the course of that arc you see the US government’s hopes and dreams shift and shrink from being able to actually protect a large chunk of the civilian population, in the 1950s and early 1960s, until what you basically have show up later in the Cold War, when effectively the American people were going to be left totally on their own. And if we were lucky a small number of senior government officials were going to be able to evacuated to safety. An Atlas ICBM launch. , DoD Wouldn’t Congress and the Supreme Court be nearly irrelevant after a major nuclear attack? Yes, absolutely. You sort of saw these plans shrink over the course of the Cold War to something that I describe as basically trying to preserve the spirit of the Constitution, but not the letter of the Constitution. Congress really understood that it was going to be pretty irrelevant in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear war. And that the Supreme Court was going to be entirely irrelevant for months after a nuclear attack, and their plans to preserve and protect those officials sort of shrank away and even disappeared. And the modern incarnation of these plans, which are known as enduring a constitutional government, remain the most secret of all of the continuity of government plans in modern life. We don’t really know how they preserve or cease to preserve the three branch structure that we’re used to in peacetime. But what we’ve guessed based on publicly available information is they will probably provide super-empowered powers to a small group of congressional members—perhaps as few as two to four to eight of them—who are able to sort of serve as a “rump congress” until congress is actually able to reconstitute itself at some point in the future. The 1st Helicopter Squadron with their vintage Twin Hueys is one of a handful of special helicopter units tasked with scooping up key individuals and evacuating them to bunkers throughout the region. Whether or not these aircraft could actually get to any of these select power players before the nuclear warheads arrive is highly questionable, but a standby VH-3D or VH-60N from HMX-1 may be able to grab the President or the Vice President in time.  , USAF Some of our leaders were seemingly more realistic about what nuclear war would actually look like, and the results of it, than others. Eisenhower stated that after a nuclear exchange there wouldn’t be enough bulldozers to scrape the bodies off the streets. Now that’s a pretty eye opening statement. How did different Commanders In Chief generally look at continuity of government, and which do you think had the best handle on it? I think actually what’s interesting about this is the extent to which planning for doomsday, and planning for nuclear war, really shaped the way the presidents thought about nuclear war. And the extent to which you really saw officials at the top of government, including almost every president of the Cold War, go through these doomsday exercises—these nuclear war exercises aboard a nuclear doomsday airborne command post or in one of these bunkers, and conduct an evacuation drill and nuclear war exercises, and just how worrying those exercises were for the Commanders In Chief. You see it with Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter and Reagan. And for each of them, they really thought long and hard about nuclear war in the context of thinking through these doomsday plans. And I think that the exercise and that experience helped shape their decision making during some key Cold War crises—when they all took steps back from the precipice, rather than push forward into war. Ronald Reagan in the situation room. , National Archives Does it worry you that there are a lot of reports stating President Trump doesn’t seem very interested in details like this? This is reportedly the case across the full range of the government, and he has supposedly delegated decision making authority to the military on a fairly unprecedented level, at least in modern times. Yes. And I think that you have a president also who has made very troubling comments about his own appreciation of nuclear weapons, and the extent to which he would like to see nuclear weapons spread in the world. Which goes against decades of US policies to try and limit nuclear proliferation around the world. Does a more perceptually effective continuity of government plan, including elaborate infrastructure like massive bunkers, fleets of evacuation helicopters, and airborne command posts, where government officials, and even their families in certain cases, might be able to survive a nuclear change, make an exchange or getting involved in nuclear conflict more acceptable or attractive in any way? Well, I think we have seen that a lot of emphasis since 9/11, really since the 1990s, but definitely since 9/11, has been put on the idea of devolving control of the US government. Which is this idea that we may be less likely today to face an all out global thermonuclear war with Russia, that blankets the entire country, but that we are more at risk of today’s threats from a terrorist group or from a rogue state like Iran or North Korea. And these threats may manifest themselves in a surprise attack that wipes out a major US city like Washington DC. And then how do you devolve power within the US government to people who exist outside of Washington on a regular basis. And that’s one of the reasons that all of these bunkers are to this day fully staffed, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Like Raven Rock, and Mount Weather, and others around the country. SecDef Donald Rumsfeld aboard an E-4B National Airborne Operations Center in 2005. The aircraft, which were designed in the ’70s specifically as a survivable command and control platform for a doomsday scenario, now have other roles as well, including acting as a command post and communications relay system for FEMA during a national disaster and carrying the Secretary of Defense on trips abroad. The aging E-4B fleet was going to be retired under Rumsfeld without a replacement, but the plan was stopped and they have since received drastic upgrades., DoD That sounds more like planning based on a shadow government of sorts, or maybe a stand-in government as opposed to relying on traditional evacuation plans alone, correct? Yes. I mean that’s sort of a very exclusive part of this. Most Americans think that the president is just a person that we elect every four years. In the modern age, the presidency actually encompasses several hundred people where you have a line of succession. The vice president, speaker of the house, president pro tem of the senate, and then all of the cabinet officials. But then each of those cabinet officials also have their own line of succession of 12, 15, 20 people or more. And so when you sort of think about that emergency government that might emerge after an attack on Washington, you’re talking about a cadre of several hundred people who are all part of these lines of succession, and would be in line to be evacuated to different facilities depending on their rank, and would be stepping into these roles after after an attack. During Donald Trump’s inauguration, outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was the designated survivor that would assume the presidency if say Washington DC were nuked in a surprise attack. Shulkin was taken to a secure location and had a security detail assigned to him, as well as a military attaché carrying the dreaded “nuclear football” just in case. , AP After over a half century of planning and ungodly sums of money spent preparing for what comes after the country is basically destroyed, that massive apparatus failed miserably on 9/11. What went wrong that day and how did it change the way we plan for doomsday and other major disasters? 9/11 is the only time that most of these plans have ever been activated on any sort of large scale. They just fall apart entirely, and they fell apart for some predictable reasons. It turned out that Washington, DC had a lot of traffic, and that they were sort of gridlocked trying to get officials outside of Washington. And they fell apart because on any given day you have a lot of government officials traveling. And so you have a lot of senior government officials who were in different places doing different things and it was hard to track them down. And then what we also saw was the tension that had existed in continuity planning all along, which is you can’t generally keep someone safe and keep them in communication at the same time. So you have a lot of officials that were being evacuated, including the President of the United States, who was in Florida and was put aboard Air Force One and sent up into the sky, and were really struggling to stay in communication with anyone on the ground and to stay abreast of a rapidly unfolding situation. Vice President Dick Cheney and members of the Bush administration cabinet were relegated to hiding in the White House bunker on 9/11. The facility proved to be woefully inadequate for the job at hand, as were strategic communications on that terrible day. The White House bunker has since been totally revamped and expanded under a secretive project that saw large swathes of the White House lawn dug up for a long period of time. The White House bunker is not the Situation Room., AP We know that Air Force One has far better communications than it did on 9/11, and there have been upgrades to the Situation Room and the White House Bunker, and so on. Are there other much larger systemic changes that were made following 9/11 to improve America’s continuity of government plans and to fix the issues that were exposed by 9/11? Certainly some changes have been made. Communications today are vastly better than they were. You see a lot of improvement in the readiness and preparedness of places like Raven Rock, NORAD, and Mount Weather in terms of what they are capable of and how there is staff there on a daily basis. But at the same time, you know, part of the challenge with all of these plans is that as in any attack or in any war, you can make very, very detailed neat and clean looking plans on paper, but in reality they are going to unfold in chaotic ways that make it very hard to understand what might actually transpire. NORAD’s complex built into Cheyenne Mountain has 25 ton blast doors at its entrances. The site was reactivated in 2015 after a stint of being kept on standby.   , AP Your book describes such a massive and bewilderingly costly apparatus built up around the continuity of government concept. Is continuity of government planning really just a giant form of mental masturbation? Not even our most capable bunkers can sustain direct hits from thermonuclear weapons and it seem like all the planning would likely fail to hold up to the realities of a major nuclear exchange. One could argue that the whole idea has become a manifestation of the “self-licking ice cream cone” that is the defense-industrial complex more than anything else. I mean is this worth investing in at all? Certainly many of these plans would have never worked anywhere close to the way that one would expect them to on paper. But at the same time, you know, I think there is value in thinking through some of these questions. Because of just how awful any sort of large-scale attack is going to be, you want to make sure you have a plan, and as best a chance as you can have of ensuring that something is left to rebuild the country. Russia has its own form of continuity government plans . We saw them at work during a 2016 drill where tens of millions of people were involved. In Moscow alone, millions were put into shelters below the city. And generally the Russians seem to have adopted a different viewpoint on all this where saving the citizenry is a focal tenet of their doomsday planning. How are Russia’s plans different than America’s, and do they know something we don’t know? You know, this was sort of a hard thing to parse all through the Cold War—whether the Soviet Union actually had a better civil defense strategy than we did. You know that famous scene in Doctor Strangelove , where they’re debating and worrying and fretting over the possibility of “mineshaft gap?” Actually, the US government was afraid of a mineshaft gap during the Cold War. And that we were afraid of Russia’s civil defense ability. We were literally out there mapping abandoned mine shafts and caves around the country for possible fall-out shelters for the civilian population, and our government leaders. You wrote about how the US had terrible problems with their command and control computer systems during the Cold War. One of the scenarios you outlined was the fault of a bad 46 cent circuit that made NORAD think armageddon was on its way in the form of a barrage of Russian ICBMs. Considering we supposedly had some sort of computer edge over the Russians during that period of time, are you surprised that the Soviet Union didn’t have similar issues, and that those issues didn’t lead to a nuclear exchange of some sort? Yeah, and to me that was a very humbling part of researching the Cold War—going back and understanding just how miraculous it was that we escaped without major incident. Because there are plenty of times during the Cold War where war would have been the more likely, and perhaps even more politically expedient, option for leaders on both sides. You know, when Eisenhower left government, he said the thing that he was most proud of was keeping the peace, and that it didn’t just happen. And I think that one of the lessons, when you go back and you read these histories, and really understand the extent to which some of these scenarios could have spiraled out of control very quickly, you come to understand, just how lucky we are that we had such good leaders during the Cold War. SAC headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska ran on some ancient computer technology. Here you see the “big board” in all its glory. , US Library of Congress In Raven Rock, you touched frequently on some past elements of emergency planning that sound like the domain of the conspiracy theory crowd, but it was all too true. Primarily I am talking about concentration-like camps. For instance, you mention orders for citizens to be told to register at a local Walmart and to shelter there with thousands of other people—with plans that call for those people to sleep head-to-toe in unrealistically neat rows and that these facilities have far too few bathrooms to support such a plan in the first place. You also talk about the rounding up foreigners and the FBI being sent to go grab targeted individuals during a national emergency or nuclear attack situation. What do you think the continuity government plans today have in them that would probably be alarming for most people to hear? Well, I think that most of these plans still exist in some modern form. You know, we don’t really have any sense of what it means to have these continuity of government plans for the three branches of government in modern times. We don’t really know what role Congress would do after an attack. We don’t know if the Supreme Court would have any role whatsoever. And what I think almost everyone understands, is that after a nuclear attack, the President of the United States would be effectively a dictator for some period of time, until we were able to restore something that was a kin to the constitution that we normally expect. You wrote about how it was a common occurrence during high-level nuclear exercises that the guy playing the president wouldn’t press the button to launch the nukes even though it was clearly a simulated event. Is this an indicator that if it really came down to it, even the actual president wouldn’t be able to initiate a nuclear counterstrike? Yeah, and I think that’s one of the things that is really sobering about this is realizing how much people struggled, even in exercises, to consider launching a simulated nuclear weapon. And whether or not at the end of the day, even if one side or another did launch some weapons, whether the other side would’ve ever actually retaliated. The nuclear football is rarely more than a matter of steps away from the President or the Vice President. Here a Navy officer carries the case aboard Air Force One before departing on President’s Trump’s nine day international trip., AP What prompted you to write this book? It is pretty apparent that putting it together was one hell of an undertaking. Yeah, it was. It was about four years of research which is longer than I was anticipating. The short answer is, you know, I bumped up against these programs a lot in Washington. I’m sure you have too writing and reporting on these things. You talk to people who have been to these facilities. You would talk to people who would have been, of were evacuated to some of these facilities on 9/11. And then what sort of really got me interested in the topic was when one of my colleagues found a government ID on the floor of a parking garage here that he brought in to me to turnover—to give to me to give back to the guy, figuring that since I reported on the stuff, I would know how to get it back to him. When I turned the ID over, it had these detailed evacuation instructions on the back. And so I got on Google Maps and Google Satellite, and followed those instructions, which were driving directions out into West Virginia. And discovered that they led to this road that disappeared into what were clearly concrete bunker doors in the side of a mountain. And it was an unmarked mountain that wasn’t on any map. And no one nor I had ever heard of this facility. I was like, wow, this is part of the new post 9/11, you know, continuity government plans. And this is something that’s probably worth looking into more. What facility was that? It was actually the facility that I talk about right at the end of the book, which is Allegany Ballistics Laboratory. Did you try to get a tour of one of these facilities like Raven Rock or Mount Weather? I couldn’t get into Mount Weather or Raven Rock, but I did have the opportunity to tour NORAD, which is similar physically to the others, and a little bit more open. And then a lot of these facilities are also now tourist attractions of one sort or another. For instance, the Greenbrier congressional bunker in West Virginia, as well as some of these older retired bunkers like John F Kennedy’s presidential escape bunker in Palm Beach, Florida, out on Peanut Island, actually just across the harbor from Trumps house at Mar-a-Lago. And when you get into that one, you definitely realize that it is not a place you would have wanted to have spent a nuclear war.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 11, 2020",Israel Is Getting A Single F-35 Test Jet Unlike Any Other,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel continues to win unique concessions surrounding its participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The country’s increasingly independent development could ultimately produce a version of the aircraft specifically suited to its needs that differs significantly from Lockheed Martin’s existing offerings. In May 2017, it emerged that Lockheed was specially building a one-off sub-variant of the F-35I “Adir” – meaning “mighty one” in Hebrew – for Israel and expected to deliver it by 2020. The plane would act as a testbed for the country’s planned, but unspecified modifications. The Israeli Air Force is planning on purchasing as many as 75 F-35s, primarily the I variant, which is similar to the U.S. Air Force’s A model. The final fleet could include derivatives of the U.S. Marine Corps’ short- and vertical-takeoff capable B version , as well. The first “Adir” touched down in Israel in December 2016. “This unique aircraft, which was not part of any other F-35 contract, will enable us to begin the work of upgrading the capabilities of this aircraft so that it answers our special operational requirements,” the head of the Israeli Air Force’s main test center, identified only as Lieutenant Colonel Shlomy told FlightGlobal . “All our platforms have been upgraded to enable stretching the flight envelope while using the unique weapon systems made by Israeli industry.” Shlomy didn’t offer any details about what equipment the aircraft would actually test, but Israel has long been negotiating with Lockheed for greater access to the inner workings of the Joint Strike Fighter, in particular its central computer brain, the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). In spite of its name, ALIS handles a host of critical mission functions, including acting as the loading port for vital mission data such as potential threats and hazards during a sortie. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8wByd06tmDQ In April 2016, state-owned defense contractor Israel Aerospace Industries confirmed it would install an additional suite of command and control software on top of the F-35’s basic programming when it received its first jets. No other country participating in the Joint Strike Fighter program has received the right to tinker with the aircraft at this level, instead having to rely on central U.S.-based facilities to devise new code packages. Israeli officials have been understandably secretive about what their additional lines of code will add on top of the aircraft’s existing functionality. However, it seems reasonable to assume the modification would help link the aircraft’s mission computer and sensors to Israel-specific networks. It could aid with a host of other planned changes , which will include new communications systems and defensive electronic countermeasures, some of which may double as active electronic attack systems to jam enemy radars or radios. This combination of equipment could potentially make the Israeli jets more multi-purpose than their counterparts around the world. And Having access to the software and mission systems architecture could help keep the jets fully capable even if the country suddenly found itself cut off from the global infrastructure the U.S. military, Lockheed and other future F-35 operators are establishing to support the ALIS. “The ingenious, automated ALIS system that Lockheed Martin has built will be very efficient and cost-effective,” an anonymous Israeli Air Force officer told Defense News in 2016. “But the only downfall is that it was built for countries that don’t have missiles falling on them.” Lockheed Martin Perhaps more importantly, Israel has also secured the unique right to perform depot-level maintenance, to include overhauling engines and airframe components, within the country. Again, other future Joint Strike Fighter operators will have to send their aircraft to designated facilities in specific countries instead. “We will not go to Italy or anywhere else,” Israeli Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Maxim Orgad, head of the Engineer Division at the service’s Depot 22, told Defense News in 2017. “These aircraft [the F-35s] will remain in Israel for whatever they need.” In addition, greater access to the F-35’s mission systems will make it easier for Israel to integrate its own particular weapons onto the aircraft. In particular, the county is interested in purchasing a version of Rafael’s SPICE – standing for Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective – a precision-guided bomb with electro-optical and GPS-targeting capabilities, which fits in the Adir’s internal weapons bay. Pop-out wings reportedly give the 1,000 pound-class version of the weapon a stand-off range of more than 60 miles. Other munitions, like the Delilah standoff missile will also likely show up on the F-35I’s weapons list. Lockheed Martin On top of that, domestic Israeli defense contractors are working with Lockheed to develop country-specific add-ons to the aircraft’s frame, including possible new external and conformal fuel tanks. If engineered correctly, this flush design could significantly extend the F-35I’s unrefueled range while hopefully keeping its low-observable characteristics intact. Lockheed’s proposed external wing tanks compromise the jet’s stealthy shape. Extra fuel on board the aircraft eases pressure on the Israeli Air Force’s relatively small aerial tanker fleet, too. Coupled with stand-off weapons, this added range in full stealth mode could be a great benefit to the Israeli Air Force, which routinely conducts pre-preemptive strikes in various countries, such as Syria , which have increasingly potent air defense networks. But really, the F-35I’s main reason for being is Iran. Oh, and there’s always the possibility it could enhance the country’s unspoken nuclear deterrent . Experts believe Israel has a stockpile of thermonuclear gravity bombs, in addition to land-based and submarine-launched missiles . But Israel expects much of this work to be evolutionary. The country’s air arm wants to have the first F-35s ready for combat by the end of 2017. It expects to support that push by conducting at least half the pilot flight training in simulators on the ground. At the same time it will, it will be testing its new software and other additions. Having a specialized test plane on hand means it won’t necessarily have to pull combat aircraft out of normal rotation to aid in this work. It also allows for future research and development to occur without impeding routine operations once the Joint Strike Fighters actually reach initial operational capability or causing any unnecessary delays in progress toward full operational capability. Regardless, Israel’s peculiar strategic position has long pushed the country to be as self-sufficient as possible, especially when it comes to military technology. As a result, it also has a long, established track record of doing so without compromising foreign system, which no doubt helped convince Lockheed to give the country’s engineers and technicians greater access to the design details. “We recognized that Israel is also going to have sovereign sustainability requirements,” Jack Crisler, the vice president of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 business development and strategic integration division, explained to Defense News in 2016. “So we and the Joint Program Office are working through that now to see how this will be done.” Lockheed Martin The planned modifications in many ways mirror previous work Israel has done to its American-made F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, both of which are loaded with country-specific equipment. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has written extensively on this history in the past, explaining: The “unique” modifications the IAF makes to American fighters is also nothing new, nor is the manner in which they have employed them. For instance, Israel was the first to convert the F-15 Eagle into an operational attack aircraft and conformal fuel tanks allowed them to strike targets thousands of miles from Israel. Today, the IAF’s F-15s and F-16s are loaded with Israel-specific communications, electronic warfare suites, and other combat-related sub-systems tailored to the potential threats and objectives they may face in the future. This experience and cooperation with the original manufacturers has allowed Israeli crews to perform almost miraculous feats when it comes to these jets. In one particular impressive case , Depot 22 got a two-seat F-15B back in the air after replacing its completely destroyed rear half with another one from a retired single-seat F-15A. When the Israeli technicians asked Boeing, which still makes newer models of F-15 fighters, for their advice on the project, the company reportedly declined to respond because they thought the very idea was some sort of practical joke. It seems likely that the Israelis intend to keep this up when they begin flying the F-35. Having a unique test version around will only help them refine their modifications and develop entirely new upgrades in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 26, 2021",Remember The Fallen With This Chilling “Grumman Cats” Missing Man Formation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On this Memorial Day, we give thanks to all who have served and sacrificed, and especially those brave Americans who gave their life in defense of our nation. Although we debate the defense issues of the day here on The War Zone, one thing that is undebatable is the fact that freedom isn’t free, it has been paid for in lives cut short, dreams unrealized and incredible valor by far better people than I. We also cannot forget our greatest allies, who have stood shoulder to shoulder with our forces to confront evil. Just like our heroes, many of their country’s finest were sent on missions for which they wouldn’t likely return. In an a new age that seems to be marked by decreasing international unity and wavering appreciation for alliances, it is worth remembering America’s best friends on the battlefield as well. One way our air arms honor those who have passed is by performing the missing man formation. A fingertip arrangement that sees the third aircraft pull-up into a steep climb, ascending to the heavens while leaving a solemn empty spot in the formation from which they departed. It is an incredibly moving sight, and some have done it better than others. One of these displays in particular was especially unique and downright fantastic. In 1996, at the NAS Oceana Air Show, legendary high-time Tomcat pilot Dale “Snort” Snodgrass flew the missing man in a Tomcat alongside three other legendary “Grumman Cats.” All piston powered aircraft, these included F8F Bearcat, F6F Hellcat, F7F Tigercat. Not only does Snort stay in position with the comparatively slow-flying WWII fighters, but he does so with the Tomcat’s wings swept fully back. The climb out is just chilling. Here’s another clip of the formation a 2:21, but you may want to watch the whole thing because it has Snodgrass’s whole two aircraft routine with the Tomcat and the Tigercat, it is truly an amazing thing to behold: The missing man formation aerial salute dates back to the 1930s, with its origins emanating from Britain, and there have been a few variations over the decades, but the “finger four” formation, with a division of aircraft and the number three pilot pulling up into a steep climb over the target has become pretty much standard by now. Dedicated funeral and memorial flyovers, which often include missing man formations, are especially important within the culture of military aviation and among aircrews who are tasked to fly them. There is a special connection that exists and a drive by military aviators to honor their fellow warriors. I have personally seen aircrews go to great lengths to execute these flyovers even in the most abhorrent of conditions—a testament to the esprit de corps of America’s flying forces. Although fast jets certainly give one heck of a performance, other aircraft, including helicopters, execute missing man formations as well. And one place where the missing man formation occurs periodically is over Arlington National Cemetery . The peace on this hallowed ground is interrupted from time-to-time with the thunder of roaring jets overhead—a thunderous cry stating one more of America’s cherished warriors is on their way to the heavens.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 17, 2021",F-35 Pilots Dress For Chemical and Biological Warfare For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has taken testers and industry a decade to come up with a flight suit configuration that can keep F-35 pilots alive in biological and chemical warfare environments, and just last week the ensemble flew for the first time. … In a press release , the USAF detailed the different pieces of the modified getup: “The chemical/biological ensemble consists of a special CB suit, a Joint Service Aircrew Mask used for the F-35, a pilot-mounted CB air filter, CB socks and gloves double taped at the wrists. The ensemble also features a filtered air blower that protects the pilot from CB contamination while walking to the jet. It provides both breathing air and demist air, which goes to the pilot’s mask and goggles. All components of the CB ensemble are in addition to the pilot’s sleeved flight jacket and G suit… The ensemble also includes a communication device so the pilot can speak to people while wearing the ensemble with helmet and mask.” Darren Cole, the 461st Flight Test Human Systems Integration Lead, described an interesting byproduct of the suit’s communication system in that same release: “It is a conversational communication unit, which is a box that integrates with the communication system so that when he speaks into his mask it lets people hear the pilot talk… it makes him sound like Darth Vader.” To test the suit, an F-35B from MCAS Yuma was borrowed, and one of the 461st FLTS pilots, once fully outfitted with all the gear, went about their normal pre-flight and startup operations in the presence of an airborne agent that simulates biological and chemical ones but does not have their same deadly effects. All the while the test team was monitoring their suits for infiltration by the agent. Cole states: “The first pilot stepped to a clean jet in the CB ensemble and we contaminated it using a simulated agent. The engine run pulls in the simulant so we need to make sure the air is filtered before it gets to the pilot. First, the air goes through the (On-Board Oxygen Generation System) and then the pilot-mounted CB filter to remove any remaining contaminants. There is another filtered air supply blower that provides cooling and demist air to the pilot’s hood and goggles. We also used three air sampling devices to be sure all the air provided to the pilot was clean.” Then a second pilot in the same outfit stepped to the jet to test the suit in a known “dirty” environment—one where chemical or biological warfare agents are known to have contaminated the cockpit. They then took off on a mission to see not only how the suit would perform but also how the pilot would react to the more cumbersome configuration and how the thermal loads of such a heavy suit would play into a mission. Lauren Gilmore, 461st FLTS engineer describes the scope of the program overall: “We purposely chose the Marine [short takeoff, vertical landing] version of the F-35 because the equipment is more complicated and basically has more nooks and crannies for the contaminant to hide in. This aircraft also has full-up mission systems. These tests will demonstrate that the U.S. and partner nations can fly, fight, and win in a CB threat environment and then quickly decontaminate the aircraft and return it to normal operation… We’ve established the procedures to step to the aircraft and hook into it and the order of powering on systems to get the filtered air supply to the pilot… We’ve developed procedures on who needs to help the pilot; how many people are needed to support the logistics trail; how many people are needed to help the pilot don the equipment and how many people will be needed in the Life Support unit. We’ve also noted how many Airmen may be needed to escort the pilot out to the aircraft and recover the aircraft. We helped a lot with the F-35 concept of operations.” .. The F-35, with its enhanced man-machine interface, has faced hurdles in the past with cumbersome flight gear—especially with the pilot’s much touted helmet mounted display . Combined with the F-35’s ejection seat, the two systems have led to pilot weight restrictions . Ergonomic issues during basic fighter maneuvers (dogfights) have also been noted, along with acuity and night vision issues that are supposed to be fixed with the newest model of helmet. Most recently, the F-35’s helmet has left naval aviators in pain and with fuzzy vision during catapult launches. It will be interesting to see how wearing the chemical and biological warfare protective gear, and especially the eye mask with the helmet, will affect the carrier launch issue. Conducting flying operations while in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) is no easy task, and that is not a challenge specific to the F-35. Ground crews and pilots have to train to adhere to each step of a long set of procedures to fight in conditions up to MOPP4. It is arduous and uncomfortable work that also impacts the fidelity of everyone’s senses and their ability to communicate, which is a big deal when working around air breathing metal pterodactyls and often in nighttime, near “black out” conditions. Over in South Korea, US forces train regularly on how to do this due to the very possibility of a sudden weapons of mass destruction attack from the North. The videos below give you just a small glimpse of what getting dressed and undressed for these conditions is like. It definitely slows things down, and one small mistake can be deadly. Over the years I have asked everyone from crew chiefs to pilots if fighting under such conditions would really be effective or sustainable, and I have received different answers. Complaints of ill-fitting gear, especially for ground support crew, and weak spots in the system are common, as is getting a look as if to say “ yeah right .” For units like those forward deployed to South Korea, where infrastructure and training has been built up around fighting in a nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) environment, there is probably a better chance of successfully sustaining operations under these conditions. For other flying units, it seems less clear, although they do have to pass operational readiness inspections on a fairly regular basis to show that they are prepared to do so. Obviously, if there is a real chance that any of this terrible stuff is present in the air where flight operations are taking place, crews would be much more careful than they would be in training, it is just a matter of human nature. But imagine asking airman to don these suits in the middle east during summer. How long can anyone last on a baking flightline? Ground forces that have to be prepared to fight in similar conditions also face this question. Luckily the US has never had to find out if sustaining modern combat aircraft operations in moon suits while being doused with the worst stuff on the planet is feasible or not. In the end, the gear may accomplish its mission without ever being used. If the enemy knows their foes are ready and trained to go about their business under such conditions, why expel the resources testing their preparedness, nor their level of vengeance once the smoke clears?
